foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is car take one of the co-founders of eighth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the 8th online 2022 finale uh you're all watching this on eveglobal.tv uh this is already a fun start and uh for those of you who are joining us for the first time here this is what we've been using for the last month to watch everything so all of our Summits all of our opening and closing ceremonies and everything else is going to be uh and as what is being live streamed from this uh this also lets us understand uh who everybody is so we can give up so if you are not logged in uh log in to say hi you can also ask us any questions or comments on what you're going to see today and for everybody who watch all the Summits uh this is how we will be contacting you with the email you signed in to share so this event is brought to you by eth global for those of you who don't know what Heath Global is it's an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by doing two things we run hackathons and we run Summits these are educational events for developers designers and anybody who's interested in becoming more involved in the web3 ecosystem to come in and learn and use that as a way to understand and explore what is possible and ethonline was our biggest event of this year and we did an amazing set of summits where we organized five different individual Summits on different topics uh we had a whole Summit around what's the latest in all of the devtool world when you're building in web3 we talked about how we can do coordination at scale especially as we see the rise of a lot more daus uh we ran the live stream of the merge where we had over 25 000 people tune in live to see the eat transition into uh the next era of the execution and the consensus layer then we hosted a summit on what the future of ethereum looks like from the optimism team and how optimism is helping extend the vision of ethereum and last Friday we hosted our last Summit for this event where we talked about the impact that ethereum has made and the amazing amazing side of the progress we have made with the people and the projects in the space that was just the Summits we also in parallel had a hackathon that what we're going to talk about today and I am super excited to announce that this has been our biggest event ever in our entire five-year history we had 1780 Hackers from a hundred countries spending 22 time zones participate and build incredible set of projects this map keeps getting more and more full every time we generate one and it's so exciting to see so many countries and so many cities around the world represented not only that we also had 35 amazing partners and a hundred plus mentors who were there answering questions helping unblock you from using any protocol that you were excited to build on and to top it all off we were also giving away over 350 000 in prizes all of which is going to be announced later today and the thing that blows my mind is that we had 360 projects come out of this hackathon which is the most we've ever seen and not only the most we've ever seen ever but the most amount of quality projects we've ever looked at from any event we've done and this is absolutely incredible because we're going to see some incredible projects through all of the the last three months worth of work from all these amazing teams before we go into everything about the demos and the prizes I want to quickly thank all the amazing partners that have been part of this event and uh they'll also be announcing some of the winners of the prize that they were giving out and on top of that um they're just incredible people to work with so without further Ado want to thank optimism superfluid hobby Grant style scale polygon ipfs file coin worldcoin ens and Uma Aurora and push protocol the graph coronos life peer yearn Finance AP wine hyperlane Unstoppable domains connects lens Spruce covalent tableland quick note nft Port ballast D Bridge teller streamer cisma Oasis Network and not protocol ceramic unlock protocol xntp and let's go back to the 360 submissions we saw 360 projects come out on Sunday on Monday we did live judging for all these teams in a 24-hour period we had 30 plus judges look at everybody's projects talk to the teams ask questions give feedback and we compiled the list of 14 incredible finalists we're going to bring them on today they're going to do back-to-back demos and then we're going to jump into all the prizes so without further Ado I want to congratulate these 14 teams as our finalists so big shout out to telescope Kerry protocol ens everywhere L2 optimizers stacker Network Xerox sauce water drops refi nari synth turbo di pass flow Theory new wallets and lensmo interplanetary funds and no cost subscriptions these are our 14 amazing teams they represent some of the most interesting creative and technically impressive projects that our judges were excited about they're going to come on one by one and demo what they built so you get to see these amazing projects in action in a live demo and before we go into that I want to take a quick second to thank the 346 projects listed here on this slide and in the next this has been the most impressive event we've ever done I get to look at every single project that comes out of it and I have been continuously impressed and Blown Away by the quality of every single project here just because you did not make it to one of those 14 teams does not mean you are not good enough does not mean there was something wrong with it it's just a representation of our judging process where the the teams that get bubbled up are the ones that our judges are excited about the most and it does not mean that you should give up or stop working on what you built you should absolutely continue extending your project the three weeks you had to build all these amazing things is just a small amount of time that you get to do and if you extend it and if you continue continuing to uh improve what you are starting uh this will be no short of an incredible uh feat that you get to achieve and if you need any help in being unblocked getting introduced to somebody in this ecosystem that you want to talk to to get feedback or improvements or anything else around it do not hesitate to ping me directly or anybody on the global team whether it's through email or Discord or any other means you'll be more than happy to to help you and for those of you who are tuning in you get to go to eat global.com showcase to see all the projects live right now you get to check out everything that they did from demos to the source code to a lot more detail around how they've built it and and why so without further Ado let's get started I want to bring on our very first demo for today and that is Project telescope so let's kick this off welcome cool hi the project that I built for ethonline is called telescope it's a cross-chain evm transaction Explorer dedicated to help onboard with the next billion users it's web 3. one of the bottlenecks to the mainstream adoption of crypto is the lack of an easy access to understand transactions today end users often rely on block explorers to view their transactions but bulk explorers often have two issues one they tend to overwhelm beginners with advanced blockchain concepts such as Network block difficulty hash rate human the latest blog Etc when in reality all that most users care about are the basics of a transaction did it go through when did it go through where did it go where it should have gone Etc two explorers often are confined to a single chain causing confusion to users when taking cross-chain actions such as bridging so this is where I've built telescope telescope is a cross-chain transaction Explorer think of a transaction Explorer as an infrastructure layer one layer abstracted from blocked explorers or transactions not blocks our first class citizens providing the most intuitive experience understanding the movement of funds across CVM chains with a strong focus on user experience now enough talking let's go into the live demo first you'll head over to telescope.o and be greeted by the simple landing page now just like a block Explorer you can search by account or contract address or transaction s but here ens is first class so this is by default so I'm going to search for my ens here now I'm going to be greeted by the account overview page on the left we have a summary of all the tokens in this account not only do we have an aggregate balance shown here across all the supported EDM networks but a nice pie chart to visualize the tokens along with a clear list of showing the individual token balances more importantly on the right side here we see our first class citizens the transactions neatly organized in a single list now a couple points to highlight here first we're cross chain supported by default where you can see all of your evm supported Network transactions here in a single view now we also kept our focus on really high level transaction details like exactly when did the transaction happen with what address with popular contracts like uniswap white listed here and exactly what type of transaction a contract call is made and finally an easier way to read the exact token that was transferred doing that transaction furthermore we also removed the decoupling of transaction types such that there's no tabs dividing a normal transaction to an erc20 to a 721 instead all aggregated in a single view now if we choose to look into an individual transaction we have arrive at the transaction detail page where you first see the same high level details as shown earlier in the list but below we see an additional data geared towards more advanced users and developers on the left side we see details like the fees and the block number and what's commonly known as the state difference on either scan easily visualized as changes in account balances below you've also thought deeply about how to best showcase input data in a smart contract all knowing how challenging this could be to parse on other Explorers so on the right side as you can see we not only have a table showcasing the exact token transfers that happen during this transaction but an execution trace for developers to easily follow up on what exactly happened during this contract call now one of the worst user experiences in crypto in my opinion is the bridging from one network to another people often say bridging is like depositing into a black hole so I've built an easy user experience on telescope for bridging users to understand the progress of their transaction based on the number of Confirmation and estimated time required for the funds to arrive such that users don't ever feel lost during a bridging experience awesome so that's the core transaction related features but I ask myself how could we take this an even step further to understand accounts from bird's eye view for users that may not be technically or numbers savvy so what I've built is something called the graph view as you can see in this view your accounts and all the accounts you've interacted in the past are showcasing a single graph based on edges representing transactions and nodes representing accounts size proportional to their balances on top of that if you click into let's say a particular node you'll be able to expand that node into a sidebar that showcases all the transactions you've had with that particular account where the edge has expanded into the transaction showcasing the direction of the movement of funds if you hover over a single edge you can see that the highlighted transaction is shown on the sidebar next to it so an easy way to clearly visualize where your funds are moving at a glance now let's take a more specific use case as an example imagine your wallet was compromised and hacker stole your favorite nft wouldn't it be great to be able to easily visualize where this hacker took your nft so let's say that this hacker took your nft and below I have a little search my record search for the nfts token address and token ID and once to do it allow you to easily Trace where this nft moved and let's say the hacker moved it over to a publicly known service like openc now that I can see that this hacker used this account to try to let's say sell my stolen entity and I'd be able to go to openc and try to block that sale by reporting that this hacker is in this address so that's another use case finally an easy way to basically drag around the nodes to your liking such that maybe you can understand better the movement of funds on a particular account especially if there's been a hack at a bridge for instance and try to track where the hacker took the money so that's pretty much all the features on telescope as you can see telescope provides an intuitive way to understand transactions across chain which is critical for us to onboard the next billion users into crypto thanks so much for tuning in to my presentation shout out to the eve Global team for organizing this amazing experience had a lot of fun and feel free to connect to me on Twitter thanks very much bye-bye amazing thank you so much for uh for that incredible first demo and all of you can check this out by heading over to telescope.o all right next up we are ready for a second demo and that is team ens everywhere so without further Ado let's welcome David Kelly and Charlie okay cool well I get started hello everybody my name is Cala and I'm going to present ens everywhere uh on this project I've been working with the two buddies of mine David and Charlie uh together we kind of cover the the full stack uh pretty neatly and the Insight that spurt art um sorry I'm gonna start my video there we go hey guys and the inside the spurred art uh project was the inset that ens is one of the most successful products on ethereum uh not only has it proven itself to be a core primitive of uh of the sort of new ecosystem and identities but they're also racking up just an insane amount of fees uh competing with some of the biggest D5 protocols out there and even Bitcoin now despite that um ens hasn't really migrated to l2s as transactions and activities moved to l2s you can't buy or trade or even get some of the gas savings that you could expect from other types of assets um now they've added subdomains like you can see here with a coinbase example but the primary use case of unes domains is is top level domains and the identity that goes with it so if we don't have that ll2 we're also losing out on a lot of fee Revenue so our solution to this is ens everywhere which lets you buy trade and bridges domains to L2 now for us to be able to build this solution we had one very big problem in front of us which was that how do you get around the gas fees on that layer one uh what we want to do is take orders and collect them on Layer Two have a relayer go and register that domain on layer one and then Bridge it back to layer two but there isn't really a way of doing that without incurring the L1 gas costs and then passing that on to the user on Layer Two so how do you go about solving that well what we did was we rewrote the ens registrar contract for ens so now uh it's possible to do bulk orders on ens and this is a as a contract that would be available to anyone in Layer Two as well but what this enables enables us to do is now that we're collecting orders in Layer Two we can go and register all those orders on layer one and pass on the gas savings to Layer Two we would have to work with the the ens Dow to get to implement this we already have connections with the team and so we're going to work on on adding this as a core functionality uh sort of benefiting the entire community and then what that's enable us to do is get these type of gas savings up to 34 gas savings uh on the biggest pools of people but even up to 9.3 gas savings on uh two people pulling together which is still great given the fact that we're going to take transactions and uh and do them on both L1 and L2 now enough talking let's go through and have a look at the product so uh this here is CNS everywhere um if we go on this site we can uh basically connect our wallet and in the same way as you would with any other dap here you can choose whatever the the network you're on let's say we're on optimism and I want to register cal.e okay cal.e is taken I'll do asd.eath great now the registration process looks very similar to what you would expect on layer one but there's one big difference here which is you can see this estimated bulk saving so if I go here and confirm my registration uh using metamask what's going to happen is um it's going to pass me on to this next step and what's going on here well it says pendant registration zero and waiting eight this is the pool of people that are currently purchasing ens domains on Layer Two and we're just waiting until enough people have pulled together on Layer Two where the time weighted relative to the the savings you can have is sort of optimal and we set that number at eight um and as soon as this uh number has reached eight uh we're gonna take this entire bulk send it to a relayer on layer one uh who will then go on and interact with the ens contract and settling this on layer one bulk is ready we need to complete our registration and sign it and then now the registration is being settled on layer one as this thing is going through uh and it's ready it's going to give us a confirmation and now we can go and look at the domains that we have registered on layer 1 and on Layer Two if you have a domain now on Layer Two and you want to move it back to layer one you can Bridge it to layer one uh by going to the bridging process here or even if you have an S domain on layer one and you want to start trading it on some type of uh nft platform on Layer Two you can do that as well and that's basically our product um we want to take this to Market we want to launch this on on all the big l2s and um and get this out there um thank you guys for watching amazing that was really cool and uh can't wait for uh I'll just also try this thing and just do a lot of block registrations hopefully we minimize some of the hoardings but uh this is great hopefully we get to see y'all uh for for all different chains cool congratulations and with that we are ready for our third demo for the day and that is team stacker Network so I'll ask both of them to turn on their cameras and get ready with the demo hey let me just share my screen all right uh hey everyone uh so I'm here to talk about stacker Network which is an SDK for building application specific optimistic rollups on a decentralized network of sequencers so problems today is that general purpose evm rollups are didn't redundant and data heavy because they have to support a variety of features from variety of applications so if a particular application wants to run so it needs to share its resources uh so that's why general purpose role of salary London and most likely you don't really need the native vvm storage because you can do fine for some use cases with the call data storage itself and you can just have a tailor-made roll up for yourself and it is not a work in the park to build your own role up so even though roll ups are simple but it's not uh everyone's uh uh piece of cake to just build it so developers would rather focus on building uh the application itself rather than building the support infrastructure and even if it means that they need to sacrifice optimize optimization for it uh and also like running a sequencer itself and building it is a cumbersome task so we are here to help so first of all what it isn't it is not a brand new blockchain or a network or it is not isolated from ethereum it is not a separate evm roll up and definitely not an ethereum killer what it is it is a set of tools for building non-evm and later evm roll ups easily and efficiently on top of ethereum itself so basically it's an infrastructure provider for ethereum so how does it work so she simply run npx create rollup you submit your directory name and you are done that's all you need to build that's all you require to build a roll up so what happens under the hood is rollups are very simple State machines they work on the principle of State and State transition so uh if you have a state uh which gets mutated by us transition rule uh all the inputs and the final state are stored on chain and with this SDK the developer only needs to focus on the state and state transition and all the heavy lifting of things that goes behind or working overlap happens uh by the SDK itself so a lot of Roll-Ups have a lot of things in common which is like 70 to 80 percent of stuff so we just extracted those out and let the developers uh build only on the 20 of stuff so we are following a three layered approach which is the underlying base layer at the bottom then on top we have a sequencer network and on the on top of that would be a application development SDK which will also be the execution layer for the project so in the application layer uh it will be like a environment in JavaScript or any other general purpose language which will connect to the sequencer Network through apis uh developers can choose whatever kind of compression that they want to use they can also like uh like uh we'll also be bundling a bunch of like other tooling necessary for them to build their applications another uh next to that is the decentralized sequencer Network which we are planning to run on a piece of uh proof of stake model and uh since we will be having a consensus model built into it we'll be we are planning to reduce the time to finality as well for any roll up and uh at the bottom would be the base chain which could be any evm compatible roll up and uh all of the uh either evm compatible chain or roll up and we'll be posting all the call data from our Network to the to this chain and modes of operation so it actually functions in two roles uh you can actually build your own roll up you can choose whatever data structure you want however you want to use it and we can also provide like for more generic use cases we can provide pre-built node which the rollups can connect to using uh normal web to apis so let's see it in action so over here I have a local hard hat instance running uh and on this side I have a sequencer Network running so right now it's just one sequencer will be soon be starting another sequencer so I'll just do npx create Roll Up Chess and it will ask me a bunch of questions uh if I want to deploy a new roll up or connect to a pre-configured node so I'll just uh select a new level up and select local development for the environment and once this is done setting up the project uh I can just feed into this directory and show you what's inside it so you'll see that we are providing a bunch of stuff already with the roll up so all you need to uh build your own Roll Up is just extend the roller based class uh provide the game State as well as the state transition function so right now it's the move the chess move and it will update the route and submit the transaction to the sequencer for bundling and this is just like two Bots playing chess with each other and now if I go ahead and deploy the roller so once this is done deploying you should see the sequencer uh being able to Index this roll up easily and start accepting transactions all right so you can see here roll up uh registered event was created and now if I just start the game uh so this is two Bots playing chess we see with each other doing some moves and all of the data is going to the sequencer and once it has a bunch of transaction it will bundle it together and submit on chain so let's wait for a couple of more transactions and you can see a batch submitted uh transaction was done and if we come into the block Explorer and check it out you can see that indeed like the game state was stored on chain uh using call data and I can anytime since it's a network I can anytime start a new uh sequencer and once this is done you can see that the Roll Up is now sending data to both of them so it's us uh they are like uh balancing the transactions so once I stop this now the other thing which I talked about was roll up as a service so this I will start as a pre-configured node so this is a payments roll up which includes a L1 to L1 to L2 token Bridge as well as a roll up for doing uh token transfers and if I go into this directory and show you what's inside the SDK so you'll find out some adapters to connect to the sequencer and like the actual application so you'll see like it has like simple apis for performing deposit and then signing messages and transferring tokens from one address to other and if I go ahead and build this quickly and once it's done I'll just do this and what it will do is like it will do a bunch of deposits from L1 to L2 uh using the bridge and once it has uh once the addresses have tokens on the bridge it will just trans do a transfer so let's just wait a couple of seconds so you can see like on chain uh like a deposit event was occurred and inside the roll up uh okay uh I think we have a error but yeah never mind uh that was something else but if you notice closely uh the tokens indeed got uh Bridge from l12 L2 so both of these accounts had 50 tokens and now one account has reduced tokens and another one had like increased tokens and yep uh so it's just the beginning we are trying to build an entire ecosystem around this and we are uh looking out for people to support us so if you think that this is an interesting please reach out to us thank you okay amazing I was uh it was an incredible infrastructure project especially as we kind of think about how Roll-Ups evolve so congratulations and with that we are ready for our next demo so we're going to go right to Michael with water drops whenever you're ready thanks karik good morning everyone go ahead and share my screen sorry dude all right so hello everyone my name is Michael gen and I'm here today to present water drops these are claimable airdrops with automatic vesting in a traditional airdrop tokens are received in a lump sum as a result they get dumped right away by many of the participants and airdrops where tokens are vested the drop requires recipients to continuously return to the app and execute claim transactions this takes time and money water drops are an improvement on the traditional airdrop a recipient of a water drop executes one claim transaction to start the automatic vesting process the tokens from the water drop are then streamed to the recipient this means that the recipient receives tokens every second automatically without having to execute additional claim transactions this saves the recipient time and money and prevents them from dumping a lump sum of tokens on the market after they claim their drop water drops water drops tokens show up in your wallet and can be used immediately after they received in other decentralized Financial applications creating a water drop is simple you set an emission rate of the tokens the duration for how long the recipient will receive those tokens and a deadline for when the drop expires next you transfer tokens you're going to drop into the contract and add a list of recipients recipients can then add the claim can execute the claim transaction to get their water drop started after the claim receipt the recipient will receive tokens in their wallet every second now let's let me show you a demo of how water drops works I'll start by showing how to create a new water drop um so as you can see here in the polygon scan user interface the deployer and owner of the water drops contract can start by specifying the token they want to drop the rate they want to emit tokens the duration and a deadline then what they can do is add users using the add user claim uh the owner could add as many recipients as they want the recipient can then go to the water drops user interface which can be easily rebranded by the creator of any water drop after executing a claim transaction the recipient will be able to claim their tokens so here we'll go ahead and execute the claim transactions immediately after executing the transactions the tokens will be received and settled in their wallet on a second by second basis these tokens are immediately available to be used in other D5 applications because they're compliant with the erc20 token standard here you can see that after the claim the balance of your tokens receives just increases at the rate specified you might be asking yourself what happens when the recipient stream reaches the end reaches its end for that we use gelato Keepers to pull for when to close the stream to the recipients and we execute each closure transaction for each recipient water drop smart contracts are built and tested using hard hat we use super fluid super tokens and continuous flow agreements to stream the tokens to the recipients gelato is used to automate the closure of the streams when they reach their conclusion and water drops is deployed on the polygon Network where transactions are fast inexpensive and handled by an eco-friendly network of nodes up next for water drops is a pilot program with the luo finance and Ricochet exchange a project that I previously did at uh scaling Eve 2021. to be eligible for a Ricochet token airdrop you'll need to deposit at least 100 or more into the app.luo finance for at least 30 days the airdrop's going to happen 37 days from now so you'll have one week to make the deposit and remember you'll need to keep your funds on deposit for 30 days uh so thanks for taking the time to view my submission for Ethan line 22 and keep an eye out for announcements about the first water drops which will be happening on polygon very soon thanks awesome thanks Michael it was an amazing demo and uh a really good step in the direction of how we think people should be tied directly to uh making sure the ecosystem is successful all right like that we are ready for our next demo and I'd like to welcome Emma Jane to talk about Inari synth welcome hey cool I understand my screen okay um hi my name is Emma Jane I'm the solo engineer and designer behind the anari synth project and now you synth is a decentralized image synthesis social media adopt that integrates lens protocol with stable diffusion uh so I start by connecting my wallet and then signing in with lens protocol and once I'm signed in this prompt box appears so now I can craft a prompt for an image that I'd like to synthesize so you can write whatever you want I'm going to write portrait of a fashionable female ethereum hacker and I'm going to add some kind of like modifiers to it that I know usually turn out pretty well but again you can literally put whatever you want in um illustration let's say art station that's usually a good one and then ought by uh Excellency hookup okay um inference steps I'm going to bring those down just to have the synthesis run faster and I'll bring up my guidance scale to around 13. width and height I can change but um I'll keep the same so and then I click synth it usually takes around 20 to 30 seconds for um the images to actually synthesize I'm going to check that the call actually went through cool it's running there's been major issues with the replica API it often goes down and a top priority of the project is actually moving away from relying on replicate For the synthesis as quickly as possible and instead having it done through like DIY local notebooks so um why are you synth why does it matter well uh social media today makes a ton of money and all of that goes to the platform owners and not any of it for us so um breaking that strangle hold on money power self-expression um it's an obvious good and that's why decentralized social media but just because we have these stronger channels doesn't make it any easier to create great things to share um but open source image synthesis is different now we can build synthesis into literally everything including social media um so I did so sometimes you get this um returned which means like the API thinks that there's not safe for work content so I'm going to just change up my prompt a little bit um but and we run but I also actually um did some previously so you can see some of the cool outputs and this was from a similar prompt that I ran um just before so um How It's Made I made it with nexjs typescript Tailwind wag me rainbow kit and web3 storage for the social layer I use lens protocol and for image synthesis I use stable diffusion via the replicate API for to do as I mentioned major priority moving away from the replica API to avoid NSFW filters and just in general a lot of the limits also our full implementation of the lens collection module and having curated fine grain token-based permission feeds so hopefully that went through cool you can see here from this prompt I got some pretty amazing outputs and I can choose which ones I want to put through to my post so I'm going to choose this one and this one and I could just post now but I can also run image to image I'll do that while kind of posting just because I don't know if we'll have time but I'll resync those and in the meantime I can write some description to go with my post so I'm going to write I love hacking on ethereum and I click create and I sign the transaction with lens protocol and then I also can post and publish that on chain so cool I'll have that running and I think the other one's yeah running as well so I also got um here you can see like some of the image to image and how it outputs which is really cool so our documentation usually um in hackathon projects documentations and afterthought but I find it frustrating when I can't find documentation so instead of making standard docs another major part of this project was creating a place where all of the fascinating open source research from the community can come together and it's not just for image synthesis but also for um how to set up and run your own ethereum node because that's top priority after the match so I could also um you can see here some of these cool variations now I can go to my stream um and on my stream I have a curated feed of all of the different Publications from anari SIM you can see this is the one from just before um but there's a ton of others and every publication also shares the prompt that was used so you can see how other people are creating their content um so it's live now at anarisynth.xyz still in beta but you can try it out and yeah that's it thank you awesome this is great and just a new way to kind of think about content generation and building just a more Niche Network about what you're interested in all right thank you so much for that demo and with that we are ready for our next demo and that is Project flow Theory so I'll ask all three of them to uh get started welcome hi I'm sunny here to present flow Theory a fixed rate credit protocol that aims to bring real cash flow to auditing lending with real-time interest payments load theory is brought to you by Mahal Sonny and Binky a team of believers what three interest cash flow is actually someone mythical currently borrowers don't actually pay down their interest until they go for a payment causing lenders to have delayed and unreliable cash flow this results in higher rates for borrowers and lower rates for lenders which is unfavorable and yet this idea of continuous interest payments is very real in traditional Finance where we pay down our loans and installments and lenders realized cash flow continuously and so this brought us to introduced the flow Theory the idea is that the automatic repayment on chain debt for interest will incentivize better terms of credit and on-chain Landing markets so with the flow Theory particle offers is a fixed rate credit protocol where interest must be paid in the Stream and lenders don't have to claim interest as it shows up directly in their wallets this direct Brewing of Interest mechanism is made possible by superfluid where we accept interest payments in the form of a stream and rooted out directly to lenders using the super fluid instant distribution agreements as a result of the flow Theory contracts hold no total value lock in the form of accrued interest from borrowers asset is swept directly out to lenders both Theory makes use of super fluids real-time Finance rails polygon and optimism layer twos as well as the graph let's get into demo all right cool um thanks Sonny hello everyone um so in flow Theory a user can either lend money or they can borrow money um and as a lender they can start earning interest so to lend money out to start earning interest all they have to do is deposit some liquidity for this demo I've already deposited liquidity into the flow Theory contracts and this user will actually start to earn interest once per day so let's switch over to the borrower side so I can also show you how that works so as a borrower and flow Theory I have two options I can either manage my collateral or I can manage my borrows for this demo I've already deposited some collateral for this user I've deposited 420 wrapped ether so we can actually take a borrow against that collateral so let's go ahead and do that now I'll just borrow um 3000 usdc as we can see the collateral ratio gets updated automatically and we also show the user how much interest they're going to be paying so let's confirm this transaction so in the background as Sunny talks about what we do is we create a new super fluid stream which starts to stream the user's interest from their accounts into the flow Theory contracts in addition to this we also pay out that interest once per day by calling a super fluid instant deposit agreement so this 3000 usdc after this transaction is done will actually be transferred from flow Theory into the user's account okay try to speed up this transaction okay actually it's done okay cool so now we can see that the borrow has been completed and if we actually go to the superfluid dashboard we can see that the user's interest is starting to be paid out in a stream from their accounts we can look into this in more detail and we see the total amounts that the user has streamed in interest from their accounts to the flow Theory smart contracts if we go ahead and refresh our page here we can also see on the flow Theory page um the interest amounts that that they have paid so far if we take a look at the super fluid console as well we can also take a look at all of the streams that are active for the flow Theory contract um so we can see that's multiple users can actually be streaming interest using flow Theory contracts and with that I'll pass it back to Sunny to conclude the demo thanks Spanky that was flow Theory we're bringing real and Direct Cash Flow to web3 credits follow us at oxflow theory on Twitter where we are Marching towards production and you can get all the alpha there and if you want to have a deeper conversation on Flow Theory or just want to talk about this idea of you know real cash flow in on-chain credits you can find me at sunnyjister on telegram or Twitter I'd love to talk thank you so much for your time and attention I'll turn it back to card Tech awesome congratulations and uh yeah can't wait for more people to use this and uh give it a shot and uh try this out in the more interesting default use case all right with that we are ready for our next demo and that is team interplanetary font s so uh Eduardo and team whenever you're ready hi everyone uh we're into interplanetary fonts we are for Developers for different parts of the world and our idea is a decentralized nftp Marketplace and collaboration platform for creators and collectors of funds the main problem we we want to issue with this then with this product is that funds are usually incomplete and they cover only a specific scripts mostly Latin so for font professionals they only develop one part of the product and the font users only want to pay for what they want what they need to use that's why we need more multilingual funds to have a better chance to support all languages all over the world our solution is a collaboration platform which allows creators to add value to fund projects by expanding the support to more regions and be rebooted in real time for their work and an nft Marketplace that provides collectors a flexible way to buy funds according to their needs and to contribute the expansion of the system ones uh the app uh interacts with the smart contracts with Deploy on polygon and the blockchain data is retrieved with graphql those the users are able to fund projects pay creators using super fluid streaming protocol main funds nfts with ipfs storage and create projects only after verifying with a proof of personhood using wargoing which also will be good to avoid piracy problems uh doing correct connections and collaboration we will use lens and epns okay now it's demo time so here's the home screen of the app uh here you'll have a feed with the recent projects you can connect your wallet [Music] and when you connect you'll have now access to your profile in your profile you will have like the Creator and collector profile in the grader profile you have all the projects you have created you'll have the ability to create new projects all the collaborations you are involved in and a treasury which will have the active phone screens you you have running and your balance as a collector you'll have the uh all the nfts you you have bought yeah this is the nft data and you also have the phone stream you have found it yeah here you'll have access to the super fluid dashboard which I'm already connected and you also have the ability to fund this stream or collaborate if it's an open stream for uh fun for a project collaboration okay so now let's go to the do a font project here is the the information about that project and this is the specimen of the font you can test it and here you will be able to choose which characters you want to buy you can toggle between the preset chart sets or you can choose a custom selection and when you're satisfied with your selection you will be able to meet the NFD okay here we see the transaction that is going to be confirmed and when the transaction is completed you will be able to download your font okay uh this pop-up window is our epns notifications that will allow you to know why when something is happening with your projects okay so I will let me go back to my to do presentation so the next steps are finalized finalize the MVP we want to connect the font Engine with the smart contracts complete the contract for super super fluid streaming Implement lens and workline and share the first version with users for ux research and deploy domain okay thank you awesome thank you so much for that demo this is a really nice way to think about discretizing uh thoughts and a lot of information for artists okay all right with that we are ready for our next demo and I'd like to welcome carry protocol team so run whenever you're ready hi uh hello everyone uh so we are Carrie protocol uh direct to wallet advertising platform oh okay cool um so yeah so the problem with safe solving is that you know marketing and webpage is hard um Community Driven marketing is great for the early stages but it's not easy to scale to the next millions of users um and in what two data driven advertising is a 500 billion dollar industry and have proven to be extremely effective so we thought that we wanted to experiment on how we can leverage on-chain information uh for marketing purposes so uh what is current protocol uh we're a platform that allows web 3 companies to advertise to specific customer groups uh based on their on-chain data and interactions histories so one example is we like to get uh is let's say if you're working on a new game five project uh initially you might want to Target it or advertise to XC or step-end users who are essentially already one foot into the webview world uh as op to someone who doesn't even know how to create a wallet yet um so for a demo there's a two parts of our demo um the ads manager and then also the ads receiver let me just switch to this uh so this is our ads manager um I'm gonna pretend that I am the marketing team from the Ave protocol uh let's create a campaign we can create a name uh you can select your audience here uh for instance if you're Ave you might want to Target people who have interacted with the compound smart contracts before but never uses the Ave contract before and this is the estimated audience size that actually the actual data that we query from the graph but from for this demo we're probably going to do a smaller user size just for efficiency confirm you can also attach some incentives to kind of like incentivize people to basically read their ads so you can attach some money there put in some content upload an image and then confirm upload the image to ipfs um so take a little bit and then touch incentives this process usually takes around like 10 seconds essentially what it's doing is it's minting the tokens in the polygon testnet and then put it into the incentives contract we'll click create sign and then back to the dashboard so essentially the ads is already sent um you could come back to the dashboard and essentially this you know is a place where you can look at the metrics for different um ads campaign you can also use this chatbot to chat with the Harry protocol team um so if you're from the um the list of people who receive the ads essentially you'll come back uh come to to our website and then you receive these content come in you can basically consume the content look at the images and then you can claim your airdrop here I'm just going to do it very quickly and um there's also a link to the website if you want to attach a link uh if you go back here refresh a little bit um your basically your earned earnings what goes up uh and yeah so that's that's the demo um thank you for listening um so we're planning to continue working on this platform after the hackathon uh we want to build the apis to connect with more advertising spaces in addition to our adapts like wallets metaverses and websites uh feel free to reach out to us on Twitter um if you want to use our platform and thank you for listening awesome a full advertising platform that is on-chain and Native this is amazing so hopefully uh you get to launch this and others get to try this out and I can rest for uh for demoing all right next up we have L2 optimizers so Ben and Matt whenever you're ready awesome thank you gonna go ahead and share my screen so our submission to the ethonline 2022 hackathon is called the L2 optimize sorry my uh my team told me I had to do it that way and speaking of the team it consists of Matt Solomon Ed Mazurek David leprod Gary Harriet and myself bendy Francesco we're all engineers at scope lift a crypto Focus Dev shop uh building smart contracts and more in the web 3 ecosystem so for the sackathon we built a series of gas efficient routers for L2 applications let me tell you a little bit about how and why these work so as you may know layer 2 networks share security with mainnet by posting transaction call data back to layer one in particular roll-up style networks do this as a result layer 2 layer 2 users actually have to pay their portion of this mainnet gust when executing their transactions on there too now because layer 1 gas is much more expensive than layer 2 gas 25 000 times more expensive or even greater than that paying for this call data on layer 1 ends up dominating your L2 transaction costs so by recognizing this reality we were able to write a series of custom contracts that optimized for call data using much less of it and as a result significantly reducing the actual transaction costs that users pay so how well does this work well to find out we wrote deployed and tested routers for three popular protocols on the optimism Network on Ave we saw up to a 27 reduction in particular when depositing and withdrawing eth for super fluid we saw a 34 reduction when starting a stream of usdc and for connects we saw up to a 46 46 reduction when testing the token bridge this was on the optimism test net by the way now it's time for a quick demo um hopefully the demo Gods will be with us I'm going to hop over to our front end and for this demo I will deposit 0.01 eth into Abe I'll go ahead and confirm the transaction while we're waiting for that to be mined I should note that while we built a custom front end in order to demonstrate this for the hackathon there's really no reason that you need to have a custom experience in fact the user experience isn't Changed by our contracts at all the only thing the user should notice differently is that their transaction transaction fees are lower because they're using our optimized contracts behind the scenes so if we head over to our Ave dashboard we should be able to see there it is 0.01 eth has been deposited on our behalf we could come back here and we could do the withdrawal transaction as well uh the optimized withdrawal in the interest of time I'm instead going to show you a couple withdrawal transactions that we've done in the past on etherscan this first transaction is not through our optimized contracts this is through the standard um the standard Ave contracts so we perform the withdrawal and what you see reflected on etherscan down here is this reality that I was discussing discussing earlier we have our L2 gas and the L2 gas that we use but that L2 gas is very cheap in Gray terms now our L1 gas we use much less of it but it's much more expensive in the gray that we use in this case we used 4700 L1 gas and we're paying 16 Gray if I hop over to now an optimized version of this same transaction it runs through our custom router contracts those router contracts call into the same Ave contracts that we used before so it's doing the exact same action it's just optimized for call data and what you see down here is that our L1 gas used went down by about a thousand and because the L1 gas cost is much more expensive in Gray terms than the L2 gas cost the uh the amount of savings is significant here so to expand on that let me hop over to this spreadsheet where we summarize the results that we saw and give you a sense of the assumptions that we're making when we provide these numbers so you'll see our savings for different actions on the order of 20 27 10 47 Etc the assumptions that we're making here are 25 gray mainnet gas uh .001 L2 gas this is reflective of reality and sixteen hundred dollar each price uh not as reflective as reality right now but hopefully that goes back up soon what you'll notice is if we increase the L1 gas price to say 250 gray and we've definitely seen that in the past the actual cost of the transaction scales by 10x as well so this goes from about 15 cents to about uh a dollar fifty and the amount that we're saving also goes up by 10x so as L1 gas prices go back up in the future as demand for Block space increases the uh the optimizations that we're doing here also scale by the amount of L1 gas and become even more important so uh with that I'll hop back and just talk very briefly about the future for Optimizer we'd like to build out more routers for other popular protocols and get this working on other layer 2 networks the same principle applies to any roll-up and we'd love to help integrate uh these routers directly into front ends for protocols like we said there's really no reason the user experience needs to be any different they just need to interact with these optimized contracts so if you work for a protocol and you're interested in saving your users gas fees please get in touch we'd love to help you out uh we also invite everyone to take a look at what we've built you can check out our contracts repo our front end repo you can also use the demo note that it is hacker hackathon level code so use it at your own risk and with that I'll just say thank you to East Global for a great hackathon experience and thanks to you all for your attention thanks Ben thanks Matt uh it's too early way too early for me to introduce you originally with the proper name but it's just a great demo and hopefully this also becomes a great project like Umbra uh congratulations and with that we are ready for our next team so I'd like to welcome Xerox sauce and TC hi guys I'm going to share my screen so hi guys where's Xerox sauce and this is our hack on Instagram online 2022 where you're building the guard for the future nft financialization and let's Get Saucy the presentation agenda includes four parts the motivation key features of our current product a product demo and lastly we include our Tech architecture in the appendix over 100 million dollars in UFT have been stolen in the past 14 months in addition to stolen entities over 8 million dollars of the fund have been laundered using nft to prevent cyber criminal scam and fund laundry centralized in Ft Marketplace such as openc blacklisted suspicious assets and the phrase them from Trading during the investigating period however this will cause a problem of this compromised nft May flow into the permissionless decentralized protocols and cause unfair training for the Unchained users with the emergence of more and more decentralized adaptive financialization protocol such as NFC amm nft loan nft fractional fractionalization there is a solid need to source and ft before users can treat or perform other tasks so above is our motivation for zero exhaust we're here to build an ongen nft Source in Oracle and we want to contribute to make a healthier and more ethnic community ecosystem so here is what we have firstly we build our own chain Oracle and we deploy it to ethereum optimism and polygon magnet our contract is callable and developers can call to Source in FTP for performing other tasks and then we set up off-chain subgraph in created data streams on Dual analysis for developers to make convenient query and lastly we build the front-end website for users to check any blacklisting information we set our push channels and we use covalent to monitor several criminal address and transactions and let's take a look of our product demo so here is our home page users can enter any contact address and item info to query if enough is suspicious or not here we have a board app address and this is for token ID 2162 anyway if we make the query it should be blocked and yeah check all open say yes it is blocked and if we switch to 2161 and we should be good yep so with uh story and updating each Blacklist item is expensive on chain we perform a Marco tree uh data verification that data verification um so instead of storing all the address and item id we only need to store a 32 bytes Marco tree root for each collection and then we save the rest of the Marco tree leaves on ipfis so under the collection page we have listed six Blue Chip collections um our current data source come from too many two places first is open C snapshot we constantly query from openc API and snap take snapshot of all the blacklisted items from openc that are tagged by openc exactly require all the scam address that are labeled by certain slowlist and scams need for and we regard all the nft under those scam addresses as all as all blacklisted we know like the current data source is not perfect and we will do multi-data source for cross-validation and the further maybe further like the high reputation Webster identities could be our potential data validators and those two are on our priority in the to-do list under the notification page uh we have the subscribing button and subscribers of our channel will be updated with the most recent nft black listing information and here is our subgraph developers can easily to carry our most updated token proof in the subgraph and uh here is our documentation so in the documentation we show the example of how to verify a lefty Source before doing an nft swap in solidity and for more information welcome to check out our GitHub repo um thank you guys all for watching and Zero's exos is consisted by two defy and blockchain security Engineers wear chain agnostic and we focus searching for donability and solidity in our other smart contracts we want to bring the fairness and security to blockchain thank you it's Global and thank all the rest of the teams we really enjoy this hacksome journey and here is our technical architecture illustration welcome to dmrs on Twitter and or submit any pull requests on GitHub and that's it thanks thank you TZ this was awesome and hopefully everybody also gets to use it and check it out and keep their uh nft safe all right uh this was demo number 10 we have four more to go and then we're gonna get to the prizes so without further Ado let's welcome Igor from refi Igor whenever you're ready yeah hi everyone I'm just sharing with Karine okay so we are team refi my name is Igor I'd like to present our project we build for eth online 2022 Revenue based the final ending Marketplace so what we build is a bridge and a Marketplace connecting web 2 Revenue generating companies such as e-commerce companies SAS businesses direct consumer businesses gaming or app development firms and we connect those with different investors wanting to invest in the new asset class so the best way to explain a project basically would be with a demo so what we have here is our Marketplace a front-end dashboard basically so what I'll do first is I will connect as a borrower so basically what I've connected as as a company who wants to borrow money what I would go is go to the borrow tab and start the process so the first step would be to connect to my sales platform such as stripe so what I would enter here is a stripe key so what happens now is that we connect the stripe we pull the revenue report about the company and present it to the user so we can see how much money this company is generated over a period of time so what I do is fill the information about my company or the thing that's needed specify how much money I want to borrow the interest rate is preset at 10 percent and usually this step takes the longest so I'll explain actually What's Happening Here whilst the transaction is is happening is that when we press mint and the system would take the information about the company that there is a pre-filled would take the revenue report data that is put from stripe and upload those to ipfs then the system would mint this nft and up and uploaded data to ipfs and to metadata to of that nft so looks like um the nft has been created here we can see this information so it's created the company name uh how much money I want to borrow and then the revenue that I've generated which is built from stripe so what I'll do next is I will connect as a lender so on the other side of the of the marketplace would connect my wallets and as a lender what I do is browse all the Available Loans that have been created by borrowers here is the latest one that I've created you can see in the company information or the company data how much money the company wants to borrow how much revenue this company is generated and then if I like this what I could do is lend to that firm so we can see again the amount of money that the company is asking for so let's say let's fill it fully I can do it pay via crypto or pay via non-ramp so for this example I'll use paper and crypto for my crypto wallet so here what happens here is that send the money is being sent from the lender crypto wallet address to the borrower account and the money is being sent of a transaction yeah there you go a successful transaction we can see the hash all the loan details and then I've sent money basically to the borrower so what I would do next actually is log in as a borrower back to back to the dashboard I want it again it's quite a lot of hopping around here and that's the problem with marketplaces a lot of users so what I could see on my dashboard is I could see that the loan request for zero automatic has been filled by the lender which I have done before so what I could do is withdraw those funds and then use that money to grow my company hire more people go expand to different markets and let's let's say I've then generated some revenue and I'm ready to repay the lender so I specify how much money I want to repay usually would be a percentage of the revenue that the company is making and then we can connect directly to the stripe account to see how much money companies generating can I keep repay the lender let's say zero flagmatic 005 Matic and then here the money is transferred from the borrower account to to the London wallet and again hopefully the transaction is not being delayed for too long there you go repayment has been successful so I can see basically just by refreshing the page is that what I've done is I've paid zero five mat takes 005 how to take off automatic back to the lender and what it does is it shows the entire process basically of our defined Marketplace so how it's made so we use an extra yes for the front end we connect the stripe to put the revenue reports about the company we use alchemy to connect front end to the blockchain and we sign in with ethereum for the session management and the login the application is utilizing and using a polygon blockchain on the back end for this specific example we're using mobile test net erc721 standard for the nft creation and we store all the company information and stripe Revenue data to ipfs and for the future what we envision is utilize other credit delegation function for the lenders we also want to build a scoring mechanism to help improve the assessment basically of the borrowers to the lenders and also build on an offerings to help web2 companies to be onboarded to web free so thank you very much it's been incredibly fun to work on this project with my with my team and let's help to build more bridges between web 2 and web free companies thank you very much thanks Igor hopefully all of us get to use this ticket is such a nice way to think about bridging with real world assets and using web 2 and just normal information to actually amplify what you're doing as a business so I can't wait for others to also try this out next up is our third last project for today I want to welcome turbo bi pass to demo what they built whenever you're ready okay hello everyone or just the moment and okay we're live so uh we built True Body iPass which is just uh no code web free integration solution allowing everyone to create integration workflows uh without using any any code so the the project really systems integration um that and that you can everyone can use just using GUI configurations to to do it and it it's based on robust integration engine we we built with plugable Integrations and it supports multi-laying integration pipelines with conditional transitions additionally we created a expression we used a very powerful expression parser which I always asked for very sophisticated data mappings and uh it's but it's basically front and graphical designer that that anyone can use and back-end integration engine that runs those Integrations so user interface are really based on three things activity and editor when you create activities and transitions between them shared resources that you can share between many activities and output mappings that you can remap in other activities so uh I will then demo it in a moment but like posting possible use cases for now are like Limitless so with monitoring bit crochet integration automation business process modeling things like that or even um Arbitrage Bots or allowing anyone who just don't know how to code and would like to uh to do something in their free to to integrate with that so our future uh future plans are to expand this this product basically at new activities and make it easier even for user to you to use so I prepared some live demo so for the starters this is how it looks and let me create some simple integration so let's start with scheduler that it just runs only once and we are just now creating new um we are creating new activity I'll add API to to be able to connect to the evm and also generate ebm Connection in the first step so having having that done um sorry having that done I can now pin it share connections I can see the functions to invoke right now I'd like to get latest round data and as you can see here it automatically gets the data from there we also have [Music] resolution from ens and Idris and yeah so this is the our first step in the in the workflow so I'll like skip a few things just to show you uh how it how it's created so then I just create two additional transitions from this invoking of smart contracts one just says that it's too pricey and we are doing nothing if the price is too big however if it's below a certain threshold we are invoking second activity which is our decentralized Exchange um and lastly we just uh log if it fails or is successful so let me now save this flow and start it of course it's live on on testnet so it will take some time in order to to run but but we'll see so for example if it if it succeeds here we can use we will just log that that transaction okay I think that we have it okay just to see if it's here it's it's still pending but come on so it will be done in a moment we also have some additional examples for for example if you want to uh pay some payroll system based on ethereum Crush chain so we have this smart contract that we can call uh so let's see that the contract itself is built on ethereum but we want to pay someone on on a polygon so we are just creating this simple integration and when the time comes it will be actually uh sent to the smart contract listen for the events and if something happens it will uh by the user so in this flow uh yeah so first we listen for the event then we are getting some metadata about the user then we are invoking smart contracted for example chain ID3 which is EDM Robson or Mumbai we are using different addresses however the same apis to do so uh we see okay yeah as you can see it was sent even twice because I I clicked it twice but yeah it works so that is all for the demo and I hope you liked it sweet this this was great all right um just give me one second to make sure everything is on track for the next demo and uh yeah thank you so much thank you very much all right hopefully you all get to use this thing and I can't wait for No code evm architecture design that sounds fun and risky at the same time but more fun than risky uh this is great well thank you so much and with that we are ready for our second last demo for today so without further further Ado I'd like to welcome Corbin to talk about new wallets and lensmo hey Corbin hey everybody all right all right guys so for for ethonline this year we created Noob wallets new wallets are a non-custodial smart contract wallet for newbies or for mainstream users it's tied to any social media account like a Twitter a GitHub or a Discord ID but the unique thing about new wallets is you don't create a new wallet for yourself you create them for other folks so your friends your family celebrities really anybody on the internet you can create a new wallet on their behalf and send any type of nft or assets to that wallet and they can claim it when they're ready to onboard into the web 3 economy we think that this is a really powerful crypto primitive that can be used for all types of interesting use cases things like nft air drops uh to Twitter followers without needing to collect uh an ens you can send it straight to their Twitter username you can send nft birthday cards to your mom she doesn't need to install or set up a metamask wallet you can just send it to her email or her Twitter username businesses can set up new Wallets on behalf of their customers with no onboarding required and uh folks like Charities can accept donations straight from their Twitter handle rather than having to set up any type of custodian uh so new wallets is the protocol layer we also have an application layer called lensmo that I'll demo here in a second um so what problem are we solving mainstream user onboarding so centralized exchanges and confusing non-custodial wallets just aren't doing the trick for mainstream users these aren't Traders these aren't investors these are just folks that you know want to do fun stuff online and then get on with their life right so we want to have a wallet for this big part of the adoption curve and we think new wallets are going to be that um we think everybody on the planet really should have a web 3 wallet and kind of start contributing to the web 3 economy so as I mentioned Noob wallets are non-custodial smart contract wallets tied to your social media account they're also completely composable so we actually tag every new wallet that's been created this is our Leaderboard on Dune and you can see we've set up new wallets for Twitter Elon Musk Twitter vitalik this is GitHub Linus torvald this is uh Twitter Jack and on down I actually did a Twitter airdrop earlier this week and anybody that retweeted this tweet I sent them ten dollars in usdc they got a new wallet set up in there in the background and they can use their Twitter account to then claim that value so let's go ahead and do one so I'm switching over to the lensmo app again this is the application layer with lensmo you can actually send cross social network airdrops as well as sending tokens to anybody with a social media account so I'm gonna check out uh Twitter Jack here and see check out his uh new wallet so um this is Jack who's been airdropped 50 in usdc I can give him more tokens or send him one of my you know membership nfts and if I'm actually Jack here on the page I can claim through this flow claim all the Assets in this wallet if we go back we're actually going to do an airdrop so um I've set one up here to airdrop to a couple Twitter users this is Drake the rapper uh Cristiano Ronaldo and then a charity that helps folks with medical debt I don't even know if this charity actually accepts crypto but I'm going to go ahead and send it to their new wallet tied to their Twitter account and they can claim it when they're good and ready I'm also going to be sending to some of our favorite folks on GitHub lens and ens all in the same transaction so let's come over here input it here we're going to do an approve and then send it out now note that lensmo sends to both web 2 and web 3 social networks so for things like lens protocol and ens we're not actually setting up a new wallet because the users have a wallet associated with those accounts right they're web 3 social networks for Twitter and GitHub obviously there's no connected wallet so we're setting up a new wallet in the background so that they can claim those assets when they're ready with the social attestation this is taking a bit to mine so you can see here I have a transaction from earlier that uh of the airdrop kind of all going through so how does this work uh flipping back over here so new wallets are built on top of the gnosis safe or the safe Dow we use a custom zodiac modifier to do the social attestation for a user to then claim their new wallet once they're good and ready and we drop a solebound token to that wallet which actually gives us the tagging of Twitter Elon Musk that can be used in Dune or portfolio tracker apps or other dapps kind of across the web 3 space we're really excited about this primitive we think new wallets can help onboard you know millions and millions of users into the crypto economy we think it has the ability to kind of mature itself into a full-flung uh protocol over time so if you'd like to do a Twitter airdrop or if you're interested in partnering in any such way uh DM us at uh pay Magic on Twitter and we'd love to collaborate thanks so much to all the Etho and line uh Community we had a blast as always with our hack so thank you thanks so much Corbin Rory and Mike this was awesome we also got a comment from the live stream saying if you want to check us send crypto.money you can also combine this thing with a way to receive uh payments to an address that is not claimed yet so it seems like there's a lot of opportunity in this model and uh I regret not retweeting that a few days ago so uh thank you so much hopefully we all get to see this and and hopefully the the medical debt charity accept script doctors this will be a really awesome thing if it works out uh maybe if all of us retweet uh they'll maybe they pay enough attention to uh to actually set that up so thanks again and with that we are just about at the tail end of our last finalist demo for today we have our 14th 14th team that is a no-cost subscriptions we're just getting them on to the live stream here so whenever they're ready we'll get them to start the video and go in with with the demo um one interesting thing that I'll kind of preface with our last demo is that we weren't sure if they were going to be ready in time the team is based out of Florida and they are just about to be hit with hurricane Ian it was not an easy uh time for for them or anybody else in in that state right now and uh we kind of weren't sure if things would work out from a timing standpoint but looks like we're about to just onboard them so we'll give it a few more seconds and see if they're ready and uh if not we do have a backup plan which is uh we knew about this ahead of time and we'll get and we have a recorded video of their demo that we uh looked at last night and we'll play that if we run into any technical difficulty so I'll check if the team is good to go here but uh if not then we will play the video but in the meantime um as we're getting them set up there might be some latency issues here uh set up uh it's been incredible to see just the variety of what people are excited about it's it's we've seen a lot of infrastructure projects we have seen people caring about how to bridge things with the real world uh we have seen people use defy in more interesting ways uh one obvious theme which keeps becoming more and more prevalent is streaming money just people finding way more interesting use cases of streaming money in real time and uh it's kind of been pretty interesting to kind of say hey like all these ways we think about what crypto can do what smart contracts can be used are just making things a lot easier for us to make more and more consumer ready apps and uh I am excited to see what what this kind of gets us in a few months um because the progress has been so immense that uh and it's so fast that it gets it gets me super excited uh not only that uh one thing that as we were looking at uh some of the stats for this event uh it was pointed out by one of our team members is that uh we we measure our success by seeing how many people in this space we bring on and having people stick around after uh we have different metrics we look at retention we look at how many individual brand new people coming into F3 we look at their their skill sets and uh the step that kind of blew my mind uh that we learned uh in computed just about 30 minutes ago is that the number of individuals that are participating in this league online 2022 as individual hackers is more than all the people that participated in all of 2020 in youth Global and that just blows my mind because that is incredible growth this is just one out of the 16 events we're doing at similar scales and it is just insane that we're seeing so many people get more and more excited about what they can do in web3 so I I can't wait for the next Heat outline because I think we need to ramp up our team just so we can handle the number of projects we're going to see and uh not only that there are a few more hackathons we have left this year alone so we're going to see if uh we can break our own records and they'll be a good good shot so with that um um looks like we are still running into technical difficulties uh what we'll do is uh play the video that we already got from this team and if they come on we'll kind of just bring them on at the end but uh without further Ado let's welcome our last demo no cost subscriptions hello everybody my name is Joelle I'm from no cost subscriptions and thank you Global for hosting these fantastic hackathons no cost subscriptions are a new subscription model that enables users to support their favorite businesses by saving money with them at no cost to the user it's somewhat similar to how pull together works we scroll down to our subscriptions a user can subscribe to a product or service by Saving or staking to initiate a no-cost subscription the membership is represented by an nft that is received after staking for example Apple can park some of its 17 billion in cash into an AWS no cost subscription to gain access to cloud services and then Apple could withdraw or switch to monthly Billing at any time we're at a smaller scale a Discord Community can create a subscription that allows users to gain access to different channels or resources and the user can return the nft and claim their stake at any time so let's go ahead and create a subscription we'll call this one streaming service and we'll give it a value of one for our demo and we'll go ahead and do that transaction to create the subscription no cost subscriptions allow businesses an alternative to monetization without ads which track sensitive user data instead they create Revenue by aggregating liquidity for Global defy markets through the NCS protocol in the future subscription creators can select the risk level by choosing between different yield aggregators or safer yields like Ave stable coins when their clients subscribe to their business by staking or depositing they yield from the deposits is redirected to the business all right so our subscription should be created we'll go ahead and refresh and we'll change our theme up and we see that our subscription is right here so let's go ahead and subscribe and we'll confirm that and that would actually go and create the subscription so while that loads I do want to show you our Tech stack NCS is a set of smart contracts deployed on the polygon and optimism blockchains optimism blockchains and it's built on a VJs front end the primary smart contract is the NCS subscription Factory which is responsible for creating the subscriptions the subscriptions themselves are also smart contracts they can deploy can deploy nfts deposit into Ave and distribute yield to the Creator we also use NFC port to validate if users on a subscription to give them a dynamic view in our UI we also included a hard hat configuration with unit testing in our GitHub repo all right so we should be subscribed now so if I refresh that tile will update and we'll see that we are subscribed so we could also do a deep dive here and look at the actual transaction and we'll see that our money was deposited into Ave and that we also received the nft which acts as the membership for that subscription and now I'll have access to that streaming service as an example and then at any time I could go back and unsubscribe and swap back to a monthly subscription with some additional time we would have loved to build up a ramp up model where maybe the user doesn't have to deposit a hundred percent of the stake at once instead if they deposit 50 of the stake now they have a 50 discount on the monthly subscription and over time they could continue to build up their stake with that company and eventually hit that 100 Mark that makes a subscription free the mass adoption of no cost subscriptions will create more accessible liquidity to the global D5 markets by driving more lock liquidity into D5 protocols promoting healthy financial behavior for consumers a sort of saving to consume model and allowing for monetization without Farming Farming sensitive user data imagine a future society that incentivizes people to focus on building up their savings to gain access to the services around them it seems to me that this is a much healthier Society it is as if every saving Milestone achieved unlocks a new feature in the world around you thank you awesome that was a recorded demo of the no code subscription team they're building just as the name it applies a way to do subscriptions without any cost I set code before it's no cost subscriptions and it's kind of similar to pull together you get to think about a better way to subsidize and amortize the cost here so it's a really unique idea and a really awesome demo so hopefully people get to try this out and make this more of a known concept just as a notes everybody uh we have heard back from them they are they are safe we are in contact with the team there's just uh connection issues with the internet there so um we just want to wish everybody uh in in Florida are our best and I hope that everybody stays safe out there and uh hopefully uh there are no uh serious uh damages because of the hurricane so uh those were all of our 14 demos and uh with that I'd like to kind of continue off and uh congratulate all 14 of these teams telescope carry protocol ens everywhere L2 optimizers stacker Network Xerox sauce water drops refi Inari synth turbo di pass flow Theory new wallet interplanetary

done and things to show that this was good because they've won actual money all right so quick note before we end everything on the prize delivery everything that we talked about is tentative and not final which means that there are a couple things that we have to make sure before we deliver any prize which is making sure that nobody cheated any uh on their projects we'll be verifying everybody's copious which is why you are required to keep your repos public and of course we are still waiting on a few more Prize winners from a few of our partners so all that will happen this week and then we'll start the review process and all prizes will be delivered by October 18th so that's about three weeks from now right after Defcon it will obviously try to make sure that we are ahead of this timeline but at your worst case is that all prices post verification will be in your Wallets on the 18th so please be patient and we'll communicate that again on multiple different channels so before we close this off I want to say a few thank yous to people that help and help to make this event possible and successful of course there are a lot of partners that we work with and a lot of parties

actually telling you what's going on next so you saw all the partner Prize winners we saw 14 teams come up you saw 360 projects getting highlighted at this uh live stream and for those of you who are joining us for the first time you may not know this but eth Global's goal is to make sure we give people that chance to experiment with what's possible in web 3 so they can stick around learn and build some interesting things that either were not possible before or we just never thought to think about solving a problem in a particular way and as a result we don't think about this as a competition there's no first second third uh there are definitely partner prizes that are independent from our own process and we call them finalists because effectively all 14 of these teams came first and there effectively are winners for this biggest event we've ever done in our history and as part of being a finalist each team member on each of these 14 teams will be receiving one thousand

Partners and of course we recognize that not everybody wants something and and that's okay but we want to make sure that you have a great experience they also are getting excited about doing things at scale this is a lot of fun for us to coordinate things we had to coordinate this with a hundred countries I've never thought of something that big not only on a short notice but also just seeing the scale and the excitement that people bring in from six different continents it's absolutely incredible so as part of that anybody who submitted a project will be receiving a free t-shirt for this hackathon this is what it look it looks like we're working on the final sides of the logistics of giving this to every single country that participated so there's a lot of stuff happening in the
