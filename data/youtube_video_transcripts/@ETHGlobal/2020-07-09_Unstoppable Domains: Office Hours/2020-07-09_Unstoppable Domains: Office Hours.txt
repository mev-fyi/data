okay we're good awesome all right we'll redo the intros so hi everyone this is matthew from unstoppable domains uh if you've checked in with us earlier you'll know that we have two tracks for hackathon prizes for hackfs one is for building uh decentralized websites you can find more information about that by clicking in our channel and we also have a google doc that describes that in a little more details and then we also have a second track for building a decentralized chat application we're going to talk about that a little bit more today we actually have carson from the textile team joining us to talk about threadsdb so if you're trying to build an application that works on filecoin you're probably going to want to use some tools to make it easier for you to organize and save data on the network so you don't have to write all of it back in for yourself and that's where uh something like threads db comes in there's actually a couple different ways uh implementations of organizing data on the back end another one just to mention is orbit db uh we'll talk with them as well maybe they'll join us on a future office hours but today we've got carson here and i don't want to hold him up since he's taking time out of his day to come and join us to talk about threads db uh and in particular hopefully give us a little bit of insight into how he might you know implement a chat uh a chat app up on threadsdb and believe it or not they did this before over a year ago and there's an old medium post where you can go find that as well which would be helpful for people participating in the hackathon to get an idea how it works so without further ado i'm going to hand it over to carson uh and we'll let him talk a little bit about threads and uh chat apps cool yeah thanks so much and um this is your office hour so i'll try to keep it brief um uh because i don't wanna dominate the conversation there's probably tons of awesome questions but um yeah i i can talk a little bit about threads tv so basically if you want to win one of these prizes especially the chat one uh i think i might have a pretty good example that folks could play around with so oh matt i just lost matt but hopefully everybody else can still hear me yeah okay cool um so right threadsdb first of all thread threaddb um it's a decentralized peer-to-peer database built on top of the best bits of lib p2p and ipfs um we use it for all sorts of things it's the backing for uh textiles buckets api which is like an api for pushing large files mutable collaborative files on ipfs and if anyone's played around with any type that that app is built on top of threads and a bunch of others um anyway uh i don't want to dwell on what it is too much but it is a it's a decentralized peer-to-peer database and like decentralized peer-to-peer databases you can do things like synchronize state between different peers and why that might be useful for someone building a chat app is is a is basically each of your peers can just write to their local database sync that state across with other peers and you effectively have a chat app and so um matt and uh the unstoppable team mentioned uh dare to go hey you know we've got this um this chat app uh bounty and you know do you guys think you could point some folks in the right direction with building this on um uh threads db and so we put something together and here i'm just going to paste it into the chat here um so we've got a repo of examples the best way i find to learn is just to break things so we've got a repo of examples that you can break um and there's a poll request in there for a chat app um that is pretty neat for a couple of reasons so and i'll highlight why those reasons are one it's actually um based on our local first offline first database um implementation of threads so basically what you're doing is you're writing to a local database in the browser's you know cache using leveldb and then you're syncing the updates um uh to your remote connected peers uh when you have internet connection so in theory this chat app works even if you're not connected to the internet you could write your little chats and then when it goes online it will flush those out to your other peers so that's pretty cool and i think certainly like in the decentralized world the remote or local first is a pretty nice feature the other cool thing about that is and our my team member and our ceo andrew actually put this uh chat up together he um wrapped using um uh he basically this is like a replacement for socket i o so it uses observables as a really nice wrapper and like framework for just like pushing and pulling updates so the idea is you could actually any app that where you might want to use socket io you could just plug this uh threads demo in there and start playing around with it and um that's kind of nice because it means suddenly you've kind of got this decentralized framework that fits into a bunch of different contexts so we just got this pushed up this afternoon i recommend you go in there and start playing around with it i guarantee you it will break and it's your job as the hackers to fix it and make a better version of it um and i'm i'm gonna be playing around with that at the same time actually so you may see some you know pushes to that example as i find some rough edges and things like that but i i highly recommend you just grab it it's one of those things where you check out that examples repo cd into the um i think it's called hub hub chat or something like that cd into that npm install npm run start and it'll pop up a little thing open one up in um actually i guess i could well i don't want to take up too much more time but open up one in you know safari open up another window in firefox and start chatting with each other and you'll see the little chats popping up and it does work in real time and it's pretty it's pretty slick and if it breaks you know ping me here i'll hang out in the the unstoppable domains chat for um the next couple of days or weeks um ping us in our in our uh textile chat and i mean i want someone to win with this so i'll try to provide some support as much as i can because honestly i think like the more sort of decentralized chat alternatives we have the better um and you know like i'd like it to be mine but i what i really want is just a really solid chat app so let's let's let's make that happen and um uh yeah i don't know what else i can say about that except get in there and play around with it break it yeah yeah so i can uh provide a little context on what we're seeing in the market and first carson can you hear me okay just checking my volume i said i'm all right yep perfect perfect excellent uh yeah so we actually see a lot of excitement around chat so we um there's that there's several people working on decentralized chat just in the ecosystem the thing that's actually happening this year that's new and different and i think really important is um you're gonna be able to incentivize the keeping of your messages right so and like that that's a huge difference um i've had conversations on uh applications before that i've lost right or or that have been deleted right just because uh some apps will only keep your chat history for so long um i actually had uh with the with bogdan on our team he actually had a uh like a link that he had been using for forever um and for whatever reason he lost his access to that link that he'd been using for this particular you know he had like a blog saved from like three years ago and whenever he got deleted now he can't find it right and it's gone forever so um if instead users own their chat messages and they can pay for the storage of those chat messages and they can ensure that they're going to have those chat messages forever um it's it's pretty awesome and then like if the app goes away there's so many apps that don't exist anymore that i used three or four years ago you still have your chat history um and then it's also neat for app developers and this is maybe a longer term thing because they don't have to worry about building uh chat protocols anymore because if a lot of people build competing chat protocols and some of them are really good then why don't i just you know plug into that on my application and now i don't have to worry about all these chat design features i also don't have to worry about privacy right because uh as the app developer i'm no longer worried about leaking my users text messages so it can simplify the application development it makes the the chats portable across a bunch of different apps and it also makes them you know essentially immutable for the user uh and this is all possible uh it only really works once you have an incentivized um chat system like if there's not a way for you to pay for your storage to be up there for forever then you're relying on other people being nice essentially for keeping your chat message up or you have to run your own node so like you have this you have this situation where um you either had to be really rolling your own all the way to having your own server at your house or you can't really use it as an end user for us at unstoppable we have you know tens of thousands of people who are a little less sophisticated than wanting to run their own node or their own server from their house but they are a step up from normal users where they're interested in using new technology and so i'm just going to put it out there anyone who builds a chat app we that that uh that passes in this competition could basically pass fail uh we will put it into our uh front end application on unstoppable so you will guaranteed have ten thousand plus people it's actually closer to forty thousand plus people email blasted um on our side about using this chat application uh and you know we're assuming that file coin comes out in august this year so we're looking at doing that push very shortly after you know people are like what are people gonna use you know file coin for why do i need a p2p uh server um i think chat is very natural it's one of the things i use the most i have like 50 different places where i'm messaging right now it's annoying i'd like to have one i want to be able to save my chats for forever i don't want to have to lose them uh it's a it's a surefire use case for um for p2p storage uh the other cool thing it's tiny right which is a huge advantage for end users because it's text i'm we already have people looking at video and we've actually done some work on that as well but if you if you have a pure text messaging app that covers 80 you know it's the 80 20 rule of the use case and you could have users storing their data and it would only cost them you know a few dollars or maybe even less for a whole year because texas is just so tiny so um yeah i think that's it on business overview i'm gonna take a look and see if there's any uh any questions here and i don't think there are yet cool all right so if someone has questions submit them in the chat we'll find them um let's see if there's anything else we want to talk about uh i mean that's really it guys you check out the uh check out the docs for threads tv on chat um also orbit db is another option for for storing these things and get to hacking i'll take a pause here for a second and then i'll see who else on my team is in this thing if they wanted to present anything specific otherwise we're here for you to help you uh answer questions on the hackathon yeah if anybody wants to chat karate is it you yeah go ahead you guys are gonna get sick of hearing me mass it's like day one not yet so no i was gonna say if you could demo like so i'm going to be onboarding my users and my application will basically i do you have you have a javascript library that i can install in my app and and put in there so that they can search the domains on your api and then it can integrate with metamask and then purchase a domain from you so like say if my my new portal app right allows people to push this decentralized you know subscription blog and then i want to start selling them for example on my platform i'm calling it a platform it's not yet but is there an api way i could use your javascript to search your crypto or whatever domains you have and then use metamask so that they can this is them sorry this is me pushing my wallet i always do this um and that's uh yeah it's weird i know but like is there a way i can do that yes so and we actually have it even easier than that if you would like so we actually have a resellers api uh for the domain name so you can actually hit an api endpoint uh and it's at docs.unstoppabledomains.com johnny on this call here if he's still hanging around is actually the person who you'd be working with to get that integrated and uh the way that it works on our smart contracts on the blockchain is we have we have a permissioned mentor and the reason why we built it this way is it makes it way easier for uh resellers right because now you don't have to you don't have to you can actually just hit our endpoint and you can do things like take fiat payment right which would allow you so you have more options for purchase instead of just metamask like you're saying press the meta mask button thank you guys yeah it's my hardware wallet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but but i'm saying like um you can offer additional payment options instead of just metamask which is which could be very helpful there's also of course methods here for you to check domain availability um and you know we'll lock them and all those other kind of things while the transaction is complete uh to make sure that users get them and we already have a reseller integration uh set up with myetherwallet um which is live and uh i'm the wrong person to demo this because uh because uh let's see if i can connect here boom boom you connect if you give me your seed phrase i'll be happy to demo it for yeah yeah yeah yeah well i'm not i'm not set up to demo here but i promise you we're inside of my ether wallet when you sign in i don't want to like connect and drop a password across the entire internet right here but uh it's yeah it's there so we we have a reseller already set up with new um it's in our docs and so you can totally do that with domain names and uh my ether wallet even went a step further where you could buy a domain name there and then also deploy a website so they actually did like they did the whole thing um on their side so they've got a cool setup and my ether wallet is going to be implementing chat so and right now we have a single chat yeah yeah we have a single we have a single chat protocol on there right now but whoever builds one for this it'll also be a chat option on my ether wallet so i think that like we have you know it's pretty interesting right now uh what you can do we're really trying to help people get the centralized tech into all the partners that we work with thank you very much yep no worries cool i'll see if there's anything else i can mosey around with here since we're on these office hours hey go ahead nestor hello uh hello i i want i would like to ask about i was asking that on the discord channel what about the selection what about um if you want to deploy a block in in in but you want to have kind of like an api json api in order to consume all the costs that you have done and use them in could be a react native application how can we do that so uh we actually the best person to talk to about that is actually don stultz so if don if you're still on the call we'll um we'll unmute you yeah we see you dawn's on here from and uh don actually built a blogging tool on um as part of one of the uh examples that we have so don if you don't mind doing a little uh talk about the blog that you built and then maybe even demo it because when you have the blog tool you have to store posts right and then users also comment which we're working on enabling and i think don actually already has the full request for comments on that as well um and they built that through three box so uh don are you available to chat yeah uh yeah so i didn't quite catch the question um but yeah yeah go ahead and get go ahead and get set up to demo the blog so you can share your screen and show people what that looks like he uh he's basically just asking i want to store content and then i want to be able to update that content and and so the blog is a good demo because you have one blog post and then you have two and then there's also comments um and i believe you use three blocks to do that but i'll let you take them through it yeah and actually it was about also how can you consume the all the posts in a react native application for instance yes and you're worried about just so if you will have you know your your block on a browser but also you will have also like a json api just to consume that in a real native application like in our like an rss feed yeah yeah yeah okay don are you still with us yeah okay so if i'm understanding this right like pretty much just want to access just call like the three box rest api would be would be pretty much what you needed um that's what we're using for the vlog we're using their messaging and we're just storing each post as basically a separate message that's yeah let me see if i can share my screen here and provide a little more uh context here so let me know if you can let me know if you can see the screen cool excellent uh and then don let's talk about how a person actually goes through the deploy on our website so uh don if i'm going to my domain and then oops this is fine um with the code and stuff online if you want make sure that screen yeah that's much better you go ahead yeah so here's our blog i just have it running locally um but it runs the same way ever all that uses yeah so you just sign in using the regular web3 metamask and everything's already set up from a config file and the config file is just stored on the this has most of the information that would be static and i'll react that and basically all that it needs to be more dynamic is the address um to find it uh with three box and orbit bb um and then like i was already saying each post is basically a separate message and a separate and using three boxes messaging api um so yeah it's just ads and posts um using their api which is really very simple um like for adding a post all i have to do is parse it into a string and then just call add post um yeah red dot post so yeah three box was the easiest way to get a blog quickly up and running um yeah all right and then uh how did you tie the 3d 3d box id to the blockchain domain name because that may be a question that they also have that's also pretty easy yeah um so basically the wallet's just the same there's not any field in the domain that um comes from three box like on your domain name all you would store is the ipfs hash for this website um and then from our website when you set up a blog it automatically like adds the uh admin wallet as the owner of the domain um so that's the connection right there that in the ipfs hash yeah so just sharing a wallet and then with three box it automatically sets up your profile when you sign in with a crypto wallet cool all right excellent um i hope that was useful i we haven't done a lot of exploring of um how to like just uh digest messages into i should rephrase that we actually just started looking at digesting messages uh sorry like some sort of doing like rss feeds so i don't have an update on on that but if we're looking particular our blog you can see that we're just using three box and they do have an api endpoint to grab all those messages that you're looking for there's a couple of questions here i'm going to answer them real quick so one is from darren he's like can domains be reserved with chinese characters the answer is not right now we actually had a few reserved as chinese characters earlier we decided to pause registration of chinese characters domains at this point in time just to prevent confusion in wallets like it's a lot more uh parse trickery yeah so there's uh because there's a way that people could get a name that looks very close to another one but they do support puny code so we are able to do that at some point in the future there's another question here how will east 2.0 impact on software domains so i will say it is undetermined at this time uh the size of the impact of youtube pack 2.0 on software domains it is going to allow us to do many more transactions so when we're looking at the future of blockchain domain names you have to decide are you going to be on the you know layer one or eventually do you need to roll up and be on layer two um we're gonna see how east 2.0 rolls out and then take a look at transaction throughput if you work with ethereum a lot you'll know recently there's been really high gas prices on there it's not really a problem for domain names because you're only updating those records you know a few times a year or maybe once a month it's not like uh like sending a stablecoin or something where you're literally it's being turned over three four times a day in some cases um and those people are much more likely to move to layer two first uh so we'll sit happily on layer one and then in terms of what it looks like when it started we actually have experience with that already because we built another naming system on silica prior to this and you just split the state so we're looking forward to eat 2.0 we are in a weight wait and see mode because we don't want to make too many major updates to the underlying protocol while e 2.0 is still kind of pending um but i'm the developers are pretty reasonable over there uh we'll be able to make any transition that needs to be made and i think that if anything is just going to make transaction costs a lot cheaper uh for everybody and increase the utility so with the sooner the better and of course we don't want it any sooner than it's ready so yeah that's it is the is there a service similar to ethon link it's another question yes i think it's called dot hosting like d o t hosting uh dot io so if i'm wrong then uh we'll try to correct that and drop that into the slack we would like to have another one so if you are thinking about building a service similar to ethe.link then um yeah so someone just dropped one they built zil.sh so thank you that's awesome but if you're looking to build one we do have a grants program as well we run that we actually run our grants program in conjunction with a few other uh companies that also do grants so yeah definitely we want to make that easier to build since we've got all these hackers here i might as well tell them the other things that are very interesting to be built for the decentralized web uh one is an ethereum lite client so there's also going to be that's very helpful for browsers looking to resolve blockchain uh domain names so we're we're looking to help and assist uh building an ethereum like client uh along with uh you know we're hoping to work together with uh ens team on that as well and potentially others in the ethereum community so we just talked about that yesterday with them um so that's gonna be big and like obviously an ethereum like client is good for uh filecoin and everyone building decentralized websites as well because uh it's gonna make it easier to do the reads um very big browsers are concerned about the size of those types of things so that's another thing in addition to these redirect links that came to my head there cool excellent ready for the next question i don't know if we have any specifically in the chat yet unless i'm missing somebody uh cool i can actually just talk about a few things until we pop up yeah for sure yeah you can talk and then if anybody has just open discussion about unstoppable or questions they had um it doesn't have to be a specific technical question yeah and you can also just uh hit tell me to stop talking if i miss it in chat because i may miss it so feel free to interrupt me something here on the website building and i actually we forgot to post this earlier but this is actually a repo for decentralized websites and you'll see don is on here and we've had several other contributors as well you can actually see several example templates here and we'll see here don where where can i see these oh there they are and uh all of these temp so this is completely an open source repo these are actually end up inside of our web app itself so again if you submit a template through us then we can distribute it to our users as long as that's what you would like us to do and there's like a correspondence here between this github repo i think here's the ambitious right and then you can see here's ambitious on our website here and so this is a good place if you're looking to build websites uh you can go through here and you can see uh several different examples and then i believe the blog and this may be useful um for people who are interested in and connecting in with yeah with three bucks so here's the uh here's the blog example on here as well that you can take a look at and um let's see going here what's interesting yep here you go and this is a good little tutorial on uh three blocks so if you want to get around and play with using three blocks to uh like have a stored uh storage state for a particular user and then updating a website with that that's a good place to go and play around with so i dropped the link to that in the chat um what are people building on the decentralized web i think there's some really cool ones here that you should check out and let's see if i spelled this right so i hope this loads you know live demo yep so this is actually a cryptocurrency exchange so people are like what are people going to build on the decentralized web this is literally the front end for for dex which is pretty cool this is up on ipfs right now right and this is live and what's great about this is like again we're pre-incentivized uh storage models so this is still being penned you know via a pinning service but you know four months from now you're going to be able to deploy your decks put a bounty on the decks for file storage and then you just know that dex is going to be up there um and you can trade you can actively connect your wallet here if you'd like and trade cryptocurrency uh directly on the decentralized web and this is cool for uh dapps because if you want to build an unstoppable application and that's one of the big things behind a lot of these ethereum dapps right now if you're hosted on a com domain name they can turn you off and there's actually been some companies i can't remember if it was kyber uh that got temporarily turned off for like eight hours earlier this year because they had an issue with their uh dns uh hosting provider um but you don't want your uh adapt to be turned off by whoever is your dns custody custodian right um so especially for dapps another big thing here it's kind of a cool consideration um and i can actually this actually goes back to websites we haven't seen anyone do this yet but i expect somebody to do this uh quite soon and that is you can you can shove a domain name into an ethereum smart contract right and then a domain name can be owned by a set of token holders so let's say that you have a dow or a specific token and uh like it could even be an nft token and you guys wanted to decide as a community what your website would look like right and right now you have this problem where if you buy a website for uh your application someone is registered on that website on the you know with the custody provider so like even if you're you know maker dow or any of these other really large and important uh ethereum applications somebody owns this domain right makerdow.com and at the end of the day that person is going to be held liable for what's happening on that application and they're going to have to deal with all of that uh bs i mean frankly and it's even more worse than that because you have 200 plus countries across the world so where that person lives also matters um so our friends over at ens for example um i think that they're pretty smart because they have i think they have the ownership of this in a non-profit in switzerland right but not everybody is going to be able to start a nonprofit in switzerland in order to have good jurisdiction for what it is that uh what it is that they're building um and like nick from the team even moved to new zealand which is probably one of the best places to be if you care about uh freedom on this planet um so like you know but not everyone can afford to make all those moves however everyone can put their website up on the decentralized web and it's super easy you just get a blockchain domain name and then point it to your application and again the ownership of that domain name could be the smart contract so we haven't seen anyone do yet do that yet but i think that's pretty cool you just spin up a smart contract with uh you know like make up a token right make up the new rc20 token and give it to yourself and then um one that i would like to see is uh you know get something up like which vitalik right dot crypto um and you can and then people can log in and then they can vote on which picture of vitalik they would want to show up on that website so that's not actually available i mean sorry that's not actually a domain now but i'm saying that you can have your token holders vote on what the front end is and another way of thinking about this is if you're maker dao and you have an application and you want to make an update to your front end you instead of having one person whose assistant man you know push the new website you could have a lot of people submit new versions of the front end to the website and then you could have people vote on it they vote on it they literally vote on everything else except for their front end and we're saying that let's also move this back so that token holders have more control over these decentralized applications that they're building so i'm going to pause there for a second see if that spurred some questions uh and we'll take it from there cool all right so uh all right so this one is from ryan bell and he says i'm most curious about the passing of messages from the p2p backend to the web client front end how does that work so let's see if we still have james on here uh and he may have jumped james uh do you feel comfortable trying to answer this question he's talking about and like i know we're using gun db on our uh on our chat example but i think it's still going to apply if someone's using threads james let us know if you can if you can talk hello we got you hey hey yeah i think i already um uh i already got my uh uh um uh answered um in the um uh thread there for ryan there um but yeah we would you use uh i'm a gun db to do all the um uh the um peer-to-peer stuff and uh please check out the um uh you know um uh library that we did build um at uh i sent the link there github very cool thank you got it excellent and then uh yeah also i'm gonna pass that back to carson if you don't mind so carson do you have a do you have a and you know the question is is um about the passing of the messages from the pdp backend to the web client on the front end you have any thoughts on how someone might do that using threads or what to be concerned about there if carson's here i just dropped it on him oh there we go cool i think i was muted for a sec um uh i'm most curious about the passing of the messages uh right so well with threads um we use websockets um as the like transport layer actually that's not entirely true we use a bunch of different transport mechanisms because our philosophy is probably something's not going to work so why don't you try and get everything to work and so um we use like lib p2p pub sub as one transport mechanism um and there's a like custom protocol that's run over the p2p we use websockets for the direct push and pull which is pretty cool um and actually okay this is pretty cool so what we do is um we have grpc um like services that run on the like remote peers and um then from the client it basically uses or doesn't basically uses grpc web calls which are really just like a translation of grpc like web 2 to web 1.1 like streams and so the client can call grpc um methods on the remote their remote backend peer-to-peer peers and so they can say like hey pull like give me the latest head or i've just made a change push here's the latest thing and the cool thing about using websockets as the transport layer there is you can actually do like bi-die communication and um so before you actually do any of the exchange of data you can actually like we have implemented um like a handshake so you can say like i'm so-and-so and i can prove that i have the private key for this particular um identity and all that good stuff and we we use uh websockets for that i think that's like for a lot of nice uh like buy dye stuff the web websockets is good but yeah our philosophy is basically you should have like as many possible routes between those two piers as possible um and so the pub sub is also nice because that gives you like proxy routing and things like that and it's a gossip pub so you can gossip message and then for those websockets is that just like an express server are you doing that with uh golang or something like that it's go the back end ones are go and then the front end is uh yeah like just a grpc uh client thing cool i'll check that out and honestly that like that that's great and it's cool and the back end stuff is cool um but we're also working on directly calling grpc methods between lib p2p peers which sounds like impossible and magic but we have some examples where like a browser peer is basically calling grpc methods on another browser which is just like amazingly cool so you can start to like really get direct peer-to-peer communication across any channel that live p2p supports and this is not even pie in the sky this is like stuff that works but it's like gonna take some time before it's really proper and safe and scalable but yeah there's some really cool stuff happening in this space ryan did you get all your answers there yeah i got it yeah documentation yeah yeah i'll just just want to make sure you got at least pointed the right direction i don't have to chew on now perfect uh yeah you got to be careful would you ask me because i'll just start getting excited carson's definitely the right the right guy to ask so glad he could be on here we've got like five minutes left here so we had one other question i wanted and i'll answer this one here and then we had a comment so the question is is there a concept of name server for an unsolvable domain and could i point to my own name server so uh right now people are reading from ethereum and all the uh lookup data automatic uh the mappings are stored directly um on ethereum now you're probably thinking to yourself that's incredibly slow and i would respond with you are correct because the name server's response time is you know uh 10 milliseconds and an ethereum lookup uh i think is closer to a second so we're doing some improvements on chain so that we'll have a you know that we think we can cut the look up time in half essentially um and we're going to keep looking and see if we can find some more ways i think that it's possible people will stand up name servers to make the lookups faster but then again the users are going to have to decide you know who they want to trust and i think that if someone like rave or cloudflare stood up a name server and that's actually not unlikely that people would trust you know cloud player basically i think people would trust them to to do it at least to some extent but at the end of the day you're always going to be able to read directly from ethereum blockchain that brings us back to the comment about the um light node for ethereum right the light client rather and i think that like that's going to be important because if you have a like client for ethereum particularly if you had one that was optimized to do domain name lookups right to run in the browser then you'd actually just be reading directly from chain and when we get to es 2.0 and there's a bunch of shards um and you know which chart you're looking at you know what contract you're looking at uh we can get that size down you know one it can be one ten thousandths the size of the main chain and still be up to date and checkpoint and everything uh and yeah i think that's i think it's more likely we had that direction uh in the interim though i think people will stand up those name servers uh next one is from karate there's actually two here uh first he had a comment about usdt being blacklisted just want to say yes that was crazy so uh what an interesting day we live in also usdc today uh it's been pretty active um so the censorship is uh running rampant at this point even in crypto and next one is uh again from karate it's like do you have anything in graph i'm assuming you're talking about the graph dot io and uh we have just not gotten to it but yeah we have talked that team um we are looking to put something up there their api can't uh is not like super uh it's being improved right so there's like a query limit there you actually see a few weeks back that um both three box and then subsequently the graph uh went down for a little bit and that's because we launched the blog and then we had a bunch of users using the blogs on on ipfs and then they're making a bunch of updates to all their posts this was getting routed through three bucks which then relied on the graph and they both crashed so so um so both of these services like we have demand right now for people to check out the d web this is a champagne problem um so we're we're gonna revisit the graph probably in two months and get something up there once we have a little more time for those things to get a little more stable yeah it is like 1998 again cool all right guys i think that's it that's our time here uh trent or andrew did you want to do the outro i mean there's not much to outro i think you we got a ton of good questions um and people will see us in slack they know where to where to find everybody in the unstoppable domains channel and elsewhere so thank you guys for answering these questions thanks thanks everyone for attending and special shout out to carson uh thanks for being here later everyone
