[Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of each global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to metabolism finale we are about to wrap up this event and you're all joining us on eatglobal.tv so for those of you joining us for the first time this is the place we're going to be using for all of this event as well as the rest of the demos we're going to talk about all things that came out of it and also answer any questions if you have them for for us and also um for anybody who's joining in and participating we'll be giving out nfc co-apps for being part of this event so let's get this started metabolism is a neat global event uh what does that mean this means this is part of our an event that's part of our mission to bring on more developers and creators into the web3 ecosystem and we are doing this thing by running summits and a hackathon for the past kind of six days so for the summit piece we actually ran two summits over the last six days it was a technical assignment covering everything that's happening in the zoro ecosystem which was on the 4th of august and then we had our creative summit that was yesterday on the 9th of august talking about all the incredible things happening in this ecosystem and from there we are coming back to the hackathon which has been an incredible event for us we had 441 hackers from 65 different countries and 16 different times participating these are all the places people came from to participate the events and over the past few days they worked on really incredible and creative projects and all in all we got to see so many creative things in in addition we had 28 ecosystem partners as well and 55 ecosystem mentors that were here to help everybody get unblocked and just get the right help that they need and we're giving away a hundred thousand dollars in prizes so we're gonna talk about all that stuff uh over the next hour or so and go into details of who and what where some of our amazing partners are and everything that came out of this it blew our minds when we saw the number of submissions we have 106 submissions that came on sunday from 400 people building on top of zora and um before we kind of go into uh all the teams and everything that came from the judging process i want to quickly thank some of our amazing partners who are not only giving away some prizes but also were vital to making sure that they've been successful so i'm going to quickly thank zora for making this event a really amazing event by being our incredible partner one thing live here at nfd dot storage polygon and lit protocol and then spin amp artifact juice box refraction made that fun african nfc community sound obsessed developer dao i also want to thank oops i missed a slide maybe i missed two slides so no g float alt anchor in our pegi and thank you so much for being our incredible partners all right so let's go into this 106 submissions so 106 teams submitted projects on sunday on monday two days ago we went through an incredible judging process and from there we got to come up with a list of eight incredible teams that we're calling our final list and we're going to be bringing on today to demo what they built and and showcase some of the interesting things that our judges found from this event so without further ado these are our eight incredible finalists i want to congratulate pearl releases club mixtape zoro land d census rex and ashtrayam they are going to be bringing uh they're going to be coming on and sharing what they built they're gonna get five minutes to demo everything that came out of this uh weekends in the past four days worth of work for them and uh and after that we're going to cover all the prices but before i go into our very first demo i want to quickly take a second and thank all of these incredible teams just because you were not one of these eight uh projects listed before it does not mean you are not good enough i'm gonna make sure that this event is a way for you to get into this space really understand um what is happening and how do you actually take a more active role in anywhere from being a better developer or a creator or just being more aligned to integrated into this ecosystem so please we encourage all of you to continue working on these projects and paying us or any of our partners for any help that you need we're there to support you and really make sure that you have all the resources and help you need to be successful so thank you again to all of you for 100 teams here and i really hope to uh to see you again at a future event and being more active in this ecosystem and for those of you who are wondering how do i learn more about these teams you can head over to ethglobalt.com showcase and see every single project that came out of it including our finalists and you'll be able to look at that right now and see in a lot of detail what they built and how they built it and everything else around it including links to the live demos all right enough talking for me uh let's go jump into our very first demo and without further ado like to bring on project pearl um we'll come on and start with the demo so please uh welcome the team on stage take it away so hi um my name is celeste and i'm going to tell you about pearl so pearl is a design platform where type designers designers and the design community can create discover and sell designs and typeface so with pearl we want to onboard the creative ecosystem on chain from designing to showcasing assets while bringing back value to other designers so today like in other creative industries the value of the creative work is decreased by how the market function so we have big resellers that take a huge amount of fees on every sale we have type designers losing ownership on what they create their resources is there is still a lot of font writing today and from the graphic designer perspective it can be difficult to identify and sort the fonts so you will have a volunteer the community facebook group websites where people share information about fox and share the proper link to buy it so this is like the landscape today sorry and uh what we want to do with pearl is to is to bring all of this creative cycle uh within our website so type designer will create sell their phone license as an nft graphic designer can buy it use it share it and sell design all within the same place so both party keep ownership they set their own rules and they can find inspiration and showcase their work source type front-end designs or within pers gary so how does it work so we have a gallery with where you can browse by typeface or by design if there is a font that you like you can just click on it here you can find all the metadata of the font so you have the type designers you have the license type you have the number of font owners these are meta that are from the nfc you can also see all the designs that use the font and let's say i want to buy it to create my next design i can then purchase it find it in my wallet and if i own this nft it means i can download my assets on my work file i will be able to download the ttf file otf file to work with on my design when i've made my design maybe it's a template and i want to sell it so in that case i can upload it on perl and my design will be would be available for other graphic designers to see and to buy if they want to so let's say i'm another graphic designer and i want to use this design if i buy it the first designer will receive the revenue from the cell and the type designer that has this font used in this design will also receive a reality so it's a way to have all the creative history of a design and a way also to bring back the value to each party in the creation process so during the hackathon we managed to build the gallery using zera starter kits we retrieved the metadata from the nft that we uploaded on ipfs using nft storage we also managed to implement the create your phone edition for for type designer so here you can create your font you upload your specimen image you set your own price and you can just create your phone sorry i'm lagging a bit okay never mind the transaction okay so maybe you can go check by yourself we have a live demo um i really want to thank your team uh for organizing this hygiene we had a lot of fun building and we learned a lot uh thank you very much for your attention we are the we are the person all right awesome well thank you so much i know uh we went to some lag at the end but being able to sort of upload fonts and create a more complex around it is a super cool unique uh example of using asdk and just nfts in general this is this is generally cool so congratulations and i hope uh i'll get to use it um very soon all right next up we have our second demo and that is mixtape so i'll let the team come on and share their demo and make sure they use your audio hi everyone hi we're mixtape so what is mixtape bigshape is basically the centralized music platform owned by collectors artists and users so what is actually the users and can build music collection or mixtape combining music energy and music collection and with a public music library powered by spindex from uh from spin on and we can directly split the proceeds back to the artist include included in a mixtape or collection which often gated access with the lead protocol and we build a social layer with the orbeez sdk with the id standard through ceramic network we deployed on polygon to create a low gas feed to create more competitive pricing model for every music collection so so yeah let's go straight to the demo like okay here here uh you can see here's uh our like our main or our main our main page over here like uh you can you can see that that there's a music player no search button it streams music unstoppable from spindex api because we want every good music uh discovered so yeah we test [Music] so yeah it's played well so if you can see here there's a there's a the chat chat room it's actually the centralized chat so yeah i can really type something here and it will show up shortly yep but what the interesting part is everyone's here is not actually replying uh from the mixtape page but they actually kind of reply from here community channel that we create on on our business club so it's fully decentralized so other than that uh we also like like create an export page where you can like see all the featured mixtapes uh that previously made by other users and also we kind of pull all the music nfc that unlisted on the market here so basically we we pulled this data from zara's apa to showcase that the centralized marketplace is uh really possible with this so yeah so after that yeah maybe you can go back to the to limit to the main page uh if you find a music that you really like you can directly add it to your playlist but what three is actually uh about interpretable interoperability so what we really want to show you here that we can also create a playlist directly from another depth for example from a spin amp let's say let let me create a really quick play this here and i can add something to the playlist click ok and don't first imagine we can't do that on spotify though so yeah all right still okay so it's lucky so uh okay so basically a new uh playlist is already created so i can let everyone listen it for free but if i want to like create the mixtape and sell it to uh people like i just can't create pass here and maybe like put it on right the access pass so yeah just transaction so yeah it's you know really close but we can check if the transaction is processing here yeah it's still impending but while we're waiting uh another features that i really want to show you that yeah we built a personalized chat for you to engage with your community on the right side and also all the profiles like i told you before like we're building with the id standard so basically what you can really do is to like see uh like if you see here my followers and my following it's actually the same with the one on the orbits same followers same following so yeah it carried my followers across the platform so let's check about that okay the it's actually okay so if let's say i i'm uh opening another account and want to open uh like to play this ah it's token gated yeah i need to buy this so yeah i just need to buy the access pass come from the transaction so yeah what do we really want to implement that that that that uh when the cells happen so uh we really want to directly split the other proceeds all the rs included on the uh playlist but we haven't implemented that right now because there's significant challenges for us so yeah let's see if the transaction is okay it's done all right it's already open and we can play the song [Music] so yeah so what's next yeah the potential upgrade for uh for mixtape is actually you want to co-create collection or mixtape with your community to direct split revenues share for the artists from past or big step sales more personalization or post your own collection page makes it a standalone music platform and live performance feature or voice on stream on chat building a verifiable credential from music you're listening every day or activity on next mixtape so the extraordinary result from from mixtape is it's just not a music player it's a social tool where the future popular music is not only decided by the marketing strategy but on only but on by community curation creating a sizable microphone diverse music camera create another revenue stream for artists and music producers unlocking potential for band management dal our community owned music label reason to collect more music entity the center mission platform where the contents and data is really owned by the users thank you amazing well congratulations for that awesome demo we also got to see the whole token gating experience work so uh that was that was really cool um well this is this is actually awesome and this also just the ui is incredible like i hope that this becomes more of a standard i want to bring back the design theme for everything else here so uh hopefully you can see working on this thing and congrats again yeah thank you so much all right with that we are ready for our third demo and next team is desensitis so whenever you're ready let's get started hey thank you kartik all right so we're team desensus um i wanna i wanna thank you oh and congratul for making it to the finals especially my teammate takuya who actually became a dad today which is pretty insane um so we hacked an incentivized privacy protected survey generator for nft communities mainly using it protocol and sora what can you do with it well any nft user from a community can start their own survey to gain insights about it so questions like country skills time zones all these type of usual questions in sd communities can be solved by throwing out a survey and getting explicit data about the community all this becomes token gated meaning that only community members of that nft or dao can access the survey and the main incentive that people have to answer the survey is actually accessing the data from other respondents uh so you can get all these insights in exchange of your information all this is with privacy and mind so um it's all decentralized using this protocol no wallet addresses are ever stored and results are aggregated now let's do a demo so here's the landing page or the home screen where you can see your own form so we can create our own form let's call it metabolism and we can input uh our tokengating address this case is an nft that my ad my address owns an item from uh we can select with the kind of questions that we want to show so let's say we want to ask about page gender and country now a first transaction is gonna go through uh this merchant section is gonna uh check it's gonna create the mapping between the tokengating nft address and the survey it's gonna check that the survey is actually erc 721 compatible and it's also um going to make sure that me as a survey creator owns an item from the net from that nfd at least now once it goes through uh we can copy the url for the survey and we can share with other people so once they uh go to the survey uh they kind of start answering the the questions so they let's say we're like between 20 and 30 we're a female and we're from the u.s and we submit it now a second transaction is going to go through the second transaction is going to check first that the survey exists uh second let me take it here uh second that the uh responded the respondent has at least one of those items from that nfd collection that's looking gating and it's also gonna generate a verification tool that's gonna be stored on a chain so once it goes through we're gonna be able to see some the stats that we are awarded for being uh one of the participants in this case only we'll get only gonna see the distribution of me as a respondent but we have other examples i'm gonna go quickly to another wallet what i have other forms and i can show you an example of like something we run last night on our team and other people uh so this is taking a while because it's everything is unchanged so we have to accept the timings um so in this example we can see a bit more answers and the distributions and uh data from the nft that we pull from sora and this is the demo now to finish with this sorry sorry let's keep going so how how does it work well uh we use this protocol for two things one for the encryption and the other one for uh talking getting the survey uh questions and the answers um we use ceramic for the decentralized storage we have our own smart contracts to map the token gating and the encrypted survey addresses and we use sora for the metadata as i said before uh why this does it matter uh it's a real problem that we as a team discover throughout going through different ft communities uh being asked about what is the right strategy that we have to run are we diverse enough or not and how can we get more with the community uh so we that's why we're trying to tackle this set of problems and for the future work we want to deploy to mainnet we want to give incentives different incentives such as other types of tokens such as fundable tokens so basically paying people for completing surveys and we also want to do multiple table analysis multiple survey analysis and for that we will need uh some privacy uh some more advanced privacy things like secret proofs and that's everything i hope you liked it amazing well thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh it's going to be a really awesome thing to uh to be able to now get more information on what's happening in t9 communities especially with these decentralized surveys and takuya congratulations and thank you so much for staying up late hopefully uh you have a great rest of the week filled with a lot of joy so congrats thank you thank you all right with that we are ready for our fourth demo and that is project now so it's fun whenever you're ready hi i'm david from team nea and today we are going to show you our program what is nehanyi is the first to factor our identificator that means that um we know that in web3 we don't have a two-factor identificator and all we can do is to it's a login with a simple wallet so what we are trying to do is to um make an nfc login with a code using a dynamic nfc smart contract and lead protocol so let's say we are on our website and we want to let's say you have a website and you want to use naia so all you have to do is you have two options the first one is joining on our already existed smart contract with the dynamic nfts or may we can provide you your own smart contract so we already have a smart contract and this my contract is changing the key the code at every minute using our own near api and we change a six digit code each minute so let's say you want to implement this on your website okay you have to put your nfc collection while when you press update metadata you log in with your wallet and the site sees your afferent nft and we go to naia to know our website where we can we will join we will log in again with our wallet and we will receive a code that code it's from our metadata once we received it as a decrypted code it was taken in on the lead protocol api so it was we were given access with the access control function on the lead protocol api and then decrypt it afterwards we go to our website we put our nfc collection we will make it with an username we also want to implement on this website with zora so you can have a profile picture based on an nfc and when we try our code we are logging in in the site another interesting thing is the smart contract which is dynamic and any every time every minute it refreshes for every individual and you also can use only naia on your website so you don't have to use it at two factor identificator you'll use it only as the first authenticator so you won't have to use your main wallet risking your assets so you will have to use a random wallet you have with almost priceless nft so that's it our project i hope you liked it and i thank you for your attention amazing thank you so much uh being able to do web3 native two-factor codes is it's awesome and i think the best part is that the recovery code is already based into the contract so as long as you lose your private keys this kind of scales really nicely and generally like a super amazing use case for building this thing as nfts and then just being on web3 so this is really cool um congrats and i think you should really make this uh a nice standard um there's a lot of a lot of fun stuff here so congrats and with that we are ready for our next demo so without further ado like to welcome kevin from the release club whenever you're ready uh i'm so i'm kevin i'm here from release club i'm just gonna share my screen here and we'll start with the slides so release club is a meta platform for music nfts so during this hackathon we've formed an incredible team you know with very diverse background in terms of experience and skills that they bring to the table and we're super proud of that that's been the best part uh about this hackathon for me with this we've planted the seeds for an awesome open source community that's gonna support police club in the future so what it does gotta move you guys out of the way so i can see the words sorry about that with release club you gain the benefits of a curated music nft platform that you control the contracts that you create from zoro's creator toolkit our future goal is to open the path for any type of nft contract to be pushed to your platform by creating a club a group of artists can define their own platform craft a unique identity and reach their audience together so as you see here you bring your music to release club bring your own contract release together bring other artists your own platform it's pretty straightforward uh so our smart contracts act as a simple registry to put your club on chain and to make it easily discoverable by indexing on-chain data our factory contract deploys your custom club contracts and emits an event that existing indexers like spindex and new network can use to find every release club deployment on ethereum how does this allow your club to be easily discovered but this is also what makes it possible for our ui to be entirely optional it's your platform on chain when you want it so with that we'll jump into a quick demo this is our uh awesome landing page which i couldn't be happier with down here at the bottom you can find the team members and there's plenty of good information here so please check it out click here to create your first club we'll call it metabolism and we'll click create club so that's going to ask us to confirm a transaction because you're deploying a contract this takes about 10 seconds and while you're doing that you can start gathering the nft contract addresses that you want to add to your new platform all right so that's done i've got a note here with contract address we can add so we'll do that um hang on this didn't populate quite all right so i'm going to jump over to this one instead um so we're going to add that to the platform your platform and that's uh requires a small transaction and that might take about 10 seconds you can be getting the next one queued up to add to your platform and uh once that's done it'll take you to your new music nft club page on our website so that's it for the demo actually there's one more thing that's pretty pretty awesome so i mentioned our ui is optional and this is a huge a very important thing to us so you've got this over here you can just click fork it go to our github repo this is going to be open source currently is already you can just pull that down based on the zoro starter kit pull this down spin up your own ui make the changes you need and go from there so that's it for the demo so in the future we hope to finalize the mvp and prepare for mainnet and make it super easy to fork the ui for a custom experience right now all of our branding is in there so it's a little difficult work towards allowing more types of custom nfg contracts to be pushed to our club contracts collab with existing platforms and aggregators to make release club discoverable in other ways and actively engage with web3 musicians and collectives to build custom experiences utilizing release club when we get to mainnet we'll be creating a club for all of the metabolism hackers and spinamp and noom have both agreed to accept our integrations allowing your club to be indexed as a platform so when you add your music nft contracts to the metabolism club you'll be releasing them to the world together and that is where that's what puts the release in the release club so we're super excited to share that with you and that's all i've got thank you amazing thank you so much and uh it's great to see that it's soon about to hit main net with uh already a list of people that you can bring on so this is really cool uh congratulations and uh generally like the the headless nature of this thing and being able to still survive and function with that ui and that's a really good feature to pick in all right with that we are ready for our next demo and i want to bring on zorroland for as the next team so over to get started all right hello thank you all and um so right now um if you go to um zora and if you want to just explore and look at the art uh this is pretty much what you're greeted with um it's just infinite list of uh you know react cards and so today what we want to present to you is our lamb so exactly what is zora lamb um first let me introduce myself chris crawford and my teammates travis rice and silence silva kumar so zoro land is a rpg that allows users to discover available tokens and collections on zora through gaming and how it works is players like traditional games you explore the world using cursor keys or wasd keys zord tokens are discovered by colliding with these little envelopes here throughout zora land and after a token is discovered players can either view a token on zorro or men a token called a zorland token and the mint function could either just be kind of proof of participation or you cannot future work would be to be able to meant a actual sprite character that you can use in the game itself that's actually on your token um we made this using the combination of phaser js which is a 2d game engine and also using the zord to enable us to metadata from some of the zoro tokens we also support connections to polygon and rank these so in addition to providing a gamified approach to exploring we also implement a multi-chain functionality and the mint page that you'll eventually see it was powered by next.js typescript tailwind css and web3 um storage we also use hardhat and the ethers libraries to both deploy and engage with the contract so um now i will show you zoro land live um the link is live if you want to play after seeing this feel free let us know what you think so you start by pressing this [Music] and so all of these envelopes [Music] are tied to a token so let's view this token well actually there are some envelopes tied to a token and some that aren't but once you hit v it'll actually take you directly on to that so if you want to make make an offer on that token or just view the token you could so in the next example i'm going to show you how to visit the main page [Music] so now you see our mint page and i've already connected my wallet but you can see that you can choose between the polygon uh mumbai network ethereum and rank b and so in this first case let's say you found the token and you just wanted to show that hey i've played this game and i want to make the token you can go here and click the mint button and right here um basic standard transaction this is going to eventually uh give us the feedback to view it on etherscan or um in the other case of polygon mobile test work [Music] so we can also go to create and so let's just say i have a game character that i want to eventually import i can go in and open that media file which is a sprite i'm gonna just call this guys orlan og just give it a simple uh zog i'm just kind of my first land sprite and in this case i need to switch over to the polygon network and we're going to switch networks and so now we should be should be connected i can go here uh click create sprite go here and it's going to give us a confirm confirmation we can go back and go here and eventually you'll see that this transaction should have started give it a little more time let's go check over here it's my wallet you can see about one minute ago so let's connect it and next steps would be to actually add enemies and attacks in the environment to make it a little bit more challenging to explore the envelopes we also like to add a multiplayer feature and also integrate the the actual characters that you mentioned on the blockchain into the game like i said if you all want to check it out for yourselves is why uh it's live now it will be dot x y z slash ether global thank you awesome well this is a really fun game and i can't believe you did that in a short few days so i hope you can see working on this and uh that's really nice music this is this is fun doctor music uh thank you sweet welcome thank you so much and with that we have two more demos to go and then we can go into all the fun stuff which is surprisingly so without further ado i'd like to welcome brian from rex um to get started with the demo and make sure the the audio is is patched in okay hello uh web3 community thanks so much for uh dropping by all right i'd like to introduce you all to rex an on-chain music discovery and recommended recommendation platform for 3 and beyond my name's brian i'd like to introduce the rest of my team christina and gaul so why did we decide to build rex this music store for the metaverse well right now uh the problem is that web3 music there's a lot of really great artists out there putting their music on all kinds of different platforms and and different chains and sometimes it can be hard to find music you love whether it's so spread out all over the place so that's where we come in by using the zora api and the spin amp api we can aggregate all this great music together in one place and provide recommendations based on the music that you love so let me talk a bit about how we make our recommendations we use two primary functions the first is collaborative filtering this surfaces tracks that owners uh have in common if you're browsing you find a track that you like we look at all the owners of that track and see what else they love and we surface those recommendations to you we've also crawled uh both of these indexes and done a neural net content analysis on all of this mute this great music adding genre tags and associating similar songs that sound the same together so using a combination of these two types of filtering we're able to provide recommendations that we think listeners are going to love all right so let's get into a live demo here pull up the app this is our landing page let's start digging we built our ui to look you know like a record store um you can scroll here through all the different tracks right now we're browsing all let me go ahead and connect my wallet as well to get a more personalized experience oops okay hit connect okay all set so let's check out some music you can see we're now on the track details page the song's playing in our player we can scroll back and forth we really love this little animation here on the side of the record spinning here you can see that we've tagged this track with a few different tags genre and the vibe of the music you have a link to view it on the home page uh where it was minted we have our recommendations here our content-based wrecks from our neural network and then owner-based recommendations we have the list of owners down here you can favorite the track if you like it and browse more recommendations queued up to the side clicking a recommendation takes you to that track page if we have zoro market data we also display that on the track page from here you might want to see what else this owner has collected there we can go to this owner's page and we even have a page if you've connected your wallet for your own music displays the music nfts that you own in your wallet and it also displays songs that you favorited through our ui we have other features like artist search you can browse by platform uh yeah so that's our uh live demo let's get back to our future road map okay so some more features that we'd like to add number one artist tipping we think there's a huge artist uh opportunity here no music platform on the web today allows you to directly tip your an artist that you like we also want to enable playlist minting for curators and we'd like to enable them to receive tips as well why not they put in the time and effort to find all this great music show your love by sending them a little tip and both both of these can be used to improve our recommendations that's what we're really after trying to get the best recommendations possible for music fans everywhere so yeah thank you very much for watching our demo we want to thank all the great sponsors that made this possible and all of the great artists putting their music up on web3 please feel free to check out our app by following the links if you find a bug or you want to submit a feature request hit us up on github or maybe even make a pull request thanks very much awesome thanks brian this was a really cool uh demo and uh yeah just being able to see that you get to continue building this thing is going to be even even better so congrats and with that we are ready for our last and eighth demo for today so without further ado like to welcome atrium whenever you're ready all right thank you kartik hey everybody my name is shaun desalin and for this hackathon i created atrium which i call the on-chain trait economy so to start i'd love to go over the ethos and motivation behind the project you see many of our identity or pfp collections today are static meaning that the metadata of the collection is static if the metadata ever changes well it's typically random or out of the holder's control and if the holder does have control over dynamic metadata it's following some non-standard unique approach or pattern so what this means is that our identity is currently conformed to tokens instead of the other way around and i think it's not far-fetched to say that as we continue embracing digital worlds and digital relationships our identity is going to become even more important so with that we need customizability and action believes that the key to customizability is composability so i'd love to switch over to sigma really quick and illustrate how that might work so azure proposes something called the attribute nft paradigm and what it's saying is that we have a parent nft and attribute nfts and the properties or attributes of the parent nft is nothing more than a composition of the attribute nfts so what we're looking at here is a noun made up of four attributes and because these attribute nfts are nfts they can be bought sold and traded as you might expect so atrium simply facilitates the exchange of these attribute nfts as an example here let's say you know i grow tired of the chameleon head it's not my favorite and i identify much more with the bell well by let's say purchasing the bell attribute nft that would automatically and reactively update the artwork of the parent nft because they're held together under the same wallet address all right cool so let's do a quick demo of the marketplace to see how this works so we were just looking at nouns and for this hackathon i taylor made the marketplace just announced so what's really cool is that we're using the zora sdk or zdk to pull in the metadata information about the nouns collection on ethereum and it's cool because while i was making this project because nouns increased the supply every single day i've been watching these items grow as well and i'm also using the zdk to pull in all the attribute types that populates this this select here however for this hackathon i just focused on one particular property or attribute and that is the body which we can see here so we have three different body traits that we can buy or attribute nfts and the nft metadata is uploaded to ipfs using nft storage and these nfts themselves are being hosted on polygon mumbai now let's say i really like the teal light body here i think it's going to work well with my sample now that we were looking at i can go ahead and interact with the zora v3 api specifically the v 1.1 asks module and while that's working here pull this down and we can illustrate what's happening here so we are saying hey you know i don't want this body anymore i would like to replace it with this one right here and by doing so this would automatically update the metadata and the artwork of this uh of this parent nft using on-chain svg rendering all right now let's say you know i grow tired the teal it's actually my most hated color and i'd like to sell it well ashram supports both buying and selling so i can go ahead here select this body teal that i just bought i can set whatever price i'd like i'll set my address to collect all the funds of the sale you can also specify finders feed and after we confirm this transaction to create the ask via the xor asks module we'll see some confetti congratulations on your listing so that's the demo for atrium i think in conclusion atrium enables users to customize their identities specifically though their erc721 pfps with that customization uh we can now have our tokens represent our identities as opposed to the other way around which is the current current standard and lastly i think the future steps the immediate next step would be to create some kind of smart contract standard perhaps an erc721 extension that specifies the relationship between a parent nft and the attribute nfts which is something that i'd love to work on so if this project excites you in any way definitely reach out and thanks so much for your time awesome thank you so much and thanks also for being our last amazing final demo um this is great hopefully uh we'll get to a world where we can hot swap design and different attributes this way it doesn't have to be nfts there's so many different ways you can think about this thing including fonts from early on you can have different font sizes too or our weights but uh this is great congrats and uh thank you for all the finalists for doing amazing demos so with that we are ready to move on to all the exciting stuff which is talking about all the prizes that everybody's wanting so
