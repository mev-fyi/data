stop stop [Music] India is an amazing massive country one of the largest economies it is one of the most builder-oriented countries developer-oriented countries in the world has it's like second in most startups in the world and so because of that India has an enormous role to play in developing and building web 3 both um in Building Systems and networks and products for people in India and for people in the rest of the world [Music] it's so big and you know it's heartwarming because you know with depth folio and polygon like we have done it together like for the multiple years even when kovit was there doing all these monthly hackathons I think all of those work yeah you know and now there's an in-person hackathon and I think how many registrations were there how we got 20 000 applications like you know I think that that that is actually that like I keep saying that the number of developers in India the population of developers in India number of developers is bigger than the population of many European countries actually so you know so many developers and I think India is waking up to the three there is much more coming grants program I'm super excited because the ecosystem is growing and developers have finally something to look forward to really build their focus the if Global Community I find to be very open very collaborative very passionate I feel here is like people are very enthusiastic and I'm also to have a great drive like people really coming here and I want to do great stuff and want to hack they're very motivated so that's great I think it's a very positive energy foreign to make these new Solutions out there getting to learn new things and uh it's crazy out there like I haven't expected this thing in spite of the Beer Market that you are saying right now uh so quite quite excited I think the builders this is like not impacted I think the energy is really great here even I've heard that around like 23 000 developers have applied for eth India that's that's a huge number I've never seen this in any hackathon then I got introduced to devfolio where I checked out that hey there's this hackathon and there's this new technology called Matic where if you build on it you get some like super good prizes and uh yeah that was my entry to F3 and haven't looked back since yeah my favorite part of the equal minute is that they don't do conferences that they do hackathons because that's like part of ethereum culture it's part of what like we we do to bring ethereum to the world um the reason I believe that ethereum has done well is because Builders developers everyone who comes to these hackathons starts building and just pushes out really cool stuff the people that have met here they've all been very very friendly very welcoming uh one thing that I've noticed about the traditional Tech space and the three is people are not judgmental we can just ask any dumb question we basic conflict don't worry about it so be open uh we put yourself out there uh yeah you'll be fine experiment a lot like don't be afraid to go up to all of the booths that are here meet with Partners go to networking and like mixer side events to make sure that you know who's here and what kind of bounties they have and I think it's like super important to have a good team so that's another like advice don't be closed off have fun find a good team and then start I love the energy like I love talking to hackers again as I said we started from here so this just feels like foam besides we love meeting people who we met in protocols make new friends and meet old ones so yeah [Music] rocks [Applause] [Music]
