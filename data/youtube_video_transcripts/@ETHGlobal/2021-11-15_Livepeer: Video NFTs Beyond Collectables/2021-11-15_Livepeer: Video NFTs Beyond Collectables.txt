all right cool let's start welcome everyone um happy monday or tuesday depending on where you are in the world um hope you guys are all having a great day so far uh we have eric from live pier here to do an amazing workshop on video nfts beyond collectibles and with that being said i'll pass the mic off to eric for his presentation thank you anna uh hello everybody uh i am eric i'm the co-founder and cto at live beer uh really excited to be doing this uh this workshop with you all um i today i wanna talk about um video nfts beyond collectibles just to kind of set the ground um the context a little bit right i think today we all very much know nfts as this form of collectibles so people you know you can buy nfts you can trade them um different nfts have different like values and collectible values um and i think that's a really great way for the mainstream to be exposed to the nft movement and also to blockchains in general right and and it has had huge value for our whole ecosystem and this whole blockchain industry in that it just introduced so many more people um to to blockchain concepts um but um being a technologist i'm also really excited to to start thinking about what's available beyond collectibles especially for something like video where this media format is so rich that has potential to be interactive has the potential to like do really really engaging and deep storytelling and be used as tools for all kinds of interesting purposes so i want to start sharing some of these ideas and and start sharing how you can potentially use life here to bring some of these ideas into reality um okay so uh to dive into uh my my presentation a little bit um my um so to to introduce life here right live here is the video streaming layer for web3 uh and and the reason we built we built life here is because you know we have kind of the video storage layer for web3 like falcoin right we have the smart contract layer uh for up three like um you know ethereum um and but but um in order for the web3 ecosystem to really uh become mainstream there needs to be a video streaming layer and that's because video is about 80 of all the traffic on the internet today right and and missing that important layer is really going to kind of stall the adoption for the blockchain and web3 ecosystem as a whole um if you have built any kind of video streaming applications in depth you realize that the having infrastructure for streaming video is really really crucial in order for video streaming experiences to work well right so for example um youtube which um which is owned by google it's by far the largest infrastructure consumer inside the google uh ecosystem and and that's precisely because there is this large need for infrastructure um for to to serve video uh applications well and this is what life here is building right live pair wants uh life here is building the the video streaming layer for web 3. so what does that really mean uh it means um for we're looking at the live streaming use case here uh it means that a broadcaster can send a video into the live peer network uh and the network will do all the infrastructural work so that it can be these videos can be streamed to the end and users devices whether it's you know a computer in the browser or it's a mobile phone or it's a smart tv wherever they are right and and this network essentially replaces the centralized infrastructure that was uh that's needed today in order to build a video application so um a little bit about life here you can go to the explorer to check out um to check it out um life here is formed of many nodes uh we call these nodes orchestrators they bring uh capacity onto the network uh and they um and at the top here you see you know the number of minutes per week that's being streamed on the live here network uh here we see about um 200 2.2 million minutes of video being streamed into the live year network per week right now let's um so let's let's jump and talk a little bit about the the video nfts use case today as collectible right so what does that mean uh it means um you know video nfts are created using the erc2721 standards and how it works is that there is a token url that you can specify in your smart contract that points to an external um external location that specifies the the metadata for this video uh for this video in a t right so for example if we go here um which is a nifty gateway um in uh nft you will see that you know this is this is the video this is the video and you know the the nft itself you can see that um it is uh an mp4 file uh that's uh that is being streamed uh over here and the mp4 and the mp4 file kind of lives here right and that is um that is part of the um that is part of the specification in the erc 721 standard um so so that's basically how it works right you create an erc2721 token you specify this token url to point to an mp4 file that you know can live on ipfs for example and then any application that wants to show that an ft will just go there and load the video and then people can trade that video around and it's public by default um so what about video use cases that are beyond collectibles uh well so let's take first take a look at um video in in web 3 and how how that's how that's transforming right what we see here is there's a big trend that's happening which is the creator economy is migrating to web3 right so the creator economy uh is this um ecosystem that any creator can create video and post them on these existing video platforms and make revenue from that right so you know if you are a youtube creator you post videos on youtube twitch streamers instagram right all of these different um large social applications uh are being built this way uh what we see what we see today is that a lot of these um creators are kind of getting fed up by these big platforms taking the lion's share of the profit and that they're starting to move to web 3 ecosystems in order to get better uh opportunities right so we're seeing uh these new platforms popping up like uh the native nft trading platforms like openco zora but we also see interesting consumer applications like glass.xyz or audios right and all of these applications are built on top of web3 infrastructure right filecoin r weave the graph livepier are also some some examples of that and you know in this web in this web 3 world creators own the content they own the audience um they're simple and transparent payment payment methods uh and they're built on web3 infrastructure in the long term they're going to be a lot more scalable than web 2 applications simply because they are they're not built on centralized infrastructures and and anybody can from the world can participate uh in this economic game right so so you know this is kind of the the overall ecosystem let's go in and and think about how does nft fit in fit in the fit in this way right like how what do nfts actually represent well here are some examples one nft can represent tickets right so instead of a collectible item you can mint an nft that represents a ticket for an event so uh here we have actually the the ticket for the nft.nyc event which just happened a couple weeks ago so you can buy an nft and and use that um as to gain access to a physical event or to a virtual event uh another thing nfts can represent memberships uh what we see here is you know one of the most popular nft communities out there uh the board abe yacht club right so if you own a board ape not only do you do you gain access into the different events that the board aid community is hosting the important thing is that if you bought if you own a board ape you belong to this community you are a member of the board of community and all kinds of experiences can be built around the broad af community in order to serve these um the board ape community members and finally nfts can represent royalties right so here is a variable a variable interface when we're minting an nft and here i can specify royalty of 30 percent uh when i'm mint nft which means any the nft is traded uh and it's it the ownership transacts um 30 of that transaction value is going to go towards the original creator of the nft right and that's a really really powerful concept because today in the in the entertainment industry in the creators world it's really it's it's closely impossible to track all of the royalties that happen uh in all the transactions here this the smart contract just encodes that and it becomes uh it becomes reinforced forever now um with some of these concepts let's think about you know what can we build with nft uh video nfts um one simple example right you can build token gated live streaming applications so what does that mean it means you can either use erc20 tokens or erc721 nfts or erc721 tokens or you know 1151 whatever standard you want to use to represent access to a specific live stream and and you know here's this is basically saying that if you own a token or if you own above a certain amount of a token then you can watch your live stream otherwise you cannot watch live stream why is this interesting and why is this powerful well imagine um you can start to build you can start to create live streams that are specific for an audience that the audience need access to right you can for example um as the organizer of adao you can create a live stream that's only specifically to the dao and only dao members can access that live stream or as a member of board apes you can watch a special concert that's put on a uh by an artist that um you know only if you own the board ape can you can you watch that right this this becomes a really interesting enabler to create value on top of these um on top of nft ownership another interesting thing um we're seeing is the metaverse is emerging right not only the the the meta at facebook but also decentralized meta verses we're seeing the central land we're seeing sandbox we're seeing crypto voxels we're seeing lots of new metaverses emerging in this decentralized world and video streaming becomes a really interesting tool for us to tie the virtual world with the physical world and we're starting to see concerts happening inside these virtual these virtual environments where people are streaming those concerts from the virtual environments out into the physical environments on onto the big screens and vice versa people are streaming dj sets from the real world in into the big screens in the metaphors right so just tying together um tying together these two worlds start to create really really interesting experiences and of course video streaming in and out of the metaverse you need infrastructure to do that and live peer is here as a tool for you to do that and and finally here is here's something that we haven't talked about as much another idea which is really around um machine learning capabilities so um something that some uh something that we don't talk a lot about at life here but is a really interesting capability is that life here actually in not only enables video streaming and transcoding it also enables um machine learning tasks that that gets done on top of the video so for example uh when you're streaming video through the live peer network the network can actually also do things like content detection to help you figure out you know what kind of video is being streamed imagine if you're building um if you're building a live streaming platform that's decentralized you want to make sure that certain questionable questionable content um are not streamed on your on your platform if you want to right and so having these types of mechanism can really help the application developers to to figure things out to figure that stuff out um and and so content recognition is just one type of machine learning capability that you can do on life here and since life here is open source platform there's actually a lot of different possibilities in terms of what the type of machine learning tasks that can be done and we're looking to work with developers to add things like object detection at things like face swapping add things like creating synthetic objects inside the video making videos super interactive so all of that is you know a super interesting area that um i'd love to see hackers working on i want to briefly introduce the uh prizes for live pier um this time at web3 web 3 gem there's a total prize pool of eight thousand dollars split across three different places the first place is four thousand second place is two thousand and the third place is a thousand and there's a price pool uh that everybody can share for and for anyone who has implemented a a live peer integration that's a complete end-to-end integration and in a working demo there's there are lots of tools and resources for hackers so we have an example token gated live streaming application that you know i'm going to walk you through in a little bit there is an in-browser broadcasting sdk that one of our engineers built so that you know you can you can have a user open up a browser use their webcam to do a broadcasting session without needing to download like a piece of special software for broadcasting the content there is a web-based example built in next.js that just illustrates how to interact with the hosted life pure gateway how to build how to build kind of a video streaming experience from that and there's the mobile demo experience mobile demo application built using react native that you know can be compiled into ios and android that kind of shows off the same similar capability where you can broadcast from a phone and you can also watch a broadcast from a phone so i definitely recommend you to check them out they're all in the livestream github and and of course there is the getting started guide at lifehere.com which is the hosted life pure uh gateway into the lifetime network um you should you should definitely go check it out um any web3 jam hackers can get some free credits on the on the gateway so you just sign up for a free account let us know and you can you can start using that gateway for free and and build your hacks and finally we'll have lots of support for you um it will be hanging out in the if online uh discord um live life care channel and our engineers will be there i will be there uh we'll we'll be there to you know help you answer any technical questions about life here but also to talk to you about about your hack and if you have any you know if you have any feedback uh anything like that we're happy to to have those chats all right so we have about 10 minutes left how are we doing on like questions is there any questions we do have a question in the chat eric okay so um the question is if i have a video hosted on ipfs is there a way to pass that cid through live peer to output for the transcoding uh through live peer to output for the transcoding capabilities our video is not live streamed thus not an rtmp input correct you might have already mentioned it but another pass would be much appreciated yeah that's that's a that's a great question so so it's really about kind of if you have a video file already and you want to transcode that video file or can you do that with livegear absolutely you can and we're making that easier as we're building tools to do that currently what you can do is you can actually just stream that video into live pier and turn on the recording recording feature and the transcoding will be recorded and you will get kind of a transcoded version out and then you can you can stream that cool um so okay so let me let me give a quick demo for the token gated live streaming example um here is oh here was the uh the last thing here here here's what this looks like right it's a very simple application um and what this is saying is we're looking at a nft that actually i purchased a couple days ago uh and and we're saying that if you have the nft then you can access a live stream that i'm doing and if you don't have an nft then you cannot access it right so we can even take a look at what this nft looks like on openc uh it happens to be an ft of this really interesting new live streaming uh kind of tv show that's coming out i think that's called it's called mad world uh i'm really excited about this mad realities yeah i'm really excited about this anyways so going back here um and i have this wallet that i used to purchase that mt i'm gonna i'm gonna switch to a different wallet where you know the wallet does not hold this asset right so when i click on login metamask is going to ask you ask me to sign a transaction and i try to sign it and it says hey you don't have the nft right i said okay now i'm going to switch to the wallet that i actually have uh that have the nft and i'm going to log in metamask is going to ask me to sign another transaction uh try another message and now i see this is the live stream that i've been doing and you know we have access to this live stream right and it's pretty you know it's a pretty simple example but it illustrates uh this token gating type of concept right so so let's take a quick look at you know how how this is built right it's it's actually really quite simple um so we have here we have a very simple um javascript application with a back end and a front end right so let's go into the back end we'll see that there are a couple of endpoints uh this info endpoint is not that important um this check endpoint uh is the thing that basically checks the incoming signature that i sign with metamask so the front end is going to send that signature into the backhand um with the post request uh and here we're just you know doing check checking the signature to to make sure that um the um the the ownership the signature is valid uh and um and in here we're we're also checking um whether the um whether the address actually owns the nft right so here we're checking does the address uh own this nft in this in this specific contract and if it does then we return true if it doesn't return false right and in the front end we can simply decide to show or hide the player uh depending on the the ownership of the the smart uh the ownership of the nft and the other thing that's interesting is that we can this is actually a proxy for the video itself because one of the things that um some people have pointed out in the past that is that you know hey if you after getting the access to the stream you can just open up the developer console and copy the url of the video and then you know share it with somebody else and and they'd be able to watch it right but here uh you're actually we're actually running the video through a proxy but only running the playlist through the proxy and the playlist is a very small file so it doesn't take that much bandwidth to be able to proxy it and deliver it around and here we can for every request we can actually validate okay is this video request coming from a browser that's uh coming from the browser session for a specific public key right and here we can we can basically prevent that type of stealing of the content and say you know only if the signature is valid will we return uh video so yeah that's um that's my demo and that's my um that's my workshop i'm going to go back to uh to my presentation um i want to check again does anybody have any questions um for the last five minutes all right if not um i look forward to seeing everybody uh at the at the hackathon good luck and i'll be in discord uh talking to y'all about your hacks all right thank you so much eric for your wonderful workshop i'm sure everyone learned a lot um it was for interesting and as eric said he can be reached on discord in the live peer sponsor um channel uh and otherwise this workshop will also be posted onto the youtube on the youth global youtube so feel free to reference that and with that being said um once again thank you so much eric for taking your time to present this workshop and thank you to the rest of you for joining us today and have a good day is it is it too late to ask eric a question please ask away oh my god dude let's do hey um i love your presentation with dude um so i feel like you know you had this nfc presentation how are you uh making entities cheap right like how can i uh interact with your protocol without burning tons of money like are you guys on uh polygon or these other chains right now great question so um nfts uh so so the streaming experience on live fear is actually uh blockchain agnostic right and what that means is um you can build this nft gating experience using any layer once using any blockchain and still be able to kind of utilize the the hosted uh gateway so you you actually don't need to do uh do any minting use from lifehere's perspective all you have to do is to figure out how to mint your nfts however you meant it right polygon or near or or wherever it is and then you can kind of build that authentication process with the specific chain that you're using does that make sense yeah no that totally does um quick heads up i just want to let the um uh eat online person just heads up just cut me off whenever um but uh yeah i'm wondering so i launched a protocol called share state and what we do is let people deposit their eat or you know um eat validation right so for you as well you allow people to deposit tokens to have a protocol that lets people um handle uh media in essence right so i'm just wondering is there a way you can uh scale up from that right because right now as somebody that has a protocol that has media you handle old profits how do you scale up from that how do you let other people handle the media handle the infrastructure for hosting that media great question so um even though um yeah so i'm guessing the question is about kind of um like how value flows in the life here network yeah how do you get a lot from there right like because you have a great protocol but how do you expand out from there because at the end of the day you can make a lot of money doing what you're doing but i think you can make more money like letting other people um the infrastructure providers if that makes sense yeah so live pier is you know is a decentralized protocol and it is a decentralized network right and in fact um if you go to the live peer explorer uh you will see that there's already a hundred participants uh nodes that are that are running live here nodes and and if you go there you can actually see the amount of monies that they're making so if we uh if you just go to live explorer.lifehere.org right now um you will see that last week uh the the transcoders made over ten thousand dollars on the network right and this is one of the highest um networks in terms of kind of web 3 infrastructure revenue that's being paid so it's already decentralized and it's already sharing the profit out to to the participants who are par for providing infrastructure and the other thing that i would say is that um through a staking protocol that that staking is a way to share uh profits and or share ownership of the network to all the participants right so inflation happens every every day in the lifetime network and all of that all of that inflation is shared proportionally to participants in the lifetime network based on their stake right and as and and these are kind of node operators so and the node operators are sharing those rewards uh to the people who stick towards them right so this is um this is how we make sure that the you know the rewards of the knife of the lifetime network is shared amongst all the participants all that who participate in the lifeview network from day one so you're open to uh other protocols like d5 protocols kind of like jumping in and um participating in life here right uh yeah yeah that's really interesting in fact there's a there's a really cool project called tenderize uh that's kind of um that that's like liquid staking for life here right um so what they do is they have a protocol that allows you to stake your life here tokens through tenderize and tenderize would issue a tenderize a tlpt token to you while helping you stick in on the life here network and with that tlpt you can kind of participate in in d5 protocols it's very similar to kind of what lido does for kind of eth2 would staking mind just dropping that in the chat i would love to like help out and build the contract for that yeah yeah here is tenderize and it's um yeah there's a really cool team working on that project cool um yeah so it looks like that's all the time that we have for the workshop today um great questions uh and thank you eric for being so um awesome with the questions in the workshop and everything um [Music] um so yeah all right have a great day everyone um and enjoy the rest of web free jam
