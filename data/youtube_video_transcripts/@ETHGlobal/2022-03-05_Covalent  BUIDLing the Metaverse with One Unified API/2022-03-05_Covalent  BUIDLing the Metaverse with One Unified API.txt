okay okay we we can start i'll i'll restart the stream and we can go so you can start the program okay sounds good um hey everyone welcome uh to our last workshop of the day at day two workshop at build quest um i hope you're all having a nice evening morning afternoon depending on where you are um we have lei and labing from covalent doing their workshop on biddling the metaverse with one unified api questions can go in the zoom chat and with that being said i'll hand the mic off to our two workshop posts thank you hi i'm liz public marketing covalent liping you want to say hi to you i'm living i'm from deborah eckelmann nice to meet y'all um yeah so we'll get into it i think anna mentioned if you have questions throughout you can put them in the chat since there's two of us and one person can probably answer but we can also um get to questions at the end and probably won't be too long i think we have like 30 minutes today so welcome everyone and i also apologize if i stop for water or a cough a little bit um i might have got sick at east denver so still kind of recovering but uh yeah let's go ahead um so today we're talking about building the metaverse with one unified api really excited about the theme of this hackathon um yeah it's really interesting to see like different hackathon topics pop up and things that are geared towards like really creative outputs so i'm looking forward to seeing what everybody's able to actually build um so what we're going to cover today is some web 3 data trends and challenges a little bit about the covalent api if this is your first time coming across us or if you already know covalent but you just want an overview of hackathon resources and everything like that um how to access nft data since one of our bounties uh if you make use of our nft endpoints you can get rewarded there um and then some resources and project demos and this is kind of the fun part that we'll go through and show you how to like actually use the api in the browser and then some examples of things that you can build as well which i think is really useful for like inspo and we also have use case like templates that we build out at covalent so if you want to fork those and build upon them it makes it really easy and quick to get started too so just like a overview as we all kind of know it's been a really big year for everything crypto and everything web3 and we've seen quite a lot of adoption especially like from 20 to 20 20 20 to 2021 and now in 2022 as well i mean things are like going down a little bit but for the most part we can definitely see that like adoption is happening but we like to plot this kind of curve that you'll see on the right of other types of historical technology and how long it kind of took to reach mainstream adoption just to give some context of like where we kind of are and adoption for crypto is still low um and what that means is even though we're seeing like big brands that we recognize and more web 2 companies coming into the space and um putting their hats in the ring we still have a long way to go in terms of the infrastructure and like the maturity of this space and building solutions at things like hackathons and what we're doing right now it's still like the forefront of innovation and we're paving the way for more people to basically participate uh in web 3. so one of the things we actually recently released that kind of ties into the theme of this hackathon um is a real upswing in game five so i would really recommend if you're interested oops sorry if you're interested in um game five and trends of like play to earn gaming and kind of the movement that's happening there i know that ties into the current kind of hackathon as well um i would check out some of the figures on our website you can find an ebook that was recently released but just to share some of the statistics that we're seeing there's millions of people uh or millions of active wallets that are participating in game fight currently so it's a really big opportunity um and it's exciting to see like what solutions could be built around um this this data basically and the fact that there isn't really a good solution right now um to access all of it and it's something that we're working on is providing more gameplay data so we indexed uh ronin which is like the axis side gene uh and we're working on providing more data in the gaming space because basically what happens when we see these big booms and trends and this is what ties back to those data trends and challenges um is that there's a lot of noise and i'm sure if you're on crypto twitter you can see that it's just there's a lot of um it's hard to know which are reputable sources it's hard to know which figures are being taken from where and blockchain data in and of itself is kind of messy and hard to extract um so yeah these are all challenges that were kind of focused on solving it covalent and hopefully if you have an interest in building with us and the data side you're also one of those people that would like to make sure that the data that you're getting is accurate reliable and that you're building solutions that aren't like misleading anybody as well um so one of the things we like to think about that kind of ties back to where we are in terms of the adoption curve um is just what the next couple of years are going to look like in crypto and it helps at covalent for us to do this because we're building an api that should be reflecting data across all of the different blockchains that we want to index and that's a lot to do because we picture the future being very multi-chain and we can already see that that's happened we started by indexing like ethereum minus and kind of the big ones and now we're even moving into non-evm chains like solana and currently index 28 different blockchains um and we want to continue to do even more of that because basically we see millions and actually i think billions of data points on the blockchain and this is not just for financial purposes this is for anything that's on the blockchain data around like one-year transactions um but also just like supply chain information and art and a bunch of different use cases um and we believe that all of these applications that are moving towards blockchain as um a decentralization in web3 becomes more popular are what is really going to power the lives of like potentially billions of people um so what that means again is those applications need to be robust and that also means that the data needs to be interoperable between different chains because we're not really living in a world where people are just interacting on ethereum anymore most people i think that are participants in web3 have like different wallets they go across chains bridging technology is really difficult and challenging and data just it's hard to move from place to place and it's hard to build applications that can scale really easily too and that's something that we want to make easier and that's part of why we kind of develop covalent um and where it fits in the crypto stack is basically just to provide a really clean standardized form of data where we can verify that things um the format that you'll be getting is the same across the different chains that you want to pull it for and if you want to add a new chain it's as simple as changing a parameter versus running more nodes and building on another transformation engine so that kind of leads me to what the covalent api is um maybe some of you are familiar maybe this is the very first time that covalent provides a unified api so it's one api that you can query from the cloud it's no code and basically our main kind of feature is that well one it's free so that's good but two you can enable multi-chain capabilities for any of your builds just by changing a parameter which is called the chain id so this is really useful again if you are focused on more like interoperable and scaling solutions um you can just loop in different blockchains to whatever you're building and also each time we index a new chain that exposes you to another ecosystem as well so just to kind of go over the crypto stack um and where we sort of fit there's basically the blockchain layer which is where we're interacting and writing to the blockchain and then there's nodes and that's the method of extracting the data from the blockchain so if you're a developer and you're not using covalent or if you're using different solutions you might be running your own nodes um but this is an experience that is like kind of a barrier for a lot of people especially just hobbyists or analysts or emerging kind of demographics that might want to find their own data and make use cases for that they're not really going to be running their own nodes so what we kind of fit where we fit in is more of like a supporting the scaling of applications by being a data layer so we take care of the entire data extraction process we host all of the blockchain data in a database it's an elt framework so then that means like extract load transform so anyone developing with the api is only focused on the transformation step which is actually just developing those applications so we're really just focused on enabling like the front-end use cases um and that can be things like dashboards analytics uh applications art galleries nft galleries wallets taxation tools um really any on-chain data that you need there's a bunch of possibilities and things that we might not know yet so again that's kind of why i'm excited about a metaphors hackathon because i don't think we've seen that many use cases outside of yeah in that realm like we see a lot of wallets of course and things like that but um i'm excited to see kind of more creative ways to use blockchain data and yeah that is how we kind of envision by making it more easy to build applications we think we can support a lot more users faster and basically ensure that we reach adoption in this space which benefits everybody um so yeah our two major user demographics are obviously developers blockchain developers and people building applications but we also uh we created an analyst mode in our docs which you'll see later when we demo some of the resources we're seeing a lot more analysts that are wanting to make quick insights using the api and fetch their own data and have that reliability so you can actually download all of the api responses in a spreadsheet format which can be really useful for not just analysts but also anybody that wants to do sort of like analytics um there's no need to like reinvent the wheel because excel is probably not going anywhere ever so yeah we're just making it easier for those use cases there as well and here's just a couple of our customers um currently we have over 15 000 developers and 500 plus projects building with us and it's a little bit hard to track these things because it's free to sign up um but these are just some of the big names that we work with uh and these people use us to display things like their balances which is our number one endpoint um and also nft galleries as i mentioned any sort of metadata there that is needed and taxation tools things like that so um we'll go on to our bounties oops everything's not working there we go okay i have to backtrack here we go um so we're offering two different bounties or two pools basically for this hackathon um you can both for each of them there's a two thousand dollar usdt prize pool um so the first one is to make a gamefi analytics dashboard uh and the second one is to um for anyone any meaningful use of the covalent api uh for a build quest build so meaningful use is just basically something that is like you're trying to solve a real problem present a real solution creativity we evaluate and the complexity of the endpoints and things like that um i think i'll hand it off to it being here you can talk a little bit about more about the bounties and then show you some of the resources and stuff thank you let me just share my screen all right maybe i'll talk a little bit more about the uh bounties first so as uh you can probably find the bounty more bounty information on the eve global price pool page right uh i'm sure many of you have already seen it so i wouldn't navigate to the page but just to give a bit more info about game fight analytics dashboard right we saw game five ballooning first of all but then there's a problem which is that um we just keep receiving a lot of marketing information about uh who's what uh who's earned how much within this play to earn games there's not necessarily much like visibility about the on-chain data right so by building the game fight analytics dashboard of your favorite web three games you can allow like analysts investors or game five players to answer certain questions such as what is the reach of this game uh what's the retention of this game how much revenue are people earning on this uh sorry having a bit of a cough on this um p to e game right and all these can be done using our covalent endpoints what the games are normally there are some smart contracts within let's say ethereum blockchain within polygon blockchain many of them are very popular on polygon chain and also whichever chain that they're on and this is our covalent api documentation as you can see um you just need to get like a api key and you can call a lot of these information in browser i've already signed in and have an api key so i just run a custom request for you like um you want to find the the most basic one right like um you want to find the token balances of your own ethereum address you click run here and bam here you go this is the address with querying in question and these are the your tokens every single one is stored as an array within this items field of this response object okay so this is what you'll be receiving as a developer if you're a non-dev there's also this analyst mode which returns you your balances in csv format and you can download it in csv excel or sheets um in the context of game5 on-chain contract activity what you're looking out for what you're looking out for typically tends to be uh well you want to see the token balances the amount of money stored on contract you want to check out the maybe the number of erc 20 token transfers and then you might want to search by locked events of the contract this is one that is useful what it does is that within if you're familiar with blockchain development or on-chain data right you know that a lot of the data points are stored within these log events emitted by the contract like each contract would have let's say and a transfer log event let's say you are uh within the game you're transferring an item between player a and player b and that is locked into the contract as a transfer log event what this um endpoint allows you to do is to get all the log events within a smart contract of course the applications are endless it's not just for within the context of game buy but uh it allows you to pull every single activity on chain from the contract as long event and what you do in the front end is you do some further filtering to get uh the specific item that you need let's try to run one with the custom example here i'll run it in developer mode as you can see the response data is a bit more complex but when you take a look at it it's uh the information you're looking for is typically just stored somewhere here this is the this is the contract contract in question so i'm just gonna have a drink of water this is the contract in question um and if you can see right did it the name of the contract is uh the compound governor alpha contract and when you decode the contract this is the method that is called it is a vote cast right and you can see this is the signature and this signature is essentially the log event signature on ether scan like for instance let's look at a random contract like let's say uh ens token contract for instance uh a contract here wait where's the log events page this is the token this is the contract okay and you can see the events here there we go each of these events are emitted by the contract and they have a signature right and this signature is being captured here okay every single event signature and each of these data points the address of the voter is here with this value proposal id for the votecast 42 uh this support field boolean true okay so that is one log event the second log event emitted is another votecast event similar structure etc the third log event will cause again i mean this contract is all about voting so all the events emitted from here it's about boats maybe we can even try finding like a gameplay um let's try searching for xc infinity is it this one okay i don't have one here at the moment but you can definitely give it a go you can even run your custom request here right you have a gaming smart contract you put it here you specify starting at ending block you know just to narrow the responses given because sometimes the number of events can be huge and you want to be able to receive a response and yeah you can do that and you can also get events by log events by topic hash if you change the chain you can get multi-chain kind of queries right these are the chains that we support and that's it for for this bounty the second bounty we are not restricting you in any way as long as you use the covalent api in any kind of build you can use it in a d5 dashboard you can use it in a wallet you can use it in a transparency dashboard you can use in portfolio trackers you can build your own open c you can build your own zapper you know uh really quickly without using sub graphs or without writing complex queries all you need to do is just explore the data a little bit so that is the hackathon resources that we have for you what you saw just now was the api reference right we have a further covalent docs which gives you more support tutorials how-to guides as well as uh further kind of um uh tools that we have up here to tailor the response that you want to get one of it is called primer okay what it does is that it primes the json response on the server side such that you return a different kind of response object that's tailored to your needs and to do that you just need to alter the query string all right that's all we have for you on your end on on our end uh all the best with your build quest builds and let us know if you have any questions right now we'll be asking we'll be answering questions i saw somebody ask in the chat um just about whether or not we support erc 721 and 1155 in the balance's uh responses to and we do just so everybody knows so um yeah enjoy checking that out as light being mentioned um on the docs site so not just our api reference but the uh covalent docs the second resource there um you can also see a past list of some projects from other hackathons to get inspiration if you ever want to take a look through project showcase on there and that can be really helpful for just like having a starting point if you're looking for ideas or things to build and you can also check out our covalent replica which i think is linked probably somewhere on the prize page but if it's not i can link it and that's where you can find um those quick like use case templates that you can get started with so uh just in case you want to make it even easier to kind of check out how to build things right away and you don't want to waste any time i will link that in the chat yep there if anyone else has questions feel free to come off me and ask it live as well everyone's just like heads down hacking yeah because we're one of the last few workshops today right all of them must be in the middle of uh something at this point probably well looking forward to seeing everybody builds um really exactly people will take on the gamify dashboard well just because that's like a newer use case that we haven't seen much of so it's an opportunity to like do something pretty cool and innovative um and yeah i'd love to see those all right um if there's no other questions um or i guess i have a question lay in leaving what would be the best way for hackers to reach you or the covalent team if they have any questions uh please go on to the eat global discord channel under the uh the sponsor covalent channel under build quest so uh we'll be answering all your questions then yeah and you can also join the covalent discord too if you have hacked with us at other events and stuff or if you want to stay more involved with our community um you can ask for questions in there too anytime awesome thank you and um thank you elaine leaving for taking the time out of your weekend to do this really awesome workshop for hackers uh yeah i'm really excited to see like what's going to be built from buildquest and with that being said um i hope everyone has a great rest of your weekend and um see you soon thanks nfl helping us yeah thanks for everyone coming out too enjoy your yeah
