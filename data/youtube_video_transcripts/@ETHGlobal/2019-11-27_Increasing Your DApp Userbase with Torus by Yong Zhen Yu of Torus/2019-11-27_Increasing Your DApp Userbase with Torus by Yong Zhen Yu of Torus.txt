hi guys thanks for coming down today my name is a Taurus and Taurus is based different you must log into attacks so yes this is us beep Boston I'm super excited to see all the hacking that's been going on so far I'm just here to introduce what we do so basically what Taurus is and is that we are replacement from a box we are web wallet the interface is exactly the same as mount on or want to go would ya so the advantages of using taurus over meta marks is that for one a user doesn't have a download of contraception and secondly you get an interesting neighbors over so how does this work in line with our students also I guess users can log in by a Google account it's relative to create an account meta mask to understand I really kind of depends we try to abstract that all the way for you from the anyone to provide that with a very seamless experience so why we can do that and how close what's behind the scenes is we use this scheme called we build on this thing called Shimizu picture and what this means is we split a user scheme with multiple different shares these shares are kept on a network of nodes which are run by logical system samples from their foundation finance stay focused on Kuiper's well and we basically just decayed you to generate these keys in a distributed manner when a user logs in diamo off so this can be a Google login there's gonna be a Twitter login it can be a facebook login it doesn't really matter what we do is we send off token to the back end nodes these nodes kind of an MPC style verify your auth token against us a you will probably favorite on shares which used so much only in the front end context of the browser so this key is only held in memory when you close the browser the key is destroyed it's not kept anywhere on your laptop and it's the keys only ever loaded in a secure iframe context which is which is kind of verifiable - a shot into - - yeah so that's how we work and what this means for you guys is you guys can integrate us our dogs and dog start all of us seems basically you guys can either use the 1-9 script tag to include Taurus and you guys instantly get a grant for instance that was the way people used to do it but nowadays with people are having multiple wallet providers and law wallets into space it is looking to different cars with other wallets I would recommend going for that NPM package over here this one gives you a provider and which came back around with web free library that they're using and it's I mean it's like the standard just and then you can start interacting as we would normally so submission of protections you can duty calls everything what's that so that's not very cool because I mean we're all used to that right we're all developers we've all put it that mask using web tray is not awesome I just want to get something coded and get out so what is cool with Taurus is that because we map offs or logins to public/private key pair we also have a name result so basically this is the API and this is what you would get so if I would enter in anybody's email this is inclusive of some APIs rental cars and something who's new who has a very simple so if I just put in a string here I can get a public/private key pair I'm sorry not acknowledging just positive the public key of somebody who events they want to interact with so I mean a very simple example of how I would use this name is Oliver is that if I wanted to send certain name change if I was the second high that's immediate James I guess we'll talk later so if I wanted to send James like II I would just get his gmail address our name was all been to a public address and then I would send that public address key and only James can access that Pete and head of time so this is a very simple explanation I mean like maybe giving with an address but you can do a lot of 50 things who comes you don't even have to interact the blockchain because these are public private key pairs we have to be doing like implementing signatures on top of it going interesting we teachers need to be communication to encryption possibilities are endless that's what you guys should play because this is more fun so right now we integrated with Google but in the future we'll be integrating through several forms as well coming down the pipeline is Facebook as well as we chat on this integrating hip hop as well and you got to be able to members off to those things so you behave on the result you get off handle I am resolved to your face panel and all of that um yes and we are prizes its we ultimately have six prizes so there's one grand prize which is going to be two thousand USD and on the 4runner upset 1000 USD each this is the criteria of course you guys have to in great integrate tourists to be eligible for this the past one this is the best that second one is the damage because industry need but one is the one that's the most seamless for the one the best overall UX and last but not least the map with the most creative design so please do for us any questions guys before I move on but we also have an online hackathon so I'm showing this as well you guys can double apply we don't mind so what you guys have on here you guys can apply to an online component well it runs through September and it's just before Def Con and so I think right now we have our 12 tries on people if you guys have any from home integration feel free to just try on myself we'd be free one more time we can't like walk around and hope you guys integrate those on does anybody have any questions before we do that no cool there's nice guys you know if this was now and to log into this DAP it's a flow which users already very decent I could just talk in my google just like this what's happening in the background is the authentication is happening I'm fabricating shares they're coming back up right by it slow and there we go and then it's just a simple set it's like a web 2.0 which is what we really should aspire to me how this house - is you are literally Max and the user you as a user are not a public the private key is never reconstructed before you log in but after you log in is reconstructed in - context in theory let's say send eat some food hasn't eaten created chemical to our cities have a key market yes that's the main use case so it's all I guess I'm done boy in general we aim to become like the thoughts key we want to be the bridge between web 2.0 whoa what and that's kind of where we go this anything else falling more so child looks really hard it's definitely very well done I have to say I mean self praise yah praise but no excuse for the after but now we want the walk teachers in science and witches and youth calls coming up soon would be introduction firewall so you guys would be able to come up permissions you guys would be able to basically not bother the user box every time on approval on that you could like trigger transactions freely after that and that provide so much better user experience in general we also basically have volumes in Tacoma so it's here and I mean just to show you guys something in action do you know who wants me what's your email address let's see the Alex's so I like actually a lot on before I think it was my I hope that this is a new account because that you guys can really see as you can see I'm sending to an email address so I can you can you say last part again basically you can interact with somebody even because you have before worth that are at the wallet yet even before they yeah because you set up the pairing between the Gmail or another property and it weren't that faculty story so that private key is are you from of Shaban signature so just a brief refresher on children see return it's really quite simple do you know how when you have a graph and you have a line on the graph if you have one point that line hard to find the line right but you have two points you can define your life this is true for entire College offense but when we talk about like x squared two points on X cubed in four months and this goes on for us the public/private key pair is always or actually multi private key is always the y intercept on this one on this function these points are generated in a distributed manner by a scheme accomplished and I think no thoughts even go for this one but it's it's very silver and and basically these plates are split across a network of nodes so the nodes of the mission right now you can compare them all to be very similar to the borough's it's basically a large ecosystem stakeholders run finance runs a node somebody doesn't have any wallet let's say this is to our service so that's coming next no actually if you guys build it for us we'd be really glad you guys could nothing that we did and it's all it doesn't just have to be like email notifications when we get work let's say to attend integrated something which we are working on as well is opening the API scopes to adapt themselves so right now API scopes are kept within an iframe so whilst you guys can access some information like information on the users approval you guys can access like you guys not open to the city sending a gmail email out by the Gmail or accessing them but we're looking to generalize a cask of such that you're able to do this and leverage or the olaf's as well so that you can like I think we'll just like cut it here and a lot of people integrations and stuff like that there's a short stick about now last few shots in addition giant sequel won't resent it again and we also have and use your child please do subscribe in a Twitter account please do follow I have no words just my friends it's my penance thanks guys
