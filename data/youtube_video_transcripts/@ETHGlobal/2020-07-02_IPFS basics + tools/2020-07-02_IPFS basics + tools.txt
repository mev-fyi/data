waiting on the stream to just keep going just a few more seconds for everybody that joined we just to start off we're having everybody throw their local time in the chat all right we're good stream is up awesome well we gave a just a real quick intro to Juan Bonet he's the if you guys don't know I'm sure a lot of our participants here are familiar with one and in the work that he does but he is the founder and current CEO of protocol labs he's probably most well known for his work with ipfs and file coin which is what this hackathon is about hopefully you're here as a part of a kfs that's what I'm here for we're super excited for the events this week and then the actual kick off next week it's gonna be an amazing full 30 days of building and creating things with all of you guys I'm going to be learning about a lot about file coin and ipfs in the whole ecosystem so yeah I can say for sure that the holy global team is really looking forward to all this one if you wanted to say any anything about yourself that I missed it was pretty short but and we do have some aetherium people coming in yeah take it away yeah that's great thanks for thanks for the interaction and really excited to be here with everybody and why not what I'm gonna do for the workshop is I want to make this very hands-on and very interactive so really want to make it a learning session where everybody can kind of try things out follow along play around with it with the tools in the tag ask questions and then kind of you know as we the goal is to give you a good understanding of the over the tools and how to use them and how they work so then you can you can use that as a good entry point to then learn more so we'll have a bunch of workshops both this week and next week that are going to cover a whole bunch of different concepts and kind of in more and more in advanced ways what I want to cover in this workshop is kind of a an introduction to the to the high-level concepts and the in the tool basics so mostly we want to give you a good foundation for how ipfs works how content is is is expressed a and so on and kind of how to work with with files and with data on it because I'm kind of how to have a good mental model for how the network network operates so yeah and yeah the the goal is to do as little through concepts as possible and as soon as much as we can directly working with with the tools in the command line and and the web so so yeah that's that's the goal and uh so I'm gonna have a I'm gonna be sharing my my screen and then we'll just go with um with that you alright so and I think I should be able to see most people as well yeah I'll have like a screen open with people and if you want to show a video feel free or not I'll also be feel free to ask questions on chat as well I know I'll be kind of monitoring the chat as we go if I can find that window there is some time to overlap a bunch of things and pin things to the screen in interesting ways cool so let's see everyone can see that screen I'm guessing thumbs up yeah cool so the yeah this is again very intro workshop very hands-on not really conceptual there's a lot of conceptual talks out there you can go in and watch those on YouTube happy to give you a bunch of links out there but you can just kind of search and we'll yeah there's a lot of really good material out there that kind of goes very deep into all the all the concepts in happy fuzz and so on that's not this sort of this works that workshop is meant to be hands-on trying things out will go through a number of examples and they'll kind of scale in difficulty we're at the beginning we're just going to be playing around with files and then we'll we'll do more interesting things like starting to deal with video and then we'll we'll deal with like whole websites and then thinking about how to how to move this around and with each of those examples we'll kind of try things out locally we'll try things out looking at things in the Gateway you'll hear more about that in a moment and so on so the the goal is to kind of go through these basic examples what kind of get an understanding of from a good understanding of how how the data is moving through the network how to address content and and and so on and yeah very much ask questions and so on if if you know if a question is asked on chat and you know the answer like please jump in and help each other out that'll keep everything everybody moving and then you know if you're running if you're trying to follow along and you run into some trouble you know definitely try to fix it if you are kind of you spend more than a couple 1 min or two on it I would say just move on and maybe move back to watching and then later on because this is recorded you can go back and play it back and then try to follow along after you devote prom but yeah so I won't be hold waiting for you know I don't it's not we're not gonna kind of proceeded in lockstep altogether I'm just gonna kind of move through a bunch of things and you can follow along awesome if you're kind of running running behind then maybe just start watching and yes I wanted to point you to a few other resources so you know first off we're gonna have a a set of learning resources I don't know these are out yet at Trent I'm not sure if they've been showed yet yeah no we're just cleaning up that dock but it should be shared if not tomorrow by the end of the week yeah sounds great and I'll give it a preview right now of kind of how it's gonna how it's going to look so it's gonna be kind of like a page like this that's going to have a whole bunch of links it's gonna how a whole bunch of sections with with different links to different things right so in terms of like an intertwined be fast you you'll get a sense of being able to kind of watch some talks that go in-depth technically I highly recommend this one the how ipfs works that goes very deep into all over the different different layers of the protocol and so on you know so here see some kind of updates around what's what's been happening and I can fast recently you can also get a sense of you know there's this kind of walks in through a lot of the tools and links you to them and then starts getting into some more advanced topics like hey how do you deal with typing custom domains how do you put a hope how do you put websites on a TFS and how do you address them how do you do dynamic websites hey if you want to build kind of like a whole web app like what are the tools that you can use to to do that kind of stuff then you know maybe some specific we're kind of collecting also some tutorials for for specific use cases like hey if you want to do something with an FPS on on etherium and so on and you want to address the content on I confess here's like some tutorials for doing that going into things like pinning services and and kind of what what those are and more so you can this once we ship this resource page you'll be able to kind of explore all these all these different things this will get more and more filled over time throughout the threat of hakkon fest will keep expanding this visa these resources and tutorials and so on and so you can see there's kind of like at least introduced here you can see like the range of things that are gonna appear over time and we've kind of maintained meeting this as well there and if you run into if you have some questions and you want to find out about something and you and you are having trouble kind of finding those resources definitely ask and and we can add that as a category here and we can kind of collect some tutorials there great so that's kind of like them I would recommend out of the main that things that I'm you should kind of lean on is that is that that page and then beyond that then you know really just like the ipfs talks right so if you go to activist that IO on on the resident click Doc's and you land in the in the IPS Doc's website and here you can you can there's a whole bunch of stuff about how to install the recent releases you can get some kind of conceptual overviews about kind of product if s is how it works and you can get a bunch of ideas and examples it goes into kind of you know so amount of conceptual information around content addressing NCATS and so on but then you can also get like you know very direct how to somehow to do a bunch of different kinds of things how to how to configure a note how to deal with bootstrapping and and so on this might not make sense to you just yet but for them that's okay here the this kind of how-to section in the docs is is gonna be really really useful over time so expect to kind of find find a bunch of useful stuff there and again if you if you are running if you're trying to do something and you don't find it represented here definitely ask and we can we can put a with some thoughts together on getting some resources for you another thing I'll mention is there's there's a lot of videos on YouTube so if you just look for ipfs on youtube you can find a ton of different things and tutorials and so on so so definitely go go check those out that's going to be a really useful set of resources as well and if you look at the ipfs channel on youtube here you can sorry sorry idea started playing in the background so i was like i don't know if somebody was talking the in in this page you can see all kinds of really useful resources from from conference talks to do certain workshops I highly recommend this IP fest camp the set of workshops here I'll paste a link in the chat as well the let's see unable to see the browser screen so you just wanted to be using din more I'm guessing is that is that better all right hopefully uh hopefully a skit the yeah so that this set of workshops is really really useful these were these are kind of like each of them are kind of an hour long and they go into a bunch of different concepts so we're most likely not going to be repeating most of these in fact I think we'll have one I think with lipid p1 but most of these are good to just watch directly from from this playlist and kind of follow along along with it so highly highly recommend this set of workshops that are already already recorded and there are probably other other things here that you can you can use you can go into kind of the videos or like playlists section and you can find all kinds of things there including more conceptual stuff and and so on so the the project does all kinds of things through this YouTube channel including recording some kind of organization meetings and so on so you can kind of follow along with what the what the core devs are are doing the probably also recommend there's a whole bunch of also lightning talks here from a lot of people using using ifs so you can get a sense on ideas of how people are doing are doing stuff so that's definitely like cool to check out so here's a for example a a a talk from from text all about buckets here's a talk from Microsoft and their eye on identity system there's there's talks about how Netflix is using it for containers there's stuff from Pierrot and how to how to do pinning and so on there's all kinds of like really really useful things here so highly recommend using using this this every sources then from there I would say there's also a ton of tutorials on the web so there are you can also just search online and you can find a lot of really really good tutorials a lot of people are writing writing about this and you can find a lot of the stuff in in the blogs of various groups and companies who are who are building tech around nightly fest so when I want to recommend textile pinatas and Perl fleek and a few others that uh that have just been writing like really really awesome along the way kind of helping people understand how to how to do lots of things and and finally Q&A so a lot of the time when you're when you're playing around with new tech it's really really useful to be able to kind of ask questions when you're stuck and kind of kind of get help quickly so for that we're gonna have a kind of a dedicated channel where you can get help through thread the next next four weeks on a lot of ipfs things and then separately you can you can rely on the on the definitely check out the resources that are already available like there's a forum so you can go to discuss that I'd be first at i/o and and there's a whole forum here where you can read up about a bunch of topics you can go to the github pages of various tools and so on and kind of search search through that and you can also ask in Psych overflow so you can you can check out SEC overflow in right ipfs and you can see there a bunch of different questions about about different things I think there's like 33 pages of stuff and and by the way if you go to stack overflow and you find something you know the answer to like definitely help help answer there that'll that'll help make um make a lot of the content better over time great so let's move on so I want to just kind of touch on a few concepts slightly because that'll be useful for for the rest of the time so yeah we're this is not gonna be like flow explanation if you're unfamiliar with these you're not gonna leave knowing and fully but at least you'll get a sense of it so the first one is content addressing you can when you think about ipfs you can think of how the the web works in normal HTTP world where a lot of clients are connecting to a single server and you're requesting information directly from from that server the the addressing of information in that model is location address where the URL is pointing to the IP address of some some computer and you're asking that computer for for some content and some files the way that ipfs works is that it makes the entire web work peer-to-peer by addressing the content with hashes directly so the ashes of the content and so this is what's kind of known as content addressing so the idea is that you map you know kind of like human readable names and so on - directly to the the cryptographic hashes of the content and that gives you kind of a secure way of distributing this during the content and distributing information to everybody so the the the creator of content or the publisher of content doesn't have to be the party serving it it can kind of be served by anybody and and again for all these concepts there's a lot of really good explanations on videos the next one is is DAGs or directly directly directed acyclic graphs these are kind of like a key part of how ipfs works and so you can read a good explanation here the the important thing is to is to just think about how at the end of the day files and computers or all kinds of data is structured in some in some set of data structures and so if you look for a cyclic graphs just on on google you can get a feel for what these these objects look like so the idea is that there's your we're gonna relate information with links and so these links could be think of them as links in a web page right so what a web if you think of a a graph of a page is kind of linking to each other in us those links are cryptographic hashes and then that gives us kind of kind of the secure context and the secure linking between all these pieces of information that means and anybody can make a link from one page to another page and make that link b-b-b secure and so nobody nobody can tamper with the content and so on is the same idea behind how watches work and the same idea behind how how git works and so on and then yeah so so hash is probably most people will be familiar with hashes in some form or another these are these are cryptographic functions for kind of creating a a a short shortened string that maps to a much larger amount information in kind of a a tamper-resistant way so so they do theirs yeah could probably write a lot about hash functions but the basic idea is this is what this is the what enables us to make those links in these graphs where one page can link to another page using the cryptographic page hash of that of that other page and the last one is a DHT s which is a distributed hash tables and so these are these are networks these are peer-to-peer networks that are used for round routing and finding nodes or content and so these distributed hash tables you can think of them as as just like a big lookup table that's spread out over a large network of how to find certain parties or certain content the specifics of how DHT is work and so on we're not gonna touch them now just know that when we mentioned the word DHT or something like that we're really saying hey there's some lookup process and we need to kind of find other parties that are that are interested in this content or find other parties on how to connect to them all right great so now the tools that we're gonna go over today so we're gonna go over the main implementations of of ipfs and so this is go I P FS and JSI BFS and we're gonna go through how to use IP fest gateways kind of what pinning services are and then we're also going to touch on IP ties desktop and I professed companion desktop it's kind of like a like a tool that you can download on your computer and you can kind of double click and open and so on companion is a browser extension all right let's let's get to the let's get to the examples so I think so if you don't have yet how about give us you can go to the website you can click on install up here and you're gonna get to move to this section and so what we're gonna need for for this workshop is mostly we're gonna be working with a command line at first and then we're gonna move to to kind of desktop and the browser and so on so here you can just you know click the get the see a live button and here are a bunch of instructions for for for how to do it and I'm gonna back secure here the instructions for me I can I'll just do it along so we can we can see what's going on let me know if that's a good font size not hearing it's not a bad fun fun sigh so I'll keep it great so then now I've downloaded the release so now I just on unpack it and I run just fashion salt great so now I should have ipfs great so that's this uh this command and I should be able to say I version and get almost Excel great so we just installed yet custom an light now if you're not used to installing command line tools and so on then you might you might run into some trouble here where your operating system might be like oh you need like special permissions to to install this and so on if you run into that I recommend kind of skipping this part and just kind of watching and then going back going back later but yeah for most people that are that are kind of used to installing a lot of various tools and so on you should be able to do just do this and now have the command-line tool can I get a show of hands either on zoom or just on Chad if you have a because installed and are gonna follow along I'll be useful for me to know sweet sounds good great so now that I have this type of on stool there's a lot of commands here you can there's really good help directly in the commands so you can you can ask for help on all of these you can pass in that self help on each command and get an explanation of how what that command does and so on I'd recommend using the docs page and the kind of the how-tos along with the help text here for for you to kind of be able to learn a lot about how all the pieces work and and so on and here the the first thing to notice is that there are a lot of different sub commands here there are some basic commands which are kind of like the bread and butter of working with ipfs which is just kind of adding adding files OFS and getting password because there are some data structure commands and so these are for working directly with like the raw data and that starts getting useful and interesting when you're working with with some application data or something like that then we have you know whole set of advanced commands which are about various different different kinds of features and functionality that you can use along with along with your normal use for Agnetha's including things like pinning which is you know asking your your know to keep around data things like resolving addresses so we when you have like long names and so on you can kind of result those you can get some stats about like the local local data storage and so on you can see how much data there isn't in the in your in your FS node and you can probably most important here to know about is the demon you're gonna usually most the time when you see a professor we're going to start up a demon and kind of run it in the background and so on then one could you just do min a little bit yeah is that um hopefully hopefully that's better then then the last the last sections include kind of network command so this is these commands are useful for these are useful for looking at the set of connections that you have to other peers in the network and then there are and there's a set of like commands just to work with with the insulation about because itself kind of like getting at a listing of that all the commands are there getting a log of getting a log of what the demons is doing and running and and kind of maybe manage a configuration alright great so let's let's initialize and kind of get going so I already have it if you already have IP fast you might have already kind of a repo I'm gonna move mine so I don't lose it and then kind of initialize and you and your repo so you can just type IP fence in it and this creates a repository in ten of your local you look at machine and what that does did is it has you know this creating some files here and in that that is where I beef s is gonna put all of the the data that you add to it and it also created a keeper for for for me and gave me some this command to run to kind of check things out so let's just run the command and so this is kind of like the basic readme it's showing how to get some files out of ipfs and so this is you know the address and I confess this is the hash of a directory and here's like the specific file so you can think of pathing here and I profess the same way that UNIX passing what works or at the web as you can even you know cat a different file so that the reason you can maybe see QuickStart or something like that and kind of get a get a bunch of ideas and kind of how what you do cool so that's that sounds not not too exciting just yet let's now move to starting the daemon and so this is what's going to bring ipfs online let's see I think I already have just running in the background great so now that now that I have it running what the demon did is started listening on a whole bunch of addresses and so these are IP addresses in my local machine and it's also connecting and you'll notice here there's a lot of different protocols so there's we're using TCP we're using quick we're also connecting to to a thing called the peer-to-peer circuit which helps us ensure that the first nodes connect and we're you know it works over ipv4 and ipv6 and so on we also see some useful other services so one is there's an API running and so there's a this API we'll see kind of how to work with it in a moment and then there's a web UI and in kind of a gateway and so the the go I profess daemon kind of packs all of these things together so let's so what is this web UI thing if you go to that address so this is one 3700 that one you get this this UI and so this is a a UI around my my my node and so this is kind of like the that this is kind of the bandwidth over time that that I'm using here's my PRI key here are my addresses and so on then here you can see like files so right now I haven't added any files yet but we'll see some in a moment and there are some other things like I am able to see the set of peers that I'm connected so right now I'm all reconnected to a whole bunch of peers and you can see kind of like the list here and you can see the latency to to those peers so this is a fully pretty good hard great and so this this map is getting populated over time by kind of taking the IP addresses of the peers you're connected to and kind of figuring out sort of like where where those parties are and you can also get that same listing here so let's see I get clear because again I'll get the commands I can the network command swarm helps me on see what what connections our house so I can say swarm in there I can say I profess harm Pierce and I'll get the same listing that is kind of rendered rendered over here these are just kind of all of the addresses of all the peers that I'm directly connected to cool so that's that's interesting but like let's let's see what we can do with it so I have here a set of files and I'm gonna add them to ifs so this is like if you go back to the listing of commands this is kind of the you know in the basic commands how we can add add some content I'm gonna add add files and now it's a directory so I have to pass in that share art for for recursive and that this is adding all of the files in that in that directory to ipfs and so I get this listing of each of the files and the hash for each of the files and so the directories are kind of hashing all of that together and so now just let's have added it I can also do ipfs LS which is kind of a lesson in the command line and kind of see the listing of that of that directory so I can explore this as well like like I would on a file system but the fact that it's now an IP pass means that I can I can view it online as well so if I if I go to localhost 8080 which is this this gateway a port over here I should be able to post the exact same you use the same hash here to kind of view view that content and and sure enough here's like a directory listing of the content that I just added and so we can see like images and we can see some these are directories I think it the the folder rendering got a little bit messed up but uh yeah you can explore all the content that I just added add it here so we can look at some pictures and kind of yeah here's here's like the same content that uh that I that I added now the cool thing is you can if I give you this this address you should be able to get it as well so you can type as the test get on this on this hash and you should be able to download download that as well so I'll post here on chat and you can follow along so here's the hash now because I'm behind a firewall it can be like really annoying too sometimes sometimes it may work or may not work because your computer may or may not be able to reach reach my computer so I have a set of scripts that help me deal with that which I want to get into right now but I'll post the script later so you can you can use something like this and so I'll do this to kind of connect to the set of nodes that I have and then kind of like replicate the replicated content to them you and you should be able to download the same the same same content as well so if you do if you do I pay first get you should be able to kind of download that let's see um I'll open another window let's get on that half then it should yes I got on the the same content was putting out on that hash and I can open it as well locally in my in my file system so I can see that set of set of pictures and so on directly in in my machine cool so so far what we've done is we added some content to ipfs we started propagating it to to the network we've looked at the web UI that shows us how many connections we have to to various spheres and then we're able to kind of add files including kind of text and images and so on and then give links to other people to kind of download download content cool so so far you know the the way that we view it on the web is through this this kind of like local local gateway and so what what the Gateway means is a there's a program it's an HTTP server that that's running that helps browsers interact with and view content that's an idea fast and so it serves as a bridge between kind of the normal normal web world way that they kind of expects to use HTTP to connect to everything and then being able to to view the content and at efest let me see if I can get a diagram for you that helps make more sense of this like you yes I think it a good a good diagram for this is like you can think of a gateway as a way for browsers and so on to connect through HTTP to a special IP first node but then kind of connects out to the rest of the network and moves and moves the data around so that's that's a so every go ipfs installation comes along with one of these gateways and that's so that you can use your own browser to view your content locally that gateways only just for you nobody else can connect sassette but that can also be used to to kind of close some interesting interesting services so as an example we run we run one global gateway that that you can use to view the content and address it in the world if people don't have don't have IP of us yet and that's at gateway type FS that IO so an example is we can take the same the same hash that we had here and then view it on gateway dot IP first auto and get the exact same same content so you should be able to this is kind of how how links then tend to work let's see I'll post it here so most most most the time you see links like that you can also for convenience drop the Gateway dot and then this this kind of works it's a little bit confusing sometimes to just use HTTP colon slash slash IP that's that I do slash I because and so on because that's also kind of the page of the project but that works there's also a number of gateway gateways from other other people that run them and so you can find you can look on Google for I profess gateway checker and so here's like a listing of a whole bunch of gateways that you can find this so this is this JavaScript page is just pinging a bunch of them right now to see if they're online and kind of gives you the kind of the time that I took them so you can find hours here you can find cloud players you can find a lot of finding services run run gateway so inferior and yadda and temporal and and another run run their own gateways and so that means that if you want to give a link to somebody that doesn't yet have ifs or or doesn't use it you can give them a link to kind of to this gateway and there are a whole bunch of folks who are building services and businesses around just kind of providing these these gateways and with added added services and so on but again this is kind of like a a kind of in-between in-between world where where we're using kind of HTTP to to to kind of enable browsing of this content without without kind of like running running the protocol and connecting to a lot of partys ourselves this is especially useful in mobile so for example the Opera browser now a mobile will can resolve ipfs content directly by going through through a special gateway and so that that way they kind of help make sure that those those phones are not connecting to hundreds of connections and so on which would be kind of resource intensive for a phone but they can resolve all the ipfs content that they want directly on web pages and what's really cool about that is that you can you can start using kind of the protocol handler sort of the way that it's that it's meant to work which is you know right now we're using links of the type we're using links kind of like this which is not which has kind of like HTTP prefix and so on but with once once a browser kind of supports functionality for for the protocol you can move change the link into just having this is so you can just have IBS : / / and then then the content directly and like that that is kind of like a nicer nicer way and this is kind of like the way that it's meant to be in that way it doesn't kind of hop through through HTTP first right now we're where a lot of browsers are starting to to add support for this in various ways the best way to do it is is through its through a tool called companion will we'll check out companion in a little bit later cool so now let's let's start diving into a little bit of how the data itself is structure so like what is this hash what's in the content like how does that bad magic work and I see some questions on the on the chat yeah what about Bravin oh well I don't know about bravenwolf I think I think companion only works on on desktop brave enough up I don't know that Mobile is there but one cool cool thing is I am the the brave team is adding go ipfs support directly into into brave so it's gonna kind of run along with with a with the shield there I don't know if in mobile they're planning for that yet I think thing that might be the maybe later on others here on the call might might Elm already great so let's let's explore what what's in there so I talked earlier about kind of there's this these graphs and so on let's see what that what that means yeah great so have a special script that I can share later and what this script allows me to do is it allows me to kind of extract the kind of like shape and the topology of the graph and then lets me let me let me visualize it so it's called Graf MD and I can give it kind of any any cid and it kind of outputs a lot of dot formatted graph so then we can we can look at it and so I just need to pipe that into dot which is the graph this tool and so on to see kind of an SVG and then I can open that that SVG up don't text let's open it with Chrome and so this graph is the the representation of the content that I just shared with you it's uh here's the the hash of the directory here's like the specific directories underneath that and then here's more more stuff underneath that stuff and you can see kind of like images there and so on and so you'll notice that the files if they're started getting big they'll start getting chunked so for example this portal 1 jpg here is getting chunked into into a multiple multiple trunks and that that is done to just have a small trunk size for objects which are easier to move around that brings all kinds of good properties you know if you have a file that's gigabytes large you want to chunk that into smaller and smaller pieces but it also helps a lot with deduplication so if you end up with if you end up like replicating a lot of the data I think this is really good about just duplicating all of that content and so here I'll I'll let's play around with an example so let's go into the that directory that I showed earlier let's go into into pictures I think we had some backgrounds and then let's let's just copy all of these let's see let's let's copy the entire directory multiple times so copy backgrounds into B - 3 B 4 B 5 so now I have a bunch of directories that are all the same and they've kind of like replicated all of these pictures so now let's do the same thing that we did before addict typing Fessenden see and see how it how it got added so now I get a different hash because the you know these these files these directories got got added now that kind of accumulated up into into the route and that ended up kind of changing the hashes along alongside in the links but you'll notice that these hashes are the exact same so that means that those direct are entirely duplicated not just the files but the directories as well so if we do kind of if we if we try to visualize that again then what happened here is we can see that there are a set of this entire this particular hash that is pointing to it has a bunch of different directories is pointing to exactly the same the same object and then which so that directory is getting entirely duplicated and then the I think there's a bug in my script were like right now it's kind of representing each one of these files is a little bit different but because those are kind of independent coming from from the directory but the point here is like all of those replicated files and so on god they duplicated in the underlying graph so all of that data is not a it's not duplicated so it's so it only those files only got added twenty first ones and so then the when when you have files that are large and they start changing you can think of all of those chunks themselves as being duplicatable as well so if you have kind of like a very large file and you only kind of change change some of the beginning then when you have two versions they'll kind of link to two the same pieces underneath the hood that are kind of kind of the same and the way that chunking works there's there's a whole bunch of different algorithms for how to do this chunking I profess have supports like different different chunker's and I really like interesting it's an interesting project for a hackathon might be to play around with different chunker's and maybe make some some specific some specific chunker's that are that are tuned for specific files great so I think there are some questions let me look through so are the trunk split in to go here in pieces the first half and the second half or are they split in two in some other way that is amenable to network so I first supports different chunker's directly so good has directively has a few fingers here you can say FS add dash dash help and you'll you'll see different kind of like different chunking algorithms here and you can kind of read more about those on on the web these are kind of pretty dumb anyway so so there's like a simple chunking algorithm that's just based on size that's not smart at all and it's not gonna duplicate very well when when with a lot of edits to a file but there's the thing called rabbin fingerprinting and I think called bus hash and and those are starting to you know those are those get smarter about how to how to chunk things especially through what kind of changes in files and and so on but all of that chunking is still kind of not very smart in terms of thinking about the file itself one of the the long one of the things that we've been discussing for a long time is hey we'd be really really cool to have chunking algorithms that are tuned specifically to the file so your your your chunking and specific and boundaries and are really useful we have one version of this like one one experimental version of this which is we can chunk tarballs like that so I'll give an example example of it so if I compress say that files small directory now I have like national ATAR and then I add a few new tonight the start command yeah so if I add if I use a special specialized type of historic a man and I add that type if it's that way then what it will do is it'll chunk the the archive smartly to kind of deduplicate along the file boundaries themselves so I got this hash let's see what what is going on inside of it so here I got something kind of a little bit more more crazy but what's going on is that each of the each of the tar headers so this is chunking in the tar file smartly it's looking at each of the headers themselves and treating that as an object and then looking at the files themselves and chunking that as a as an object itself so one interesting thing though is if we start looking at kind of the data contents of some of these files they're exactly the same as the content of the file outside of the tarball so if you have a lot of tar archives and the actual files on the con compress and so on then they'll do duplicate do the same to the same to the same content so you can you can actually just like get out file directly out of the the tar ball yeah so this is kind of like pulling it out of the turbulence the same the same exact hash that I'm that I was in the in the company all right let's see if there are other questions I think I answered the one in mobile living over there other questions that I haven't covered yet all right great so so far we we've added some content to ipfs we've looked at it on on the Gateway we've moved it to each other and so on and so we're getting a sense of like how static content like documents and images and files kind of sort of move around we've looked under the hood to see how those files themselves are chunks and kind of moved around we've talked about the duplication a little bit now let's do let's do something more interesting what about like so so yeah we can move around files and so on in a peer-to-peer way but but what about websites right so this is kind of where the where the Gateway to browsers becomes like really really interesting and useful because you can put entire websites into into ipfs this way so for that let's see what it's a good website let's find a website hosted at the fast there's a whole bunch of them I believe and Hackett s website itself it's hosted with us so let's I think we can we can get we can find out about about that in I think if I do i press dnr thing so think this should maybe it's not let's see you will this work maybe this tool this old tool is it's not working let's see yeah there we go so I can do I think that's less directly so I can do I confess calm and so I can can't reason I think I DNS link is not it's not set up yet yeah I'll see what the I profess your website so this is this whole website is all night if s itself so this is kind of like the I profess that I your website so this this whole thing itself is in n ipfs and so let's listen maybe grab a Docs one let's see the docs one will work do you yeah great so let's just get IP NS dot doc Scott I'd if I saw that yeah and so that this is going to download the whole the whole website to - okay great just fine thanks surprising that it's taking a while sometimes it can take a bit of time to like find the right the right content you should be also like also do this yourself and you can like download the whole website so now we have kind of this dachshund IP facade on your website and so like this is the the whole thing itself here's like the index.html and images and so on and you know like all of the files and whatnot and so we can you know you can like deploy cold like this is you can think of that this entire website is moving as your ass estatic bundle directly on on on on I confess so let's try to try to replicate that so let's make a website ourselves my first ipfs website let's add some content to an HTML page let's maybe copy one of those pictures and see if we can maybe make this a little bit more interesting great so now I have some index dot HTML that has you know just a super basic basic website now let's add this entire let's add this entire directory to IP puss so and so I got the hashes for for this this website and so on and now we can go to localhost 8080 and get that content and so that we can see like the the images that I that I posted let me make the text a little bit bigger so we can we can see it oh that's right I need a body standards great and so like I just deployed like a very simple simple life saving so you should be able to look at it as well if you go to this let's see yeah let me pin it move it to the rest of the world I have a particularly aggressive oh there we go particularly aggressive like a firewall so if I'm and and and and that so sometimes like yeah being able to kind of move it to to a machine out in the cloud or fading service uh really helps so there we go like we kind of loaded it directly on on the global gateway and you should be able to kind of follow along and see it as well so yeah if you're kind of hacking around and and doing it as well yeah feel free to post like your links here and we can we can check those as well so let's see from that and by the way you can always come back to the peer list it's kind of cool to see like all the various connections kind of flowing and so on so we can we can also use kind of like this tool here to kind of explore the content as well let's me kind of browse the the content directly here so there's web UI lets me view kind of all the content that I'm adding to I don't to my PFS and that works for for any any any web site so if we like we saw before I can do I can like resolve the content for docs and kind of browse that and so here it's like the here's like the entire website for for docs there's a whole bunch of like a web sites that are that are hosted this way I think like the ENS management tool is itself and I Festool let's see let me see if it is things not I think it used to be yeah it's probably funny no matter Brooklyn yeah but you can grab any kind of content or all right because website or something that you find you can always put it here and kind of explore it this way you can get a sense of like the content in there and this this GUI tool also lets you kind of import files directly into into ipfs so like if I were to open the image is blurred directly I can drag and drop things into into this as well thank you you have to like drag it into the input button and then you know I can look at the content here and I can like grab links you know copy a copy of CID and share a link to other party so there's there's a I wonder if like maybe you'd Ryan drop will work yeah I guess so I think yeah didn't like that there was already duplicate name there we go so you can just drag and drop content directly into this web UI and you can add so this is starts pushing into out of the command line more into GUI tools we can kind of explore kind of adding adding and so on I think this way sweet so then we've seen how to like deploy websites statically and so on directly directly twenty-firsts now all of this stuff is made easy by a whole bunch of tools so I'll give an example of one here so fleek is is a really really good tool that lets you it's kind of like in that notify type tool that lets you just kind of have a github repo and if you kind of push content to that github repo the fleek will kind of follow along added to ipfs and then update a domain name so you can have like a bunch of domains kind of pointing pointing to this so in fact the the Falcon the kind of there's like a this well said I made recently called for Falcone ignite and this is kind of hosted with fleek and it makes it super easy to just have a standard you know single page website and so on deploy to github link it to fleek and then it'll kind of constantly pull that added to ipfs and then update the domain name I probably going going to into the minions here but we might in a future work trouble and kind of how to how to add DNS domains and ENS domains and subdomains and so on so we'll kind of get into that into that next week but you know there's a way of like having a really nice human readable domains map those two IP first content and then have that be totally automated by tools like fleek and other stuff that let you do this in a kind of a in a smooth way but kind of like the underlying what what elite is doing is kind of like the same operations that we're doing here which is just grabbing the content adding it to our professors grabbing those hashes and then kind of pointing a domain at the main to that hash cool so let's see how are we doing on time I think we're like at 6 now had a probably one one last thing I wanted to show for this kind of basics which is getting a little bit into into the desktop discipline companion so I'll try to do that kind of quickly and then we'll go from we can pick up on a lot of the more kind of advanced uses of ipfs and so on in later in the week and next week so great so desktop is a software tool so less less for the game for developers and so I started with a command line here because I wanted to kind of tune that for for hacking with ipfs and developing but I wanted to also cover the fact that there there are you is that that you can recommend to folks the core not developers and who are not used to installing things that way so if you go to I because that IO again and you go to install here you can get IP of his desktop and you can download the yeah we got to make this Intel press a little bit nicer but you can download here test app for Mac Windows and Linux so you can just download the tool it's very big because of electron and kind of bundles electron in there so happens to be like a like a little actual I already have it installed so I'll just open it so if I open I gotta kill my local tool before um let's see yeah so once I open I press that stop it got added to my to my tab bar let me let me do it again so it's clear so yeah if I open this app it will just add it to my toolbar here there's no maybe too small for people to see I think there or not yeah I have like a very experimental setup so I my this sub might not be I might not be working I'll show them of the stop working later on in the week but you know if you don't if you don't miss a lot with a command line and so on that's always just kind of like a dragon drop install open and it gives you this kind of web UI the web UI that we were seeing before so that's that's kind of like the main interface for for desktop so yeah this is the same UI that I'm that that this desktop tool would would open and so I quit my demon and started it up again so if we go back to the to the Pierce tab we should see a lot less peers as you add content and so on it's what's kept gathering more so like yeah if we if I go back and add content it will jump up again this should refresh them in with a lot more Pierce yeah yeah it's like lining up cool so then maybe the last thing I want to show is companion so companion is this tool with for the browser so let's go back to the install page and down here is at this companion and so this is a browser extension that's going to work with my local node to resolve content on the web better so let's get let's go to it you can get it for Firefox or for Chrome so you go for Chrome and so I already have it installed so um we have it but you can do with them inside here here I'll just remove it and then install it again great so now that I have companion installed in Chrome that means that my chrome instance can now resolve content on ipfs directly with this with this extension so I can start browsing all kinds of ifs links directly from Chrome without having to do anything special so companion is this really nice kind of stepping stone to ipfs being broadly distributed and implemented in browsers where you know if you build a new protocol for the web browsers won't immediately kind of adopt it and add it in you can have to get a lot of traction and usage before they'll consider that but then you have you have this chicken and egg problem of how do you get people to use the thing if you can't really use it in the browsers and so this extension is serving that purpose where you know the communities installs it and has it around and that lets a lot of websites and content be served directly through it with ipfs without having to touch the gateway and then that way people can play around with a whole bunch of interesting features of ipfs directly in the web without having to wait for for kind of a browser adoption great so now I have companion running here it's connected to my node that means it's gonna start like I can open the web UI directly same thing that we saw earlier and then I can also start looking at at web sites directly here and it'll start doing some smart redirection so if I go to say the docs web site like we saw earlier this is now gonna get redirected to my local machine this is might be too small to see it but what happened is that it noticed that that website is hosted in IVFs and it redirected it to this address which then works locally with my local with with my local extension and so that that's like a really really useful way of now suddenly all this entire website has been downloaded to my computer and is now served locally so that means I can disconnect from the internet I could like disconnect from from the rest of the world and continue viewing this page because it's now in my in my computer and can just keep refreshing it and it's just it's local great so I think the these set of tools so go up if s in the command line the Gateway for to be able to kind of give people links that don't run like with us and then kind of companion added to the browser to be able to kind of resolve links directly with a local node and then desktop for for users who kind of want a a desktop application kind of form like the the basic tools that a lot of people working with ipfs and building building things and I profess end up using most apps just use go FS or JSI profess that's the the one that I haven't touched on yet it's ipfs which is this this whole JavaScript implementation of the of the tool anyway this is yeah this website also is running directly from from my computer because it I'm using have defense I'm browsing it locally so JSF s itself is a yeah so a cool inclement ation written JavaScript and you can play around with kind of examples directly here of of how kind of how to how to use it and so on if you're writing anything kind of like a fronting application where you want to use that because not just to kind of distribute the website but to start doing something more more important by starting to play around with like the peer-to-peer network directly in your app like you starting to build like a like a peer-to-peer Twitter or something like that then you might you might want to use it it has to be able to kind of deal with all those connections and so on we'll get into this more much more advanced topic next week into kind of exploring how how do you see si profess how how to how to build applications with it and and so on so great I think that's probably most of the content that I had to to to cover today kind of summarizing we went through these implementations we looked at some of the tools we looked at how content is structured and modeled we talked about how files going to distribute through the through the network and through content and we kind of looked at a whole you know kind of host of resources where you can learn a lot more about about the tooling and and how to do various things and definitely go kind of go check out tutorials next week we'll get into into a much more advanced set of set of things around not just how to move static content which they're kind of this this workshop was aimed at but then now how to build how to build applications with with the tooling and if you're building kind of a yeah how to model the data for applications and so on so I'll take 40 I'll take some questions and then and then kind of wrap so hmm I see is there any both encryption available for a because just before upload right after download so the encryption is not yet built in so there's the the connections themselves are encrypted similar with with TLS I think TLS should recently the but the the content itself is not encrypted by default and I profess it's because a lot of the content is kind of published websites that people should be able to to look at it but the you can totally pre encrypt things before you put them into a class and there's a whole set of tools that are emerging to do that encryption for you so one that will kind of plug here is text out buckets are a way of kind of addressing instead of content and then kind of encrypting it and then kind of moving it around encrypted and having having keys I was gonna kind of demo there's a tool called ipfs sank which is kind of like simple encryption that I showed us an example of how you might do something like this so you can see like this this uh tool let's see how kind of companion it'll download a lot of data that I don't want to directly see so this this tool just like grabs some encrypted content and then kind of decrypted directly in the in the browser it's kind of downloading it right now and so this is kind of like a whole bunch of this all of this content was encrypted before I've hit my browser it hit my browser decrypted it on the fly and then kind of render it here so this is kind of like how you can send kind of like an encrypted little drop box like thing it's static so this is this is not a dynamic thing it's not a full solution but uh but you know it kind of gives you I a an example and you can even like rickroll people with it and so on which is a key staple of the Internet but yeah I think like there's a whole bunch of tools that you can you can use for for doing that upfront for you great any other any other questions or happy to I'll be on chat and so on and you can you can definitely ask a lot of a lot of questions about IP fest there and we'll have more workshops next week if there are not any more questions I'll wrap up this has been really great a good intro to hack FS the event and I'm sure we're gonna we already have four more events so really quickly before everybody reps or everybody heads off I'm gonna just run through a quick list of things most people I think are here for hackin fest so we're very glad to have you but you've got to make sure to stake the 30 die if you're having trouble with that we know there were some issues with credit cards and so please just DM somebody from youth global and we'll make sure to take care of that as soon as we can but you have to do that if you want to stay in the hackathon after this weekend after that will be sort of trimming out the slack just to make sure we've got people who are committed to the event for the 30 days yeah again just DM anybody if you have issues kickoff is Monday 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time we'll have a we'll have an opening ceremony type thing where Karthik one of the youth global co-founders going to give a short talk just enjoying the event Juan's gonna give a talk and there might be a few other small things but definitely make sure to attend that if you can't attend anything else it'll be a really good event highly recommend it and then just after that is when hacking actually starts so about 1:30 Eastern and like I said there are four more intro events got very similar to this if you're not familiar with the file corner ipfs eco system very much recommend people check their emails for the calendar invites we've already sent a bunch hopefully didn't go to spam but yeah check your emails and the easiest way to stay on top of all these events because we're gonna have a ton next week it's going to be even more stuff we want to make sure you guys are getting up to speed on things and you know you have the best tools available while you're creating your hacks subscribe to the hack FS calendar you can find that in the agathis schedule channel in slack let's see if there are any final questions I think I covered everything I needed to cover yeah again and WAN thank you so much that was super fast but I think people got a lot of value out of it and you can see a lot of great comments in the chat people really enjoyed it and of course this will be available directly in YouTube after this so if you weren't able to keep up or you want to go back and try something again this is recorded it'll be directly on the eath global youtube page any any final comments you're muted thumbs up from Juan comes up for me everybody hopefully I see you tomorrow for the events give me a wave as you head out we'll see it
