[Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to hakapes finale this is the amazing conclusion for our month-long event and uh all of you are watching this on each global.tv so for all of you that are joining us for the first time you can sign in and say hi to us and now you'll be able to kind of participate in the chat and ask us any questions and we'll also be giving out nft apps for everybody that logs in and says hi all right let's get started uh this event is brought to you by 8th global and for those of you who don't know equal is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and this is exactly what the last four weeks were about we ran an amazing summit around what's happening with decentralized storage uh for the hackathon summit on the 8th the videos and talks are up on the global youtube and you can also go to global.tv and watch the summit again on demand and today is about the hackathon so the hackathon just finished about a couple of days ago and we're going to talk about who some of our amazing teams are and what the prizes that everybody is going to be winning and to kind of talk right about some numbers this event has been massive we have 950 people who participated at the hackathon from 82 different countries spanning 16 different time zones this is one of the bigger ones we've ever done in addition to those amazing hackers we also have 17 ecosystem partners that are here with us and also 50 ecosystem mentors that were there to kind of provide any help on the technical side or anything beyond um we kind of put everybody on a map and just uh for fun to see where so many people were coming in from and it's just constantly amazing to me to see so much incredible representation from all continents all right and of course we are giving two hundred thousand dollars in prizes so today is going to be about seeing some of those uh teams live demo as well as talking about every single prize that everybody has won what blew our minds was that we had 197 submissions and teams and projects that came out of it so the last few days were jam-packed with everybody including us and our amazing partners going through hundreds of projects to see what everybody built to give feedback and decide who's going to be winning what prizes so we're going to cover all of that now and doing this in the third time in a row this has been our biggest event ever more than double the very first one we did about two years ago so can't wait to get started and uh i want to quickly thank all of our amazing partners before we jump right into some of our demos and uh kind of give a really special shout out to ipvs and falcon without their help and support this would not be an amazing event they've been an amazing partner for all of our events and it's just a pleasure to work with them so quickly i want to thank ipfs follow coin team and also polygon fluence the graph ceramic covalent lit protocol nft port oaps sonar sphere on table land orbit ballast xmtp lapse hyperdap radius and secured finance all these amazing teams were there to help all of our hackers and also be giving away uh handful of prizes so let's go into the 197 submissions submissions were due on sunday about three days ago and we spent all of monday going through live judging for these projects our amazing set of judges went through and talked to all these teams and gave feedback asked questions and that got us to ten finalists uh so we're going to be bringing on these 10 teams to live demo what they built over the course of this hackathon and before we kind of jump into all these teams i want to quickly first recognize all these amazing 10 projects so without further ado the 10 finalists for hacker fest 2022 r interform chain look uptick ghost share builder poly docs waypoint toffee.bid rip db and split protocol so i want to give a big congratulations to all these 10 teams we're going to bring them on to live demo uh what they built so all of you can also see and then we'll go into all the rest of the prizes and before we kind of jump into the very first demo i want to quickly take a second to thank 187 teams listed here um for the amazing work that you've done so many of you came in from uh web 2 backgrounds wanting to learn more about web3 some of you are kind of coming back to these events from whether it was new york or hack money or some more previous events from earlier in the year it's incredible to see the excitement that all of you have here and i really want to emphasize that just because you were not one of those 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough our goal is to highlight some of the things that we find super interesting through our judges and bring those teams on for this short finale where you can see some of the highlights all of you are still amazing and you're going to be winning a lot more prizes that we're going to announce soon and i really hope that you all continue to work building and finishing up what you did or if you want to extend continuing to build on what you submitted on sunday we really encourage you to do so and if you need any help whether it's introductions to people or technical help um or just overall any general advice please don't hesitate to reach out to me or anybody on the global team and for those of you who want to find out what these 197 projects were you can head over to eveglobal.com showcase to see all these projects uh now uh we'll be able to kind of uh you'll be able to see all the submissions as well as kind of all the things we're going to announce later in an hour all right so without further ado let's jump right in we're going to bring on these 10 teams back to back they're going to demo what they built and we're going to move on to the next team and then after the 10th demo we're going to be talking about all the prizes so uh let's get started with our very first demo for today and that is project interform so without further ado let's welcome the interform team feel free to get started whenever you're ready all right hey everybody um the project that we built for hack fs is called interform it's a web3 native form builder platform powered by ipfs paving the way for a new decentralized and censorship resistant way to collect data to put it simply think of google forms or air table but on decentralized storage our mission is to democratize access to data and build a censorship-free world let's dive straight into the demo imagine we're starting an activism dao in a country where access to centralized form services like google or typeform are strictly prohibited and we want to create a survey to gauge interest in our cause especially one that might be sensitive to authorities all while maintaining the privacy of our former respondents we'll first navigate to interform.app we'll be able to see our friendly landing page where we can read all about interform and then we can go straight on ahead and launch the app itself which will take us to our forum builder page there we can start by connecting our wallet once connected we can either choose to see a dashboard of our existing form or create a new form from scratch let's go ahead and create a new form now here on this form builder page you can see on the left the palette of form elements to choose from and on the right side of form canvas to build your form we're going to go ahead and start creating our form specific to our activism dao now as you can see we've put a lot of time and thought and effort into making the most delightful user experience possible when creating these forms you can simply drag and drop elements from the palette into the form canvas to start creating a form from scratch and just like any other form service you can also specify for each question toggle on the side whether or not you want the form to the question to be required or not and also drag around the ordering of the questions for your liking on top of that you can also see that you'd be able to specify whether you or not you want to collect the wallet addresses of your forum respondents now for the purpose of this very sensitive survey where we want full anonymity and protection for our users we'll specify not to collect the addresses and once you have created your form just click publish and then boom what you'll be getting is a shareable link to your form but on top of that you're going to get a link to your cid of your json data of the form that we've just hosted for you on ipfs via web3 storage so that it can be accessed by anyone with just an internet connection now let's say that i just received the actual survey link as we specified earlier we specify not to collect the user's addresses and i'm going to show you that as a user without any user authentication on the website i'd be able to input my answers and submit it without any issues boom and just like the form creation will be able to see a submitted response hosted on ipfs with its unique cid now on a quick side note have we actually specified to collect the user's wallet addresses when user goes into the form they will be greeted by this connect wallet screen where they'll have to connect their wallet in order to see the form content and once they once they submit the form response their wallet addresses will be saved on ipfs alongside their responses now let's imagine it's actually been a couple of weeks and we've already collected a good amount of data on our form as a creator of the form i'll now be able to go to the dashboard that i mentioned earlier and in a single view i'll be able to see all my organized existing forms here showing them in progress or completed also i'll be able to edit the form view it on ipfs view responses or close the form we're going to go ahead and view responses now seen here on a single page we've summarized all the responses for you fully equipped with easy to read pie charts to visualize selection responses and also seamless way to view the written responses now the real kicker here which we think is that we've talked about posting these responses on ipfs now imagine a scenario where a local authority crack down on our efforts they don't want to see this type of activism happening in their region they've identified our site into form.app and as a whole banned the region's access to our ip address now if this was a centralized service not only would the users lose x to all the responses but the creators of the form themselves would have lost access to everything as well but now since everything is on ipfs only with the cid anyone on the web only with ipfs.io or with a local node we'll be able to see all of the form and the form responses hosted on ipf's decentralized storage system just like this now the next question might be well if a government has banned your ip how will you continue to create new forms to support censorship resistant form building no worry at all for that exact scenario we've actually hosted our entire web app on ipfs as well via fleeq service so that anyone can set up their own ipfs node and directly interact with the site taking full advantage of the decentralized web and finally we've as sure through fallback we've hosted an entire code base publicly on github and we plan to provide the best documentation such that anyone can actually launch their own instance of inter interform and launch forms of their own as you can see interferm provides a powerful way for you to inclusively survey individual while protecting their privacy by having users opt-in to share their wallet data we embrace on-chain identity while ensuring that the user data is never stored without consent gone are the days of sharing your email once submitting forms our mission is to democratize access to data and contribute to a censorship free world hope you enjoy the presentation and thanks for tuning in amazing thank you so much for uh for an awesome demo and also for going first uh this is really cool to see and hopefully uh we get to see this also in production that everybody can use it so uh congrats and we are ready to move on to our next demo so without further ado i'd like to welcome sulil from chain luck whenever you're ready hi yes uh thank you party so yeah let me share my screen um yeah so i'm ceril and the product i build uh it's called chain lock so chain like you said decentralized blocks in analytics platform and it's powered by the graph and ipf so what you can do is you can build analytics dashboard uh using data from subgraphs uh so you can think about it as uh duo analytics but data coming from subgroups um yeah you can build widgets like line chart pie chart table and just by configuring the data source that is the which sub graph degree and you specify which fields you want to render other any filters to apply so all of this is a json and this this json gets stored in ipfs so the configuration and the metadata for vgs and dashboard they are stored in ipfs and the data comes from some graphs uh the graph protocol uh so let me let me show you a demo of one dashboard so this is a dashboard dashboard for your descriptivity protocol and it's powered by this particular subgraph messages ethereum so you can see metrics like total value log revenue total pool count this is an area chart for last six months of volume and this is the top rules of the day the usage trend of the last 30 days and this is a table on liquidity post based on aggregated data from last seven days so all of this data is coming from subgraphs and all of these widgets is the configurations are open and anybody can make a copy of it and make some changes if they want so yeah this is the configuration of this video this json so you can see the title type chart and data source is a graph this is the sub graph id here and you can see the entity we are querying uh there are some filters applied and below you specify the chart so in the x axis you will render the timestamp and the data rather in the area chart is called daily volume usd so if i want to make some changes to this one for example so instead of last six months i just want last 30 days and uh in the filters for a area instead of first one id i'll just do first 30 all right so you can see the preview here and once you are happy with you can just publish to ipfs so this this json gets published and you can you can see that here so yeah so the url will be widget slash the cid of the json and the widget standard so you can publish a widget and share it with others if you choose to or you can you can also save this widget locally which man which means you can use it when you when you create a new dashboard so i have saved this locally and there are some examples of a couple of other widgets which you can use as a template so yeah this is a simple metric that you saw earlier so let me save this one also locally and if i go to the new dashboard i can add those features so last three days this is the one we did and i can drag and drop resize and uh if i add other widgets as well i can put it here and um optionally i can also add like some text widgets to show some info um yeah you can drag and drop resize rearrange and once you're happy with it um we can just publish this to ipfs so yeah this entire layout of this dashboard plus the widgets it's basically a json underneath and that get published by bfs um so now now this is this json is ipf's integration and this is the c id of that one so sometimes it takes a bit to get stored in ipfs and while we paid i just wanted to show another dashboard so this is this is the same thing but the data is powered by ipfs so this feature the bitcoin prices so this is based on data coming from ipfs instead of instead of subgraph and in this one the data source is stable and so if i go into the details uh yeah you can see the source is table and then the table name is here and these are some filters and the columns here under so this will automatically generate the sql query required for tableau and then under the widget so if i go back yes our dashboard is ready and the url is the cid so what it means is that you can publish your own json with the same schema yourself and we need to ipfs and huge here it don't have to be created from chain lock so you can build your own private dashboards if you want um now any any user with this url they can make a copy of this dashboard and start by you know removing this one and adding some couple of extra videos if they're used to and then publish a new copy um yes that's that's a main essence of it so this is um pretty much live uh for use and the url is stayed locked xyz so yeah i'll give it a try and then by creating some widgets and dashboard and and if you end up creating a cool dashboard just let me know in this code and i can showcase here in the home page um yes that's that's it for me uh back to your craptic amazing being able to uh look at the graph data directly is a game changer so thanks so much for uh do this and uh for everybody checking it out it's already live so you can just go to chainlook.xyz and try it out so congrats thank you and with that we are ready for our next demo so without further ado i'd like to welcome the optic team for their demo feel free to get started all right my name is felix i'm here with dominic and evan and we created optic which is a web-free enabled video conferencing application to provide a platform for dial contributors teams and groups to host meetings online events and more first we'll log in and authenticate via morales next step is to enable identity via xmtp for our notifications so on our dashboard we have a pro version and a free version if you were going to use just a free version you can jump right into the video calls tab add your participants addresses and start a video call immediately in our pro section it works like this you pay 50 usdc per year and you will enable notifications scheduling and po-apps once you went pro you can type in your team name a potential token address and the individual participants you want to add here once you've done that you can go into schedule where you create a meeting you add in date time your title the presentation and the potential cost which is important if you want to monetize your content for example if you have courses you want to share you can upload a cover photo for that meeting and then you create the meeting this will take a couple seconds it will pop up metamask which creates an nft for you as the meeting host once the transaction goes through um a notification will be sent out via xmtp to all the participants in your meeting and they will be able to access those meetings in their notifications tab um this is going to take too long so i'm just going to jump right into one of the upcoming dates that i prepared for you what we can do here is either jump right into the call create a power for our participants or go into the archive so we'll start with the poe apps we created an open power which is free to use for everyone in collaboration with hyperdap all we need to do is connect with metamask and then we can type in the title a potential ipfs image link in the description once we create the poep we'll be able to copy the link and start the call i'm gonna jump back here once we go into the call we'll join our meeting and what we can do now as soon as our teammates are present we can open the chat room paste the link to claim the poep all we have to do is let our teammates know which token id it is in our case it's going to be number nine what we can do here is we go on to this link which redirects us to the hyper that front end where we connect with metamask what we have to do is type in the token id and claim the power once we confirm the transaction we'll be able to see the poep in our poeps tab on the dashboard back to the video call what we can do here is we can start a recording which is particularly useful if we have like something to talk about and some of our teammates are not present so we'll talk about our meeting record the call stop the recording save it and once we saved it we can come back to our schedule tab find our meeting and go into the archive so we'll go into this archive here we'll be able to upload a video or see one of our previous recordings that we did once you click this little icon down here it will take a couple seconds it will show us a video that we uploaded previously you can re-watch it and now i guess the question arises how does someone who is not the host of a meeting access those archives therefore you just go back into your dashboard and go into the notifications what we see here is we have a couple different notifications if you get a new notification you will have to first accept the notification which essentially means an nft and shows that you got the notification that you will participate once you did that the buttons will change into join and archive where you can join the meeting or go into the archive so this is another archive from another meeting we had dominican beat this a couple days ago we can rewatch the meeting and as i also am a participant i could also go ahead and upload any missing files or whatever last but not least we can go to our poeps tab and see all the pop-ups that we participated in all the meetings we participated in all of those are also visible on the test.openc we have our meeting name the ipfs link in the description in terms of our next steps we'll be probably polishing off the user interface make it a little bit more user friendly add a couple features create a pitch deck and once we are done with our testing phase we should probably be able to launch this in a couple months time that's it thank you for your attention and have a good one exactly thanks felix this is uh it's gonna be super awesome for a lot of doubts to use so i can't wait for others to try this out i wanna i wanna make a different observation but i'm gonna wait until the next demo and talk about a point because we're noticing a very obvious amazing theme for all these hacks so uh stay tuned for uh that one we're ready for our next demo i want to welcome goshare to them what they built hello hackers this is ghost share a file sharing service that keeps privacy and user friendliness equally serious what is ghost chair ghost share is a service to send files between people similar to other web 2 tools you properly use frequently but now decentralized and private but why our mission is to bring the millions of people who are currently using centralized file transfer services to web 3. in order to do so we are discovering new approaches to make file sharing user-friendly without giving up privacy in order to do so our core proposition is to make it hassle-free and 100 percent private with height by hasselfree we mean that the user doesn't need to have a wallet or pay for any gas and private the user does need to give up any email address or any private data but how does it works this is a simplified version of the underlying working flow when the user uploads the file the file gets encrypted with the help of the network and the encrypted file gets stored on ifps the corresponding metadata is then stored on our file registry contact which is currently deployed on the polygon testnet when the upload is successfully done the file owner can share the link by a custom link to the recipient the recipient on the other hand needs to request for access and the file owner needs to grant access the access is stored in our file registry contract and is the access control mechanism to decrypt and download the file let's go to a live demo i have two windows opened because on the left side i'm simulating the file owner and on the right side the recipient when the user visits our page for the first time you get informed that under the hood a wallet was generated which we call it so to speak a temporary account we can back it up but we skip it for now and move go back to this later on we can select the file or just drop it in and upload the file that takes a moment because the file gets encrypted stored in ifps and the gusless meta transaction register the file on chain i can now copy this link and share it with someone i do it on the right side as a recipient i now try to access this file we are looking for the file basically for the metadata of the file in order to request access for this file we found this file and request access sometimes it takes a moment between the communication between these two uh users because we're using xmtp so i try it again just waiting a second request access usually it looks like this um i have the possibility to compare these kind of emojis this is usually the public address and grand access when i granted the access emitter transaction gets sent to the smart contract and the file process is successfully done on the other hand i waiting for the access to be granted and then i can download the file the file successfully i can go to my dashboard or my account and see what files i already shared and with whom i also can expose my private key which was locally created in the browser in order to backup this session and restore it later on if i want to for the demo the service is live on ghostchat.xyz we are happy to invite you and test it out give us feedback in order to improve we also have a great plan for the future in order to improve the speed the overall use use the experience i'll uh i'll let you finish there just uh i think you ended up getting muted last second so we got the last sentence cut out but uh let me know what you were gonna say oh which this slide or this list there you go that's let's do this okay the most important slide so thank you everyone uh especially if global for making this nice um event happen as well as the enabling sponsors which you're seeing on the slide thank you very much awesome well uh thank you so much for for that demo i know uh sometimes live demos are tricky but we still saw what everything we were supposed to see for this whole authorization and download process and it's awesome to see that you kind of were able to do all of these things in a really short window so congrats again and uh we are ready to move on to our next demo and that is project builder and the best thing about all these projects is that we are slowly replacing every single tool on the google app suite so uh it's kind of awesome to see these things already ready to be used and entirely being decentralized so uh i'll let giancarlo go ahead with this demo hello hi carter thank you very much uh so good morning everyone uh today we'll be presenting builder the best way to build web 3 apps without code as part of the hack fest 2022 my name is giancarlo sanchez i'm a software engineer from venezuela and founder of topify so what is builder builder is a multi-purpose webdav builder platform with compostable modules similar to legos that users drag and drop into a canvas for a no-code building experience these modules are composable and interoperable meaning that they can talk to each other i'm going to explain you a little bit how this works so each component is an encapsulated module containing html css and javascript they can implement vendor-specific logic and integrate with other uh with other elements to provide a context to the rest of the modules the way that they do is by sharing a context and emitting and listening to the modules so it's demo time let's build a tab that allows us to mint and track auctions of msds with a built-in support chat deployed to our bfs so this is already running into the builder so let's start first by connecting a wallet module so we can inject provider and sign their context to other modules to consume then we're going to add a smart contract ui module that let us tap into an nfc smart contract deployed on polygon here we can see we can specify the control address the api the function target and this is the same with every module you can specify uh configurable components for them now this module is using the contents that we previously injected for the provider and designer right now let's set up a way to track auction prices for the nfts using a chart that is powered by a subgraph from the graph so as you see we can specify here the subgraph url the query the and how the the response is going to be consumed and printed into the access now if you notice uh the current graph or the current sub graph only imports values in native token currency let's do something about it let's import the context from covalent that will fix that and print and print everything in usd so you can see now the usb prices here and last and not least let's just import a chat support powered by xmtp so that we can talk to our customers or visitors can talk to us when they go and visit let's just quickly go ahead and launch this this packages everything every module into a web app that can be deployed to ipfs so this is our app right let's just get started on this and let's connect our wallet it's fully functional and you'll see that share context among everything a second so we sign so we're now connected with our wallet now let's just meet an nft we're gonna specify that it's gonna be our address we're going to be the beneficiary we're not going to have any reseller revenue and we're going to specify 2k uri which already they created and let's just print this for the sake of this is just speed it up so we can quickly see it afterwards but this is a process as you as use uh this now look into the context we already have a chart that is power and sd graph which is using covalent to display price and usds and you know if you ever have any questions you can just pop in here and use your wallet here to connect to the xmtp which is also configurable module and then here you can chat with me since i'm the i configure this to connect to my wallet so that's it for the demo just showing interoperability on composibility for no code thank you very much amazing thank you so much this was an awesome site builder that really understands what the web3 context is and hopefully others get to use this too and uh and gonna get started really fast well thank you so much next up we have polydocs and i'll everybody get started welcome thank you so much uh akshay drew and i are really uh so privileged to get to present today polydoc smart documents for smart contracts uh the core insight of polydocs is a micro app that's hosted on ipfs that allows one to both see a contract agreement that is immutable because it's being stored on ipfs and dynamic because it's coming through code and be able to agree to those terms directly through this same uh microapplication the the the fact of that agreement is then recorded directly to the chain is right here on the event log for this particular nft contract linking my contract address with the exact url of the agreement that i just assigned and this is significant because it takes advantage thing that it's like intrinsic to ipfs which is its immutability uh because both the renderer exactly the way it would be put in through a standard um a web browser because it's just a web app it's being stored in ipfs and stored by a cid which means it's immutable similarly is using a template we currently use markdown with just some tokenization to reflect what the actual contract is going to be and then those terms get filled in mad lib style from a smart contract identified with a chain id so sort of a global addressing but as of a very specific block height that means if you put all these pieces of information together you will always get the same contract every time and now you have a decentralized agreed upon source of truth uh just like the distributed ledger does on the actual transaction side now because we're doing this using standards for ipfs and with the uh and with the chain that means it works with the services that people use today like say openc for an nft and if you were to try to buy one of our signing slots uh openc would say you're not allowed to buy it and the reason you're not allowed to buy it because you haven't agreed to the terms for our particular community that this token is gating so once you've agreed to those terms and that's been recorded onto the chain you will then be able to buy that nft that way we're able to combine both the legal agreements in terms of these documents with the transactions that are being recorded on the chain so we try to make it very smooth for the customer we also try to make it very smooth for the vendor if you want to add this to one of your contracts first of all it's already in the wild it's in production on polygon you can this in this contract is on polygon right now and you can see that it just inserts one line that before you execute the transfer make sure that whoever the recipient is has accepted the terms of our particular uh community agreement uh contract whatever it might be otherwise it rejects the transfer and with that one lines being backed by an abstract contract that we have available up on github that one can just mix in along with interfaces that make it easy to work with your particular contract and then to make it easy to actually deploy just the contract you want we created polydocs.xyz which is an editor that allows you to modify say you know template agreements and be able to make them exactly what you want them to be upload them to ipfs and of course they're subject to whatever those terms are they're going to be specific to your contract which you can also edit you know edit your contract setting it to use a particular say template what tokens you want to have in it and be able to preview the exact experience you're going to have for your customers and what agreements you're really asking them to sign in that way we get both the protections of law along with the protections of the code of the the cryptographic uh distributed ledger so looking forward we're looking forward to making this safe for customers uh through having trusted documents and using templates you're no longer worried about having the wool being pulled over your eyes by some lawyer who's customized in a way that you're not really sure about like having a standard nda how many of those have we all had to sign and also making it safe on the other side by making a standard that allows us to protect things like intellectual property rights make sure you're within regulatory bounds of like qualified investors etc so that it can be safe for larger companies uh to be able to come in and be able to use this great technology to accelerate markets um you know beyond the wild west that we have right now basically take docusign as a centralized entity and turn it into a standard for all of web3 thank you so much we're so grateful to be a part of this competition and just a moment of personal privilege thank you so much to akshay and to drew who have been fantastic teammates to work with and it has been my privilege to get to work with you at least two weeks ray akshay and dhruv thank you so much for that amazing demo and i mean this is such a really interesting primitive like just being able to enforce some of these conditions is just a game changer so i can't wait for everybody to actually try this out and of course you can do that by heading over to polydocs.xyz so congrats again and uh can wait for this to be seen in the wild thank you amazing all right next up we have our demo number seven and that is team waypoint so without further ado let's welcome dan hello um okay i'm gonna share my screen okay hi uh this is dan oved and with louis parker i am presenting waypoint waypoint is a platform that offers true interoperability for the metaverse with waypoint you can build and mint a virtual world onto polygon or any evm compatible blockchain plus ipfs then connect them together with onshane portals without needing any centralized or private servers let me show you how it works so here is the home page this shows a bunch of worlds that have been created using our platform on the polygon blockchain on the polygon boom by testnet blockchain for now i'm going to show you this demo on rinkiby because it's going to run a little bit faster so this is worlds that have been minted on the rinkeby blockchain so let me show you how you actually build one of these worlds so what i'm going to do is connect my wallet and i'm going to open the virtual world builder so this is like the standard world we give you and it's very easy to drag and drop files and and upload the scene so hold on a second my mouse is okay excuse the controls at the top um let's do drop this in here and then i'm going to move this down a little bit drop the 3d model onto the scene and then i can add a video or an image it's very easy from dropping from your desktop onto the screen and then let me just hide this i'm going to mint a world with a scene and that's going to pop and i'm going to mint this i'm going to give it a name dan's new worlds and i'm going to mint it and what this is going to do is it's going to bundle all the assets i uploaded onto this screen including the video the 3d model and the image and create a scene graph which says where all these things are located inside the 3d scene and bundle that together and upload it to a folder in ipfs using web3.storage and then i'm going to create a token using all these assets so this is going to create a erc721 token pointing to the scene and let's see what one of those tokens look like so this is one of the tokens that have been minted and i can show you it's actually a fully interactive application nft so it is it's rendering the 3d scene all from ipfs and and also rendering the application ipfs and let's see what the actual token looks like if i go to the token here so what this did is is created erc 721 metadata and the token contains an image which which is the screenshot i captured animation url which is going to be interactive application that points to this scene graph in ipfs and then the scene graph url which is going to point to the folder that i just uploaded and let's look let's take a look at what that looks like so that folder will contain all the assets that i just dropped into the scene um and a metadata json which i'll look very quickly at which just shows where all the assets are placed within the 3d scene and this can obviously grow to something a lot more elaborate the final thing i'm going to show you is that you can actually create a portal to another space using a smart contract operation so here i'm in a space i'm going to create a portal to another world and that's going to open a smart contract operation and i can actually show you here that um it is this is the space this is basically the map of all the spaces and all the portal connections between them and this is all querying from the graph and in a second you'll see this new portal will show up or it should let's give it a second um there it is it looks like it showed up and if i put around there it is there's the portal that i created and i can go through it and it'll take me to um this new world and you can see here that there's a new connection between these two worlds that have been created so that is it for the demo i'm just going to quickly go through what's next video panel so the next steps is we want to make these spaces truly interoperable which means you can explore them as a glb format and import them into any metaverse we want to make composable metaverse spaces which means they can contain other tokens that can be detached detached and sold on their own we want to use multiplayer using lib p2p and we want to be able easy to launch community owned space networks uh for daos or nfts nft communities and you can access a live demo right now at wavepoint.on.fleet.co and uh that's it i'm gonna stop um amazing sure all right thank you so much this was awesome and uh not only that people can play with it right now so can't wait to see a whole universe of portals being built in and uh just try this out congrats thank you all right next up we have our eighth project which is toffee.bits okay whenever you're ready okay so hello my name is kai and i'll now be presenting my hackerfest project toffee.bid so nft marketplaces they play an important role in the web3 ecosystem especially as use cases for nfps keep increasing they're great because they let us buy and sell nfts in a trustless manner using smart contracts however they are not quite as decentralized as you might expect importantly they heavily rely on web to infrastructure especially when it comes to managing order books a crucial part of the application so whenever you place a bid on an nft you sign a signature and that signature is saved in a traditional web 2 database now this is problematic for a few reasons first of all we are relying on web 2 infrastructure which is not what web 3 is about and second of all every nft marketplace ends up with an isolated order book because they're all using their own system this is annoying for sellers that want to reach the broader nfp market and reach as many bidders as possible they have to deal with multiple nft marketplaces which ends up with situations like this okay so let's move to a demo toffee aims to solve these issues by creating a decentralized universal nft marketplace order book so i'm going to switch to this tab actually and i'm logged in with an account here and i want to bid on an existing nft so i can search for any nfts such as test.if an ens domain nft and i can choose to bid on this nft i'm not going to do this here because i'm going to switch to testnet for the demo the search function works on polygon and ethereum mainnet now for the testnet i've hard coded a search response this is a demo nft that lives on the mumbai test net and it's owned by another account so i want to place a bid on this nft i click on bid i see some information about the nft and i can choose to bid let's say 15 usdc and i can choose which nft protocol i want to use for the final settlement of the sale so i'll choose that the sale will be done over c port and i can click on place bid so what happens here is toffee automatically checks the token approval checks for the seaport protocol and it also does a signature request that is valid a valid signature for the seaport protocol so i can click on sign and this will create a bid now this biz is a signature that will be saved on ipfs and specifically it's saved in a instance of orbitsdb so we have a public decentralized database that clients connect to directly and data is persisted between peers using ipfs pops up under the hood so we've just created this bid i can switch to another account this is the account that owns the nft that i just bid on with my first account i can click on the incoming offers tab and what we'll see here is we just received an offer for 15 usdc and i can see that this offer will be done using the seaport protocol if i choose to accept it so i will click on accept and i'll set a high gas fee so that this happens as quickly as possible and click on confirm so what just happened is toffee fetched the bid signature from ipfs and all the relevant data for the sale and it then checked whether the seller here has already approved their nft to seaport and then it submitted a transaction to the zebra contract for the fulfill order of the sale so as you see that transaction just got confirmed we don't see any offers anymore because we no longer own the nft and if we go on polygon scan we can refresh our account here this is the account that just sold the con uh the nft we'll see that we have an incoming transfer of 15 usdc and an outgoing transfer of r nft and this was all done within one transaction to seaport so what's toffee allows us to do is we are leveraging any existing nft marketplace protocol and the power of these protocols all while benefiting from a decentralized public order book that runs on ipfs now as for the future of topic.bid there is potential to add more features to the interface such as allowing sellers to list nfps for fixed price and letting bidders fulfill that directly or other potential integrations with nft protocols but it could also be interesting to see existing nft marketplaces integrate toffee order books directly into their interfaces so that the nft market would be more decentralized and interoperable as a whole thank you amazing thank you so much for that and uh i think you kind of hit the note right there which is all these marketplaces only work if they're able to talk to each other and uh we can have fragmentation this way for all these uh different entities that are basically in the open market so i think this is a really cool solution and i hope that others get to use it integrated and you get to continue building this to uh probably putting this on mainnet so thanks again and congrats all right next up we have our sucking last demo and without further ado like to welcome zach from riptv okay my name is zach and my hack is called rip db and rip is a dead simple fast decentralized json store built for web 3 builders who want to move quickly and under the hood it's just redis uh and ipfs uh and i like to think of rip as a database killer but i want to rest assured no databases were harmed during the process of this hack um so let's jump into what is the problem problem is relation relational databases are a pain uh you have to deal with things like migrations context switching to write sql queries uh encryption key management is a pain uh and what's worse is they tend to be centralized treasure troves for attackers and they usually don't give users prominence over their data and because of this i decided as i made the jump into web3 i'm going to break up with sql databases uh there's all these other great indexers out there why not just let them aggregate the data and query them instead of managing any of that infrastructure myself uh and that worked for a little while but then it turned out uh i had a relapse and i needed to store some data off chain for myself that wasn't on the indexers uh and specifically my use case came up uh when storing merkle proofs because with merkle you have to store the leaf nodes off chain calculate the proof off chain verify on chain so i needed a way to store this data which was really sad to me but it gave me the opportunity to think from the ground up what would be the perfect solution for me so i don't like to store data on my own but when i do it should be really really fast for the end user snappy experience and preserve my own developer velocity so not a lot of overhead and also maintain decentralized redundancy and offer end-to-end encryption um and that's where the idea of rip came from i decided to combine two awesome technologies one is redis a tried and true web 2 cache with ipfs that gives you that decentralized network and redundancy so enough gab let's hop into the demo so here you have a website that i've built that points to a live rip clients you can choose a key here let's just say hello eath global uh and that key is what you use to reference your data you can generate some dummy data and you set the data and as you can see this is the main benefit of rip that one uh millisecond set time thanks to redis so your data is immediately available uh but then it's backed up to redis in the background uh which takes about two and a half seconds so it's a from an end user experience it's about a thousand times speed up uh which is pretty great uh and similarly with fetching the data you got one millisecond fetch from redis versus uh a bit slower from ipfs and then what's cool you can also purge the cache in case you're growing in a bunch of memory you want to reclaim some of that memory because memory is expensive and what that does is as you can see the data is deleted but you maintain a reference to the cid backed on ipfs so you can always get that data when you need it won't be that super rip fast as you can see 102 milliseconds which is slower than normal still pretty quick but you can always fetch that data from ipfs and then when you fetch again it's back in the cache back to one millisecond uh we also offer encryption uh if you connect your wallets via lit protocol they you can sign a transaction with them uh and essentially use that as your encryption key so when you encrypt the data and store it on rip uh you can see the data is stored in this encrypted format as a data url you have your encryption key which is also stored in the owner address uh and then only the owner of that data can actually get and decrypt it um so there you go i'm the owner of this data so i was able to fetch and decrypt it so that's pretty much it there's just set get and purge those are your three functions and the integration is actually dead simple as well uh you just import the client initialize it with the server url and then you can set your data and get your data all from the front end of your application uh which is pretty rad um so next steps for this i'd love to package it into a really nice node module so people can install it into their browser clients and uh just use it very easily and also potentially a hosted uh server that hosts rip instances on behalf of users if you have any interest in contributing or using rip please check out the discord it's on the uh it's in the readme of the repo thank you awesome thank you so much zach and this was awesome to see more devtools come in that make a lot of that easier and yeah being able to save a few seconds now and then totally adds up so can't wait to uh everybody else try this out too and congrats for demoing thank you all right with that we are ready for our last and tenth demo for the day and the last team is split protocol so whenever you're ready all right hello and welcome to our project submission for ifs 2022 the split protocol now i would like to start things off by asking you to think of the last time you went on vacation with your friends or family most likely you had some shared expenses that could have either been the rent for your shared accommodation your car rental or just a bill at the restaurant now you might have used an application like split-wise to keep track of your expenses but there's a number of problems that come with the way that we deal with shared expenses so far first of all someone has to someone has to advance money for the others which depending on the amount might burn a big hole into that person's pocket or might not even be feasible at all due to lacking funds secondly the lender is not not being paid back at all and lastly everyone has to use the same currency because the lender probably doesn't want to get paid back in a different currency than than he spent and that might be a big problem if you have shared expenses with different nationalities hence different currencies so this is where the split protocol comes in the split protocol is a defined protocol which lets you manage shared expenses it acts as an intermediary which collects everyone's split and makes a single transfer to the recipient once the target amount has been reached but what makes this truly special is that everyone can pay their split in any token out there because the protocol automatically swaps any input token to the recipient's preferred token but without further ado let's jump right into the live demo all right so now you can see the dashboard with all expenses that we are involved in meaning these could be either expenses that we created or that got created by someone else who wants to split an expense with us the dashboard gives an overview of open and paid expenses and all information relevant to each expense now let's go ahead and create a new expense shall we i already filled out the form for you so you can save some time here what's important to note here is that the creator defines everyone's split in the target token which in this case is usdc since the landlord of our villa that we want to rent wants to receive uscc but like i said before everyone can pay their split in any token out there eventually let's create that expense now all right so now that expense got created and we could already just pay our split here but let's for demonstration purposes switch the account to the other account that is involved in this expense i want you to pay attention to the avatar on the top right corner which indicates which account we're connected to right now okay so now you can see that the new expense is the second one in the dashboard here let's click on that expense to get all the information and be able to pay our split so now once we want to pay our split our swap model pops up asking us which token we would like to use in order to pay our split let's use wmatic in the background now uni swap is used to fetch the current spot price of wmetic to usdc we now see that we have to spend 1225 w matic in order to pay our share which is equivalent to 1000 usdc let's confirm that and confirm these transactions all right so now we can clearly see that we successfully paid our split if everyone involved in this expense will pay their split the expense would be settled and the recipient would receive a full amount that is the general flow of the split protocol now in terms of technology we use uni swap to swap the tokens to the recipient's preferred token polygon is used as a layer 2 to save on gas fees and we deployed our front end onto ipfs and we further have plans to use ipfs for other user-generated media and lastly we build our own sub-graph which we have to save on time and be more efficient which we plan on integrating into the front end very soon all right that's it thank you very much for your attention we hope you enjoyed the presentation and are as stoked about the idea as we are thanks jonas this is awesome and congrats on making an amazing tool that everybody can immediately relate to all right that concludes all 10 of our finalists and also want to quickly thank interform chain look up to go share builder polydox waypoint toffee.bit rip tv and split protocol for being our amazing 10 finalists and uh kind of being able to do all this every few weeks one obvious thing that i get to kind of recognize is that we're more and more seeing people build applications that they get to use in a more frequent basis whether it's around collaboration or common utilities that they want what the alternatives for so to me this is an amazing win because we get to see all these things happen in real time and be ready for all of us to use in production and on mainnet so congrats to all these teams and for the part that i know hundreds of you are waiting for we'll kinda we're gonna jump right into that so all the

project page if you head over to equivalent.com showcase or go to your own individual submission you will see which prizes you have won so if you missed something you can always catch up and confirm by refreshing your own project page on eatglobal.com and just a quick note on the announcements for all the prize delivery this is still a tentative list that means we are going to be verifying everybody's code bases and making sure everything was public and nothing was done before the event started so not all of these things are final if something comes up that should not have been the case for this event whether it's cheating or some miscategorization we'll be taking the next week to process all of that before we send out and finalize to finalize the list and you'll be able to see the final list by next week which is whatever is reflected on your showcase page and that remains the source of truth in addition all ipfs or non-ipfs popcorn prizes will be distributed by the youth global team by august 5th so that is by end of next week and for anybody who has won an ipa fast for falcon prize the team uh will be reaching out the protocol labs team will be reaching out to you for those prizes so keep an eye out for an additional email that covers all of those prizes so congratulations and we are now at the closing half of closing and not half of hacker fest so before we wrap everything up we want to say a quick few thank yous and really kind of thank everybody that made sure that these events happen as they're supposed to by putting in the time effort and work needed to ensure that we can do all these things at scale i want to quickly take a second and thank all of you as hackers for spending the last three weeks with us about a thousand of you were part of this as hackers over a thousand people in total that are part of this event from 80 countries it's just incredible to see such an amazing amount of excitement and passion in building things that you yourself are excited about so thank you so much to all of all of you hackers i want to thank our 18 judges that spent all of monday talking to hundreds of projects giving live feedback and advice and commenting on anything they can do to improve what they're building and without their help and support and comments and feedback we won't be able to do this uh this event um and this finale so thank you to all of our judges we had an amazing set of workshops and summits kind of going on and all these speakers made all that possible this is incredible content that you can use and look at and learn from anywhere from on demand to live and ask questions all this is also on our our youtube channel so being able to see all these amazing things being built in front of us it's just something you don't get to see anywhere else so thank you to all of our amazing speakers for talking about everything that you are building and for all of our amazing mentors and volunteers that were there to help make sure everything runs behind smoothly behind the scenes whether it was coordinating a zoom call with 900 people for judging to being able to answer questions that are technical and being able to help you get unblocked at 3am all these people were part of that process and want to thank all of them for the time they've given us over the last three weeks and our amazing partners that were part of this event from the very beginning helping people learn how to be better as web 3 developers and using different protocols and not basically spending all this time starting something from scratch and being able to leverage what's already out there in this ecosystem so thank you to all of our amazing partners and lastly i want to give a quick amazing shout out to the global team chloe donagh kevin k kevin i cree ouiji mini anna moaz luke emily andrew and jacob the the time and effort that he the whole team puts behind the scenes to make sure everything runs smoothly and can happen consistently at the quality that we are all proud of is is no small thing and they should get the right recognition for making all this possible so you have the best experience as attendees wanting to get more into the web 3 space so thank you to everybody that made all of this possible and before we kind of conclude this thing we just saw 10 teams present what they built over the course of the hackathon we call them our finalists but for those of you who are joining us for the first time you may know that if global is not designed to be a competition we call them finalists because really want to make sure that everybody's able to work on what they're excited about and it does not behave like a competition so officially all 10 of these teams are our first place winners and as part of being a finalist every member will be getting one each being a finalist so congratulations to each member and hope that you continue building this and pushing everything you built to be used by everybody else in this space and that's kind of our hope and we really hope that you continue to contribute to the what three ecosystem and uh with that let's uh let's wrap up hack fest also in addition to all the prizes everybody that submitted a project judged volunteered or helped out as a speaker we'll be getting a hackathon for being a participant and we'll be able to have all of you claim this thing on friday so you'll be getting an email for how to claim this shirt and we'll get the to you no matter which country you are located in so hopefully you also get away with some swag in case you uh i want to remember this event in a more physical form and look out for that email along with all the prizes polaps and everything else so congratulations to everybody that was part of this event for the last few weeks we can't thank you enough for being part of the global community and before we close this off i want to make sure that we get to talk about what's next and of course this won't be an equal event where we don't talk about what's upcoming after this so with that i'm super excited to announce our next hackathon metabolism that starts on the fourth which is next week we're doing this event in partnership with sora protocol so if you're excited about nfts and marketplaces and building cool creative things uh using zora check out xero.educable.com and participate in metabolism for hack i pass hackers if you're interested in participating again into this one you'll be able to see an option in the next 24 hours to be able to automatically sign up and roll over your stake from acapess to this event and we'll follow up again over email with all these details in addition to that our next in-person event will be eat mexico in about three weeks we'll be going into mexico city for our next in-person event and bringing on a lot more people um into the space so excited to meet some of you for the first time and also reunite with some of you in in mexico city and then comes ethe online which is going to be our biggest online event of the year it'll span all of september and we're going to be jam-packed with all the things that are happening in the theorem ecosystem and bringing on so many incredible speakers and covering all these topics that all of us are excited about and should be excited about and then we will see all of you at defcon with eth bogota this starts just before defcon officially begins so in colombia we'll be doing another massive event aiming to cross over a thousand attendees in person so anybody who's interested in attending deathcon can't wait to see all of you at eat bogata and then got a couple more after this thing then we come back to san francisco on november 4th for another in-person events bringing on everybody that's also still in the web 2 space into the city of silicon valley so join us in san francisco and we have web 3 weekend which will be a weekend hackathon that's online on november 18th and we'll close the year off with india which is going to be one of our bigger events in bangalore on december 2nd to 4th so a lot more things going on from our side for the next five months and i can't wait to see all of you again at our future events whether online or in person so with that check out each global.com for details on all these events showcase prizes talks anything that you will want to catch up on from what came out of acapest and what's up coming and i want to thank all of you for being with us here today and with that let's close off fs please enjoy some low-fi beats and we'll see you at metabolism so take care everybody and goodbye you
