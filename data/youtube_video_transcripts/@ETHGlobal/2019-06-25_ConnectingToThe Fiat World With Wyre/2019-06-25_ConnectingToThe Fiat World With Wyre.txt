so this isn't the main stage but you know we'll do here let me introduce myself my name is Nick I'm the software well first let me know when we're rolling on the camera if you want to record it perfect my name is Nick the software integration engineer here at wire and I'm gonna be talking about wire and why it's beneficial to you as a developer why you would use it and the ways you would use our products here at wire so who here who is not employed by wire has which limits the audience down to about 50% has heard of wire before yes hundred percent okay whoo yes who here is used wire before 25 percent for those on camera we've got four people here not that many people 25 percent is great so let me ask you this what have you used it for okay cool so nothing in production though okay sweet whoa would you test out me if you don't mind me asking what did you okay cool it's great use case and why did you choose or why did you look into two wire because that case obviously I guess my next question is what stopped you from actually putting it into production yes true story okay okay enough of me heckling the audience so perfect okay well now that we've yes more people come on in great so now that you can know about wires what we do I'll read here promote financial innovation by offering entrepreneurs compliant ports and are regulated fiat worlds so what that really means is we take we do the compliance we do the on-ramp we've built basically the trade engine for transfers cross-border payments all the relationships with the banks we do all the stuff that really developers don't want to think about we do that for you so then you can focus on building products so we take care of the banking and regulations you build products so that users can then ramp on-ramp from Fiat to crypto go from there feel free to interact too since this is really small private crowds feel free to if you have any questions ask them at any time or whatever is the case feel free to ask so for those that just came in the audience my name is Nick the integration engineer here at wire and thanks for having thanks for having me here so once again fintechs hard you guys don't want to spend the time actually doing the compliance doing the onboarding doing all the necessary back work that we spent past five years doing you want to focus on building your products you want to basically focus on bringing more users into the space to get on your platform and to do the things that you know you want them to do on your platform onboard them convert crypto I'm sorry Fiat to you crypto in under 48 seconds that's our fastest records if you want to try to break that the hackathon go for it might give you some prize money so the main thing here for wire what you really want to take away is it's really two products right we've got our widget and then our API and then within those two products really think about three things here thinking about accounts payments and transfers at a core that's what wire does alright so again what do we do perfect awesome one out of eight people got it counts payments transfers perfect so that's on a high level what our product does in order to go from Fiat to crypto that's all you remember from this presentation today and you go back and do the hackathon and connect with your widget or API counts payments transfers okay so when accounts basically you create accounts right your user accounts they go through a process kyc AML the payments you add either credit or the sorry debit cards banks and then transfers transferring from fiat to crypto what I want to focus here today on the widget so if you are using wire bringing wire integrating with wire into your application the fastest and quickest way to go from 0 to I want to say Fiat to crypto or 0 to crypto kitties or NFT tokens or ERC 20 tokens using wire is through the debit card feature on the widget what that means is that you got fast as a product manager says faster payments faster onboarding better user experience for your users so that way your users come on upload or put in a bank in familiar their debit card information and be able to buy whatever crypto they want and go from there and continue on on your platform does that make sense everyone yep questions so far so yep four contacts our CEO my care yes yep yep new oh just had a big launch they use our debit card feature so it's a it's pretty nice again what were the three things here to remember a plus all right let's remember his name give him some dye for price points this is where I can go into the demo here but I mean as you can see here it's really I mean I'll play the video it's really simple they put in there from a upload information right user inputs that was the the accounts part phone for the demo purposes just put in 1 2 3 4 5 the phone gets auto approved for the debit card or for the it's going fast but for the email you have to put a valid email address which will then send you the confirmation you confirm it and then when going through the process again we'll go through it here what part is this guys hey alright it counts great then payments and then everything all the the dummy data this is all the dummy data here is provided in the docs in order to use our test environment with debit card you just look at the docs reference the API read through there there's the you're gonna have to put the credit card number there's a specific credit card an expiration date and there's a specific billing address you have to put in there to go through the flow transact and go from there does that make sense cool sweet and then again our second type of product here is the API so with the debit card and the widget we provide the UX UI experience so you can then go from you know US dollars to die or to eath in less than 48 seconds but if you had the use case of wanting to create your own user experience and you know customized UI or other features that required you to do payouts or cross-border payments you use the API like in your case and your example yet earlier so think about the API I'm not sure I want to confuse you too much but reading through the docs again accounts payments transfers and there's a postman collection that you can use to get more familiar with the API so who here's use postman before cool cool cool some people use postman super simple I'm gonna head go ahead and show you the presentation right now on the on the postman we got an overview here of our buckets again accounts payments transfers and then there's one other bucket extra credit for subscribing the webhooks if you want to go that route you can do so without getting too much in the weeds with our API endpoint who here is planning on using the API for this hackathon suite okay if you do use it know that there are two types of authentication mechanisms and feel free to ping us on discord if you have any questions but basically this is the quickest and easiest way to use it is through postman there are different endpoints here so if I want to get my accounts I just click on get accounts send it's going to send back my account information all the information is in the docs just go ahead and have a read you're going to have to put oh I'm not going to open up that because it's going to show you my secret key and its recorded so that was a quick one I was close one uh-huh I've been created accounts again you would have to populate your own environments in postman and then just click a button and then you'll see back all the the JSON object returned so that way if you wanted to build your own ux/ui spirit or experience for your users you have that to play with as an open source tool makes sense sweet alright so let's go in here if I wanted to create a transfer cool transfer information have my endpoints create the transfer BAM comes back unconfirmed status you know don't want to get too much into the weeds you can then here go into I even though I am confirming the transfer boom hit the endpoint confirm the transfer goes into pending status get transfer boom gets it it's completed super simple transfers Fiats a crypto under 48 seconds very simple and that's that's really about it I know a short and I didn't know how you know how much in detail you know you guys wanted me to go into but feel free if you have any questions go to discord there's the discord channel there's our API documentation for the camera there are prizes so if you want to prize money pretty good size price a little under $3,000 and a few different tokens die and ZRX tokens for our joint partnerships here ourselves 0x and 4matic and basically hint hint we're gonna give most or at least will heavily prefer people who build for the debit card widget that I showed earlier there's a specific parameter that you pass in when initializing the debit card that's a destination address that you then send the debt the thief to or your crypto to we are going to focus on giving some of the prize money away to anyone who wants to come in and build a forward function or a smart contract that then replicates that wallet address with another address for afford function there's more contract address so if you wanted to do any cool things with with that type of implementation that's that's something that we're we're looking into so and that's it so we've got a you know there's our URLs for the postman our API again use our test account and test URL instead of production and feel free if you've run in any questions I'm here at the booth feel free to ping us on discord and yeah I've got some time for questions yes yep we've also yep so yep that's alright again quiz time what are the three things say it again payments accounts transfer ah perfect perfect awesome and that's that's about it you guys have fun focus on building I'll be here for you any other questions
