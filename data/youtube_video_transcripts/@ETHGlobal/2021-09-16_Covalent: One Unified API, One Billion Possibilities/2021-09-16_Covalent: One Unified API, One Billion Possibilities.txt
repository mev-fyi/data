okay hi everybody welcome to the covalent one unified api one billion possibilities workshop um here we have harish and charlie who are from our sponsor covalent who are going to be leading today and they're going to share all there is to know about covalent and the api um so yeah thank you so much harish and charlie for being here and take it away awesome nisha thank you so much for for having us i'm just going to to share my screen um can you can you see that okay yeah we got it okay perfect okay uh awesome well hello everyone um so hate to disappoint you i'm not i'm not getting swami who was originally scheduled to uh to present uh he's one of the co-founders um and uh there was an issue so he wasn't able to to make it so i'm gonna do my best to fill in for for him and i've got my colleague uh charlie baker here as well um so i'm gonna talk a little bit about covalent uh and where we fit in with the overall uh you know web 3 crypto tech stack and then um charlie will take over and and walk through some of the resources for the hackathon that we that we've got as well as provide an in-browser demo of our of our api so uh my name is harish i looked after developer relations here at covalent um and charlie who's just joining me he literally started with us on on monday so that's that's kind of how we roll here covalent was part of our onboarding to get someone new to present at uh perhaps the largest web 3 hackathon in the world with over a thousand developers so i'm sure charlie's not not sweating here um so let me talk a little bit about what covalent is uh at our core we believe that blockchain technologies can can change the world uh but this potential is left unfulfilled if that data is not accessible so we believe that data can unlock one billion possibilities it's in line with the the name that we've given our workshop here and these possibilities can be to help a billion unbanked people access and understand d5 services it can be to help one billion decentralized help build one billion decentralized apps or products uh it could be to help one billion traditional processes integrate and merge uh with decentralized systems so those are online with our vision of one billion possibilities uh yes blockchain data is public but only really on the surface to truly extract blockchain data and generate meaningful insights you need a middleware data layer connector and that's where we fit in the crypto stack so you've got blockchains like ethereum where the data live secure secured by cryptography then you've got nodes to access the underlying blockchain data and these can be nodes that you run yourself or through a hosted service like inferior get block or anchor uh and then you've got covalent which organizes and serves up all that blockchain data and and once you have that data there's no limit what you can do with it uh so we provide this key raw ingredients so that developers analysts builders can create a billion use cases we've indexed the entire ethereum blockchain as well as a dozen other evm compatible networks so the data is actually immediately available all the data is immediately available there's no waiting for indexing there's no 24 or 40 hour delay that data is instant uh ultimately our vision is to empower you developers and the pioneers of tomorrow by providing you know the richest and most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem so you can think of us as like you know the google blockchains um and and we provide this data through a single unified api which can be used by any developer at any skill level you don't need to set up any infrastructure there's no you know complex code or sql queries to write our api is the fastest way to access and use blockchain data especially in the context of a hackathon when you need to to get up and running and build quickly the covalent api is a developer focused product it's a simple rest api to pull token balances positions historical transaction activities log events across a dozen different blockchains and charlie here will walk you through how you can use the api directly from the browser uh you know we've got a strong belief in a vibrant multi-chain future which of course includes ethereum as the core anchor in the space uh and our api is designed so that you really just need to make essentially a single character change to switch getting data from ethereum uh and from polygon and a dozen other supported networks and again that data is is instantly available to you and by accessing this you know rich blockchain data uh you unlock a whole host of use cases uh many of which are are probably still unknown and are coming to line with the the torrid pace of innovation that we see in this sector uh some of the current use cases of our api include things like you know building crypto wallets to present your balances transactions return on investment portfolio values um you know broader metadata such as token concentrations uh volumes and distributions uh you can use it to build nfp dashboards so being able to show price trends liquidity uh the return on any collectibles uh you know existing applications or products out there like finances nfp marketplace nftx chain guardians these projects all use covalent uh to power their their nfp dashboards uh you can build uh dex and dow analytics password so of course we've seen an explosion of interest in endows uh and indexes so um we've actually got a custom api endpoint that uh that is used for automated market makers like uniswap so you can build a dex dashboard very quickly using those endpoints uh of course tax compliance especially as we start to see traditional fintech and d5 spaces start to merge and also being able to stream um on-chain data directly into into smart contracts so covalent's been around for for nearly um four years and actually started out of a hackathon where our co-founder ganesh swami worked out a proof of concept organizing blockchain data into a postgres database and now that concept is translated into a hyper growth startup company powering over 300 projects uh you know we've got over almost 40 employees we've indexed over a dozen blockchains and we got you know 7 000 plus developers building with us so so we love hackathons uh which we we clearly realize um is the fuel for innovation adoption in this web 3 space yeah we like to think of hackathons as being the the window uh to the future and covalent is not just an outlier but if you look at other successful projects like one inch polygon instant app these were all started hackathons so as you take your ideas um and you know what you come up with here at etho online the connections you make the concepts you build and push them forward uh we're excited to see what what you come up with then you know maybe some of you will actually turn out to be the the next hyper growth startup uh company that that we're excited to help support uh so with that i'll pass it over to charlie he'll go into some of our hackathon resources and also give you a demo of our of our api yeah great thanks for the intro harish um yeah hi guys i'm charlie uh as richard said i am the freshest recruit for convenient um i've been enjoying i've joined the api support team so i'm going to be helping them um develop the api and deal with requests um a bit of background about me so i stumbled into the crypto verse a couple of years back um bundled my way down the road building some algo some trading algo sentiment testing um then discovered the nft space and um as a few weeks ago i just recently launched my own personal nft which i'm going to share my screen and just albeit not on the ethereum blockchain but uh yeah that's a bit about me and um my recent part so i'm going to be talking to you about uh two main resources today so we're gonna be starting looking at the ethereum the uh the box page for covalent so this is the kind of main page you wanna be looking at to get all of your your key information to get started using the the api so first thing you're going to want to do is head over to the this page and sign up for your free api key so you click on this link here and it takes you to the landing page to sign up to get your api key um once you've done that you can then begin um interacting with the api so um best place to start that so if you want to be looking at what networks are supported here we have a detailed list of networks we're supporting so um to name a few uh ethereum matic phantom um and many more key point here which um here's mentioned earlier so this chain id this allows us to very quickly and efficiently change chain so what's doing query requests on the api um which will become apparent um when i go through it so this chain id is just for integration into the api so those are the networks we support next good place to look would be looking at the uh alchemist cookbook so this is a a great tool for leveling up your uh use of the api so here we have a bunch of tutorials how-to guides case studies and uh great references to to look at to um to build out your applications or to start here for your hackathon so we're going to take a look at the project showcases so all of our project showcases here have been built out at the back of hackathons so if you're looking to start building out a decks or looking at uh nft wallets or looking to do some multichain analysis for a project or a hackathon this would be a great place to start um with some high level details of what's what's going on there tools and some good code to use so now we're going to take a look at the uh api so you want to head to covenant.com api so when you go there this takes you to the landing page so what we see is a bunch of uh currencies all the currencies we support here so we support the um all of the main leading currencies apart from the british sadly with me being british [Music] so these currency quotes are quite useful for interacting with the api when you're doing query requests so um they're all standard ones that you'll be familiar with whilst using this um so from here we're going to look at class a so what class a is is uh this applies to all blockchains we support so you can cycle through the blockchains we support just through changing this chain id string um so for the purpose of this um tutorial we're going to be taking a look at ethereum which has the chain id string of one so we're going to take a look at check token balances for address which is what we have here so i'm going to be looking at the ethereum uh chain so i want to put one and we want the address string so i'm just going to go ahead and open up my metamask um i'm going to grab my um id for my wallet and here note we have a balance of 1660 dollars so now i'm just going to pop in my address to the address stream box i'm going to scroll down i'm going to hit try so now the api has fetched my wallet and the contents of the wallet and its dress so what we're looking at here these numbers quote rate this is the current uh ufc to um ethereum rate then this quote rate 24 hours this is the average 24 hour rate for ethereum to usd and then here we're looking at my actual wallet balance quote so this is um approximately equal to to be in a very good range of my balance we just saw a meta mask here so that's one quick very useful uh tool we can also do this using the ethereum name string so um if you want to take a look at demo.e to check the the balance we want to try that and here we see the balance of the demo.e which is uh 3416. so a great great place to get started whilst experimenting with the api so next we're going to take a look at how to extract historical portfolio value over time this is particularly useful if you're wanting to track whales or track any information on a wallet you want to be hitting up or you want to know what a certain person's been doing over the last few months so again we're gonna we've got my wallet address saved in the clipboard so we're gonna take a look at that paste that in and we try so here we have fetched the uh historical portfolio of balance for my account so what we're looking at here is uh the timestamps so we have the quote rates and then the balance here so this goes through um all the way back to the start of the blockchain so if we go back to it far enough we will see that my balance will be zero here when my wallet was created uh a short while back but as i said uh our database has the entire indexing of all of the blockchain for every transaction for each network we support [Music] um since i mentioned nfts earlier we're going to take a look at getting some nft data so in theory we can go again here and we can uh check out the contract address uh i don't know if we don't want to do that apologies so that for that we need to actually grab the contact address of the nft which we could grab through getting a get balance request for my account but uh i'm not prepared to do that so if you do want to do that you simply just grab the account address of the contract address of your nft um and then the id of the token to grab the metadata and then that will spit out the metadata um from the json and you can change the format of this string here through if you want it in a csv or a json it will come out in whichever format you require so now we're going to go ahead and look at class b so class b is um application specific and it's custom built to for the endpoint for certain blockchains so these are very specific to each chain so here we're looking at a rv sushi swap um very useful tool for very specific requests from each endpoint on the api and another fantastic tool we can use is pricing endpoints so what we can do here is get endpoints from a large range of time period from um from each each chain essentially so here we're looking at getting historical prices by address um which is a very interesting tool but what i think we should look at is getting this historical prices by ticker symbol um so this would be really great if you wanted to do some back testing with some modelling or you wanted to do some cross-checking with some sentiment and looking at um looking at trend detection or something interesting that uh i'm sure that i would love to do and a lot of other data nerds would love to apply so um we're going to go ahead and look at the current currency string which requires uh usd and then ticker symbol we're going to take a look at usdc so here we have the query string parameters so we're going to have a look for the last month so we're going to go from today um until a month before so so there we have that and we're gonna try this so here we return the um the historical price by a ticker symbol for usdc for each dates required um from that call so we've told it to call from the last month so it will be fetching uh for each date the individual price so as you can see the price is varying through the date but we really expect this sort of fluctuation from the stable coin that is usdc and that kind of concludes my brief overview of how to extract some great data and value from the covalent api there are tons and tons more documents and tutorials to get stuck in and i really advise uh you do so thanks awesome charlie thank you thank you so much and again great job again this is your third day and you've just gotten introduced to the api and here you are demoing it so what charlie kind of showed you was again just the high level really easy to use under understand api endpoints but there is so much that you can you can actually do and i definitely encourage you to check out some of our tutorial or how to guides and our case studies if you want to get even a deeper uh view into how to do some some really interesting analysis um you know as i think you you put it charlie you know we're basically empowering data nerds uh to do some some interesting interesting analysis with with our data awesome awesome does anyone have any last questions for harish and charlie before we close yeah i had a question um so i've used the covalent api and i use the meaning to get erc20 balances and i guess the trouble i'm having is the response time like it oh it takes over five seconds sometimes so i was wondering if if you have any comments on that yeah we're actually re-architecting our balance's endpoint because the the volume of requests on that endpoint have just exploded um so yes you might you might see some delays now but we're actually in the midst of deploying an architecture fixed to that so you're going to see a significant improvement in responses but we're just keeping up with the demand the especially on that balances endpoint where the traffic has just exploded over the last few months right for sure because i would love to like keep track of the response time correct because for our use case we kind of want to query that endpoint like a lot right maybe thousands up to millions of times so we want to make sure that the performance is a factor so if we can like uh keep track of that that would be great because we are currently evaluating options of getting erc 20 balances yep thank you awesome thank you uh and you're definitely not the only one this is probably a daily thing that we get asked so i definitely appreciate you you're being patient with us but uh you will definitely see an improvement when that endpoint uh re-architecture of that endpoint gets deployed for sure appreciate it thank you very much and then i believe you got a question in the chat if you want to check that out uh will it be compatible with the the new l2 arbitrage so i know we've uh we we have indexed we have indexed arbitram um any uh you know arbitram solana some of these other non-edms they require a bit more um resources to go through or to utilize to be able to index but um again what's interesting about the way we're approaching which networks we we index there's actually a you know an opportunity for the community to put forward proposals um on on what networks to index and and based on that feedback we actually prioritize um the the indexing work so um if there are any networks that that people are interested in having having us index uh put forward that that proposal uh and that gets voted on and if it's uh if it's sort of a you know a popular one we'll absolutely we'll absolutely index it i had another question so um how do you see the other competitors in this space because like alchemy is also like doing a lot of custom indexing on their on their nose right and then you also see other decentralized solutions like the graph and i think covalent is more of a centralized solution right you just hit the covalent api and they give you some data so how do you see sort of the other competitors like nodes also doing similar things and i got these like the graph who is trying a decentralized solution yeah great great question and those are all great projects i mean alchemy the graph they're they're all very very solid projects um we actually don't even we don't really see them um you know in sort of the competition lens uh you know in in the sense of us saying you know we're you know this is the graph what they do this is what we do um you know we like to think we're kind of rowing our own boat here and the way we've approached our architecture uh with our focus on um sort of an extract load transform so an elt um sort of pipeline that's that's kind of our our prime focus uh and we are actually moving to to decentralize we've actually already started that process so over the next um you know three to four months here you'll sort of see uh different uh steps in that process get executed as that network gets decentralized we do want this to be uh in the you know as a public utility in the in the public domain um in in a decentralized manner so that is absolutely the process we're going towards and i'd say you know our focus is on sort of optimizing this extract load transform data pipeline which is a bit unique from what you might see from from the other players in this space right right makes sense could you could you just explain what elt means yeah so if you uh and we're getting into the weeds i don't know uh with respect to the audience here if we're going to put them together maybe if not then we can have a discussion offline about that for sure yeah absolutely if you want to thank us in discord i actually got a couple slides on on this as well that i was thinking of going through but um you know when we're talking about just uh how you know the the user um is accessing their their data um you know typically the the process that they go through right now is you you know you pull out the the data from your data warehouse um it gets transformed and loaded and then you know that's the the data stream that you've got access to uh we like to do our you know basically present our data so that you can transform it at runtime um so if you need to aggregate to filter or do any sort of transformations um you know you've got the ability to do that in in sort of real time as opposed to having that pre-loaded um to to use so yeah if you've if you got more more detailed questions there sean happy to answer them in in discord if you want to join us there okay for sure yeah sounds good thank you very much all right so we've kind of hit the end of the workshop um i do want to encourage everybody to continue this conversation with harish and charlie in the covalent sponsor discord channel and i also want to thank covalent for sponsoring ethonline this year and harish and charlie for coming out and presenting such a great presentation for all of us um and yeah everybody have a really great day and i'll see you at the next workshop bye thanks
