hello everyone and welcome to the super hack mode Workshop mode 101 a guide to deploying on the hyper growth chain joining us today is Kat McGee who will be taking us through this session and with that I'll pass over to Kat to get the session started hey everybody very very excited to be here this is actually super special so I'm Kat I'm a developer relations engineer and today I'm going to be talking to you and introducing for the very first time love um I say first time because we're kind of still in stealth mode right now we're like in hot stuff um so this is our first like introduction to the world really Global for a very long time and it just made sense for us to jump on the super hack and talk with all these amazing sponsors and partners we are an L2 on op Sac so it just makes a lot of sense for us and it's very very exciting so a little bit about what the hyper growth Chan actually means um we have noticed you know through all of our years in blockchain that's there's kind of one big issue with it and there's a ton of like developers like building and there's a lot of projects but actually growing those projects is a pin it's difficult to do and you know turning really good code and really good Tech into businesses is something that we haven't quite nailed in Boston yet so the point of this L2 is kind of just down to a few different things we've got Technology based right into the protocol level that's going to really incentivize um have growth mechanics and have kpis and have everything that you need to just develop like a working application that's going to get users you guys focus on the code and then this kind of does all the business stuff for you and then also on the other side we're really focused on just growing an ecosystem in a community you know this this is built by like people who've been actually building hundreds of blockchain projects for like seven years or something so we want to support developers into doing this and we have that side as well so it's both kind of the technology and then this ecosystem of really good like people so why both so we're kind of trying to build this like whole big incentivized system that isn't just the idea of watching but actually is like on the protocol layer on the ecosystem on a community so the way that we're doing that I see loads of different features but these are just some examples that we are working on from me and not at the moment so we have contract secured Revenue so any developer who publishes a smart contract is gonna actually get some things from the transactions that go through the smart contract and this is something that we really really feel this is going to incentivize like you don't have to think about how you're going to make money your contract's going to make money for you immediately without any sort of extra stuff attitude you just have to grow that unethical sense of I thought to happen then there's like referral Revenue so this is the whole point of the ecosystem and the community working together so like anyone who repairs and developers new users new protocols is going to get a share of the transaction fee Revenue onto that as well so that's just like you know this growth ecosystems that's going to incentivize people very exciting and then there's also this dashboard and tooling and this is honestly what I think is the most exciting part of my mode in that developers can just like we can forget about all the marketing stuff and all the boring like gross stuff and kpis and all of there's like you know what kind of stuff you have to give to PCS to get money it's all it's all it's going to be understaffable it's gonna be chills and stuff in there and you can just focus on building what you're building and it's going to like grow and become a business for you which is I think probably the most exciting thing about mode so today um I kind of just want to go through like a deployment guide it's just an evm's gym so it's very very easy to do just like any other UB engine I think optimism just had a workshop there and he explained how this is gonna work and it's basically the same there's just some extra stuff because we are like a brand new chance still in high self mode so first thing you gotta do is um obviously super simple we're aren't you unless we are chin ID 919 so just had audition list and go to mode you can also just type in node instead of doing this link um and then you're gonna add that to metamask if you wanted to manually if you don't trust Shameless for whatever reason you can find all the information you need for adding it to metamaskup mode on network there's some other resources and stuff there too for just like deployment guides and our homeworks and the point of it and everything there too if you want to learn some more information after that you're gonna need to get to fully we don't have a faucet yet on Road so we only have a bridge so if you just get to pull you we also have some we can send it to you just message us on the Discord um or you can use this faucet this is a good faucet by Alchemy simpleleafosset.com after that fridge after that you bridge the Folia to mode so just break.mode.network super easy to use um plug in how much you want to you want to Bridge Over make sure you are connected with your supporia ethereum metamask and then we can also send to some as well if you don't want to go through this process just send us a message on Partner mode on Discord and we'll DM you and figure that out and get you some modes so for deploying it's just the same as anything else all you have to do is put us into your config file so remix you know obviously super simple as long as you're connected to mode onto the UMass you just Decor using using metamask and you can get your contact from mode Parts same as anything we also have a guide online for third web and we're working pretty closely with them we think they are just super awesome before getting stuff up and running so if you want to use third web or any sort of other tool just go onto your docs and you'll be able to see like a really easy guide for that um and yeah you just have to generate an API key for them with I'm just reading the message yeah with um mode Network logged in and then you're sorted so this is a pretty short presentation because I just kind of wanted to introduce mode um to the world which is like super exciting but we are offering 10 000 USD at the saxophone to some really cool wacky projects we just want you to build like cool stuff so we're about 3K given the best overall that can be in any theme anything like we it's just gonna you know blow people away so that's that's 3K for that 2K best developer tools super important because we want to be building up amazing developer ecosystem and user ecosystem 2K professors ai ai I think is going to be a pretty huge theme of this type of phone seeing some of the other prizes as well so this could be as well like anything your heart desires for AI we just want to see it integrated pretty well and then we have 2K for the most weird idea which I'm excited for this too so anything that you just contribute probably shouldn't be built just build it we just want to see like weird stuff crazy stuff stuff that you you know maybe shouldn't exist or we want to make it exist so we have something for that too just be crazy make memes like do whatever you want something that you've maybe thought of like that's a stupid idea just build it we want to see that and then one Champion prize pool you can see how to like qualify for that online for basically any project doesn't win any of the other prizes if you Deploy on those you're going to be eligible for the price book so some ideas um since we are a nutrient we're pretty much interested in like anything we have not much so far like deployed onto those so we're looking for anything anything you want to build like it's going to be super awesome but these are some of the ideas us and the team are just like super into so obviously integration of other projects we want to get crosstained get some Oracles in there get some like queries the graph maybe and a little sponsoring um I just don't make some interesting things there I think it's just another chance we don't have it yet on vote so that would be so so awesome just to build the secret system identity system as well is going to be really important for mode um in that as well because we're doing this like reputation system um referral system how are we gonna like actually have like you know civil resistance and identity on that gym so something for that would be like super interesting and something that we need data visualization so obviously we are working on a dashboard because we do have some like protocol level visualization so just more and more is obviously good so any sort of blockchain visualization tools it looks awesome like we wanted to just be attract users and stuff love that kind of stuff um you know user Focus kind of stuff like that Innovative D5 as well so stuff that's also crazy like there's so much you could do in D5 be crazy be weird be wacky with it um get some weird D5 projects like I think that'd be really cool you can also maybe integrate AI to that get some user-friendly D5 could be interesting um a construction anything of course maybe like an AAA wallet for most something that's like themed after mode could be really really cool um that's like also probably a pretty huge theme of attack of mine and just like we love games as well I know the team has like built a ton of blockchain based games and stuff and that's something that we're super enter so something that actually utilizes blockchain and a game pretty well and it's just like weird and crazy you just thought of a game that no one would ever play that you think that's funny like give it a go or there's like Instagram ads that you always see that are just like weird games they're funny let's just build up you know build whatever you want but we love games um some other like ideas for the AI prize providing Ai and dynamic nfts like we've seen AI um integrated like really well into like previous Global hacks and people are doing like some crazy stuff with it like you could just talk to a bunch in or you could use AI to do swaps and stuff we've seen projects like that they're awesome I haven't seen anything that actually like combines AI navigator please I think that's like a really cool use case so something that does that creatively would be really cool um AI for gas protection as well you could maybe like combine this with a kind abstraction and be like you know if you submit transactions with the chin it like that's the chin it's like okay well it's going to be cheapest if we do this in 20 minutes instead of nine so maybe you can like just load it and then it kind of extraction and then it like drops onto the chin or something it's cool so tons of ideas we're also interested in ZK didn't want to put it here because I don't think there's any VK protocols actually sponsoring super hot but having anything to do with privacy or damage groups on mode would be that's it um we if somebody will want to stress as well is that like because we're all about child build developers being entrepreneurs and really like build this ecosystem up and because we are still very early stages of mode we want to keep working with you we want to turn you into entrepreneurs we want to make your project successful and because of that we're going to be like offering grounds to awesome projects that are built here you guys are going to be the first peoples to go through our grant systems that's really really exciting um so if you're interested in that when you're submitting a project into each Global you'll be able to like click check a box that says we're interested in advance so just make sure you check that if you're interested in muscle reaching out to you um because you really want to get some like awesome developers building awesome stuff on mode and that is it so a lot of time here uh most important thing is to enjoy the hackathon we are at partner mode on Discord in the global Discord come and say hi we're always there even if you're not like talking on mode just say how I want to support you anyway um so yeah if anyone's got any questions Zoom chat is open feel free to send some stuff into there otherwise I think this was pretty short awesome cheers thank you yeah if anybody has any questions feel free to top them in the chat or take yourself off mute and ask away and if there are no questions then yeah as cat said definitely reach out to the team on the Discord Channel um they will be there and happy to assist as you all progress through the hackathon over the next couple of days um but yeah uh I think that's it so yeah thanks thanks Kat thanks for the great workshop and presentation um and uh yeah thank you all everybody else for attending have a great rest of your Friday and have a great weekend and happy hacking thanks guys good luck cheers thank you on the Discord bye
