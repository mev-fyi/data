hear me awesome we're gonna get started here in one second i'm just gonna make sure we have a few judges not judges a few people to give feedback i think michelle is one of those people who else so bear with me one second while we get this going so like last the last few sessions um you can sign up for it's not really signing up but um you're welcome to add your name to the stock i just dropped in the chat that's the order we'll be going in i'm going to try to give space to people that haven't done a demo before so um just be aware if you've already done something last week and we've given you feedback on your video i may choose somebody else to go um but throw your name on that list and that's what we'll be using hey dietrich hey michelle thanks for coming hey all right let's see josh you are the first on the list so why don't you go ahead um remember to so this is just for anybody who hasn't been to a demo session before um we want to know basically give us the idea of what your project is why it's important before you dive into how it works um you know the specific technical things that you've worked on for the past month tell us why you think this is important why you think it's useful and then if you have a demo hopefully you do uh that's the other thing uh we will be limiting this session to people who have some sort of demo um we're not gonna be giving you know time to people to just talk about their idea so joshua i'll let you share your screen do whatever you have to do and um go ahead cool thanks um so yeah i do have a demo um so this is hopefully self-explanatory it's user facing so it's not a tool for developers it's a tool for your grandma and everyone in the world and it's something that they are familiar with already hopefully a contacts app or an address book but this one um your data is automatically your data is owned by you yuck your data you own it and then you subscribe to other people's data and um so it's all decentralized you can see i have to do a little bit of work on the welcome page but that's not too terribly important when you when you connect there you're connected to metamask and then it goes and i'm using heavily relying on three box but you get presented with your address book and the idea is that you don't add contacts but you request contacts so right now any input any channel that a person would have in their profile you would be able to request access to their details with so in other words a channel is what i'm referring to as like their their email but it could also be you know golden dot crypto if you have a crypto account or e it could be um anything that is verifiable on their decentralized identity and so i'll just for now type in an email and then that would be all you need to send out a notification to the user that has a verified email address of what what you entered in and what that looks like on that user's screen is something similar to this request here where you have a person who sent a request to hello at bolden to get access to contact information do you want to allow it or reject it the contact information is in the form of a profile um before i get to that i can show you the log i mean like you have just a log of the different events that could happen so maybe you had sent maybe someone requested maybe you requested someone uh contact information you can cancel that request at the same time someone else canceled your subscription request did not allow it so you could resend it but the profile information is here and you could have multiple profiles so you're choosing when someone sends you a request you're choosing which profile to connect them to so you could have co-workers that you want to share certain email and phone number information and then family who you want to share a completely different set of information so you would enter in for work and some information and then you know all of this would then be yet another profile in your list um that's basically it um in terms of the demo i'm working on something much to show more than just this screen so a presentation showing about how the um orbit db stores in the back end are connected to each other how we keep track of subscriptions those types of things but that's basically it did y'all did was there any questions or so i want to do more than that for the um when i submitted and so that's kind of what i'm working on but for right now this is all i have very cool yeah it's definitely clean you've spent some time on the user interface which i appreciate um can you tell me maybe i missed it can you tell me the difference between a subscription and um other ways to get contact information right so people will be subscribing to other people's contact information the way that is handled is through a confidential thread in three box so um whenever anybody wants to update their contact information they would send that out to other people uh that would be a note so there's these threads in orbit db that everyone is subscribed to depending on what contact information they have um they have a subscription too yeah so basically there the the threads are being able to subscribe to the contact information uh was what was the question exactly though i was just trying to remember what subscriptions actually did yeah that's just subscribing to people's contact information so you don't have to worry about updating any of your contact i mean i can't every week it seems like my friends or family have a problem where they don't have my phone number or i don't have a phone number for one of my friends and so this would be i think a really good way to solve that problem and through using decentralized technology so that there doesn't have to be um a central place where it's all stored and it doesn't cost money it's not google or facebook those types of things yeah dietrich i think you're muted though there you go hey uh thanks i'm i'm i saw this one in the list as i was kind of interested in it for sure because contacts are one of those things that uh well seemingly simplistic and a little bit mundane they're part of everyday life that's also the backbone of how a lot of these applications interact with each other a lot of the identity stuff that you see so far is around your interaction with a service or a project but not necessarily around interactions with other people uh so i think this idea of complex context replication is is pretty interesting uh one a couple of questions i had were around um things like modification uh uh i see replication here but things like deleting or unfriending also things like gdpr how how is my ability to remove my own data uh or and or ask for other people to remove my data to unreplicate uh things like that yeah it's really tough this is a problem like you know so in the app itself that i'm creating um it would make it it would make sure to send an update to that person and the app the instant the application that that i'm creating would respect that but there's nothing stopping that person who had access to that store from you know being able to keep track of that one uh collection all by themselves pinning that information or whatever so yeah the application's built to make sure that when notifications come in that say delete the subscription that that person doesn't have access to that information through this app anymore cool one of the other things that i think is really powerful in this type of situation is the ability to take the same information and use it in other contexts uh i think one thing that might make a really powerful demo for something like this is be able to integrate this with something else so if there's an api that isn't just a regular http website a an example of how you might export or import or connect this to a different service would be a pretty powerful thing to show yeah man i so i really i want to be able to get to that definitely have a mobile app in the play store or available on android and ios i guess too but um making sure that this is a replacement for address books especially on mobile devices and then if it's on a mobile device you could have a qr code associated so instead of knowing someone's did hash whenever you go to request information well you can just pull up your camera and point it at a qr code and it automatically sends a request or you know uh handles it for you that would be nice i think uh what vcf export would be something that would be like super low bar iteration option as well because so many systems will just automatically one click uh support that what was it i'm sorry uh like vcf format like super old school but also a contact format that is basically supported anywhere and everywhere by everything yep yeah totally absolutely um i was looking into that format in turn but but i i didn't look into it for too much but i'll standards would be good yeah go ahead michelle so um interesting that dedrick started us down the path of i o and integrations because that's those that's exactly what came to mind right a network contacts app is is um measured by the value of how many contacts you can get in there um and how comprehensive it is so um on two fronts one is during the entry field like when you can type in any kind of decentralized id i think it would be helpful to give users some hints as to what kinds of ids are accepted whether it's um you know email address or what you you know whatever whatever you've got right um think of when you type in a credit card number and it kind of automatically highlights what type of credit card it is or you know pattern patterns like that that kind of encourage um encourage you to get creative like i don't really remember this person's um email address but i might remember their um their id from this discord or whatever whatever id system um you support the second is that um when you send the invitation does the recipient need an account um in your app to get it or can you kind of reach break through that wall and send an email or send something else so this this ver this current version totally it's within the app but the goal is when you enter in an email it actually sends an email to that end user and then that end user will get a on one hand it'll it'll be asking that person if it's okay for a user to subscribe to their data but they won't have their data in the app so this would be a way to onboard new people into the app the the email would give them the details they need to add their information into the app and download it onto their mobile device whatever it needs to be done and then accept that request from their friend yep and also like you know twilio or being able to send an sms if someone enters in a phone number is also um pretty important i'm trying to make sure that um the final form of this is going to be usable through any channel that they're on um we'll see how far i get yeah and then if next time you do a demo or you know in the submission if there's a way to show that like the threading updating the other records i think that's a really powerful aspect of it yeah so i should show like i want i i i wanted to show um two browsers and have them like you know feed off of each other and i hope to get to that point by the the time the demo actually gets submitted yeah that would be really powerful to highlight right now it happens in the console i need to actually make it happen in the ui cool definitely um you can you me even if you can't build all of this necessarily you can at least mention it in your video like these are my next steps this is what i plan to integrate in the future something like that would be good to you know the last 15 seconds of your demo video would be good to highlight there awesome i will thank you that was great all right next up is jay carpenter hello so i have a video it's a rough cut and it's about seven minutes long do you want me to play that it has a demo within it or do you want me to just um project yeah why don't you is there a way that you can do that but in a shorter amount of time like maybe give us a short intro to the project and then show a couple clips of the demo if you have it pre-recorded sure i can do that yeah so what we've created is the phone workshops global directory and it's basically a very simplified way to for people to publish their public key or and or peer id along with basically an index but the index can be easily converted into human-friendly aiming so that's basically it it's on github right now and the idea is that if you can find somebody's peer id and then connect with their peer then anything can is possible with a ipfs node so um let's see let me see if i can screen share and play a little bit of the video [Music] hang on believe this contains the video yeah here's here's the video um okay now i need to press something in the screen share correct to for you here to hear the sound yeah i mean you can either talk over it now live or if you if you have already recorded your audio it will be a little pop up in the bottom of the screen share interface okay share computer sound and optimize screen for video clip okay and then share this okay can you [Music] maybe not if you're having internet trouble i can play it for you i think just give it a sec unless people can see the videos already for me it's still yeah it's still loading i do have an ethernet connection um now this is looking promising and i can skip okay can you see that yes but it's pretty blurry okay [Music] hmm now can you hear it not yet oh okay um hello i'm jay carter representing the phone workshops team in the images 2020 global competition for step creating what's next for the decentralized and then show you a demo um using terminals aj i think it started to work actually it was playing and i i could hear the audio you guys over the last five years and things unfortunately you're slowing down a bit in terms of certainly in terms of adoption you want me to go back to the video we have a global construct but we are facing through so sorry let me just step through the presentation and um which makes it hard to use there is a link machine friendly address nation raises questions of trust for signing up so we've got this tension between machine friendly versus human friendly basically you can create something we created that is a global loud machine friendly and questionable human what's missing well we solve those problems with whoa i'm hearing both audio i don't know if other people are hearing that as well yeah i think we need more cores we need stronger computers it was definitely getting confused with that many streams going yeah we can hear the audio um it did stop now though i'm not hearing it anymore right yeah exactly here's proposal jay could you send that youtube link out and then we can take about five minutes to watch it and then we'll come back here yeah it's it's actually on the document where we signed up um along with the presentation link but let me let me drop that into the chat do you know where the demo starts because i could just i could just screen share for that okay that'd be awesome yeah if you just um if you just started about i don't know 30 seconds into it and then the demo starts somewhere around let's see about uh looks like around three minutes in how about i i'll stream soon okay awesome thanks sorry about that no worries so this is a let's see there let this is how we normally connect in the decentralized web with an ipfs spear we put in ipfs forum connect this long id and then go we're into a connection what if we could put in a simple bash dial 1833 hollywood and get the same result well now we can with the directory that we've created and let me switch over to show okay raspberry pi connectivity okay now let's switch to pub sub so let's assume that we do a pub sub connection using the same human-friendly phrase like this we hit enter and we're connected and then we go over to another raspberry pi and we put in a message and bingo we are communicating from peer-to-peer node to node over pub sub using a very human friendly identifier like this dial 833 hollywood now let's go over to show you what can be done in terms of a contact list which is also very powerful here we're going to go to this and now we can put in again bash and then dial but instead of just hollywood we can create different contexts like twitter or we can create linkedin or we can create the context of doing email addressing or better yet we can start to create services that are related to cryptocurrency transactions like eth or file coin and again boom we're connected but we've got a whole variety of different connection context that we can use so screen sharing again get back into the presentation so that's how some of the power of having a global directory that combines human friendly addresses to dance with machine friendly addresses so we have a experienced and seasoned i.t professional team and we're looking to create a new realm of decentralized addressing such as quad one ethereum quad one protocol labs one thousand file coin and these are just examples these are not operating addresses in quad 9 textile we're offering an invitation to hack fs participants to stake claim to two phone word directory global directory numbers such as one one quad one your name or quad nine your phrase and you could just send a pull request to our github account to do that you should follow along on twitter we're going to be announcing some workshops where you can learn in depth how this works and what the advantages are we're also creating an invitation to hack fs sponsors to become inaugural registrars and create an experiment with us a wealth of human friendly services in the decentralized web you can email me here and again follow us on twitter so now with the fun word workshops global directory you can connect the way you want to connect and you can control those connections yourself you can find us on pub sub at quad one phone workshops and that's what we're creating and we can now create and take the decentralized web to a new level join us that's it great michelle dietrich would it be helpful if i went back to the beginning of the video and just showed a summary or do you have some feedback now i i think uh uh some overview of value proposition and architecture from from jay would be great i don't know if that's in the beginning or if you just want to walk through that yeah sir why don't you just um i can either play the video and you can talk over it jay or well why don't i just talk um you guys can review the the video in the presentation um you know you've got links now but so the value proposition is that you know we're looking to create a human friendly uh experience in the decentralized web and we have all these you know different constructs that have very technical very um involved pieces to them and this is an attempt to usher in a new way that's as human friendly as you know we've been experiencing with internet domains or you know phone numbers it's more powerful than that than than any of those because it's completely backward compatible to a rotary dial telephone but it's as powerful as whatever you can create with an ipfs peer connected um so you know that's the value proposition um and the key is the directory you know how do you enter a public key and a peer id into a directory how can that be trusted what's the process for you know carrying title to that construct what's the dispute resolution i didn't get into all that stuff but um that's the idea and to minimize make it as friendly as possible for anybody and everybody to use that's that's the value proposition questions yeah yeah the uh yeah i've been like leaning on a century of user experience with regards to uh uh familia familiar number groupings uh that's that's pretty cool i'd love to hear a little bit more about the architecture so how the implementation works and um what what what you're building on i i some of the questions i did have were around things like uh not not just dispute resolution but also like number collisions and things like that yeah i think the number collisions are minimal because it starts with a 15 digit number we call a lookup number that goes from 15 zeros to 15 nines which is a quadrillion records basically but the key is that you can kind of map or overlay those look up numbers to existing telephone numbers or in in certain cases there is no existing underlying telephone number but you can map the lettering to the the numbering and create these phrases and then you know once you've got this lookup number combined with the lookup number is a public key and it could be ipfs peer public key it could be any public key could be it it spans the spectrum from what i consider to be what i think will be absolute anonymity to absolute definitive identity um so the the architecture is to create this bare bones basic basically text file that contains all these records but there's hashing that goes on that assures the public that this hasn't been tampered with and there's also a set of validators that um with a whole community of you know rewards for validators and trusted validators and dispute resolution all that stuff but it's it's the goal the architecture goal dietrich was to keep it as simple as possible you know the question is do we need another complex construct with you know phd level mathematics behind it to introduce into the ecosystem and so keeping it simple with the just pure plain text and the other thing is leveraging uh very very simple bash files to do the the lookup and the peer connectivity so i don't know if that answers your question but um the the core is how how simple can this be made i i certainly appreciate that aspect of it can you talk a little bit about how the so is when you talk about the index i agree that's really the kind of the correct part from an architectural standpoint uh is is this something that you're running when you're running your ipfs node uh is this uh or is this an entirely separate architecture and overlay on that network that utilizes different nodes you could you could think of it basically uh like a phone book so you know everybody in the world has access to look up these phone pick up a phone book look in and find you know um here's the lookup number for for dietrich and here's his public key and his uh ipfs peer id boom i i have a confidence in the phone book and therefore i can directly connect with dietrich um or you could do vice versa so the the lookup is you know well and and the way people use these lookups is they can go to our github and they can download a set of these very very simple bash files that contain the you know the phrase the lookup number and uh the connectivity to an ipfs pier does that make sense yeah i think so one one challenge that i would watch out for is things uh some of the architectures that we're seeing in other hack fest projects even are people who are running their ipfs nodes where they're uh changing peer ids pretty often they can be rotated so that there's there's some potential breakage leakage there uh and then um one of the other things that i would recommend too is is maybe visually mapping out the pattern a little bit because one of the things i think is interesting here is the less the implementation and more the pattern that you've identified and that's something that could be applied you know a bash script is maybe an example of how you might apply this pattern but i think you're going to want you know people are going to want to see this integrated into other systems um so a really powerful demonstration might be how this actually gets integrated into an existing situation where we would otherwise be faced with trying to parse out a cid or or a peer id or something like that that's one recommendation for uh for a final demo cool thank you any other feedback um couple questions about the like maybe clarifying how the um the the phrases are generated like i know in some examples you can claim your own custom name um but there might also be um a ton of utility in in being able to send the service like a hundred or a thousand different peer addresses peer ids and and have it create them for you um and then another question is uh it can these be mapped to um kind of leaf nodes of of a of a of a graph or is that kind of left up to the service after you've kind of after you've translated it or basically connected it to um the the service that's it's using um that's kind of behind the uh phone word yeah so i think it's totally mappable to uh leads and and different um chunks of the graph uh you know you just start to map you just start to create this so you've got your peer id which is you know running your daemon and then you could you could map an infinite number of uh cids to that peer id and have you know that peer basically uh presenting whatever cid you want um if does that answer your question and then in in terms of you know let's say that you wanted uh four ones and then michelle lee you could as a uh hack fs participant you could go in and stay claimed to that basically look up number that corresponds to that phrase now that phrase that the look at the number itself is going to be a set of numbers but because of the telephone number to letter mapping you can create you can pick the lookup number that spells michelle lee and then point that and then have your public key for your ipfs peer basically bound to that lookup number and then when people you know want to connect with you they can see the direct in the directory that they trust and they have a high degree of confidence that that is indeed your peer id and they're going to be connecting to you and then once they're connected to you you have basically it's up to your imagination what you want to present to them what you what sort of services you want to create that's associated with your peer id does that make sense so it's the key is the trust because with a peer id now it's impossible to know who's behind that peer id this puts some sort of if you will a brand associated with that peer id and and all sorts of semantics and contexts and trust and a set of services like you know 1 833 hollywood you're going to expect some sort of entertainment content whatever associated with that peer id and then as time goes on and you know that brand will has the opportunity to build whereas a peer peer id that's totally machine friendly you know without this has little to no branding possibility does that make sense so i could go on and on and i could spend all afternoon talking about this unfortunately there are some other teams here that would like to present so um i will probably have to move on but thank you for presenting um i know you sent your video to me and i'll i'll have to review it again the whole thing to get the full picture and then i'll give you feedback but remember the videos do have to be less than four minutes um for the judging session that's kind of the time slot you have so please be aware that your video needs to be edited down um quite a bit another key piece another key piece if i could just cap it off with this is part of the what makes this work is to have a market for these look up numbers so there has to be an active market just like there's an active market for internet domains for this all to work and i didn't talk about that but that's a key piece to the whole model and it has to be definitely mentioned that in uh in your video as as part of like you know you introduce why this is important why you think this is a good product how it works and then you know what's next marketplace is next what do you have to do after the hackathon is over these are important things to consider and it also has to be non-proprietary completely swiss neutral never be bought never be sold so that's okay thank you appreciate thank you awesome all right um all this are you ready to go i know you said you were editing some things christian you are still muted hello hey how's it going oh it's going uh not so easy do you want me to play your video or would would you like to play the video um i tried to the whole day make this video for like a test of a demo video so i have choice a lot of technique and to trim it to to three to four minutes so i try to show you can you show it the trial can i say yeah i could share for you unless you would like to and please uh stop at three minutes and go to the four minutes uh because the common distortion i haven't aided it okay i will share the video for you and play it and the language and the spell and typo it will be adjusted through the day i have some friends professionally okay let's see this they're good apologies one second i committed the cardinal sin of screen sharing oh okay i did share the screen sound uh share [Music] i'm working on three buttons interface and this on the headquarters for the collapse make some little case study um while i present the pbis of intention contribution and hacking uh my uh challenge have been that is not accessible and it's not easy to contribute and find out what privacy then privacy there and if i should have disastrous heck i need more progressive okay uh yeah i mean i mean the mouse rap should be more accessible and more privacy and pact to be procrastinated for me a pack is a good solution or piece of advice i try to make it here for example with three bi three bottles of interface press prime social or payment and use the functions actually i tried to make a timeline with heck if this adjustment for limitation and contribute or work on privacy in the ecosystem and hack [Music] in microsoft to be progressive as uh go the the weight to mouse grip and tbi the three button face uh did you say you wanted me to skip ahead to four minutes yes okay what can you hear [Music] nothing like i tried to tell this is just i've been interrupted i don't just show you some of my i'm working on people and trying to make a better project with accessibility plain line in microsoft ecosystem and used from when in microsoft it could be [Music] conformity i hope i come to to hack and [Music] is more accessible and more privacy and they're not possibilities for him everybody can fight me okay um christian can you just tell us in uh in your own words what the project is you you're muted [Music] i try to make the context special with look at what the newest not yet published accessibility standards for ue or who x because i'm artistic and i need i need and will contribute with some ideas and i can't do it at all but i have examples ux copenhagen he went people therefore to to ask for help to this ecosystem [Music] so that was my idea to go in and make just a little app uh accessible like at epfs desktop and then click save and edit files that was my context it's still uh but i can't give any code because all the documentation and the use of the home pages and the hacking is i'm starting from scratch and i can't find around it so all the big stuff with the [Music] commando and also can have not given me the heck option [Music] yeah i think there's a really um interesting concept here which is how do you take everything that's possible on the decentralized web and try to break it down into three buttons or three like three actions three links um that's pretty cool uh if you are um you know if there's obviously a lot of work here that you could take on but one way to simplify might be to um break it down into uh you know just start by having each of them be portals to a popular service so you have these a web page with three buttons each of those links so the file one maybe it links to filecoin and the social one maybe it links to metamask or another decentralized social service or matrix um and the payment one maybe it links to uh to a payment service and just start start there um and then once you have something in place focus on what you know one of the um three buttons at a time but i i i like that you're being so bold hold it just to say let's let's try to simplify the d web into three actions um so just you know keep simplifying until you have something that's yeah you know that that you can click and use and and then keep going from there yes you trick any anything else to add yeah i i think that i think the two things that aside from what michelle said that also like just even the name of it i was like tell me more uh with about the three buttons uh because it really is a lot of these applications very complicated but i think there are two things you mentioned that i i would encourage you to lean more into as well which is the idea of a pwa for this using uh edge pwas because i think that opens up the door to accessibility for a lot of people without having to install something and second is the accessibility aspect that you brought up uh like you said ipv's desktop uh it's very simple application and we've started getting some feedback uh from a couple of people who had accessibility requirements for the app we made these changes to update this desktop to make it more accessible and then that person who reported the issue took it back to an accessibility slack with a bunch of different people who had different assisted technologies that they were using and they really really appreciated the fact that it was accessible and that we've made those changes so i think that's something too where it's not often taken into account uh for decentralized technologies and authentic afterthought so i really appreciate that it's there in the design from the beginning [Music] yes so what i first saw by c5 one year ago i started in the epfs ecosystem and get users in esc and github and so it was the system uh to work as a center block in not to email but in the system and use the github i have some like you said some idea you two at the other and it have to that smile here be incorporated into the whole epfs system before i to the in the future i can make the file button let's that's not something i can do alone because why can i not just program some i think one button with file press it and save or load a file but then i have not changed the desktop of the ecosystem yeah one thing i was going to say earlier is i think it's okay if you know you said you're starting from scratch and you don't you don't have a full demo that's totally fine um a big part of the entire event was you know trying new technologies and working with filecoin or ipfs a lot of the people coming into the event where it's their first time working with them so um kudos for trying something new and um looking forward to see your edited video submission tomorrow hopefully you'll be able to edit it but yeah thank you adjust this payment i'm we i can't can't today or the next month make anything about payment because uh they only you only ask for stuff that can work in the chestnut i want of course later on using the main net of icon the new yeah payment system okay yeah definitely it'll be interesting to see uh when the file coin maintenance launches different integrations hopefully you'll be able to include so anything else yes my journey through this last month and the journey through changing the ecosystem um would be very interesting even i not make the three button solutions it said that been a very good time to take and put people excellent i'm glad to hear that it's been fun for us as well on the other side thanks all right uh looks like we have a few other people who have signed up for feedback um but just before we move on to them can i get everybody to turn on their cameras it's the last session of uh the hackathon [Music] and we're going to do the same thing we've done for every week which is just throw up the jay already knows it's week five here we go and then we'll just take a little screenshot and that'll be our group photo for the week oh zoom is cutting out my fingers gotta keep all five let's see how many we can get maybe two or three more hold the pose this is great your hands look great everybody all right that's good that equals a photo for an online hackathon great job um next up is dan and veraz for the shopifest team hey hi uh can you uh yeah hi can you am i audible yes yep yeah yeah so hi again uh hi everyone excited to present uh our submission which is shop fs a decentralized data marketplace so i'll just go through the presentation very quickly and then we'll move on to the uh to the uh gamble right so uh over the years i think we have seen like data being uh you know data has rising has been rising as a commodity and over the years uh the data market size has grown uh you know linearly over the uh you know as every year has gone by and what uh web 3 has done is with the advent of web3 uh the user adoption has really you know been very phenomenal uh what we have seen with plot either with blockchain or you know ipfs and uh with ipfs especially to focus on the ipfs that the data incentivization we know that you know it is the key in monetizing and incentivizing data and data content basically and with uh we have seen file coin uh you know taking good steps towards that uh but although we feel uh despite that what the you know the great work that's been done uh we feel there is a lack of a good uh you know sustainable minimalistic ui interface through which through which potentially both buyers and sellers can you know interact and you know purchase and buy purchase and sell uh you know decentralized content uh over the over web3 and uh and also there is a bridge that bridge between ethereum and uh ipfs that's missing in the sense that uh there should be more payment assets other than just uh you know uh file uh file drawing yeah so for with a shop fs we aim to you know dan can you just go back once to the presentation yeah so with shop fs we aim to you know cater to these two factors and uh we'll just uh uh quickly with this uh uh we are using these six head stats uh in terms of categories we are using three bots uh obviously the ethereum smart contracts we're using a fleet space daemon and throughout the dap we are wearing all the blockchain data through graph and we will be deploying the whole application to unstoppable domains and also we have a subscription model on top of the you know normal bind selling architecture uh which is powered by safety which is eip 1620 to uh you know incorporate streams yeah so uh i think you can go to the next slide once yeah so we after the hackathon we have had some good ideas and uh after the hackathon we plan to have a dow built underneath where we for every subscription right now it's free for every uh you know to create a subscription and uh subscribe to it but we we would we plan to have a dao model on top of that where we charge some sort of a small fee which goes into development of that tao which can also you know used to uh use for uh curation of content right and then yeah so that's it and then we can go over to the team uh yeah so the team members include me with us we have dan and shubham who's not here and yeah i think we can jump now straight over to the demo and i think dan will take over yeah so this is our road map currently we are at the second point yeah so yeah i think you can take over no hey guys can you hear me yep uh yes this is our landing page so uh we trying to make it as simple as possible is just to upload a file you describe the file and then you can earn fees for people accessing that file uh we support die for now but we can you can use any token on our platform so to upload a file you set a title uh i'm going to so uh actually before this let me ensure that we have a space daemon running locally a space demon is an app that fleek has a fleek stream has built which helps us create private content on iphones basically so this i'm giving a very uh [Music] like example description this thing to show you how this thing would work so uh in the background what uh is doing is i have spaced him and running locally so uh it we have to give the local file path to for it to run so it picks up this uh file name for the file encrypts it and stores it on ipfs and uh sends the thread info which is needed to share that file to our database i'm not sure if you can see my meta mask but basically i'm confirming the transaction on the blockchain so once take some time to increase transactions okay okay there's some bug here but basically once the file is uploaded you can see the files uploaded here and you can explore the files uh like for example this flows uploaded a song so i can buy the file which is like basically as simple as sending some dye i'm going to switch off switch over to another account which has bought some files because it takes some time for these transactions to complete so this person has already bought the file so i can just download the file so there is some bug right now it's uh i don't know why it always happens only while demo and bug comes so once uh once the file is downloaded you can see the local file path appear here and you can uh use you can view it from a local hard drive one more thing sorry oh the reason was i haven't had been connected so we also have a profile page for every user uh so this is my profile page when i'm logged in i can i can see all my files for sale the files i have bought and i can anytime go here and download the files and i can also see so this is the extra thing that we have which is subscriptions so i can create subscriptions for my uh for my portal so uh the way i do it is i settle what token i want and the minimum number of days subscriber to should subscribe for and the amount of the fees that he has to pay for a subscription so once the user is subscribed uh it's like so this is how i update my subscription info but suppose this fellow is subscribed to me so this guy can uh download any of the files uh that i have uploaded without having to make transactions at every point to buy these files he gets access and and at any point as i as a subscriber seller can come here and withdraw balance which i basically i get to withdraw the amount of die or whatever that is currently available for me from the subscription info this is the total deposit is given for 10 days but if there's if it's two days then i can uh i can download i can withdraw to die and at any point the user also can cancel a subscription which which i can show you one second so i'm just changing my user so uh if i look at this is the view for someone who comes in and looks at another person's users so you can click on subscription and cancel subscription at any point once that one when that happens in the background uh whatever the leftover balance will be sent back to me as well as the uh what is for the seller will be central seller i think that's it for the demo we have also we have some docs that you can explore to see how how we built it yeah i think we should move into uh questions because we do have a couple more projects yeah so dietrich or michelle you want to start yeah just just a comment i think it's really i think uh this stack is interesting uh you put together a bunch of different pieces um space demon using three box for identity and comments uh some of these you know what's feel a bit like common you know uh e-commerce interaction metaphors but with the twist decentralized identity uh crypto payments and the subscriptions thing i think is pretty interesting um i i i want i would like to learn a little bit more about the decision you made around how subscriptions are paid out it seemed like in the ui it was like per day like user can choose amounts per day or something like that yeah yeah so basically what we are uh uh yeah am i audible yes yeah yeah yeah so basically what we have used is eip1620 which is a uh which has been which has been you know introduced by sablier where uh what we do is we just based on the like we have just an input field of number of days minimum number of days that the seller wants to you know have the subscription at least and then the amount per day that he wants to have and then once that is done uh we a buyer can always you know go on to his profile and just add the number of days that he wants he wants to subscribe you know get subscribed to that particular seller and on the background we just calculate the start time the stop time and uh you know pass the day or call the uh create stream method on the savely on the eip1620 contracts so what happens is uh for every per second the amount is getting calculated for both uh the buyer and seller so basically they are entered into a contract for that particular duration right so uh and at any time during that during that duration based on the number of days that the buyer has set uh you can cancel your subscription and based on the rate per second based on the allocated balance calculated by therefore the eip 1620 contracts uh both the buyer and seller will get the the appropriate amount of share that they deserve you know depending on at what point that these stream was cancelled right and uh same goes for the seller if you like anytime you want to withdraw withdraw and get the die locked in in that stream that you know so at that time you uh uh basically we are calculating the current balance that the seller will be entitled to and at that point he can get only that much amount right and once the suppose uh the seller doesn't withdraw throughout the stream so he can do that once the stream expires he can then withdraw the whole amount at once yeah so that's how uh okay yeah great thanks for thanks for clarifying i think it's really interesting to power something like streaming payments like this with something like uh unlocking things from from a from file coin archive and that that pattern i think is going to be more and more common so i'm really i'm excited to see people experimenting with it uh one thing i would recommend when you're when you're doing a demos is be able to explain that that overall vision and architecture uh because i think it is one of the first times people really kind of piecing these interactions together and i think that alone is pretty interesting thanks for the demo thanks any other feedback all right uh thanks for demoing guys next up is uh unfortunately i i skipped over one team so we're gonna jump back one to code ego team iot and ethereum okay hi everyone can you hear me yes okay let me share my screen can you see my screen okay so hi everyone where team could digo i'm planning to go over a couple of slides and then just play a short demo video so we've built a decentralized app for um contributing and collaborating on firmware development for the internet of things and also for device management um for the for the internet of things so first of all that's our faces um okay and the project is has started at the university of federal as a research project for um making an open source community platform for contributing firmware and picking up from when manufacturers stop supporting a specific device and then it dies then we were proposing the code proposing the codigo network is proposing a community where developers could be incentivized to continue um upgrading these devices and users will be able to [Music] you'll be able to use the firmware contribute from the network so um yeah as i said this is the kodiga network but we've built the codigo hub on top of the codigo network which is a decentralized app for doing all of the ui work for both the developers so upgrade uploading and firmware for users for browsing firmware and also adding their devices on the platform and monitoring them in real time in terms of their status and also doing over-the-air updates directly to our platform and finally if a user has some device which has a request an upgrade but there is no available upgrade on the platform users are able to put bounties with to put bounties on their requests and developers are have a bigger incentive to work on them because they will get paid from the bounties of the users i think you will like our tech stack um i will the damn video will explain how we're using quite a few of these so let me let me go on the demo video is that something i need to do to share my my voice my the audio of my welcome oh my god okay as an existing user you can log in and you see a map of the man of the device is managed by the hub and their active status at the moment they are offline but i'm running a device on the background called the humidity sensor so let's add it the forms have been at the field for demo purposes and the hub will automatically identify that the device started because we are talking to each other through entity mqtt websockets assuming i want to find an upgrade on the firmware of that device i can search the firmware repository and i find something that looks interesting i can check the source code the details from the developer itself the community's called amount of downloads likes from other users and reviews but i can also check the profile of the developer i can see how long they've been active their community score on the on the hub how many firmware they've already uploaded to the platform and it looks good so i can either download it to my pc but i can actually just deploy it directly to my device it's easier and the hub will fetch the the file from filecoin and pass it through mqtt to the device that's it but now assume that i actually didn't find the upgrade i was looking for i can create a request as a bounty and set some amount of money on it to draw some attention to the developer community of the hub of codigo and now i'm waiting for the bond to be registered on the bounty's report smart contract the bounty went through and the codico is already listing it so let's see what the developer will do now i'm back as a different user as a developer and i can see the volunteer has been created i'm interested to make some money so let's check it out i can see the device affirmation and the amount of stake on it it's open so nobody else has collected it yet and i can read the request i like it so i have already actually implemented this fix so let's upload you upload both the binary and the source code to allow to allow [Music] easy collaboration and then codigo will read the file and upload it to file frame and also register with the firmware repository smart contract the contribution has been submitted so i can just go and collect the bounty and i should see my balance to raise by 0.1 f that's good i collected the bounty so i can also check my historical learnings on the platform visually and for different firmware durations and finally codigo hub is already is about building up your profile and making other users transfer contributions so the more you the more you contribute the higher community score you get and the more people get you test and like and download your firmware and the more users get to trust okay um so just to finish up what we would like to if we had more time we would also use the graph apart from all the texts all the technology that already using to track the history of a developer on codigo so it makes it easier for users to see if they trust the developer or not and also use unsuitable domains to allow developers to have their own crypto domain so it will allow users to go check their website before they decide if they want to download their firmware or not and yeah so thanks for the time and we would appreciate any feedback that that was super interesting and uh as somebody who worked in in mobile phone devices before ota for more updates are uh complicated and tricky business uh especially the fact that they often are um how do you say uh expired with regards to existing cves so i i like i really love the idea of a system for that or a like open marketplace for for firmware updates and bounties uh i i have a lot of questions around things like bounty validation uh i i think some of the interactions around the bounties would be really interesting too the bounty validation is the biggest one right like how do you like please submit a new firmware for a bounty how does that get validated i think there's an opportunity there probably more more complex social interactions but an opportunity for crowdsourcing some of the validation as well right like um somebody submits something maybe i'll remember the payment right and the payment too and that was the other part of it is like how can i how can i stake more behind somebody that somebody out of there i would like to be like i want a plus one uh add more die or whatever to do an existing bounty request uh that then you can start amplifying bounty values and that marketplace becomes more self-reinforcing and so i think there's some interesting opportunities and really interesting ideas here uh the the overall ui and stuff looks looks great um but i think the interactions and really optimizing for specific uh really high value cases would be interesting answering some of the harder questions around boundary validation um or because technically you could do things like external like you could oraclize result resolution of a cve or something like that right with a known vulnerability check but the complexity there starts to go crazy uh one other thing i think would be interesting here too is just from a not related to like your security use case was was interesting but complicated uh the idea that you actually demoed which is actually just like trying out um an example firmware for a device i think it's really really high value and interesting too um i've done a little bit of work uh playing with like the arduino ide services how you actually get new services registered inside united id for a specific device doesn't get projects registered there you can host your own you can just submit a pr and they'll add it so some type of dynamic integration with this service into the place where people are actually building these projects iot projects themselves would would be really fascinating i think that'll be that would be a pretty powerful demo and the process of getting submitted and added to arduino ide is pretty simple actually so that might be something worth exploring as well but overall the real really interesting idea um but i think there's some big questions around around the validation aspect just given the security vulnerability use case um just to give a note i we had some discussions about bound validation but our thought would be since both the firmware repo and the and the bounties repo they are smart contracts a bounties people can check that actually somebody has contributed firmware to the firmware that they're seeing and to the firmware repo and we are thinking something like uh as long as the firmware has been downloaded that many times and it has received that many likes then then you'll be able to collect it but it's a bit more complicated than the idea yeah that's definitely the right direction very cool yeah like really cool concept execution um i'm gonna say something like potentially a little bit controversial is i would say just stop writing software right now and go get users so go hang out on all the forums that um you know that people are searching for help or mods or or new firmware and um can we make your next goal to become the firmware source um for pine phone or for arduino or you know pick pick something pretty specific and become the go-to place for it if that means that you guys have to write some of these patches yourself so to build up critical mass and so be it right um but that i think once you become the go-to place like a lot of the volume and dynamics and traffic will come much brief um we also i also have one question in terms of the demo would you guys i think that um it's more useful to do a pitch-like demo or a technical demonstration or walkthrough-like demo i i like actually seeing it in the the overall flow i think that was that was good to see the the end-to-end interaction like both the the person is making a bounty or asking for something the person is uploading firmware uh what i would recommend is choosing your use case carefully because you used a cve it opened up a plethora of questions uh that that might not be immediately germaine and might detract from the immediate like value and impacts of the pitch because the class opens up it opens up a pandora's box of questions a simpler use case like trying out here's how you try out a new firmware for you know the that you know flips the light blinks the the hello world of iot right uh blink demo or something like that maybe not as powerful but also reduces the open question set in that short period of time that you have um you may you can address some of those use cases that have more complex validation requirements and maybe in your vision statement like this could also be used for and then and list a bunch of cool use cases like that um but but i think that so that would be my recommendation from a demo standpoint given that the time that you have for it yeah i think because this is organized as a as a hackathon which is a building software event it's actually for this i would i would maybe dial down the the pitch part of it the slides like by 25 or so um but have a little bit of both you could also also introduce what you're doing show the demo and then go back and and talk about your stack talk about um uh all the other things after after you've caught people's attention okay yeah some of the some of the best videos we've had from previous events uh do a little bit of both um the balance obviously depends on the specific project but um in in the info center for hackers uh the notion page there's a couple video examples that we'd give so maybe go back and watch those again just to see the different balance that some of the projects have taken just to give you a sense of you know what seems to be a good amount of technical content and what what is a good amount of pitch content because the reality is you do need both because you're explaining the project and then you're demonstrating it but yeah thank you thanks a lot for the feedback we have one last project on the sheet um i lost it but if you are oh i think it's john john are you around yes sir can you go ahead can you play the video for me sure or if you'd like to drop it in the um drop it in the chat you should be a little okay i have too many too many windows open right now sorry okay here it is got it i got it yep fin file here we go hi everyone welcome to the demo of our hack fs app fin file pin file is a python flask app that allows the user to input a stock or top 100 crypto symbol and the app will generate a five-year weekly chart and an excel file with the same price data users can send this data to far coin via textile io's hub where they can retrieve the data using a url generated by the hub let's take a look at it in action let's generate the chart for amd advanced micro devices the app generates a chart let's download a png image of the chart let's download an excel file of the [Music] chart let's make sure that we have our two files in our directory now we want to initiate a bucket and then we want to push these files to the hub bucket we would do this by [Music] i think the demo stop playing that second url we're going to use that later to inspect the bucket once we're done push our files to the hub [Music] pocket yes we want to push these to the changes [Music] and now we want to generate those hub bucket links one more time [Music] click on and open the second link and there we go here's our two files have been pushed to ipfs with our bucket id let's inspect one of them advanced micro devices awesome so what are some other uses right we could do a chart layover of two similar assets to compare their price performance our next steps what we want to do going forward we want to hook up the grpc client to automate file transfer to file coin add new apis for more granular data and metrics and we also want to improve the ui aesthetics and functionality thanks for watching please come visit our repo at the link below [Music] awesome video [Music] yeah thanks that the one i'm really excited to see some python up in here uh you know like i thought javascript number one of the two languages in uh the what 18 to 22 million of developers out there uh so i i think already like seeing some file kind of file coin in python uh mixing up is is is really really nice for the ecosystems all so it's very cool the front end seems really nicely executed uh one thing that i think that would would be powerful is like that you can you called it out right at the end you're like next steps here's what we want to do is is automating that that transfer from the ui from like what the user closing that loop between what the user creates and how it gets into the decentralized system uh so i think that's that's that first part right and and the second part i think is actually reading the data from the decentralized system and i think that that's also really powerful because then you have a way of actually viewing the files that other people created so i think the the the python aspect is great i'd love to see more of that um and maybe even a bit of detail about what you built there and uh to be able to interface with the system um that as a reusable library something like that would be super super would be super useful for a lot of people uh example apps like this so that people can follow down the tracks that you you've created here um but i think from a value proposition to the end user the ability to share directly to the decentralized system from the app is key and then the ability to either like index and index and read other views that people have created and pull those down into your like like you've created this kind of way really nice clean generic viewer of this data too on the front end and be able to reuse that might be able to pull other people's stuff from the from from the network as well would be would be pretty rad so if you use something like ipld to be able to link a bunch of these different so if you had a root c id that you actually added other people's visualizations to and were able to link from there i think that would be pretty cool because you could see the set of different visualizations that other people had created um so a bunch of opportunity here but um you know from the front perspective really nice and clean ui and uh excited to see some more michelle did you have anything uh john you muted here we go uh yeah sorry about that um i think if i had three more days i could have accomplished the uh the automation with grpc um i had you know gone down the rabbit hole with it had never experienced it before and uh and and i was there but i wanted to concentrate on making the video and make sure that it was top-notch but but that's that's my next mission absolutely yeah um the video does a great job i think telling telling a story a really simple story and it's very clean um and an architecture diagram at this point would would be interesting to look at just because um you know you have so many other visuals and and you've got that nice front end so i'm kind of highlighting both for your project and for other projects how um how they they all stitch together nice asset to the presentation i i want to second that for all the projects i mean if it's not too late for folks to add to your demos and videos uh one of the unique aspects of of this stack is the complexity of its topology we have different nodes in different places and they sometimes reside multiple nodes on our local machine sometimes there are you know global networks they're hooking into and other times there are specific services that they're hooking into as well like like flea quarter textile so overall like giving giving the judges a view to what the topology of services and nodes are uh i think for all these projects that's something i would highly recommend you know what one slide in every and every deck that has that that architecture overview would be fantastic awesome thank you guys appreciate it all right that is it unless there are any final comments from judges but judges uh dietrich and michelle whatever role you want to be in that's we appreciate you contributing to this session um i know i i could not have uh carried it on my own so this was awesome thanks everybody yeah we can we can wrap um there's a little bit more than 24 hours to you know make some last-minute edits um get things wrapped up so good luck to everybody um i'll be in the slack uh so ping me if you want me to review your video or check some edits and make sure it's four minutes long you know it might seem impossible but try to trim it down try to express your concept in in simple terms you know it doesn't have to be this very detailed explanation it's often better if you boil it down to its core concepts rather than trying to you know have this really long explanation of what your product is so it's gonna seem hard but you can do it i i believe in everybody you know uh you've come this far you've you've been building for a month so one more day of editing and trimming i'm confident in everybody's abilities to do this so good luck we'll see you tomorrow or at least virtually in the slack sometime around submission maybe hey everybody hi
