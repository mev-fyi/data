awesome we're good to go hello everyone thank you so much for joining yet another east global workshop for road to web 3. i'm super excited to have everyone here i'm also really excited to have peter from sequins doing a workshop on building seamless web through experiences with sequence wallet um with that being said questions go into the zoom chat peter will be answering them at the end and i'll pass the mic off to peter thank you very much anna hello everyone thank you for joining today hope you guys are having a great event uh the youth global events are always a really incredible place to kind of learn and meet people so um yeah really honored to be here and share with some of the work that we're working on um yeah so today i'm going to be taking you through a little workshop on how to build seamless experiences for web 3 using sequence so what is sequence well sequence is actually an ethereum wallet designed to make web3 simple fun and accessible for everyone and obviously as we're looking at ethereum it's really it has a wallet it's it's really important to kind of look at where ethereum's been and where ethereum's go going and how it's kind of what's its evolution and ethereum as we know it today whereas we knew it like a year ago and as we know it today it's actually evolved quite a bit um it's not just a single chain anymore and a single layer one main net that everyone's interacting with and deploying everything to um it's actually an ecosystem of chains it's a we're a network of ethereum compatible chains we have polynomial optimism arbitrary smart training phantom and avalanche and and a bunch more um and so and now there's again there's these are all evm json rpc compatible blockchains that are all kind of speaking the same protocol which is very very cool and interesting makes you think about you know again what's its further evolution and where this is all going um and of course when you look at you know this imagery i love this imagery and you look at this individual kind of interfacing with these this web three you look at like the single point of access and you see that the wallet um is that interface it's the interface to derive these chains and access these different networks in a way that's seamless so the wallet plays a really key role in how you in your gateway to accessing these different web 3 networks and that's why we're kind of today and so and when you think about you know wallets and web 3 and all these different things and you there's still a lot of user experience challenges that um that are real and users are faced with today um and again it just comes down from you know as a kind of an iteration evolution of a new set of protocols that are that are needed to be able to be supported well supported um with some new kind of paradigms um but these are some common you know challenges and issues that people have faced so i know if you guys have ever tried you know your first time in web 3 or in ethereum or something you come up on a website and it says okay well uh you got to sell a chrome extension you know before you can even access it and you're like well why do i need a chrome extension that's kind of confusing and then so you got to get that chrome extension right it's kind of a chrome extension's very powerful but it's kind of a pro user level thing it's a bit jarring to be jumping into that right away and then you get the chrome extension or your wallet and you're like okay now warning warning warning you know seed words make sure you do that um that's that's kind of a little bit scary you know it's definitely kind of something new and then in other instances when you're perhaps logging into a new computer you're like okay how do i get that wallet set up so now i've got to start handling these really delicate private keys and seed words that has full access and full control of my wallet it's kind of it's a bit also scary and very error-prone and you know again it's easy to kind of misuse or understand it's um it's kind of power and then you come up on gas you're like what is gas like what is what's the gas price what price should i use and what's the limit like and what's it what's how much does it cost and you know what's a nonce and things like this right um and then you finally learn about gas and you start saying okay well where do i you realize you get you need to eat if you're into the basic inner currency to go and execute you know pay for your gas you're like well where do i get these how do i get ether in my wallet in the first place that's not so easy um and then you know in other instances you know as a wallet experience perhaps your friend sent you an nft and you're checking your wallet and it's like no it's not here like so where's that maybe you tried executing a transaction and you're like the transaction's stuck you know you try to try to fire a transaction it's just taking forever to you know either tell me it's gonna take you four hours or something like this because you know you misprice the gas it's kind of annoying you gotta speed it up or cancel it's really uh you know it's not great not a great not a seamless experience um perhaps it's too expensive you know it's very expensive to send a transaction to do something kind of you know perhaps simple and of course that's why we have all the great layer twos and sidechains that are that are helping with that um but yeah so again you again consider the evolution as it relates to infrastructure and as it relates to user experience and how they all come together to build something very integrated and that's kind of the point of all of this um or the the point of the kind of the ends end game solution and then what if you have your wallet on a computer and your computer gets hacked or stolen um you know you lose it someone breaks into your car or you you forget your phone in a taxi cab you know you kind of you got your single private key in there right so there's definitely some protection but you i would be kind of nervous you know i'm gonna be like oh i gotta rotate my private key i can't really do that i can't change the underlying key that has control to my wallet at least in the standard state of the world and so and then we look upon you know again evolution we look at layer two future you know the kind of layer two networks that we have which are doing amazing things but now it creates a new set of challenges because again if there's not one network anymore it's it's many networks and actually i would say even in the next four months it's going to be other sub networks and it's going to be it's going to be hundreds of networks that are ethereum compatible actually maybe thousands i can see that too um and so yeah but again they'd solve a lot of they solve problems with one hand but then they created a bit of fragmentation and friction on the other hand um users have to start understanding these different network names dapps are deployed on different places and you again you need now you need a new currency you need a new gas currency perhaps you need manic or avax things like this um and then how do you get it on the network and then how do you switch networks and all these things right and then and then you're like well i want to buy some usdc or something how do i get that right where do i go to buy this buy the currency i mean how do i move you know currencies across different networks as they're kind of obviously part and parcel of the design so all of these things all together um are the opposite of seamless right so again we have to solve all this this is what we have to do and as an ecosystem what's incredible is it's happening right like it's not just me it's a lot and thousands and thousands of people who are all working towards this and doing really cool stuff um and really are building ethereum as an ecosystem of chains that feels like one network and that's it's gonna happen it's a matter of time it's already we're not we're really not far as an ecosystem so now looking at kind of sequencing the architecture and how it all works and how we've approached it i wanted to share with you guys some of again some of the some of the internals um and what makes it a bit unique and how we've you know how we design our architecture to solve for these problems so first and foremost what's pretty cool and novel and different is that a sequence wallet is actually a smart contract and that's why it can be considered a smart contract wallet you can actually find the source code on the github link there you can see the actual solidity contracts that um you know create your your wallet um and so the difference is you know now you have a contract that you have that only you can control or a set of keys a set of different combination of multi keys can have access to control that wallet and your tokens live inside of that contract they stay in that contract um and that's pretty cool it's also we've obviously as i've been talking a lot about multi-chain this is something that we've been considering for a long time it's part and parcel of the design um in the way that again the net all the numbers feel like one you know having a non-custodial design is also very important because you know for a lot of reasons you know first off i don't want to have custody of any or liability of anyone's goods i really don't i don't want that on uh on my conscience but it's not even just that it's that again the maintaining how do you design all this and maintain the purity of web 3 and to actually have self-custody and you know have these composable things and you know full control and lots of other cool benefits but yeah so that's the nonprofit design is is one of the really challenging elements um to again satisfying all those conditions we described earlier and at the same time making it so that the user can is protected against themselves right so they don't like screw something up and like lose their lose all their funds like so there's and there's or maybe they want extreme security because they're an expert here so there's a lot of consideration and then the other cool thing about the sequence contract wallet is as you might imagine you know perhaps some of the you know the savvy viewers are realizing that okay well a smart contract costs money to deploy so how can you do that so does it cost money for me to use a wallet well not exactly because we have well yes and no so you can actually we have this thing called lazy deployment or counter factual instantiation so you can derive a contract a wallet a contract account without even deploying it you can derive the address and you can start receiving funds and start doing things inside of it even signing messages and you only actually deploy it at the time when you do your very first transaction it actually it's quite transparent to a user so they don't have to consider it but of course they're still aware of it um and on the next slide i'll just show you how efficient the actual deployment is it's actually actually only 40 bytes of data it's pretty cool um anyways so we also support so lots of crazy packed technology uh that extends the capabilities of ethereum leveraging all the smart contract stuff across these different chains these these even compatible chains um really fun stuff and there's a lot of great research going on even you know vitalik released uh an eip or you know an erc 4337 talking about account abstraction really signaling kind of in this direction and you know we're really excited about that to see you know even further standardization around these types of you know contract accounts um again pretty cool stuff of course we also support you know social email login so users can use like a gmail and log in kind of easily we'll kind of take you through that it's also a web 3 compatible wallet so it supports you know eip 1193 if you built your dap in ethers or web 3 or another ethereum client it's just going to work because again because of ei you know 1193 um then again part of the beauty of ethereum and wild this stuff is really important to have standards and open protocols because you kind of gain the benefits of tooling just kind of clicking together and working across the board and everything kind of just start you know meshing and growing um you know in a really seamless way um so yeah and then the other thing we have is you know flexible integration so there's the sequence wallet can be used in many different places so for instance you can use it as just a web wallet uh so a user doesn't have to install anything whatsoever you don't have to install a chrome extension um you can just use it kind of like you just access the dap and adapt and like load up the library in a way you kind of go in like a paypal slash stripe type of experience but of course with web3 and on ethereum protocols right or you can go install a browser chrome extension or you know we're going to add firefox extensions as well it does work on braid so we have support for chrome and brave um we can add firefox we are going to have firefox um and it's pretty cool because then you have like it's a bit of more extra pro features so when you want to kind of you know go a bit deeper and perhaps access a bunch of daps like you would with metamask you can go inside the chrome expression do that and then of course we have the mobile experience and what's neat about the combination of the web and the mobile it's a powerful combo because now you can actually open your like you know your phone and you can use the mobile browser and suddenly you can actually start accessing apps right through a phone without having to install anything um even if that dev doesn't have like anything on an app store with the wallet integrated and so forth again back to seamless design um and of course as some of you may or may not know like you know sequence is the only product we've built we've also built a video game called sky weaver um and so nfts are very core to us in different tokens and experiences this is kind of why you know brings us here but of course we have you know very deep and awesome integrations with nfts and tokens erc20772175s um you know to the extent you know someone could go mint an nft right this second send it to someone someone's sequenced wallet and the wallet will immediately show that nft right because we have this really cool sequence index for this piece of infrastructure we wrote kind of like the graph um but it's their own it's called sequence indexer and it's again has really nice indexing across the different tokens it's really fast it works you know it's superior compatible and so forth um so yeah you can just mint and see it and it works so again it's it's really important because you know that's what's what you need on the web um and yeah and the reason of you know this isn't really me about going on about sequence feature lists why this is important is because you guys can have all this stuff in your dapps right you want users to bring in our t product you want to emit something you want users to see it well guess what it's just going to work right it's just going to work with all this stuff is here for you to use in an ethereum with your compatible way it brings me to the next point around gas you know using gas is very tricky um and and you know handling gases or understanding it and firing transactions you know like just firing forgetting and not worrying about pricing and so forth with kind of you know you know as quick as block conclusion as possible so we actually again we have these there's a few kind of a lot of concepts um in the ecosystem and uh one is called you know gas abstraction and the other one are called meta transactions kind of they're they go hand in hand and we have kind of an advanced form of that because it's a smart contract-based account and what it allows you to do anyways is it lets you fire a transaction and it lets you pay the gas not an ether or automatic you can if you want but you can pay it in usdc die or some other erc20 token you know you can actually you can pay you can use in the case of skyweaver we use you know we use usdc we can use it for for anything um so yeah you can go on the polygon network or in the even network and you can actually start you know paying your transaction fees in usdc it's pretty cool um and then we have the meta transaction stuff which again it's related and you can do things like you can actually instead of like sending one transaction for it approve and then you know like a swap or something you can actually match them together you can actually take a multitude of transactions and group them together as one and have it be executed as a single transaction on chain that's what we call it bash transactions also very very cool and powerful um against a lot of user experience problems and security problems when you think about approving things only to a certain quantity not for improving all stuff like this um and of course we have built-in you know built-in bridging support and feed on-ramps with wired and paid ramp and again why this is really useful for you guys as dap builders or you know whatever you're building um is well you're going to want people who are going to want to make purchases perhaps they're a new user they want to you know um so now you don't have to worry about you know how many you're going to do your own bespoke integration into wire and you get to kind of you know benefit from the integration that exists in here so that's that's kind of the whole thing if you map it back to all the problems there's a there's a good kind of mapping to that um i just want to show you guys this is the actual uh uh sequence wallet by code that gets deployed these are the 40 bytes and you can go to see it there and there's a lot of like it takes a modular design so there's a lot of like ninja coding tricks that our team has done um they're very experienced solidity guys and they they know all the ins and outs and the different tricks that kind of construct all these things so that it works in such a way um while being very efficient it's a it's very impressive stuff that they that they've done um and yeah so as i mentioned we kind of built sky weaver and um and this is kind of what brings us to like in sequence is that you guys can actually go by using you can achieve the same level of kind of fidelity and experience that skyway users get we have 170 000 people playing skyway right now next week we're actually going full general availability which is really cool so we're having more users um and half of our users are they've never done anything on crypto ever right their first time they're doing it it works on the phone works everywhere definitely great experience we don't have any problems people saying like i don't know what i'm doing right people just say oh the game is great i traded this like that's kind of what you want so yeah so that's kind of again what we want to help others achieve we want to see you know more utility and whatever we want to see more content more things going on um and how do we how do we drive that utility as an ecosystem to for people to do more fun stuff and cool stuff so i'm going to show you guys a little bit of a demo uh kind of the workshop component of it now to hopefully understand a little bit about uh some of the background um in terms of some resources we have uh yes we have the discord you know discord gg sequence we have our docs stock students build and we're going to go through this with these two demo dapps that we've constructed um and demo dab one uses web3 modal you may or may not have heard of it it's a cool integration uh by the guy who made wallet connect pedro and it's really nice nice thing i'll show you how that works and then you can also use uh sequences directly to connect the wall directly but the minor differences but i would suggest you know have a look at both um so yeah let's turn this off so i'm gonna switch into that um so as we do the demo so pop open the link you know uh you can actually yeah so those you know github.com if you forget this if this link is too long at least if i get this in the chat so i'm posting that in the chat and yeah i'll i'll go through the uh the questions in a bit um but maybe there's some teammates that are also going to answer all right so that's the link so if you want to follow along you can also once you're in here you can actually click on this link right here and it's actually hosted on github pages like this is this is just an entire this is just a react client-side application nothing too fancy um and the point of it is so i'm actually going to run it locally just because i think that's kind of cool to see so we're going to clone it all right and then let's just pop it open so i'll leave it in here so um yeah so as the instructions kind of say you know you can clone it again you can run it from here directly but if you are looking to do development this works this almost functions like a good boilerplate right so if you're doing a dap like this would be pretty decent boilerplate because it's not heavy it's not very opinionated on react you can kind of take it any direction you want um yeah so we're going to run yarn as expected and this is using the react create reactor scripts sort of thing and it's using the web3 modal program and i'll talk about web3 model in a second um in the meantime as the kind of tells you is have a look at the app tsx right that's the bulk of the real stuff so most of the application is is in here um so it's running on port 4000 and yeah so the whole program it's you know around 300 likes of code including some styles and so let's let's get into it um so yeah what is this gap exactly so it's a bit of a boilerplate and it shows you how to so when you do open it it'll pop up in your chrome inspector you're developing you know browser inspector and it's just to kind of show you how to do and execute common functions of what a wallet what you want to do in your adapt so you're going to connect the wall you can disconnect you can get the network id because you might be on a variety of different networks or as a network list what's the account address of the of the wallet give me the balance of their kind of ether automatic uh you know whatever the native currency the network is signing a message assigning uh like an a typed data message like an eip 712 which are really cool and useful um you can send some eve you can send some tokens 0c20 tokens and so this is sending essentially the sending of the die tokens is really like you're making a smart contract call so this would be you know transact this is a native transaction call with no call date or no smart contract information or calls and this is you're actually making a smart contract called to do a die transfer so and if we have you know feel free to um you know again look at the source and we're using web3 model in this case which i'll give you a bit of a demo and explain why it's interesting um so ultimately it comes down to here we're going and making like a web3 modal instance and we're specifying a few providers so so yeah let's kind of show you and uh go through it so first off the thing i'll mention in part here is i actually don't have just for demonstration purposes i actually don't have metamask or anything running in here you could think of this like a fresh user so if i hit this connect mode of this mode like you know so on your gap you might say connect wallet right and then this is where the web 3 model pops in and it's kind of cool also you could add more providers like feel free to go and have a look at their thing and add more providers as you like and this allows you to kind of the the idea of you know users can bring their own wallet right which is which is definitely encouraged um and so yeah you can use wallet connector it's a great protocol so perhaps you want to access this dap remotely you want to actually have a phone that supports wallet connect well you can actually click on this scan the qr code and start interfacing and as these messages ask you to sign things it'll actually show up on your wallet so you know a really cool thing and i will mention sequence does support wallet connect so if you're on your phone you could actually do that uh perhaps you don't want to yeah have a key on your on this computer you want to access it remotely you can do that um anyways and then the other link of course we have sequence you pop click this guy open and then say oh do you want to allow this this dab from this location to access your wallet or to connect to you while you say continue and that's it and you know and now you're connected so you can kind of click on these little buttons you know and you can see oh train id is 137 and that's the polygon number i can click on the networks thing i can see okay my networks are i'm on the polygon network as well i can get my account oh that's my address i get my balance okay interesting is doing some that's my balance um maybe i want to sign a message maybe like click on this okay it's asking me to sign a message this is the message i hit confirm and it checks it checks if it's valid it's true it is valid so yeah going back to this a little bit um yeah so you create your modal which lets you then once it kind of connects and once you hit the connect button and go through that you ultimately get a provider um and in in this case which is kind of cool is although i've talked to you guys a lot about sequence um again it's it is just using web3 libraries it's compatible with that so you can just use ethers directly you could also use web3 so in this case where our provider is actually a type of ether's web3 uh what yeah web3 provider um and yeah so we kind of once the wallet connects we get an instance of the provider we can also from the provider you can actually grab a signer and a signer is the thing that like the provider you don't always need the wallet you can like access the node directly so you can just query like read operations but a signer is when you have to ask the wallet for something of permission so we get an instance of the designer but you can also get the trinity there's lots of ways to get the trinity there's there's some overlap with these functions so you don't actually need the signer for that but whatever um but you know okay we're gonna get the signer we're gonna get the you know the address of the wallet we can list some accounts um ask the provider for a balance and here we're gonna you know get we're gonna be sending a message so we sign up you know ask for this sign the message and then we double we check if it's valid and kind of so forth and then let's say we want to send some die so i'm gonna hit this button and it's like oh let's let's send some dye you know um i actually don't have any dye don't have enough dye but we'll do a little thing we'll get some dye actually in a second um so i'm gonna be sending five dyeing here so yeah this function you know we're gonna be calling the die contract we're going to be encoding um you know we're preparing a transaction um you can actually remove this gas as well here um we should do that because it's not needed it'll automatically calculate the gas limit for you and yeah and so yeah you got your little api function so you have a look but this is all standard appearing stuff that you you perhaps already know um and then again you just pass it to the sider and it just pops up here so what's special is this is running in like a web wallet mode um pretty cool now next thing i'll show you is what if i did have metamask right so i'll turn it on and i come back here i'm gonna disconnect and now i got my metamask going on and i'll unlock it and now click connect okay cool interesting so now i actually have i can come in here be like oh i can use metamask sequence or this so i can like let's say pop open metamask it's a bit annoying what's it doing there we go um yeah so now i can go check the chain it's like oh chain one i'm on i'm on the main net in this case get my account address i can say hey sign a message for me and it's gonna be like all right we'll sign it or sign a type data or send some ether or some sort or send some dive and don't have the money right so pretty cool um yeah so again what's interesting about this is that you know same code path um again a simple demo dap and of course we also as i mentioned we have a sequence chrome extension so pop that guy open um oh yeah the last thing i want to show you before i get the chrome extension is um you can also once you're logged in to the wallet you can also go to sequence.app and you can start actually accessing the wallet in like a full screen mode um and the other thing i'll kind of give you a quick preview of is if you are just incognito if you're signing in again you can use these kind of give it a try you'll see what i'm saying um but yeah so you can access it from here you can like you can check your different keys and oops different keys and you can like sign out a device because you have like it's a multi-key system right you can like kick out a device if you if you lose it like i'm saying but yeah so if we pop open the chrome extension so the web wallet is pretty cool but from here from the web ball i can't really access uni swap right i can with wallet connect so that does work right um but the chrome extension lets me access other dapps just like i could use metamask so it's here you could click here and go expand and access it full screen just like i showed you as well um but yeah let's disconnect let's restart and if you hit connect now and now you're hitting web3 wallet and now we're actually using this all these different functions work the same and this is actually although it doesn't look like it this is actually the chrome extension you can't really tell because it's you know but it is it's running like you know client side of my device in an offline way and uh that's kind of it i mean you can also go pop into uni swap and you know launch your thing connect my wallet um and uh yeah i could you know convert to some die yeah so we're going to send this transaction just to kind of show you the meta transaction part so now i'm asked it's asking me to do a contract call right and this is where the better transaction stuff is happening and so we have a variety of so you have the different contract call we're doing a multi-call and we definitely should show this to be a little bit sometimes in certain call datas we can actually render it kind of nice um we'll go more we know it's on the polygon network that's what this particular uh wallet is hooked up to because the union swap runs on a multitude of networks and we're going to actually pay a gas fee in usdc imagine we didn't have i actually happen to have like three out of four of these currencies but let's say i want to do with ucc anyways let's go and the cost was actually extremely cheap it was less than a penny i think right um and what's cool is when the real error gives you a quote it's actually guaranteed that quote and so yeah yeah so it's guaranteed to give it to you and it'll automatically do gas free pricing so you never have to think about like speeding up or anything like this like our transaction even confirmed faster than poly then even polygons showing us right now which probably is pretty normal but anyways that's how fast it got mined it's really cheap and we got some more dye and uh i'll i'll stop the demo at that point and kind of turn over to questions because i know we're hitting on time um let's see what we've got here hope you guys uh hope that was helpful and like i said please join us on the discord um oh yeah we did audit the contracts we have so yeah we just yeah i'd say any other further questions i mean definitely ask us on the discord um but yeah the wallet contracts which are here they've gone through two audits maybe three audits i guess three audits um um yeah i guess i'll just pause there but if anyone wants to kind of like oh how do you test test like uh mumbai so what you'll do is or test that you go here you go sequence.wallet and you hit the on your login page you go enable testnet and this little yellow bar and then suddenly you're on the test net network at this point um we do that so the users don't like you know screw it up or they're confused where what assets are aware like it's pretty intentional about what network you're on you can and then you go disable um yeah so that's that's pretty much it well it looks like another question oh how do you ramp up users if they don't have crypto in their wallet um yeah good question so i guess i didn't show you on the screen share but um a few ways i think it's a really cool thing that if users are using their wallet they could like they could find their way into crypto like they could like um you know play sky weaver and earn a card you know and boom you have nothing and you just played the game you earned a card or maybe you created a good piece of content and someone sent you some cryptos i like i like that aspect you could go buy it if you do pop up on the wall you can click add funds you can you know buy it with the different providers like with credit card or debit card um you can do bridging right you can buy it from there's a lot of exchanges these days that um will deposit directly into a layer two i think a lot of the world is understanding that it's like a kind of dapps and the ecosystem exists on layers twos and the base chain is used just for kind of settlement and additional insecurity hopefully that answers it um and yes to answer yes so you can use um yeah you can use morales or any other like you can use the graph you can use whatever you want right in your adapt you can do whatever you want um sequence provides its thing it has its own backends and things but yeah you're feel free i encourage you guys to use you know whatever helps you build your dabs um the web3 off is also really amazing like you know taurus aka web three off we actually use it inside of the wallet so when you did when when you go and log into our wall it's actually creates a by default like a three key system it's a it's a multi-sig account so you have your login key which is we actually use web3 auth um it generates an on-device session key at random and which is stored and encrypted on your device um and then we also have an extra recovery key that's that's built in and which you can kick out if you want but it's an extra kind of and you have to have at least two out of three keys in order to actually do anything and that's the default configuration but you can again do more more stuff and you can go get a bit more crazy um we are adding like a web3 kind of login thing so if you didn't want to use a google sign-in or something you want to go full like you know web 3 mode again we have something really interesting coming up for that because again at a primitive low level these are just kind of signers it's about you know the experience to um how they get constructed so yeah we i guess you could use i don't know how you would use web3 on top but web3 is like i said what three auth is sorry uh the taurus is built right into sequence so you don't you kind of already benefit from it that's kind of what we're trying to say right it's like this integrated thing that you just get to benefit from all these extra um features inside of the product um if yes you do need to install a specific well two things i mean you could use like the demo gap i showed um yeah you could like definitely check our docs right like like i said keep in mind so there's a few ways you can use the wallet right you can use it on demand without users installing anything you can also use it with a chrome extension and then it's like metamask style um yeah and so if you want to link here's a link to the sequence chrome extension yeah i'm not sure i guess i don't understand um no if i already have secret sections that no adapt shows to connect to web through all yeah it's true yeah the demo dap will show like a little it's just like a web3 icon because but if you click on it it will connect to anything that's injected um i have to check with the web3 model guys but it should also show you the sequence logo with that case that'll get kind of fixed but it doesn't really matter because just clicking that will pick any kind of native um injected provider so that could be yeah so it's kind of all good there um thank you guys appreciate it and yeah i mean like i guess that's i know where if there's any final questions but yeah we're happy to answer all like you know keep the conversation going on discord um and yeah any help you need it's uh i mean it's pretty easy you know like integrating sequence is easy and it's a price the surprise pool for it like the coolest app so it's like you're done you're already building adapted does that you get at least you get meta transactions you know that you can pick you don't have to worry about matter of gas token you can use a bunch of different tokens like and lots of stuff lots of cool stuff so um yeah i hope that was helpful and um yeah enjoy and have a great hackathon and good luck on all your projects awesome thank you so much peter that was super super interesting um just echoing what peter said if you have any
