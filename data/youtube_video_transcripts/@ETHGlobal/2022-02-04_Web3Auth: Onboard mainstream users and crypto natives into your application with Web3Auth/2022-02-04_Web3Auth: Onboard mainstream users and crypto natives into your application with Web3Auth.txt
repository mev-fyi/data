and uh reaching out to the the team in what three afterwards in the discord channel to keep this conversation flowing um and i believe he'll be taking questions throughout the session uh so post them in the chat as we're going along and and and you'll have your voice heard really glad that you're able to join us trial give you a second to introduce yourself and kick it off the floor is all yours um awesome awesome uh so hi uh hi everyone my name is chai i'm a head of engineering at taurus or web3 auth as we are called now so i'll be conducting this session today okay so i just want to onboard you guys on to uh what we do as a company and uh just take uh sorry uh just guide you into uh how you can use websites in your projects and then uh how you can onboard mainstream users and crypto natives into your application okay and uh we want to help you with this vision where we want to make free accessible to everyone okay so let me just uh go through this okay so first before i talk about websites i want to talk about the evolution of authentication as a whole in general okay so authentication basically gets more complex as the need for security increases okay initially we have uh simple passwords and then we had to move to complex passwords managed by waltz okay and we also had to add 2fa on top of it to bring more security okay we had to add authenticator apps and you know we have otps those annoying sms which you get every day and uh now in case of web3 we need to memorize seat phases and a bunch of other things which go along with it in terms of uh how to be more secure how to not uh how to manage your seat face very securely and how to uh you know make sure that you connect your wallet only to secure sites and uh everything so in the blockchain space management is usually very hard okay over the last 30 years of technology consumers customers were never managed uh custom to manage their own private keys so the pgp keys and all have been existing for the past 30 years to be honest okay but uh users never the regular users never had to actually you know learn about them all of it has been handled in the back end and uh you know people were usually in general protected but uh in case of web3 where uh we own our own privacy where we are focused about privacy and where we uh own our own authentication stack etc uh the key management becomes a more imperative problem okay so coming to the uh applications in the web3 space right now we have uh it takes around greater than 10 minutes of onboarding time and seat rates are like super interesting for uh regular users i mean have any of you guys try to explain what sea trees are and how they're supposed to be secured to any of your parents or grandparents uh i mean you would have had a hard time okay at least i did so yeah uh and around 3.6 million bitcoins uh were lost in terms of you know just lost private keys alone so key management and security and storing that is really hard okay at web3 our fundamental agenda is to make key management simple and secure for all users and by all users i mean actually everyone including your parents your grandma everyone okay so we have this uh saying that you know webster is supposed to make blockchain in general uh easy so that even your grandma can understand okay and how do we do that okay so webreop lets you sign in with any of your uh traditional oauth providers or your own provider let's say um let's say for a simple example you can have just sign in with google to reconstruct your cryptographic keys and you know generate blockchain wallets for your applications as well okay so i'll just go through more in depth about how this works in general okay before that um okay there are no more questions so yeah so how does it generally work so webtriot is powered by the taurus network taurus network uses something called as distributed key generation so distributed key generation works and the following way so a user's key is split into multiple parts and uh these each part of that key is stored with one node of the torus network so as you can see these notes are run by a couple of big stakeholders in the uh echo system uh like uh as you can see i mean the logos are not really clear but uh it's polygon ens scale uh coinbase uh you know bunch of others okay uh binance etc so uh all these notes basically uh they store a shard of your uh private key and when you log in with google or any other provider in general uh all the shards are then uh brought to the front end and they're reconstructed in the browser to come make your own private key okay to generate the private key and uh on top of this you can add additional authentication factors which includes like a user device share or you know recovery share which is sent to your backup uh email or you know you can just download it a recovery share you can also add a password etc so all of these factors uh combined to form your final web three or private key okay so this way uh we can guarantee that this experience this seamless experience is completely non-custodial to the end user because uh at any point the taurus company does not have access to any of these shares right i mean this recovery share is only presented to you the user device is only present with you so and you need uh two out of these uh a minimum of two out of these three factors let's say uh to access the full private key okay so yeah so i think i have some chat uh yeah so it does use shamir shammy secret sharing yes i'm not sure about voltron in general but yeah coming to the next slide so as you can see uh the private key uh in general consists of let's say three shares okay where one share is stored on your user device the second share is reconstructed using your uh login service provider let's say it can be google uh reddit etc uh the third share can be a backup share option okay or a password etc so how is it secure so the device share can be secured by your biometrics okay which uses your mobile or desktop browser biometrics within your browser um how is the login provider login service provider share secured it's secured by the torus notes okay your login service provider is basically split across the torus network and store and let's say your login service provider there's a priority right so it can be split across nine taurus nodes and then each node will basically store one part of that share okay you only need five out of those nine to actually reconstruct your final private key uh to construct your login service provider private key so and you can also have a backup share which is uh kept secure by your device specific authentication entropy or it can be just your password or some security questions or uh something of that sort so uh all of these in tandem in generate your final private key okay this is a selected information secret sharing here um so at any point uh unless you have to access to any two of these authentication factors you cannot reconstruct your private key so that is why uh it's completely in the hands of the user and it's completely non-custodial to taurus okay so web3hot currently powers some of the biggest blockchain applications as you can see these are all the companies which use web3auth um in their stack you have binance chrome extension there are hundreds of products on the solana blockchain as well silica uh chain uh tezos chain terra sequence good dollar cash chain safe and uh coin desk okay so all of these uh companies have used web yachts key infrastructure management to secure private keys for their users so uh what is the advantage you get so you get familiar with two flows for web3 applications so we don't want web3 applications to be hard okay we don't want users to uh feel like they have to learn a lot of new things you know to just interact with their you know favorite gaming app or favorite just nft platform they want to just have a minimal interaction with it so if they can use a familiar web two point flow in the web3 application it would basically increase uh the conversion rate for the dapps okay and we are the most user-centric non-custodial key management in the market uh and our code is entirely audited and our code is also open source okay you guys can uh visit github.comsearch or github.com to actually look at uh all of our code okay yeah and we've all been uh we also been audited uh by a bunch of audio companies okay we had multiple audits over the years you guys can reach out to us to actually see the audit report okay we have currently more than 500 apps slash wallets integrated and we have more than one million active uh keys under management okay it's monthly active users of one million uh we have more than eight million keys under management on the tourist network at this point next uh i can just demo uh web3 to you guys right now unless there are any more questions right now okay so there are no more questions so at this point i would like to take a moment to uh demo this so this is one of our uh demo examples which uh we have built just for this uh you know so this demo example allows you to customize and uh use the web3 sdk in the way you want okay so right now i can just uh use a hosted example and connect to the torus network of testnet and you can select you you can say that you want to connect to let's say polygon okay and you want to use the default ui with all of the social logins enabled and when i click connect so it shows me a modal with all of the logins which i enabled on the left so you can just connect with google facebook and all other your auth providers you can also do passwordless and you can also connect with an external wallet so in case of external wallets we currently support uh wallet connect uh the taurus ethereum wallet which people love and use okay which people are very familiar with which is app.orders i mean so that and you can also connect with metamask okay so why don't i just uh connect with my uh taurus ethereum wallet here so right now as you can see it is using my biometrics here to log into my uh account so i just clicked on touch id i don't know if you guys saw that um and boom i'm logged in so as you can see i'm connected to my uh taurus ethereum wallet uh you can see that here and i have some usd on the polygon network uh i can just um get some user info i can click on some uh send some eath on the magic network and the polygon network i can sign a message as you can see i can get some details about my account and uh get my balance of my account okay so on and so forth um you can also uh the ui is also fully white labelable as you can see i can just you know change bunch of that uh okay i'll need to just connect a different network yeah as you can see uh you have the new white label ui and you can continue with the rest of the stuff okay so i can also just do a simple login with google here yep and i'm connected with my uh open login account okay now this is a web free autonative account and i can do the same stuff again as you can see i can get my chain id get the balance yeah so on and so forth uh so the entire code base for this is open source again you can find it on github.com uh web3 slash web free auth okay so everyone can look at this and then you know go through with it uh our documentation is available on docs.webs.i o as you can see uh so depending on your stack you can uh if you're building a web3 app or a wallet or if you want to plug in your own auth let's say your application already has an auth uh using so that's the email password or password or however so you can plug it uh you can bring your user base onto the uh taurus network and then you know you can manage them uh with zero migration uh okay so if you're building a web3 app we have a bunch of guides for you uh depending on the network you want to use and depending on the products product you want to use and depending on the network you're targeting okay so let's say you're targeting polygon or ethereum or binance smart chain etc okay depending on that you can use one of the guides and then just start integrating and before you start those you can register under our dashboard to get your client id uh the dashboard is very seamless to use and we have several uh i know uh how do i say this promotions running on the dashboard okay so once you log in uh you'll keep seeing more and more details about it yeah uh let me just uh log into the dashboard i think i'm already logged in here okay um yeah so this is how the dashboard would look like for a regular user so by default you would start with your plug-and-play and you can create certain projects and you can let's say there's a website demo project which i created i get a client id i would use this client id in the application you can also whitelist certain redirect uris and yeah the creating project is just a click and then you just write a new thing demo2 and yeah you're done so you can whitelist more redirect qrs here and take it forward okay you can read the docs here and you can also just go to our uh integration guide which has uh code which you can just try and directly start using okay yeah i see some messages in the chat um what is the chance that two addresses create from the different wallets can have uh same security i mean uh there is the pro probabilistic chance is uh very low that you know uh it's uh more than one by the number of atoms in the universe okay so it's almost impossible i would say okay considering the current um cryptography mechanisms which we have do we have on-ramp or partnered with one yes we do we do have multiple uh on-ramps uh in our wallets okay and you can actually use any of them to make sure that your users can buy with credit card does it work with polygon testing yes it does okay i just uh showed you the polygon mainnet in the demo but you can also the same will work with polygon testing as well so for the on-ramp part uh i can just log into my uh taurus wallet uh as you can see it's just asking for my biometrics again because i previously logged onto this device and set up biometrics so at the top of page you can see we have a bunch of providers and all of these providers are more active depending on the region and they all have different fees and different currencies which they support so we can uh this top-up page is also available through an api so you can just integrate in this top-up page uh irrespective of the website indication you're using and you know provide a seamless experience for your users to uh talk about using their credit cards yeah so uh continuing with the presentation uh oh wait any chance of a team could work out react just a startup rate is a challenge because of the new making changes with webpack um not really okay so we do have an example i think we do have an example with the react uh create react app and assuming that's what you mean by the starter kit um yeah we do have some examples of the starter kit um and uh the web 3 documentation also suggests how to resolve those challenges with the create reactor to be honest okay it's pretty uh straightforward and uh yeah let me just uh a few examples here so as you guys can see we have a simple plain javascript example here and we have a view example here uh but the react exam is also like pretty similar okay and uh please reach out to us on the discord uh and we can help you out with uh any specific issues with react integration as well okay i already posted some info about uh how to resolve uh how to resolve that issue with the react one uh and i'll be glad to help out more people and we'll also simply add a react example here okay that's not a big deal yeah it'll become up by tomorrow yeah so the basic idea is that the web3r wallet allows anyone to log in with google authentication so there's no need to use the wallet password or tool see yeah that is true uh you can log in with google facebook or your favorite authentication provider and you don't need to you know memorize any passwords or memorize any seat phases and secure them we want to make authentication so simple for everyone that you know people don't need to worry about the complexity all of the complexity is handled by us and it's hidden away from you okay so you'll be secured in that way so uh continuing with the presentation i think this is the most important part which everyone cares about here uh we have three prizes which for this hackathon uh the first prize is around 2500 usd the second is 1500 and the third is 500 usd uh the judging criteria would be based on the viability and the practicality of the use case at taurus we value the ux ui which is built and as you guys can see most of our products are consumer focused and we believe in providing the best ux possible for the users and making the onboarding into f3 as seamless as possible so this quality of ux ui build uh is a pretty important criteria for the judging in this case of uh in this hackathon and we also obviously reward the technical complexity yeah uh everyone can uh join us on twitter uh at webtriath and on discord uh discord.js and on telegram okay so please feel free to reach out to us on any of these platforms our team will always be active i mean we work in different time zones so at least one of us would develop in your time zone uh to help you out with uh your issues during the hackathon and yeah expecting lots of integrations uh containing the messages here yeah i think that's it so i think i'll just open the floor for any more further questions which any of you guys may have before we can wrap this up thank you it's been excellent yeah does anyone have any further questions um right now the sessions work uh based on the tab which was open okay so we rely on session storage to determine the session of the user um yeah if the tab is closed then usually the session is lost and the user will have to log in again um if you're having difficulties integrating web three off with react uh yeah you can just reach out to us on the discord group which is set up by the brilliant team at road to web3 and heath global so you can just reach out to us on discord and then uh i can either i can or people of my team can definitely respond to all of the issues which you have yeah and does website allow us to get to users at the rate twitter in order to use it on the page uh it depends actually okay if the user is willing to share that information with you uh you'd be able to get it okay if the user declines it of course you can't so it depends on the user's consent yeah we do have an api for that yeah perhaps an office server 20 minutes for react folks or session context yeah sure uh we can do that definitely uh we can um most likely create a small video uh you know going through the react integration and you know just putting that out there and we'll also definitely add a sample to our web3 repo okay as you guys saw the previous sample is available the host sample is available at a demo slash shop app on.web dot io and it's also available here in the view app here so the react one would also be like very similar uh but we'll definitely add include one no problem any other questions guys i see a lot of great questions from you guys so yeah oh by the way did i say that the model is fully widely available i think i did right let me just log out and click on connect yeah so you guys can see the logo changes and all right the colors change it's fully widely available yeah keller thank you thank you for such an excellent presentation um i see a few more questions here and we saw a little bit of time but i would recommend everyone reaching out in discord a lot of great opportunities there to connect um i know that y'all already made some plans to do that uh thank you for everyone uh thank you chai for for for lending us your time today and and and and your mind as well it's been enlightening always glad to have you um very very excited to see what our hackers do with web3r over the weekend um we will be i think ending the session here um i encourage everyone to reach out in in discord as i just stated um they're going to be a lot of opportunities to connect and continue asking questions to both chai and the team and the mentors as well if you have any issues there highly recommend dming us and we can we can help sort you out get you ready for the finale but thanks again to everyone i'm looking forward to seeing you guys uh later on our next session all right so thanks everyone and uh yeah uh i'm happy to i'm hoping to see a lot of indications with websites yeah really cool projects sure you will all right guys we're gonna be closing the session here
