and summary what we do is allow you to log in to dabs with Google and basically you don't have to care about your private key o as a new user not yet but then after a while we will let you off board and behind the scenes how we do it is we do key to short and in order to being constructed you need majority of the shares and then we have all these shares be held by other servers so the servers are not remember us you only want a service so a bunch of people running servers just distribute across the world and then when you log in Google you get a share back and then you we can attract either browser a long story short plug in Google shares from somewhere come back after you proof has proven that you've logged in Google and then you get by private key so users don't have to keep it they don't need to know anything about see phrases like private keys like how all this stuff like that so it's easier to show how it works just by looking existing in the question um but for now if you guys are interested in trying out as I give the talk you can go to app to order us and apt order us a PP don't order us I don't have to thank you so show of hands who here is already building on tap or like has existing that that you're working on before they came here and the rest of you are working on this hackathon just doing cool stuff okay I see I see okay and before this you guys are using meta master like to let users interact with your apps but normally Mama's know brave users know okay what about mobile solar have you any of your users asked for a mobile version of your app no they have what do you tell them okay then how are you communicating with the blockchain very mobile ah okay so you said I remote no like gas or something or into your okay okay okay okay and then you Baba turkeys like it's managed by you guys or the user oh it's in the phones okay okay cool so it's not connected yeah thank you so yeah yes I really heard what it does basically is log into adapts and if you're with that can you check out the docs at the store us or you can do this this is actually you put a port order us in from this let me just changes oops you want to put up toward us here and actually if you go to this site it should just give you this entire script tag so you know this is a sha hash there so the reason for that is users keys so um we want you guys to know that we don't change the Java square wheel Ike right if we change the Java Script then because like who steal keys so all these codes actually open source you can look around github and there's a sha integrity hash so anything changes you would know so you can just go to app us and copy that one so so once you do that all you do is put the script tag in your body of index.html so a lot of like if you're in react usually as index.html right just put in a body the script tag no not a head um the reason for that is because there are certain like for example on some web trees like madame us were three actually detect it like a bit later so we put in your body like mixed load on time so it's just some timing issues anyway once you do that it basically provides a web three instance they can just use so you if your app is integrated with madame asked already it can use it straight away so you just need to disable madame masque on your browser put this script tag in your body and if you just work you hook into the basic stuff like if they're not in anymore the usual webs recall like signed transaction stuff and yes that's about it so it may not seem like a lot you like it's that straightforward really is so this is an example integration um right here i'm using javascript in jest it into this tag onto the page and after you log in you will just trigger a Google login and if you have two FA and a boat it will prompt that and then you can just log in and start using a tab so afterwards after this talk I'm with lots of time I'll go around and make sure that all you guys can get integration working it should be pretty straightforward so this diagram kind of shows a little bit I'm not sure how much Leonard covered but we essentially allow users to log in to decentralized ecosystem via social logins so right now we support Google but in the future would be supporting Twitter github LinkedIn and several others you can combine multiples of these authenticators to one public/private key pair so make kind of like a trash hold key so for example you could have a 12:3 with LinkedIn Google and github and if somebody wanted to access that key they would have to have to access logins like either you know like 2 of 12 3 of them to get that key and that ensures that authenticators themselves can't get access to your key as well back in the background what we use is a scheme called distributed key generation to generate users keys these keys are generated in the buffer in a series of nodes which are then assigned to users as they log into the platform so right now these nodes are actually run by several organizations including virgil from the theorem foundation finance labs waseda university as well as kaiba network and several others and these guys are basically who the people which keep these different shares of your of your users keys which your user will authenticate with them to get back and add up in the browser and start using the web tree instance is a one grand prize of $2,000 in eath he's fluctuating a lot right now so I really don't know how much it is but if we awarded when we made the decision to the best app that incorporates Horace as the login mechanism so that's the first grand prize and they were giving two prizes of $1,000 to taps there for industry needs so in this particular case it has to be like an existing industry not something that is like very good√∂ specific but something that's like I'm already in existing industry and then the last one is one price of $1,000 and eath a water to that that's the most senior and intuitive user onboarding process so that's also really important to us because one of the core goals of Taurus is to make crypto applications that you guys are building accessible to public right normal users may not want to deal with private keys or even know what they are before the user app and we have a few other prizes of the one thousand dollars in eighth I wanted to dad this the best overall user experience and so the previous user onboarding such as user experience another one for taps that displays the most innovative use of Taurus so Taurus right now is use for logins but I can use it for other things you can use it for example to look up a person's this is tied to Google right you could maybe send money to process Google account on I could to Kitty to put this Google account there's something interesting I could use it for examples and then the last one is a price of thousand dollars and eath a water depths the most creative design for implementing Taurus so that's all um if we actually hook into a bunch of existing web three call so you do if they're I'm not enable if you used to meta mas api's nowadays they use if there are any avoid to call that before can access get access to the users eat account right so if you do if you're not in a boat actually just triggers this call we know that how is the login but if you want you can also just call this yourself to trigger user login and if minima is already installed with Taurus people work um no it won't work when I'm asked those too fast because it's a browser extension so it will just disable it so if you want to you test it out please turn off meta mask easy way to do that would be to run an incognito and the last one is run your browser incognito using Chrome or you just work and yes you can refund each Network just use the same web three calls like web 3d star get account whether you're either contract at and then make a call they all use the same API so yep if you like what we're doing you want to reach out to us come here we're always open we're actually looking for authenticators they may be interested in building out more login mechanisms so right now we will go log in but if you want if you authenticated out there let's say you have some type of API login I'm like oh of login will be happy in the gradient that's all yes uh sorry you having a question yeah right so the the back end of it right is actually publicly verifiable in a sense that all of so all these nodes dish they do a lot of messages to do a key generation right all that happens on the shed um PFT layer by the time fault horn earlier make sure use tendonman core at the engine and all of that is actually recorded so if any of them did malicious activity you would be there and you could submit a proof of that so that's one way to do it right now a lot of these knows they're running it I'm not doing it for money right they don't I mean this is free to use first of all second of all they just want to incentivize ecosystem to build apps that I usable by the mainstream audience and this I think provides way more benefit than whatever money we can offer them so there's kind of like the incentives for like a lot of these nodes yes there is an Associated eat address so um you would okay let me just show you a live demo missing you have two latest one I think it was I'm not sure I try to just know why I wasn't working connection yeah I think you do I think it's use this like it's yeah it's connected to every morning so what did you guys integrated if you had to crypto providers integrate on into the platform so these include wire which is just outside simplex it it's wire is integrated now but yeah the rest aren't integrated just yet but like any other DAP you'd be able to easily just get your public address and you know take it off in yeah exactly exactly um you probably could you probably could inject your own web tree version as a mask either over the one that we are providing you could actually rip it up by I think it'd be it'd be would it be the easiest thing right now the so how it works on the front end is that we keep a user's key so metal mask keeps a user's key on a separate JavaScript context which is the Chrome extension right and this ensures that your key isn't readable by any DAP using it and basically the taps can't take and run with your key right so um we do something similar but we use an iframe to as a separate JavaScript context to keep your key so this iframe basically communicates with the web for instance that we provide to you guys and you can replace that web pre instance with a newer version and provide a provider on top and an injector provider that we provide on that work for instance it is possible but uh it's just a bit more walk I don't know why the screen resolutions like this but okay well I'm showing here is I have this tiny little user script and what it does is it just injects it just injects the script tag - notice now at altura us onto the page it just works so let me show you so you click start it's going to trigger a login which usually speaker guess what she said and then and then yeah and then you can just start using adapt so I'm logged in um I can check out my wallet here what's this that boy is here oh they are here and then it's really way bigger actually I don't think a church to displace sighs I tried it just now it's super small here on my screen - anyway I just made it bigger you can see like what your how much you have you can look for top-up um not integrated right now and then if you want to see your address you can just get it by window - web 3 accounts so if you go to here who I'm not on the main Network yeah if you go to Aptos how to ask unis integrate like that which ones [Music] right ok so yeah just put this in your data in your dad and it should just provide your instance it's kind of really small I'm just going to not use - this is hard most apps we call siphon section as well as some yep so not sure ready you you saw that Artie but they can just buy stuff on here sorry right now I'm not good no we are doing that um but the problem with that approach is that it's actually less secure so um our keys are Jared on behalf of you buy it so it's not any of them are basically it was right because they wanted that so yes yes but it's come along a sign you run a buckaroo dairy yeah so we can't go wrong like you guys are like very specific questions we can answer them what were you planning to do with private like yeah these things okay yeah sharing secrets yeah so there are that especially what you can do I think there's also like a few more API sits in our documentation side but mostly just around these things you see so much fun i oh there was a demo app is it this one this one okay oh it's huge so I think you can just log in so okay um if you want that I mean no problems please put it in the body like I know like a lot of different like react has a few libraries that listen to web we really late so like if you have it in the head or something like it sometimes just doesn't hope yeah so put it in the body it has the best results I've done a lot of testing these things yep can I get a cookie this actually kind of lucky like they have a really weird loading thing like it works on time no problem so know yesterday was some huge server issues like last night highly slack all day let us know if you any like any issues will be you guys can go to a telegram chat that's like one for Taurus here and it's just horace labs
