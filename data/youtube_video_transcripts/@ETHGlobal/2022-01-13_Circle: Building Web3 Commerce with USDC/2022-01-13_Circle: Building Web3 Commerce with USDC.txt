questions and you want to make sure you don't forget them put them in the chat we'll get to them at the end and we'll make sure everyone gets a chance um and if you need to follow up in the discord uh in the sponsor channel for circle but allison juan flor is yours alrighty thank you luke and um hey everybody um and welcome to this session i hope that wherever you are in the world you all are having a wonderful time at nft hack today and i want to give a huge shout out to the youth global team for hosting us and putting this together um my name is juan lopez and i'm based in miami and i work in the product marketing team at turco i really focus on the crypto native vertical which in other words i get the awesome privilege to work together with our revenue our product and our marketing teams to position all of our products and services uh to the most crypto friendly businesses around the world and uh i'm joined by my colleague allison allison you want to introduce yourself sure yeah hi everyone uh thanks so much for joining us here today and we're super excited to uh go through circles api products and how you could incorporate them into the projects that you're working on i'm not a solution engineer at circle uh which basically means that i help out with technical questions so anything that relates to integrations with our api products uh i can hopefully help out with those uh so really excited to get to walking through our product suite and i hope hopefully you guys will be able to integrate with us awesome thank you alison so we're here to talk to you about building web3 commerce with with uscc uh i'm sure with the with the audience that we have here today we've we've all witnessed what 2021 has done for nfts um we've seen everything from punks becoming one of the most prestigious avatars in crypto to loot uh really redesigning the way we think about community co-creation and and we're now starting to see what these building blocks uh do to help us tokenize art tokenized property tokenized culture and we're we've been at a point where non-fungible tokens and jpegs really have everybody's attention now and although some people do see the space as a marketing opportunity and may use it to make a quick buck i think most of us here today do see with the real value behind nfts and are looking to build a product or service with with long-term incentives around their communities i'm sure most of us uh here have experienced what it's like to onboard into crypto go through an on-ramp send the first entry in transaction run out of gas get a failed transaction or even nfts and i think we can all agree that we can leverage all the open source tools and and really all the amazing talent that's jumping into this space to continue to design the ideal user experiences for for web3 commerce i think our goal here today is to hopefully nudge you a little bit and to letting us join you along for that ride so what we're building at circle is a very simple solution for nft platforms and applications to onboard users into crypto in a scalable fashion um and we'd love to talk to you about what that means exactly so at its core circles building internet native payments and treasury infrastructure all based on uscc we think that part of that long-term value creation that we spoke about uh the first couple slides comes with having a very seamless and trusted user experience specifically around payments and more importantly with with users who are not necessarily crypto native into the applications that we're building so throughout the next couple slides um i'd love to just talk a little bit about usdc about our apis and and how our fiat infrastructure can help us seamlessly connect crypto with with traditional finance so let's start with usdc um 2021 was a was a great year for usdc together with everybody here we've grown usdc supply about 10x and uh 90 of that still still lives on ethereum so looking forward to to 2022 what that means is there's now much more liquidity much more volume and more blockchains to build interoperable commerce on web3 for for us it's really about the usdc like governance its regulatory footing and the trust from everybody here the the crypto community the ethereum community that's allowed developers and builders to to design blockchain applications that leverage usdc payments with confidence so let's let's dig into let's dig into payments um we we believe that crypto native goods do deserve crypto native payments um with circle you can send and receive blockchain payments across our supported blockchains with with a super simple api integration um and something we're currently testing in beta is btc and if payments as well which um we're super excited about um but as most of you know um onboarding net new users into crypto is not super easy and and it does involve going beyond the blockchain payments which is why our payments infrastructure was designed to enable businesses and projects of all sizes to easily bridge in and out of crypto so our apis allow you to accept traditional payment methods cards and ach for your customers to buy digital goods in a method that they're still familiar with maybe while they're still learning to use something like a metamask wallet and just as importantly we support programmatic payment payouts in ach and uh and also wires back to creators to developers and and sellers that are already interacting with your platform um so that you can reach more people in more countries so the next question is really how does this all come together now that we now that we're going beyond just sending and receiving payments and we're thinking about designing a more robust uh same marketplace experience with circle you can actually integrate both payments and payout functionality the the functionality that we just covered really with the ability to create user accounts and manage balances so what this ultimately does is it essentially enables us to create scalable a compliant marketplace solution um that lets you focus on the design on the creative aspects of your nft and on the minting and custody of your nfts while you look at circle as a core financial architecture to your platform so with one api integration you can stand up user accounts you can top them up with usdc from an external wallet or you can top it up with fia from cards or ach and more importantly you can design highly customizable funds flows the way that you see fit so in the end we provide you with all the tools that you need to position your product for for growth across users across blockchain ecosystems with the blockchain partners and blocks that we support for usdc while still allowing you to stand up a compliant digital marketplace with with confidence a great example of how we've been able to do so is with dapper labs in which beyond the initial sale of a cryptokitty or a top shop pack buyers and sellers could connect up to this marketplace and they're able to do peer-to-peer transactions or if they'd like to keep funds on adapter platforms they can or they'd like to withdraw them on chain through an external usdc wallet they can do so as well so it's really whether it's a blockchain based game managing in-game tokens or a sports nft platform that's looking to enable trade within their community circle really acts as the core financial layer of that digital marketplace so with that um i'm going to pause there and i'm going to hand it over to allison who's really going to talk to us about what this looks like in practice and hopefully share some resources to inspire you and and let us join you in that journey towards building web3 commerce so over to you allison awesome thanks juan i guess so we're going to get a little bit into the weeds now and we're going to actually show you some technical examples of what it looks like to integrate the circle uh and make everything that one just talked about a reality for you guys uh so in terms of our api products uh really what we're looking to do like juan mentioned is connect uh both your crypto native users and your less crypto savvy users uh so for users for coming onto that platform and they just really like that nfc they want to buy it but they have no idea how to create a wallet they've never purchased cryptocurrency before all they need to do is give you their debit or credit card uh but for those crypto native users you still have an option to allow them to pick their favorite chain of choice that usdc is available on and then they can send that as payment as well so to talk a little bit about circles uh api products and the way that they're split out uh we have three main products that we offer uh and these typically uh these are all kind of mixed and match uh when creating an nft marketplace uh it's compatible with circle uh the first is the payments api and that is kind of what it sounds like it allows you to accept payments uh both fiat uh and crypto native payments uh from your end users uh so in terms of the fiat side we're talking mainly cards uch sappa and wires cards probably being the most popular among most users uh and then on the crypto native side that is going to be multi-chain usdsc again on eight of those blockchains that we support today and then also uh and ether and btc uh payments coming soon uh on the flip side of that we have our payouts api which is pretty much the exact opposite of our payments api that allows you to redeem the usdc in your circle account and then you can just send that back out again in the form of fiat via ach sepa or wires or through a blockchain transfer of sending usdc to any of those wallets on chains and then finally we have our accounts api and the accounts api is really meant to allow you to create a wallet infrastructure or you can think of it like a ledger infrastructure for your marketplace so this allows you to really easily store user balances and also enable peer-to-peer sales between different users on your platform and because these are all taking place within circle and subaccount infrastructure there are no gas fees and gas fees involved so you don't have to worry about paying additional fees when you want to kind of add that secondary marketplace layer to your energy marketplace uh so we're going to go into an example here of both card and usdsc payments to start out with so for enabling card payments the first step of this is for you to build a user interface to collect those card details from your user when we talk about that we're talking things like card number cvv expiration and then billing details for that user uh we'll ask that you encrypt those that card number and the cvv on the client side of your application we don't want unencrypted card details flying around uh but once you have encrypted that and you pass it to circle's postcards endpoint uh we will take care of storing that card data for you so you don't have to worry about having to store sensitive information in your database circle will take care of that for you you can see here once you've created that card you'll get a card id returned to you that's what you'll use in the next uh in the next call to actually charge that user's card uh so if we go to that call uh this is our post payments call and this is what actually allows you to make a payment with that card uh record that you've just stored with circle uh so you can see here that part id we mentioned in the previous slide uh here is represented as that source id uh and you uh in in this example we are charging that user fifty dollars uh so that fifty dollars will be charged that uh users card pretty much instantly so you'll know within a couple of seconds whether or not that payment was successful there are some settlement times uh but you'll know at least that your user has made a successful payment while you're waiting for that usdc to settle in your circle account uh one of the nice things here is that all of these payments are going to settle as usdc directly into your circle account master wallet you don't need to do anything else besides just making this call once that settlement time has has been completed that usdc will just show up in your balance and now to talk about the usdc payment side of things uh this is a super straightforward uh piece of our integration really all you're doing is just appending a unique deposit address to your circle account master wallet uh we typically recommend creating one address per user who requests one this means that you can just associate that deposit address directly with a user so you know anytime you receive usdc into that deposit address who it belongs to or who actually initiated it so you can see here for example uh this is a a call to create a uh deposit address on your account so this would allow a user to send usdc um on the ethereum blockchain uh but again you can append addresses across any of our eight support blockchains today and i'll get into a little bit later how you can also use your circle account to do things like chain swapping as well uh so once you've actually initiated those payments from your users or they've sent that transfer of usdc you're going to want a way to know when those payments or those transfers have actually settled uh so to the easiest way to do that is by subscribing uh to aws sns notifications uh with circle so you can set up an endpoint and we will send those notifications pretty much anytime the status changes within your circle account so that could be things like creating a card and that card status updating or creating a payment and seeing that payment uh get confirmed and unsettled and then also for blockchain transfers you'll see uh the initial pending status for those and then once that completes uh you'll be able to know that we've gotten the confirmations for that payment to be successful uh and once you have confirmed that that payment was successful you can use the get balances call to actually see the updated balance within your circle account uh so you'll be able to uh pull for that balance if you want to so you don't have to keep track of the the payments that are coming in and you'll be able to see all of those payments as they land uh and now on the flip side uh we're going to talk about uh payouts as well so we'll go ah and go through and talk about both uh the siege payout example and the usdc payout example so for ach this is a call to basically make a payout to an ach account uh we have skipped the linking step so similarly to how you link the card before you make the card payment you have to link the ach account before you can make a payout uh the way to do that is actually through a partnership that we have with cloud flat enables a secure linking process for your users so again you're not touching any sensitive information there if you've used things like venmo or ftx's app you're probably familiar with the cloud linking flow for connecting your ach account uh so it's a pretty seamless process and most users are pretty used to it so this is one of the easiest most user-friendly ways to get a payout in fiat for a user and then in terms of usdc transfers uh again you can send usdc out from your master wallet onto an address on any of our eight supported chains and what this means is that in our example previously we accepted usdc in from an ethereum deposit address uh but we can actually send that same usdc out to an avalanche deposit address so that circle account kind of works as a omnibus wallet and that will store all of your usdc and at that point it's blockchain agnostic so you can accept usdc from any of our eight supported chains and send out that usdc to again any wallet on those eight supported chains so it makes it super easy for you to accept those payments and send payouts to your users without having to try to balance a bunch of different uh usc balances across a bunch of different chains so that covers our payments and payouts api uh so moving into our accounts api this is really where i use their balances on your platform come into play so thank users who want to top up their wallet balance because they're super excited and they want to make sure that they can get that next backdrop they don't want to have to waste time entering their card details on that day they just want to load up their account with you so they can purchase it immediately uh and then the other kind of user experience that this enables is those peer-to-peer sales on a secondary marketplace so once i've bought that awesome pack drop now if i want to resell one of my nfts because i think it's worth a bunch on the secondary marketplace i can easily sell that to another user on your marketplace and you can transfer those peer-to-peer payments between those sub-accounts again that's totally gasless there are no fees associated with any of those transfers so to go into the example of how to create a subaccount uh it's really just this one call to create a what we call a wallet but we also refer to as a sub account those are the same things in this context uh so when you create a wallet uh you can add a description so you know you know which user id it belongs to or something like that and then you'll get a wallet id as well that you can associate with that user in your database and you'll be able to see the balances for that wallet uh when you actually transfer uscc into it once you've created an account you can actually receive usdc directly into that account if you want to so i talked a bit before about appending a unique deposit address to your master wallet you can also actually append them directly to these subaccount wallets so when you do that the uscc that come in that comes in will automatically reflect in the balance of that sub account you won't have to do any additional ledger management there uh do keep in mind that for fiat payments those are always going to land first in your master wallet uh so they do need to land there and then you can transfer them to the appropriate wallet unlike the usgc payments and then finally we have this uh post transfers call which you've also seen before when we went over the usdc payout example uh but you'll see here uh the uh body is a little bit different when you're making a sub account sub account or a wallet to wallet transfer so you can see here in the destination uh the type instead of being a blockchain wallet and an address it's going to be a wallet and it's going to be that wallet id that we created in that first step uh and this will allow you to send usdsc between one wallet in your circle account infrastructure to another once you've done that that's going to be relatively instant because it is just happening within circles database and again there are no fees associated with that so it's a super quick and easy way to enable those peer-to-peer payments cool and that kind of covers uh what we have to offer here so we went over uh card payments uch payouts uh usdc payments and payouts and also enabling a wallet infrastructure for buyers and sellers on the platform and really what we're aiming to do here is allow you to connect your marketplace to as many users as possible with as many payment and payout rails as possible to really just form the best user experience for all the users that you're targeting um so if you guys are are excited or as excited as we are to get started with this uh you can actually get a sandbox api key at my uh sandbox.circle.com uh you can sign up for sandbox api key and you'll be able to start making calls we also have a sample application and really good on what i think are really good developer documents so please check those out as well if you get stuck anywhere if you do have additional questions you can also find us on youth global's discord server in the sponsor circle uh channel so please feel free to ask questions there we're happy to help out if you get stuck anywhere well and thank you so much for joining uh i think we're gonna have a few minutes for questions as well yeah awesome thank you for such an incredible presentation um we have a few questions in the chat here we can get to i think we have like eight minutes i want to say yeah we get we got some time so let's go for it is the circle api compatible with polygon network coming from erwing yeah no so we we currently support eight blockchains and that would be um ethereum solana avalanche tron algorith stellar and hedera um with with more coming soon so um definitely stay tuned to see what where we continue to support uh usdc natively for sure for sure um i think we have a few actually i'll ask you to unmute real quick hello hello okay guys uh i have a question about uh how the whole process works uh if like let's say we are selling like nft we integrate in your ipi or like something so person is like sending money like from credit card to your account getting everything done are they getting how they get access to their like meta mask and all this like this infrastructure it's like within your ui or like can you like elaborate on that like if like let's say we integrate a circle on our dab tomorrow basically yeah how it's going to be from user perspective thank you yeah that's a great question so uh really what we've built here uh is a payments in kind of treasury management infrastructure uh that is blockchain agnostic so where we don't handle the actual nft custody but that also means that you can choose whatever chain you want to build that infrastructure on for your users uh so you can uh whatever you know change you choose to mint those nfts on uh you can have those users you know connect their metamask wall to get that nft uh and in the background what will be happening is when that user makes a let's say like 10 credit card payments uh you'll get that confirmation that that payment went through successfully and then you can choose when to actually release custody of that nft to your user uh so you can think of it as kind of being uh two separate parts of your infrastructure uh you have circle where all those payments are running through and then you have whatever platform you've decided uh to build your empty marketplace on where you'll be handling the actual custody and management of the nfts no okay i still have a question who's going to be the first person the best person to talk about this like late i think it's like a little bit going to take too much time from from other questions so maybe i can contact you directly like right now after this session yeah absolutely i think the best place would be to ask any additional questions in that discord channel uh we'll be able to view those there and then we can take them back to the right people on our side okay thank you thank you samuel do you have a question um yes i have a question um why i actually joined this session was because i'm actually working on a project a web 3 project e-commerce website project so um this is this sounds very interesting so like from what i've said so i don't really need to um implement a smart contract just to receive stable coins payments using the circle api right i just i'm not going to call i'm just going to call it call it as a rest as a poster and get requests in my application yep well i don't want to i know that i want to ask do you have like an escrow function uh did you say escrow function yes escrow function yes so um not natively built into the apis but the nice thing about them being rest apis is that you can put in additional controls if you want to so a part of those sub accounts is that you can really create those additional wallets in your circle infrastructure and use them for any purpose that you want so we do have customers who will basically create a sub account and use that as like an escrow wallet while they're waiting uh for a specific event to trigger and then they'll make the transfers to the appropriate uh wallets once that is triggered okay then also for the api is the api um is it is it like pay as you go can i start making use of the api then um as um customers are trying to buy so i get charges for but how is the payment of the api been done is it pay as you go or i have to subscribe so you could sorry i was gonna say you could get access to sandbox now uh pretty much but as far as getting production keys to actually be able to start processing live payments there is a subscription fee tied to that and there are transaction fees depending on the rails and the usage um so for something like that would definitely uh you know something that would reach out to her to our sales team and assess the use case okay okay because i'm just trying i'm just trying to i'm just trying to differentiate why maybe i i was thinking of probably why maybe i should actually migrate my webster project to sell me like using makings or settle for my payments my web 3 project so i'm just trying to look at but you know it's cool it's actually cool but i'm not trying to see um the benefits soon if i can write a smart contract and still do this do these things like see you know wait cool it's cool it's it's a nice product it's lovely that's what i can say thank you thank you thank you another question um when can circle freeze assets can the die collateral address be frozen so circle doesn't have like the utmost discretion to go and freeze assets um the governance for usdc is set at the center level um i would definitely defer to our policies and procedures on on that front um but circle doesn't actually have like the discretion to go and like freeze collateral um yeah i think one more question and then actually maybe fit two more questions in there is there a live currency conversion from the major currencies to usdc um so not currently with circle uh but what i will say is that it is on our roadmap uh to basically be able to accept btc and ease payments uh currently we actually can't accept btc and east payments but there's no conversion aspect uh we are expecting uh within you know q1 to early q2 of this year uh to have like an automation feature basically where that incoming b2c or you could be exchanged automatically for usdc within your circle account awesome well thank you thank you everyone for for joining us today thank you allison thank you juan it's been an incredible presentation as i mentioned earlier please connect with them in the discord channels following this is a great way to get constant updates and and and learn about things when you are blocked during the weekend we're all really excited to see what you build um but thank you everyone for joining us we're gonna you know pause the recording here and uh close the room so uh take care i think i we have thank you a few more sessions coming up today so uh stay tuned thank you luke thanks so much
