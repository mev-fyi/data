[Music] I'm a judge jokes we're talking don't do that make sure you mentioned the anyway the ground [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] check-check okay hello everybody so clap once if you hear me that was too many times clap three times if you can hear me you're done yay yeah we're at the end here who all slept in the the room with the air mattresses yeah yeah I slept there for ten hours Friday night though I was tired I was really tired haha but now I am awake so thank you all for being here the we're gonna take about an hour mostly to celebrate the end of the hackathon and also to showcase some of the winning teams but before we do any of that we actually are going to do a musical performance so with that I want to welcome ivy to the stage to come out and start his musical performance that's welcome Ivy once you went - hi everyone my name is Ivy I'm from Manhattan New York okay okay represent I am an ethereal foundation DEFCON four scholar and today that's right be proud yes yeah I'm your hype man yeah thank you thank you thank you and and today I have something very special something very special special that I want to share with you it's a it's a song about blockchain it's a song about Kryptos a song about a proof of work proof of stake everyone participate it's it's something a little bit about myself I finished I was at Cornell University and I studied FinTech and I'm also Jamaican and you know like you know Bob Marley knew bob marley fans I decided to harness like my skill set and also my background to like create a song something for the community something the community would enjoy and they just that it's a yes it's a four and a half minutes song and the title is blockchain and if it's okay I like a shirt with you today sound wonderful wonderful before we jump in let's take a hot second to thank Jacob Andrew Ruiz the organizer as each Boston it's your Mound ation let's just give them a big hand for like throwing a great event come on wonderful wonderful wonderful okay awesome so we're gonna get the audience engaged we're gonna get started with a a quick call back repeat after me when I say said Toshi you say Nakamoto Satoshi Satoshi okay all right all right we're gonna split down the middle right side just quiet down left side left side this is your chance when I say a theory YUM you say Network etherium aetherium solid solid okay left side quiet down right side you gotta show them up all right ready here we go when I say Harvard you say College Harvard Harvard solid solid okay all right all right so I quiet down website did you see what happened did you see what happened they beat you but listen listen listen everyone loves a good comeback story this is your chance when I say DEFCON you say five DEFCON have con wonderful excellent excellent all right all right left side stop stop stop stop right side personally you're my favorite side oh I want you guys to win so this the last one all right knock it out the park when I say check huh you say black chain check the check the outstanding outstanding outstanding all right uh are you guys ready for the song yeah hold on hold on hold on are you guys ready for the song [Applause] listen listen I'm not at Stanford and I'm not at Yale I'm at Harvard at a if Boston are you ready for this song DJ please drop that track Internet is that massive computer the one that's becoming really big now what do you write to it like mail now a lot of people use it and communicate I guess they can communicate with Allison can you explain what internet is always protect your private signing cartels watch those mattify's like Terra game SIBO and CM is only 51% attacking security and the financial [Music] folks permission Alaskan all my people hope Genesis block January only nine generates it at an essential time all these defaults no one can stare at the housing prices the Great Recession was the crime in my dorm straight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and trade champagne remember nakamoto's named Satoshi and the global other thing spread Eshan and remember nakamoto's name but Toshi and the global Hall of Fame ivy thank you so much for having me uh please welcome please help me welcome back to the stage all the organizers so that we can continue with the closing ceremony for eath Boston thank you thank you let's give one more round of applause yeah that was sweet uh I was yeah that was fun so on to other news we saw is worth 'if Boston and we that was ivy by the way it works are like your Instagram or some you know or your Twitter I'm sorry just google him there we go um so and this is me and I work at MIT and the people who are here were all of you so we had over 400 attendees and remember that almost you know more than half these folks are from our new to the ecosystem and our we're learning this weekend so that's awesome to see all this in all of the hacks that we got there were 55 total submissions which is a lot with a bunch of names that are hard to understand what you do but thank you all for your submissions this is honestly like a pretty high ratio of attendees to submissions so that's cool and the finalists I'm gonna name all out and let's give them a round of applause so a zero pool vent eat a massive Vitus match and I'm here on Wanda yeah and if you are one of those teams what you should do is you should stand up and start walking over here unless you're already there which I think many of you are and so open oh there you go it's and what's gonna happen yeah we walk in that direction yeah okay you said and so each of these teams is gonna have it is just like the celebration time so they're going to come up and they will have four minutes and I will cut you off by the way at four minutes also give you a one-minute sign and you have four minutes to present and then we will give them a round of applause so with that we're actually gonna do vend eath first and then the rest so let's welcome Bend eath to the stage [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you can tell why we're doing them first it's because they have some hardware here so give us a quick second to work through this yeah so what is a funny joke to tell people um what do you call a bear with no teeth a gummy bear who else has a joke why did the old man fall into the well because you couldn't see that well this is great let's have more dad jokes from the front - a joke dad joke when does a joke become a dad joke when the punchline is a parents yeah yeah let's you got one more oh we got what one other in the let's oh he likes it but he never laughs he I like telling dad jokes but he never laughs there's one other one the crypto miners say when he created his first Bitcoin I have an announcement announce Ananse announcements I assume that's a joke okay if one final one final joke anybody else Evan Joe who Craig or Wright is Satoshi that is a good joke for those of you who are not aware yeah there's yeah that is a joke watch out for crypto better people um okay let's welcome them to the stage one more time bendy everyone so I hope you had a great eye cat song and I hope you're not too tired so we are van Dee's and this is a project I've created with Alex and another teammate Louis but he's not here has it taken a bus so basically what is our project it's a crypto vending machine it's very simple and the idea was to use well at first a knife at first an iPad but it died this morning so we turn this into an mobile app based application and um we are just going to demo you the thing very simply so basically you go to our website free W that when links calm don't do this right now please otherwise this otherwise the demo is going to be screwed up and basically there is like all the product we are selling right now so you have the choice between eight same protein bar and then you can click on the one you want and pay with the different crypto currencies like aetherium or we use also conveys commerce to pay with the bitcoin litecoin and other other stuff like that and you can just hit the pay button and then you can easily pay with scrolling tours metamath just valid etc don't do that also because I up I forgot the network ID so you will be charged real money well actually do that [Music] and I'm just going to show you a quick demo so I fit the button Mehta mask and it's going to trigger transaction but it shouldn't work since it's a demo but it's not working obviously anyway okay I can so I can let you explain the rest of the things what I'm going to yeah so basically the way it works that there is a Arduino controller behind the vending machine that controls Sarah bows inside and we have a back-end program running on his laptop that was originally supposed to be running on a Raspberry Pi but dude the way the Wi-Fi works here you can connect it see that like listens to transactions or a product purchase event on a vending machine smart contract and when it detects that it'll dispense the appropriate product so there's like two smart contracts one is a vendor management contract which is unique to every vendor that sells a product through the vending machine and it allows them to specify like the vending machine the product is sold at and the price and there's the vending machine contract which the idea is that like each vending machine has its own contract associated with it and vendors can choose to like register with whatever vending machine they want and when the transaction comes in the smart contract has two ways of like paying for or handling a payment in the case of like aetherium transactions it'll send the funds to the vending machine contract which then forwards the funds to the vendors contract but in the case of like with coin based commerce on Bitcoin payments you can't like send Bitcoin to a aetherium smart contract so we have a back-end service running on a VPS and the cloud that listens to web hooks from coinbase Commerce's api and then calls a back-end purchase function which is basically like a delegated purchasing system that fires the appropriate events to dispense the products and then the back end can um yeah well for the funds the appropriate party and yeah basically this is the the project right now so if someone wants to try to trigger something you go to the website like with metamath mobile and you go to Rob's and network and try to order like the domain first link with atrium basically so this is what we created and it was very fun and hard at the same time we had some very good surprises and other not like soldering all the parts for the Arduino outside in the night in a corner with cardboard around us to avoid the win yeah or for example this box that I've found in a trash just two blocks from here so it was a really cool 7 yeah I told like we we discussed and I was saying yeah I'm a bit disappointed because I wanted to do a lot of stuff with secret contracts and be able to buy NF cheese secretly with an enigma an Aztec and stuff like that with scale side chain and eggs die for example but it was a big challenge just to create this so pretty proud of it tonight I think y'all proud too so thank you [Applause] [Music] that thank you and yeah if someone wants to go to Vinnie calm Sacha obstinate a free there's one more protein bar in a number one slot one is the one it's unplugged never mind okay so with that let's welcome zero pool to the stage [Applause] and you're looking for a dongle yeah Hey hi how's the run good we also like we had a lack of sleep we'll just stay here but yeah Nick you ready yeah I just want to add that we are very shy and can you please supplies to us please thank you so like privacy is very important for us right now and actually we decided to like make small impact to it and build is your approve what is that actually it's a way how you can make truly and the numerous transactions on a film and also we use your knowledge for that I also want to add that right now it's also in like in - version and yes like any demo is not working perfectly but we are actually going to make it happen under my net soon so let's start do somebody knows about - another cache it's a great tool but actually we have which is the same but actually we are not a mixer like how actually watched another cache is just a mixer that mix all transactions this camp - like to this smart contact and just like you Zeki starts to mix it you have a six amps and actually you don't have after make swaps or any you take so base model over it but we have so what like actually there is a big difference between anonymous transactions and mixed transactions and we have anonymous transactions and actually we have you take some model that is not rated trackable by like anybody even the creator of this you take saw cans check it so how it works we have a bunch of cryptography staff there all of that is just like friendly compatible like stock to stock a stock friendly compatible cryptography all that actually was made by our great for like friend quick talk paper before you go glam off so like if you have any questions you can easily answer to it so let's just briefly explain how it works like we need to store proofs of how we store actually we store outputs of users in sparse Myrtle tea on the smart we start only like a metal hood hedge there and each time you know a new my transaction you need to specify outputs how you like send transaction to it it's like plasma like style actually and we use just not for that so in privates data of start we use CT chemical proof and he jigsaw details is just like private data that comes to snark and also we have public data is like some about like data about notifiers of the hash of three asset ID fits transfer of deposit like oh if it's deposit of even though and actually the same book have public and private data to like it's batch of data all of that is like I'm gonna have right now and how it works basically we just send stock proof we've public inputs to the smart contracts smart convict just verify this proof after that it means like create new hash on the tree and also it gives us outputs that we can use to the next transaction so let's just show like a small demo actually I just want to add that actually we use real layers we don't like there is a big problem how to execute transactions directly on smart contracts and for that we use your layers like this is just some like some examples how we make it right now we have like simple here layer on the main chain but I don't mind chain but actually we can use multi chain or layer for that we can execute on sections like we can send a small amount of like second layer chain money to layer and this relay will execute transactions on the main chain for us it's much much much harder to attract your transactions with multi chain architecture so let's just show a small demo connect my laptop our who's yours okay actually yeah here our solution but here first we need to upload per set for snarks which is this crazy size and initially we thought okay we will do Chrome extension for this but then there is that problems like with a web assembly built especially for Chrome extensions so this like will take up to two minutes so we can just speed up this record right yes go please do about forty minutes mark so therefore the seconds mark not minutes forty seconds here I just don't show like how we start this process okay anyway here you see let's go back a once we press deposit it was like we choose a mouse that's us here's like again web assembly workers that now generate sound proof for that we gonna send to a smart contract actually here it is so can you just few seconds more okay here like we have this we scientists and transaction to : my net here's actually was our encrypted YouTube sauce first array is in public input of a snark and here is encrypted a chick so so then we send this like we wait for a couple like 50 seconds to be proceeded on my net just yeah you can go further yeah in general yeah here like all the hours generate the start data from this webpage he's now allowed to go on - sorry that's net yeah and here were like here's the process of deposit also like we debug like design atomic swaps during this hackathon but we don't put it in the front end yet but the like test is ready yeah the question for maybe Nick fans actually really concentrated on stocks and cryptography so we have all like console test that allows you to make cationic swaps it just like up twee front and side and with your eyesight but we just need a visible amount of time to implement it it's not it's not the hardest part of this like of our projects and we just concentrated on cryptography and stock site during this hackathon great [Applause] pretty classic that was cool privacy is good and also classic concentrating on the back end you can't really do the front end so with that let's welcome II was um to the stage hello so we re masam actually uh it's okay my name is ramp over I'm the guy that brought you idec's and if you're out Ethan ycx Adele it's my partner Ivan prismatic labs yep and we have created an assembler today that has a JavaScript API and we're gonna try to explain as fast as we can why we would do this so the point of this is because you can actually use this to create eath call queries to to spoof like you are a contract constructor and and use it to call as many conscious that you need and do the most complicated query imaginable on in a single transaction executed on your RPC which could be in Fira or whatever you need is to fetch data as fast as possible and render it in a way that doesn't require you launching a new view layer or anything like that you can just exploit the existing viewable functions on an existing contract and write your assemble the most efficient query to get as much data as spot as possible within inferiors limits or whatever using so to explain simply we've using what he's made called a maza to we've used arbitrary byte code execution to pretty much get them a crap ton of data and as simple of a cost possible and we're using this to check through maker dow excuse me compounds of the quotation systems in order to find who we can liquidate faster than compounds own api five times as fast five times faster right now but there's still some automation optimizations to be done yeah it's hard to read from we're gonna have an issue demoing this because actually the all we have to demo is really code and CLI tools we're gonna run the sim we're gonna make it as big as possible we have this problem at exit out to about that watching so we are going to run a script that will get us the list of addresses that can we can liquidate off of composer and while this runs I'm going to show you a sample of what the ast looks like that can run it very basic the most basic example which just is a script that will loop over I hope we have to make enough for anybody to see but this is just a short ast it's it's the it's a nested list structure and the point of that is so you can just generate macros that are just JavaScript functions that generate snippets of assembly so you can inline everything you need to do and you each call this is literally going to use in fira to calculate it just add two on the top to the number on the top of the stack until it's over ten and then return that value so at this point you can use it for your own personal computer but if your might get mad at this and they might go paid even faster so we encourage you to use this for good and not evil all right sure about this good all right so it's about halfway done running so we get it finished about two minutes over in fira so when it's querying about 8,000 addresses and packing into this mother as much cult it as it will allow us but just while this is going the whole point of this is for me to educate everybody that the trick here is that all you have to do with an e call RPC call is omit the two the two part field same as you do when you're launching a new contract to send transaction and then your call data is actually interpreting entirely different by an e therom note you actually get arbitrary objects ik you Shanaya do an assembly is because you have a very easy much easier way to write a constructor that doesn't just return the runtime code which is how a contract constructor works there are other ways to do it but they're overly complicated and also much less efficient we shouldn't finish yeah we should at this point I think everybody's got enough at the point we run a crypto server a discord server called crypto devs we're gonna post a link in the the discord here and come meet us I'm flex this key we will talk about this all day whoo Thank You flex and kiwi okay so up next we have a Vitus match let's welcome Vitus match to the stage hey everybody hope everyone's having fun my name is Robert Miller I do advisory and product work for consensus health we sort of took a different take than the other projects you've seen today we started with a particular problem in health care and life sciences that were passionate about and wanted to see how we can take these new tools that we have in the blockchain space and associated privacy-preserving technologies and solve an old problem in a new way so what our project was is connecting patients with researchers and speeding up new miracles using new cipher and square-link and to that end the problem that we're solving is that 5% of cancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials 80% of trials do not meet their enrolment timelines this is super expensive cost eight million dollars per day in lost future revenue it's really difficult to tell if you're a patient if you qualify for a clinical trial but it's a lot easier if you have access to the right data current solutions are super siloed put a lot of burden on the patient and we wanted to enable people to share their data in a more secure way so that people could get matched to the right trials get the right medicine they needed and researchers could focus on their work of creating new cures and treatments and to that end what we did was we integrated with 1-up Health's API which allows us to access up to 90% of the health systems the United States health information with your consent we created a UI for users to log in request their data share it with researchers get paid for that we integrated square-link for a seamless web 3 experience we use new ciphers this is where the magic is we use new ciphers brach Syrian Krypton schemes will let someone share their data with multiple researchers with really fine granular time limited basis access to that data and it even works if the patient is no longer attending to that information in a basic way for patients to monetize their health information in exchange for aetherium and finally we demonstrated how a malicious researcher who shouldn't have access to data wouldn't be able to get access to that data if they tried to and so like a quick 1 minute demo for you yeah so the patients are gonna come to our application and this is actually the app but we don't expect a patient to know how web 3 works and how public key management works so the integrated square-link all the all patients needs to know is their email address and we take care of their public keys and the patients can sign in and patient patients will be asked to share their email address and a Tyrian public address so that we can encrypt their health care data with their public key after the patient has confirmed that they want to share their email address our patient would be sent an email with a link that's their login link because we don't want patient to remember one more username and password just to access our website we want to make the experience as easy as possible and after patient paste this link in the web browser they are logged in to our website and they can see their health care data yep so this is the entire EHR data of this patient all the information is coming in this data is actually stored on ipfs after encrypting it using new cipher and if the patient decides to share this data with medical researchers or clinical trials they can do that by clicking on this link and after clicking on this link patients can see various researchers and clinical trials going on each of these clinical trials will be offering certain amount of each to patients for sharing the medical data once the patient clicks on one of these research research studies going on what happens is we take the data we re encrypted again with the researchers public key so for example if a patient decides to do that with that the first researcher then these two researchers cannot make sense out of the data because you would need the researchers private key or the patient's private key so the cool thing that we did here is we used new ciphers proxy encryption scheme in order to manage access to the patient's data and we integrated with smart contracts such that people can paid for sharing their information with researchers this is the output of our scripts don't have the time to demo the whole thing for you you can see how we successfully shared it with two researchers of the patient consented to and blocked one person who shouldn't have access from getting access to that data and thank you for your time today thank you okay so one note by the way is let me yeah so let's bring out an on hero two-stage whoo and as they get set up someone found us a phone under a thing so if you've lost your phone oh great perfect check check the left side they're young chicken school every one we ran on hero we created a way for people to create community around events happening in real time we think of the events in Hong Kong right now is a good example of our use case um and now let's dig in so logging in with the tourists easy seamless user experience this is me if you want to send me an email so while that's loading we're gonna tell you a little bit about the use case and the the idea that we had so this weekend we came into Boston and we were super impressed with all the technology that that we were introduced to actually we really didn't think that we could do as much with etherium as we've ever done before until coming into this weekend so what we wanted to do is we wanted to use some of that interesting technology specifically privacy side-chains we wanted to utilize some of the the machine learning sorry I'm blanking right now so privacy sidechains machine learning and we wanted to utilize some of these things in a novel idea a novel application and that's where we started thinking about a non hero a non hero is basically an application that is kind of near and dear to our hearts especially being young people who are always part of a social group and trying to be part of social events we want to participate but sometimes we don't want our activities to kind of come back and affect our work life or our home life so we want to participate anonymously we want to support things anonymously and what we want to do is we want to come and come together and create some technology that enabled us to do that and that's what we have here so I'm going to set my location it seems simple but there's a lot going on behind the scenes yeah so as Jason said they were trying to create a anonymous sort of event for people to join so how this works is so you press the button to verify his location and how this works is we set a pin point where the event is and a geofence of whether they're in the area or whether they're not and we say that data and I'll give it to you Anthony to describe before that I'm gonna start rapping so um privacy is really important if I started rapping right now they might come back to haunt me at some time so Friday is extremely important you're gonna go on you're gonna protest against Hootie the Blowfish isn't like that and you're gonna say hey I don't want this to come back to work and I'll get fired so he theory I'm a lot about aetherium is privacy privacy for what it's mostly for assets it's not for people in order I have the decentralized future we need to be private as individuals so we can keep our sovereign tree that's why you know secret ballots exist right so you can make your choice and not have the choices come back to effect in the future so we use the Enigma to allow for this privacy feature to take place so I'm at this protest I see something interesting I take a picture I'm gonna want to add the image to to the community feed I think it's the feed I'm uploading to scale and then executing a transaction with Taurus that should show up momentarily and I can see the other the other people who are contributing to this feed where they're posting what they're seeing and they're building a community around something without really just disclosing who they are and confirm that transaction and pass it over back to you Jason so what we've done here is we've really enabled our community to participate without providing our information personal information we're able to do proof of location because we're able to store that location data on chain we're also able to validate the images and content that we're taking at these locations so what we did was we utilized scale pretty much for our entire process we use their EVM we use their storage and then we also use their machine learning component we trained a machine learning algorithm that basically analyzed our picture that we sent into scaled and checked it to find out if it was a building and then sent us back a true or false if it was in our case it was a true you can think about that and think about utilizing that technology a little bit more if we had for example much more information in that in that algorithm we you really start validating things at a much higher rate so we just wanted to kind of showcase that that element so throughout this weekend we were able to use four components we worked on enigma we used the Telus authentication as well as scaled into two components of scaled Harrah's for the machine learning model [Applause] thank you yes anonymity so our final finalist is Swan dice let's welcome Swan die to the stage [Applause] this is this on area area this was a lot of fun like you know let's sleep them better you know delusional okay are we uh are we good okay all right so I'm will he's will he's will we met on Friday we did it for the meme all right we made Swan die so Swan die is a synthetic asset that tracks the deviation of dies price from its dollar peg taking a long position on Swan die can result in a massive payoff in a case of a Black Swan event so companies that rely on die for example like a payroll company that issues die payments they can hedge against death spiral and die and you know remain solvent even if everything else goes under also speculators betting on instability in the crypto markets and defy or stable coin naysayers can put their money where their mouth is and you know show us we're wrong yeah so uh we used we used um a to build our Swan die token work pretty nicely and you know we we spend most of our time doing a lot of financial engineering to make sure that this was a good asset to invest in and we'll hear can explain more on that yeah so basically we were focused on two things we're focus on getting like peak convexity if you're right hence the exponential curve and me mobility so we focus on two things we focus on the thirteen percent threshold which is where when the when the peg is above by thirteen percent then that's an important moment because default becomes preferable to to actually paying back alone in the maker system and so at at 13% it's roughly 2x returned and then where we break out at the top is that as a hundred X which is 50% away from the peg so that's like a full break of the peg and so we were considering the different factors of the maker system and also a global settlement is a potential so we thought that if global settlement happens that would potentially disrupt this so we want people to be able to benefit off of that before global settlement does what it does so we ran some simulations using data from the coinbase Die USD C API to get historical volatility of log returns and project die price forward into the future and using die price were able to get a simulated price for our Swan die token and as you can see the return distribution is exponentially decaying so if you think that the tale of the true distribution is fatter than is shown here then you might be willing to pay the premium associated with buying a swan die toten and we'll quickly do our web 3 demo yeah so we just have a very simple dashboard here we already have a token facility set up for the for the UM a synthetic asset and after you approve a token transfer once that goes through you can confirm the actual transaction which will then transfer Swan die to your address and once that goes through you can see your long position in Swan die will increase and then once the Swan die gets settled then you can cash out but yeah so just you know you'll see you there that's that's Swan dying thank you thank you tally up your heart out this wand i this wand i thank you will will and will so with that let's give them all one final round of applause okay so up next and seriously all of that was cool with visualisations our suite um so i have lost this so we're going to in addition to all of those specific all the like general winners we also had a bunch of sponsor winners and sponsor prizes and so to do that we're gonna bring up each of the sponsors if you're a sponsor start all the sponsors if you are giving out a prize walk over here if you're not already over here yes thank you run good job and and what's gonna happen is when your sponsor logo is up here you will speak about it and as a note for all the sponsors you're gonna get like 30 seconds so be pretty quick say hey here's this team won this prize this team won this prize thank you all for supporting whatever and then just give the mic to the next person so that sound good okay so first up this is actually my job new cipher had to leave they went away they went to on the train and the people from new cipher it was a Vitus match he was up

able to log on to your theory of account without while not having access to your Harbor key or other meta Basques or anything like that so that was really useful and could be extrapolated to other projects easily which is why we thought it was exciting yeah okay coin base you're up next hello everybody quinby's commerce offered an award for the most interesting use of our API and the award goes to goat okorafor using a very nifty way of connecting coinbase commerce with dye that essentially kind of like is like a charity that multi-sig that controls so all the payments that get accepted from coinbase commerce and get to this like multi c contract that earns interest on the funds that it gets so just kind of like combining the different pieces that different companies put out there and

don't know if that's ever been done like in any a hackathon but we're gonna award all three of the bounties to the same team and we think this team exemplified the you know the things that we were awarding which is the most innovative use case the best user experience and the most complete integration of our API it's really cool because we saw this application that I think is really commonplace to a certain extent so you couldn't think about it has an innovative thing but it's hugely used across hackathons all over the world and in other use cases you guys will know what it is in a hot second and also just like throw out the whole demo I couldn't tell that it was a decentralized experience there's just kind of what we're trying to bring to the market so congratulations to Anish them from Square sign for winning all three of our batteries oh and we'll be working on it personally um over the next three days and launching it with our site officially so you guys gonna go and check it out and hack Harvard how MIT should actually be using it this this coming year hello I'm Greg from approvable things and we're actually going to do the opposite and we're not going to avoid everything to the same person but we've got a 5k of credits on our main net the system available and instead of trying to pick between all the projects that I've actually been helping out with um we are spreading out amongst anybody who used our API at this event so you all know who you are cuz you've all chat to me at some point and I've got contact details for all of you cd-rw wherever you are or around are they easy as one for me to remember but yes I've got contact details world in touch so we're trying to help all developers that we can whoever's using our API you all win okay let's give everybody one more big round of applause [Applause] as they walk back I just want to note I mean it's it's cool to see I mean Ethan you know Kartik may talk about this a bit but east waterloo was at the the first eath global event was at the end of 2017 like November 2017 beginning of 2018 was East End for my first eath global event and just seeing each new event I go to it's really crazy to see all the different things that people are building on top of these platforms and I get 20 different prizes there for a bunch of different projects it's really interesting so with that much said I'm gonna go through and give all the sponsors one more big round of applause so hold your plow hold your applause until the end and so I'm gonna do my other thing I did the beginning where I talk through all of them so thank you scaled new ciphered thunder course square link ideal collab tax off Jean labs um a AKA uma Elgar and Oasis labs my ether wallet enigma consensus coin based Taurus ENS seller

Karthik I just want to give so I live in Boston these days and the Boston team I guess it was maybe 11 months ago at Def Con and then some initial calls at the beginning they've worked really really really hard on this event so let's give them one big round of plot super-awesome and because Kartik won't be able to do this for himself let's just give Ethan a big round of applause as well and with that here's a party can Andrew thanks Rhys I was actually coming up here to thank you and everybody else so thank you so much for being with ear being with us here I am no longer able to form proper sentences so I'll try to finish this as fast as I can a quick request that I have for everybody is we'll make you clap a lot more for the next 60 seconds and then we'll kind of end it so a lot of work goes into running events like these and I want to just take some time and thank everybody that actually made this possible these are you guys see everybody here just sees the two two and a half days worth of experiences but this has been going on for about 11 or so months as we pointed out we talked we started talking about doing it Boston last September and here we are now with a final product that you get to see as an experience and I want to make sure that everybody well tout is is recognizing and we're all proud of it so with that hello hello okay so with that yeah I'm just build on what would Karthik said so much work goes into this event all there are a lot of people you don't see I want to personally thank and as a team ether thank some of the key organizers Shamir Justin Dan Mansi Corbin youngin Katie Daniel John Nick Emily Lindsay and Christine they have been working for months and months on this event they're based here and a lot of the credit to this event goes to them [Applause] and these are also our volunteers we've given up their weekend to clean things up and move boxes and hang things on walls and and just help in general so please a big round of applause for our volunteers and of course the folks that did all the hard work of filtering through and looking at the demos today our judges they all went through two demos so everything presented twice to a new set of judges and they were able to sort of take out all that morning and afternoon to pick the projects that we saw here today on stage so I want to thank Emily Robbie Peter Rick Raoul Joyce can Mahesh Christopher and Ethan ash and Spencer for kind of spending all of their weekend with us and without this we would not have the finalist project so please thank our judges and of course the speakers the mentors our sponsors the custodial staff and security staff the a/v crew the university for letting us host this event and a big round of applause for Rhys our emcee so oh yeah and there's six of us that run youth global and then kind of help out with all the events so I want to personally thank Andrew Heather Jacob Josh Liam from from the global team for putting in all the effort with everybody else here to make these events possible they run a Frostburg table so back to six people presented six teams presented on stage and in we saw the bounties being given up from the sponsors but the real unique thing about these events is that if you've been to one of these before you already know what I'm going to say because I repeat the same thing but these are not competitions this is not a place for you to kind of game or win a specific thing or solve a particular problem these are about kind of how do we actually maximize experimentation and creativity and also support you from a technical standpoint to actually get better at making more projects on what three so as a result we actually don't have first second third place winners the way we decide all these events is that the judges that kind of bubble up the top six teams they become our winners everybody is treated as first an approvable set this thing but all six of them are actually first year and it has a result everybody on that team gets $500 in eighth or died and this is the first price so congratulations to everybody you presented on-site and with that I will oh this is almost f4 I'm going to make sure we end in 60 seconds okay Reese what's up one final note before you say your final thing is also for those of you who are from the boston block chain area i just want to say to note mainly that all of the boston block chain folks that are here will be on the discord and you can reach out to them and if you want to look up just go to the meetup page there's boston aetherium developers there's a boston bit devs meetup there's a women and blockchain meetup so check out all those if you're around the Boston area it was really important this is about actually increasing the size of the community here so two quick things simple request keep building on what you started this weekend and in continue working on it starting tomorrow the the real progress is you not abandoning the projects at four o'clock so it's really important for us to see progress this is how you understand how we actually make things easier for us to use as developer tools or as utilities reviews your experiences and this is what matters being able to keep on building so we can understand what to fix so with that this would not be an equal closing ceremony if we don't announce the next event and I'm proud to now set this is our last event for 2019 this is where everything started two years ago and we can't wait to do it Waterloo again on November 8 so applications are open the websites live you can go to eat Waterloo calm and if you're interested in attending this one this is going to be big because we are going to do a massive review of this ecosystem and what's changing two years from now and I kind of promised that on stage and that he doesn't know about this so so we'll see how that goes so with that I want to thank everybody for being here we do have an after-party that starts just about now it's a two minute walk it says three but you can walk faster to Cambridge Queen's Head pub and the the quick note on this is as you go in there will be an ID check if you want the drink tickets so if you are planning on you just have to kind of go through the process and add with the ID check you will be you will be given two drink tickets but even I was not talking it's four thank you everybody see you in Waterloo [Applause]
