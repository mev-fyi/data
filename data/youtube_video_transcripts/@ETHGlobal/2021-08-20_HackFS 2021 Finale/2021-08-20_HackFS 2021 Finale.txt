foreign ERS at Beef Global and I want to welcome all of you to the hack FS 2021 finale I am super excited to uh to host this today and uh we have an amazing list of demos lined up so let's get started so all of you are watching this thing on youth global.tv I want to just quickly uh remind everybody that you can log in and kind of say hi to everybody out there and also if you have any questions whether it's for our finalists or for us we can kind of ask them on the channel and we'll relay those questions to uh to the relevant uh people so with that I encourage all of you to log in and say hi and uh also um comment on how some of these amazing projects are so before we jump in I want to quickly just talk about a global hack FS was organized by each Global in partnership with protocol Labs I need the global global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to get as many developers as possible into the webpre ecosystem and this is exactly what we did with hack FS where we hosted a month-long hackathon and also a few Summits so we hosted two Summits uh showcasing what's happening in the protocol labs and ipfs and decentralized storage ecosystem with the builders stay and also storage provider Summit and then uh we held the hackline itself which is the last day of today uh in terms of seeing the outcomes the hackathon had over 670 participants from 70 different countries spending 18 different time zones and it blew us away the amount of incredible talent and diversity that we got from the participants on top of that we had over 70 mentors and 22 sponsors from the broader ecosystem participating in helping out all of our participants and uh I want to quickly thank everybody for making the last month happen um all in all we're giving over 175 000 in prizes which I'll announce at the end of this live stream after the demos so stay tuned for all of that I also want to quickly thank all these amazing companies and partners for making this event happen so let's jump right into today this event has been absolutely incredible uh from all the events e Global has done in the last four years um [Music] hack Fest 2021 has had the most amount of people uh coming in from web 2 to web 3. the ratio has been 50 and we're super excited and we were incredibly honored to have had the opportunity to host over 300 attendees trying to understand what is possible in what three as part of mcfest so after everything ended in terms of submissions this Sunday a few days ago we had 153 projects that were submitted for this event you can check out all these amazing projects on our website and I'll kind of go into all that shortly and after judging a whole 153 projects we came and our judges sort of came to a list of 12 incredible projects that we're going to Showcase today so uh these 12 teams will come on and demo what they built for this hackathon and we'll do live demos as well so um fingers crossed for everybody here and uh without further Ado let's let's get started so before we bring on our first team um I want to announce all these 12 uh teams are so we have in no particular order Discovery Co-op art data wallet slash byofm fairy fragment ventura protocol scholar Dao kirva crypto Shooters fungi proof docs and paste pin as R12 finalists they'll come on in different groups of three and uh and showcase what they've done so as we were looking at what these uh 12 teams represented we saw some really high level and common categories so these categories are a lot of these products are touching on nfts and gamings uh there are social networks here as well and interesting takes on social networks we have adapts and utilities and then there's also a lot of focus on tooling and open data and just data itself in general so we'll kind of bring these teams on in these four categories and you'll be able to see what all projects have done under these uh high-level categories so before we go on to our very first demo I want to quickly take a second and just thank all these 140 teams that uh you did an amazing job um working over the last three weeks on your project just because you were not one of the 12 finalists it does not mean you were not good enough it does not mean what you did is not interesting or valuable um we really want to encourage all of you to keep using equivalents as a way to understand what is happening at The Cutting Edge of this ecosystem and also getting help for taking your projects on to the next step so there's a lot of amazing people with a lot of interesting ideas that are here and we've already gone so many uh questions and and messages about people wanting to get help post submission deadlines so we're there for you you can ask questions anytime on Discord or message anybody on the global team or our our partners and we'll be there to make sure that you are never in a position where you are blocked on any technical level so uh please continue building I really want to make sure that you're able to get the support you need and I want to thank all of you for participating at hack fs and trying out something new and bold for the last month so for all of you who are interested in seeing what the rest of the projects have done including our finalists you can head over to showcase.eth global.com and although you'll be able to click on the hack FS event and see every single project that was submitted so let's get into our demos so we're going to bring on our first category of nfts and gaming and we have three projects that are going to come on and present their demos so we have fungi proof Co-op art and crypto Shooters presenting here so without further Ado I'd like to welcome fungyproof to uh turn their cameras on and kick us off with their first demo so let's do this all right hi hack FS I'm Mike I'm based in Colorado and I'll be presenting fungyproof in nft grading and enriching platform our team also included Brandon Abby Michael and Carl so the value of an nft is derived from its story the story includes how it's minted press events certifications and more but there isn't a way to immutably tie that data from multiple sources to a token or view it all in one place fungi proof enables owners to validate add and showcase all the value attributed to an nft with a user-friendly UI inspired by Collectible Grading Services so here's how it works first you grade an nft and you aggregate its underlying information we're coining this it's tokens mint conditions second you encase the token encasing a token places the token's mint conditions into an immutable token registry and finally in case tokens can be further enriched with upgrades achievements and items so let's jump over to a demo the initial screen for the enrichments demo is an nft wallet dashboard and the demo is built on top of the Mumbai polygon test net so first I'll connect a wallet to the Mumbai Network and connect to the DAP so you can see I'm connected there to Mumbai and we'll connect so once connected the wallets nfts are retrieved from the covalent API and cached into a textile thread DB collection and all the tokens displayed in the wallet were custom built for this demo and minted on Mumbai so clicking on a token grades the token if it hasn't already been graded and it takes you over to the tokens profile the tokens profile view displays the token's grade its image the available enrichments for the token and then its registry event log so once a token's been graded owners can encase their token I'm going to choose the polygon case which is a limited edition case and purchase it encasing a token places all the tokens data including its mint conditions and grade into a ceramic registry file and it ensures the information about this token will never be lost this registry file that gets created is also used for future enrichments so we'll give it just a few more seconds for the transaction to confirm and then the registry file to be created and there we go so the case showed up on the token there so in case tokens can be further enriched in this demo we've implemented the ability to improve a token's grade by backing up its assets this is the filecoin asset backup so again I'm going to purchase this and wait for this transaction to confirm the asset backup uses web3. storage to store a token's metadata image and any additional linked assets into ipfs and filecoin and then it ties the resulting backup directly to the original nft through an enrichment contract so again we'll give it just a few more seconds here for the transaction to confirm and then the data to also be appended to the registry there we go so once at Richwoods have been applied to a token we can view all the all of the tokens data we can do this either in the app or we can do it through the ceramic Explorer and there wasn't a test net Explorer so we actually created a fork of the ceramic Explorer and generated that on testnet and so you can see the file here for the ceramic registry at the bottom you can see the enrichments and the cool thing about ceramic is we actually have the commit history so we can click back and we can see the original commit where none of the enrichments were there all right so I'm going to take a little bit of a deeper dive into some of the tech that was used to make fungi proof the first is a new contract standard we're calling a non-fungible enrichment which is an extended ERC 1155 where the 1155 can actually be owned by another nft the second is our ceramic registry we already touched on this earlier but an additional point I'd like to highlight is that by using ceramic we're able to store data which is actually owned directly by the nft using the ceramic nft did provider and for our implementation or our first implementation of the nft enrichment we chose the filecoin upgrade because we believe improving and immortalizing existing nfcs to help incidents like rug poles from happening is really critical to the NFC ecosystem however we plan to build out a framework which includes chain link client which will enable us to support any type of upgrades in the future and finally we're working to create an incentive mechanism for Community contributions to our nft grading rubric this will help to ensure that our grading is informed by Community experts there we go all right well we're already working on a production ready release and we're ready to jump start our Discord community so definitely join us in there and reach out with any feedback thanks for watching amazing thank you so much Mike and team um this is great so uh I know this happens all the time where uh I want to ask questions and uh the attendees want to ask questions so uh I'm gonna say if there are any questions from our audience we'll uh we'll ask all the teams to uh log into uh if global.tv and and do the questions over chat but uh we'll move on to our next demo because we want to do all amazing 12 teams back to back so without further Ado let's welcome co-op.art hello thank you katika so I'm Enrique I'm from France and I forgot the idea for Co-Op after from looking at the 69 billion million people's nft the piece of art is made from five thousand tiles merged together into command canvas I saw that it would be great if each style was made by a different also and Soko part was born the platform is available at co-op.act so you can try it out right now if you want to Copart is the first ever Cooperative tile based nft art Marketplace this is how it works first create a canva and add the first Style other artists expense the canva and add more tiles people convert tiles out of the canvas each canvas is its own Gio and self-govern and finally canvas installed and profit distributed towards the contributors let's try it out connect your wallets make sure that you are connected to the magic Mumbai test Nets as I've deployed everything on the polygon testnet let's start by creating a new canvas here you can see a few options uh like the the tile size not that all tiles in the canvas will have the same size even for other contributors let's choose one subtit by 340 pixels you can also select the time period for other artists to contribute to the canvas let's choose the deadline three days from now after that the canvas will automatically lock and be put on sale meaning that no more contribution will be possible now over your mouse over the tile and you can see the coordinates and the upload button you can expand the canvas in any direction on the right side left side top side and bottom side uh there is no limit to the canvas size this could technically scale to a million of tiles let's upload our first Style I'm using apfs with the infrared gateway to store the nft image and to connect metadata so it is fully decentralized and thyroid nerves can be reassured that there are safety safely stored forever once the image is uploaded it appears in the tile you chose and the transaction to means the dial is automatically started accepted to mean the tile as a Nazi 721 token in the smart contracts the canvas is now officially started you can add more tiles yourself or wait for other to contribute let's now go to the marketplace here you can see ongoing canvases that still have time left in the contribution period and canvases that have expired and have automatically been put on sale you can see the canvas we just created right here and I can click contributes to contribute to this canvas now not that I'm using uh as I have created a subgraph to fetch data with graphql and let me know add for example true martial on this side of the canvas so one and two so while I'm waiting for the transaction to get approved I'm going to go back to the marketplace and contribute to another canvas for example this one I'm going to click contribute it's going to load all the existing tiles and I can see that all the tiles are about some typical Rage Comics however there is one here that doesn't does not seem to fit the seam of the canvas in that case I convert that tile to be removed each canvas is its own Dio and self-govern so you can click a boot or download on this one approve the woods and if a tailor has more than what than a Woods it will be removed automatically now once the contribution period of the canvas expires no one can contribute to it anymore and it automatically put on say in the marketplace like this one right here for now I've only implementing a simple fixed price sale at one metric for proof of concept but I will develop more complex auction system in the future when the canvas is purchase I can purchase it also contributors of the canvas are paid according to the number of titles they contributed for instance if you can buy stentiles and it solves for one Matic each style Creator will receive 0.1 Matic and if someone contributed two tiles it would receive open dramatic corepat is a revolutionary way of building nft act cooperatively tile-based art will lead to new and exceptional piece of Arts from thousands of the artists working together and maybe worth billions Millions like the people nft thank you for watching amazing thank you so much for that awesome demo I think we already have a couple questions for you on the chat so uh whenever you get the chance be sure get back to some of our incredible attendees uh yeah this is this is awesome Cooperative art at a global scale is uh is exciting so with that let's move on to our last demo for the entertain gaming category and let's welcome crypto shooters foreign thank you for having us my name is Joelle I'm here with Hugo from Miami cool deep from India and Ryan from Singapore and we're Team crypto Shooters crypto Shooters is a play and earned cyberpunk RPG battler and we believe in true digital ownership for gamers where the items and currencies you earn in the metaverse belong to you you should be able to buy sell and trade them as you wish so let's jump in the world of crypto Shooters takes place in Cypher City where you're leading the revolution against an AI corporate overlords by creating operators and crafting weapons to go to battle with the Enemy droids winning battles Grant you tag tokens which you can use to recruit more operators create better weapons or cash out into other cryptos or Fiat currencies so let's start by minting our first operator we do that by heading to the barracks and then going down here and pressing group and then confirming this meta Mass transaction in its current state crypto Shooters offers two different operator classes Scout and heavy and each one can come in one of four different elements fire water Earth and lightning every time you recruit you have a chance of minting one of these eight possibilities as we roll out new operators we'll also rotate which operators can be minted each operator class has special bonuses with certain gun types which increase the damage they can do when combined with the proper gear so we have our operator in our git book we actually have the list of the special bonuses they can get so in addition to classes and elements operators have the following stats as well they have a level experience power stamina and accuracy all of these can be tracked on chain and transferable with your nft if you were to sell them on a Marketplace like openc so now that we have our operator it's time to grab a weapon and we do that by heading over to the armory heading down to the weapon Merchant pressing get a weapon and confirming this transaction right here so crypto Shooters has five different gun types snipers assaults SMGs shotguns and pistols in the four different elements and they also come in five different qualities common normal rare epic and legendary allowing for a hundred different potential minting possibilities each weapon has the following stats which are randomized within a variable range based on the weapon type and Quality Power fire rate accuracy multiplier and durability no two weapons are the same so now that we have an operator and a weapon it's time to take back Cypher City we do this by heading over into battle each operator will present a unique set of four enemies to battle that rotate every hour so let's select our operator let's select our weapon now let's pick a good point here to fight it's like this guy right here and then we'll press engage and confirm that transaction now to calculate the battle we start by seeing how many shots we can take in a single engagement we then use your weapon power and operator power to calculate the damage done per shot and then we use your accuracy to determine if you hit the enemy in the head body or legs which may amplify or reduce the damage that you do think about it as a sophisticated bicycle or information on these calculations can be found in our get book so it looks like we were able to win this battle we gained 22 experience points and we earned 0.12 tags that's awesome now if you look in the top right we'll see that we have tags to claim then we can click right there and claim these tag tokens and within a few minutes these tag tokens become available in our wallet we could use them to buy more operators buy better weapons or we could cash them out into different cryptocurrencies now this is just the beginning we have an extensive list of items that we want to accomplish for crypto Shooters during the hackathon we're able to complete the first three phases of what we were planning we have a lot of exciting ideas we want to want to be able to take your 2D nfts and put them in a 3D immersive world you want to be able to provide large-scale battles where hundreds of players can come together to fight strong opponents we also want to integrate with other games an example is being able to bring your crypto Shooters operator into decentraland and play in the laser tag match and we have many many more ideas now we want to thank the East Global team uh for their generosity and guidance and if you'd like to learn more about crypto Shooters just grab a screen cap of this right here and you can join us on Discord and have discussions with us thank you awesome thank you so much for that amazing demo um and uh we'll uh share this URL on the chat as well so uh everybody who didn't have the chance to look at it or write it down and uh you can click on it directly so I want to thank all three of our NFC gaming teams uh for presenting today and kind of going first uh just super excited to see that I think the one obvious thing that I noticed that I want to point out is that for all of your demos the URLs were on production and uh while some of you were using test Nets instead of mainnets that's still not an issue because the fact that all these things will be soon available for everybody to try out is is what gets me excited so um whenever things are ready do let us know we'll share this thing with the rest of our attendees as well and we hope that everybody else gets to try out these amazing projects too so uh with that let's move on to our next three demos so next category is social networks I know when we think about social networks we're looking at a decentralized Twitter or Facebook but uh Network here is defined as anything that is bringing on different communities together and adding elements that do anything from tying reputation to a incentive on how somebody can behave and make a make a particular category or group or ecosystem better so uh we have discoveries colored down and ventura protocol coming on to talk about what they're doing for each of their respective problems and categories and their communities um and I'll let them all talk about and share their demos so uh we'll have Discovery protocol come on first so uh whenever you're ready I encourage you to turn the video on and show us what you built hi everyone we wanted to expand on bitcoin Quest by combining them with open source and decentralized content that's why my awesome teammates and I have been working on a project called discovery Discovery is a gamified learning platform that provides high quality courses built around open source trustable and verifiable content members of the rip 3 projects will collaborate with Community experts in various Fields such as content creation and research development infrastructure and security users will be able to switch between two main Pathways branched will provide theoretical content for users willing to learn how to use the best web free projects and decrypt it will provide technical content for developers and Technology enthusiasts willing to expand their skills so without further Ado let's dive into our live demo the first step for users will be to log in with their metamask or other web free wallet through the polygon Mumbai testnet when we first log in we will need to sign a ceramic string and then we will be redirected to the projects page in this short demo we will go into detail about what the best D5 projects on polygon are and how users should go about using the protocol and at the end of the course we present a quest that depends on the lesson so it could be a short quiz a code challenge or a manual action once completed the users will be able to meet their first discovery polygon nft so I'll go ahead and answer those questions confirm the transaction and it is at this point that we use chain link to verify that the user has completed the quest that they are attempting to claim the reward for chain link will check the summary the ceramic stream and verify that the users the ID has a record of completing the quest related to the work and only then will the user be allowed to mend their nft which is stored using nft.sturge in addition to creating our lessons and questing house we also plan on making the platform completely modular we focus on this by creating and providing a template and working with official protocol teams so that they are able to create courses and challenges for the things they would like to see their protocol used for with this projects will be able to work with the discovery team and community members to create content as well as offer their own rewards in conjunction with the discovery in a few words because we we are emphasizing majority we are also using gitbook to create content like many other protocols so we've created a plug and play GitHub action that can be used in any repo and the files will be uploaded to ipfs through web3. storage we then generate an nft that contains metadata such as the ipf scids the name of the users the GitHub commit ID Etc we then upload that nft to nft.storage and we also create a ceramic document that contains the CID returned by nfk.stitch so in case you're wondering how the courses are created first it goes to the get book then on the merge request uh when we approve it a course get gets created by hitting a graphql endpoint and we'll go through the technical overview but I won't stay too long here feel free to re-watch the video and hit pause on there so that's for the GitHub GitHub action and that's the technical overview of the discovery mono repo so what's next uh displaying the content of a course uh Dynamic nft profile that would evolve with the progress of the user displaying projects data from the relative sub graphs create our own subgraph in order to get rid of our server-side graphql and ceramic instances to stream tokens with superfluid contributors creators Etc applied to Grants programs more hackathons and that's it for us thank you very much thank you so much Axwell this is a great demo and with that let's move on to our next team and that is scholar Dow so whenever you're ready turn on your cameras scholar.team and share us what are you built right [Music] yeah uh Hello friends so um I am Chrome I'm a student from a university blockchain clubs or you can see our club my club here in Singapore and yeah so we are scholar Dao uh with the aim to make the peer reviewing system more transparent and very viable so our team comprises of four students coming alive from India Singapore or Sweden so pumping into each other underscore and we are of fascinated by the ID of the centralized research so um like we have two people doing the product development and two people to in the backhand development or small contract development so our projects has um for five main features so firstly we provide open assets of people to to everyone secondly we use the ipfs for ficon to install the paper and making science censorship resistance shortly we make the open we make the review open to everyone and the final decision is taken by a valid teacher um yeah and firstly to incentivize everybody to um act in the best interest of the public we make a reputation system uh compressions of Statistics accounts or health in gas using the subgraph and finally um the ownership of the people installed by using the nft and so that the author can sell the paper later all right so now let's jump straight into the demo so now let's see um I'm gonna use yes the account scholar one and uh the title of the paper is ethereum yellow paper and it should be in the field Community sense um sir distributed system to business uh specific and I'm going to keep 0.1 either to the valid creator and let's copy the validate address over here a little bit about the validator here so you can see the validity here uh he or she can add as an editor of a journal so to validate the paper and they need to um stage some collateral into the protocol so and to become a validator and in return They will receive the tips or the rewards from the scholars for validation okay let me continue to upload the paper yes okay now I will submit yes just use the scholar account to submit the transaction from it now you can see right so there is a paper number three um if you want yellow paper which is in stage of crafting and now I will use the validated account to acceptabilities and requests come from it another paper should be in stage of pre-print so now we will go into the um yeah the the paper um yeah the description of the paper there should be ipfs link here and now uh I'm going to use um scholar 2 account to add a review here and let's choose the file called pay-per-view and there are four decision a set minor revision major revision or return so just accept like a spread my acceptance I opinion here now I'll just see yes there is review here um yeah we can build build the review at this link and yeah uh let's now use the validity to account to publish this paper out um yeah so now this paper is super Institute of published so uh so now let's move on to the sub graph so we this is the subcraft of the data which crop from the smart contract on the test net and now let's query it so you can see like the query is about the information of the paper are like the idea of it the owner like with paper inside or with paper like a certified and for the scholar it contained information about the hatch index here of the IP and the problem yeah how many application he orc has all right so uh with that um I want to continue to talk about the future development of the projects so in the future we might provide a professional ownership of the keepers or we can use the quadratic printing to run the paper um and more ranking methods can be added into the current system where we use hatch index or centers and cards now and finally uh we want to onboard installer by using other chain link cling after chain link with the Twitter handles and yeah so that is our present system thank you for watching amazing thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh we already have a couple questions coming in so I'll encourage you and the rest of us called our team to uh go back to eat global.tv and answer some of those questions I think uh uh as a comment from uh the chat as well for those of you who tuned in to uh the opening ceremony for hack FS three weeks ago uh being able to think about how decentralized web affects Academia it was a pretty big theme from dibology and metallic and one talk so uh it's it was amazing to see so many people try to do something in that space as part of their submissions and it's called that was in another Amazing Project from that category so with that let's move on to our third project from this category and that is Venture protocol so George whenever you're ready feel free to show us your demo foreign protocol is a place to brainstorm and request nfts and digital memorabilia that doesn't yet exist so we are developers spanning us UK and Europe so what's the inspiration behind the project um one interesting example of digital memorabilia is these emails from italic and Gavin that he tweeted talking about early development of ethereum so another example is from the late 90s um DVDs used to contain plenty of extra content like um director commentary or behind the scenes content and recently with streaming that content is no longer there because the reason the reason being is that it costs a lot of money to produce this content and there's no guarantee that the users will want to pay for it for this so another more recent inspiration is irrevocable protocol which was the finalist in hack money and from the keynote Balaji talks about [Music] um converting influences to be crypto creators so this really resonated as well so how does ventura protocol work you'll have basically a list of requests here and if you want to create a new request you just tag a person on social media so we support Twitter and Instagram so I will select Twitter um I go continue we do a covalent credit check what what this is used for is to make sure that the user has it checks my wallet right now to see if I have the funds to do a pledge important field here is the 24 hour balance this we're making sure that the user actually has the funds and isn't just getting a flash loan so to kind of cheat the system we also do this check cross chain so that you don't have to move your funds from Main mainnet to polygon to just do a pledge so if I hit continue um this is the place to enter some text with your request we support erc20 tokens so any token address goes here and the amount determines the rewards So currently if I set the amount to be 0.3 is which is close to a thousand dollars if the nft sells on an open auction for for a million for example I would get as the top pledge I would get 62 000 which is pretty good reward if the nft fails to sell on an auction I will lose my 1000 and I will gain the nft the rest of the people who pledge behind they they receive proportional rewards this is based on square root formula between the difference of sale price and pledges so what happens next is I'll do a transaction on polygon in the background we are uploading content to um to web3 storage and filecoin this is textual content it's going to be immutable we then save CID on on the contract and we do another credit check through chain link Oracle to make sure that the Unchained data is is correct and then smart contract simply emits a bunch of events that we subscribe to using a graph protocol subgraph and that populates the actual front end so let's have a look we submitted um actually there's an there's an error now so each I'll switch to a backup so each user um gets a page they can share and users can add to a pledge um multiple users compete for positions to get the maximum Rewards and later stage is that the Creator gets alerted of this and they will just upload a preview and they will then ask to lock up funds from everyone and then rewards will be distributed so then the kind of idea of this is to be completely censorship resistant protocol and to be completely decentralized and of course the front end like this one will be moderated to prevent spam but the protocol is completely open to people developing their own front ends if they wish um that's that's about it um if you like the project please get in touch if you would like to be a co-founder if you if you know any Angels or if you are an angel please get in touch with me that's probably easiest and uh thanks a lot this is ventura protocol thank you thank you so much George that was awesome and uh yeah this is uh this is great so that concludes our social networks category and um and also the 50 Mark of all of our demos we have six more remaining and without further Ado I'd like to welcome the next three projects and that is well looks like I did not share properly in that category is um Taps and utilities so uh we'll have Doc's Ferry and paste pen present what they've built um and uh let's welcome docs with our first demo foreign my name is Connor and I'm in New York and today I'm excited to present docs which is a web 3 notebook linked to your ens name or ethereum address let's take a look at the app so duct is a web 3 notebook kind of like notion or hack MD linked to your ens name or ethereum address it uses idx ceramic ipfs filecoin and web3. storage to publish your documents on the decentralized web I was heavily inspired in this project by notion's seamless editor and data model I was especially interested in exploring the challenges of building a responsive real-time app that's backed by decentralized storage that was definitely a challenge you can use docs as a Blog profile Journal homepage Wiki and more you can edit text upload files and images and embed Rich content like videos bookmarks and nfts you can create a profile that's linked to your ethereum address or ens name to share the docs that you create with others and of course all the documents you create on docs are public so do take care when you docs yourself here's how it works so everything inducts is a block Pages text and content blocks are all stored in ceramic streams as tile documents that means that each block that you create has an immutable version history here's an example of a block that represents a page for identity docs uses idx to link your ens name or ethereum address to your documents it maintains an idx index of blocks and pages that are linked to your ethereum address Ducks itself is a typescript and react app hosted on ens and ipfs you can access it through a webview Gateway or directly if your browser supports ensname resolution check it out at docs.eth or docs.link finally image and file uploads are all stored on ipfs and filecoin using web3 storage let's look at the editor first so here's the editor you can change the Emoji here up top text blocks support inline markdown stuff like bold italic and strikethrough inline emojis and lots of other markdown elements you can embed images which are uploaded directly to ipfs as well as files like the ethiolo paper here and the blockbust editor supports a number of other Rich content blocks things like bookmarks embeddable media and even a block for embeddable nfts okay let's add a new one at the bottom the heck of this to view the public version of a page click copy Link in the upper right here's an example of a public view of a page you can see there's a nice clean reading experience and the author of this Doc is linked here in the upper right either by their ens address or their ethereum address you can click through here to see their profile here's mine for my ens name horsefacts.eath this profile page pulls information from my idx profile as well as from my ens address text records if I have any of those configured so you can see it's got my display name some information about me an emoji your profile pic and a cover image if I have those configured that's all coming from my idx basic profile over here on the right I've linked some of my social accounts Twitter GitHub Discord Etc those are stored in a separate supplementary idx schema and most important you can see on my docs over here on the left that includes the Ducks we've been looking at in the demo today so go check it out live docs.link find my profile for horsefox.eth so the really cool thing about storing your identity on a decentralized decentralized profile is that it's portable across the decentralized web so when I edit my profile and docs it's available to other dapps here's an example of the same profile which I created on docs being displayed and used by another dap this is self ID so here's what I learned from this project first working with decentralized storage means getting used to working with a different set of trade-offs in web 2. you get great guarantees about immutability versioning data verification but you have to think a little bit more about stuff like latency and serializability second web3 can actually provide an amazing serverless developer and user experience I was surprised throughout this project to find how often my Dev server was totally disconnected I was still happily working on my app since the data was being loaded over decentralized protocols I think with a little effort web3 can be even better for developers and users both than web 2. and third and finally don't try to rebuild the text editor in two weeks if you can help it so check out docs you can see the live demo at docs.link or docs.eth you can view my profile in the demo Pages we looked at today at docs.link horsefacts uh right now this is running on Clay's ceramic test net and Robson but we hope to have it on maintenance sometime soon so thanks to youth Global again for a fantastic event thank you so much Connor for that awesome demo and uh it's even better to hear that it's already live and anybody can check this out um so uh with that let's welcome our second demo and that is team and project fairy so Ryan whenever you're ready thanks classic can you guys see my screen yes what I think everything is great oh cool hello agrofess my name is Ryan and this is Ferry a ux friendly web 3 file transfer tool built on ipfs and falcon uh we are a team of South African ux UI designers and developers from Cape Town South Africa so what is Ferry put simply our tool sends files from one person to another uh similar to other web 2 tools that you've used but now decentralized what's the problem the world desperately needs direct web3 replacements for web 2 Tech centralized file transfer tools are wasteful by Design and in the end and the end users pay the costs opportunity the web 3 ecosystem needs solutions that let people migrate without even realizing it our solution is to provide a familiar workflow for file transfers one that mirrors what people are already comfortable with so how does it work very leverages content addressing in order to minimize our storage usage and we pass these savings on to our users we use protocol Labs web 3 storage to upload contents of those files which can then be shared via ipfs Gateway link ipfs this content addressing minimizes our storage use by preventing duplication and we pass these savings onto our users and so the smart contracts currently deployed on the polygon test net we have number one the core Ferry contract which handles payments Pro subscriptions and integrates with Ave to earn yield by lending out the protocols die and number two the nft mental which integrates with chain link and Zora to bring true Randomness to the randomness of our nfcs plus one more special announcement in a bit so let's get to the demo and show how anybody can pick up this tool and start varying files instantly all you need to do is visit our login page and since we use magic link you'll be logged in instantly and created by a user interface that you're probably familiar with if you've ever used a web to trans file transfer at all before all a user needs to do to start varying files is select a file to vary let's go with some beautiful art and we can also optionally choose to send a ipfs Gateway link to an email address of our choice um and then we simply need a variate What's Happening Here is we're using web3 storage to upload a file to ipfs which will later then be persisted on filecoin as well we then are able to generate an ipfs Gateway link which you can see over here and that is the same link that we actually emailed to another user if you choose to and you can see here I've received the file and we can open it up from that ipfs Gateway link and it's really as simple as that and you might be wondering over here what's up with this file expiry and why is it grayed out well we recognize that software development is not free and we need a sustainable business platform for an app like this to continue to grow and that's why we have got a pro subscription so in order to use our Pro subscription all you need to do is connect your wallet approve and while we're waiting I can say that the die on pain gets deposited into avey's landing pool and polygon and can be withdrawn by the multi-sig when we need to pay various operating expenses and seeing as this is the first time I'm subscribing from this wallet I also get a fairy nft right now the contracts have been triggered through chain Link's verifiable random function service which is generating a random number to determine the Rarity of our NFC which is being minted through Zora's smart contracts on polygon once this payment concludes will be taken to our dashboard which is available to Pro members so as you can see here we see details about the files that we've uploaded their names how big they are when they expire and of course we also see details about our nft uh the most important part and you can see that because I'm unlucky mine is a common one so you can try Ferry out yourself right here at fairyweb3.4 cell.app um and this will be available on the main Nets in the next week or as soon as possible as we work on fixes and future improvements so in conclusion one more thing we've decentralized uh we're decentralizing control of the protocol everybody in the hackathon will get some of our governance token ship in the upcoming airdrop you're all going to own a piece of Ferry Ferry's mission is to accelerate the adoption of web 3 through easy beautiful ux combined with economic incentive flywheels and file sharing is only the beginning finally our special nft is a reward that will have future benefits for the community follow us on Twitter at fairyweb3 to find out about where we're going next and welcome aboard awesome thank you so much for that Ryan and uh what is smooth and uh seamless demo so that's great um I'll encourage all of you to try out Ferry and uh with that let's move on to our last demo for this category and that is paste pen right whenever you're ready and uh they were still okay I wasn't looking okay uh hi everyone I'm from Hungary I'm uh my name is marathon and during the hackathon I worked on paste pin which is a site that allows you to share text and try this in a decentralized you know decentralized manner using just a link this concept might be familiar to you if you've you've used page bin before which is a similar kind of site except your data is stored on a decent on a centralized database and your data will be could be taken down anytime and to counter this issue I built paste bin which is a site that stores your data on a decentralized network it uses uh that three dot storage under the hood which basically uploads and pins your data on the ipfs network it also manages uh that deals with the storage Brokers um so let's take a look at the demo here we are have a markdown editor and I'm just going to paste in hello overall the solidity example let's review it I'm gonna give it a title and now we have two options either to publish it anonymously or using a signature I'm gonna go with the first option now and uh now it's uploading the content and uh okay I think I forgot to refresh the site uh let's do that again I'm not sure what's happening uh let's try the signature demo then first uh here we basically signed the message and uh here we can see the message that we are currently signing I'm going to click sign and now it's uploading it and then you get a link and this really should work oh I think it was uh yeah there's a currently bug in here in there that if it's not refreshed or it's if the site is cached then the redirect doesn't work but I think our first yeah the first example so we're I just had to refresh it uh sorry about that one and so okay here's our hello world example and here we can see the uh when it was created the total size that it took the number of pins and Deals it currently has which will probably go up in the future and we also have a direct link to the ipfs Gateway where we can inspect the content in there all of our data is stored in this paste pin.json file currently let's inspect it right now so here's the content that we put in there and the title that we gave it and uh yeah um let's uh take a look at the signature example the only difference uh there is is data other than the content and title we also stored our signature there and uh are associated address with that and we can everyone can verify this on the client side and we can also see our batch here um that uh this message belongs to this address and uh one thing I forgot to mention is that you can also upload and attach any kind of files in there you can remove it if you'd like to and uh yeah I'm just gonna put in something there to Showcase it and uh it'll be redirected I'm gonna refresh again not sure why this is happening and we'll get a downloading their link there also for a file uh and some of our future plans for this is to also host the site on the ipfs network and provide a way to encrypt the content and then basically only give access to the people uh to the post to those people who have access to a secret key and then also to create a subgraph of our pins and uh give the users the ability to query their own pins basically so that was a paste bin I hope you enjoyed the demo and you can go and head over to facebook.xyz to give it a try if you'd like to amazing thank you so much there's a little bit of Hiccup there but it all worked out nicely so don't get too stress about uh some minor difficulties cash in validation is a is not an easy problem so uh this was great um and also just like the the other two Demos in this category they're all live and I'm able for everybody to try these out so be sure to give some of these tools a try and uh answer any feedback that you have forward to the teams here to improve them so with that we are ready for our last three projects uh for the demo yeah so without further Ado let's welcome our next category so the next category is data and tooling and more specifically uh projects that are helping Advance just what it means to own and manage your data but also encourage more open data and web3 Integrations so we have three projects coming on we have fragment kirva and data wallet slash byofm and um we'll kick this off with fragment and uh I'll let the fragment team demo what they've built so Thomas feel free to get started yes coming up so thank you very much I hope you can see my screen now so um hi I'm Thomas from Paris and with Philip under the fragment team we built a data processing pipeline platform to enable a more open and collaborative way to manipulate your data thanks to ipfs IPL the influence so the first question we asked yourself coming into this hackathon was um why is an ipfast used more for collaboration in data science well the first insert we found out was that ipfl is still a tool that is quite unused when you need your schema to be flexible the third insert we find out was that there are already some quite powerful tools for data manipulation even if there are clothes like for example cargo and the third and final insert that we found out and we focused on for this hackathon was that we needed a formal definition of what a data pipeline could be in an open environment so we Define the data pipeline as a stack of transformation that would be run on top of an original data set so if I have an original data set which could be x0 and we run a transformation which could be x0 F0 sorry on top of it we could generate a new data set X1 and we could do that with any any data set in that way of building transformation in history it goes pretty well with ipld schemas that we could upload that we upload on ipfs to build their history now before going further on with my explanation I will demonstrate the hacks that we did so um we are we are here in the context of Alice and Bob that wants to collaborate on a data set typically with everyone so I will as there is upload the sentence could be demo that asset and I will also import a new transformation you have to know that all transformation here was the modules that runs on the reference test net and for example let's create demo transformation and once it's uploaded I will be able to go back on my data set details here and check that the data set is only a Boolean a number and string and I can't even check that it has been properly uploaded to ipfs if I run a new transformation on top of it like here for example the one I just uploaded you'll see that it can here add some value to my data set switches the Boolean and concatenate a new string now let's say I share that link to Bob so that you can also manipulate the data and check it out with the history well but when you arrives on the link here you'll be able to go on ipfs in equal ipld to check here my triplet of data for the transformation the input transformation bytecode and output data and see that the data is the one that is claiming and it can run finally a transformation on top of it if I run the same one as that is dead you can see here that the data with evolving the same way so now how did we build that well firstly we used ipfs to store data sets and the pipeline metadata with iple schemas and to run the transformation we call the freelance Network give it the CID of the input data sets and the transformation by code when they have run the transformation we get back the result data and uploaded 12pfs to complete the iPad schema that I talked about and in the web demo we wanted also to integrate sdx uh sorry idx for uh some collaboration with issues on top of the data sets but we didn't have the time to do it why we think this project is important well first off we think it would free you from flood platforms that could because whatever you can be run on field Network on your client browser and many more runtimes it will also free people from closed data science platforms like for example cargo and it would also bring a fresh air in open data where we think that the main problem is there are consistency and we think that way of doing history building would solve a lot of problems if you'd like to continue with us and you're interested in um that's where building transparent history and data and data transformation well at polyphen the company I'm working at we are building a protocol open sourcing in September that share the exact Vision that I just talked about so feel free to follow us on Twitter to have more information coming up and I'd like to thank it Global and protocol labs for the nice hackathon we had friends for the amazing help and availability and all sponsors and actors for participating and let's keep building guys foreign thank you so much for uh that awesome demo Thomas and uh yeah I can't wait for us to try this out too in a month um so next up we have kirva and uh I'll let Hugo present hello everyone so I hope you can see my screen so today I'll be presenting caravan.org modern scientific publishing platform based on ipfs so about the team um you go sell French cyber security student based in Luzan and I had a solo team since all my friends were on vacation um so since I'm about to graduate I spent a lot of time during the summer on archive um and I realized it was a pro platform that had a couple of problems so just as a little bit of context first off archive is a major player it has 1.2 million visitors a day it's a top 2500 website but it has centralized servers the review process is totally non-transparent and you also have concerns about the censorship so as a reference I put two stories here uh first one about Nico rgc and the quantum physicist at the University of Geneva wondering if his students were being blacklisted from posting their work and also a story about Brian Josephson a Nobel Prize winner in physics whose article was kept in review for too long because these ideas were so novel at the time so as a solution I present karma.org where you can host your paper on apfs and iterates all the very nice properties of ipfs like fault resistance and image immutability we have a review process that is community based a bit like Wikipedia where you can State funds for CBO resistance and also we could be experimenting with new forms of scientific funding like using nfts where you could mint your paper as an nft for example so what has been done during the hackathon part of the scientific taxonomy and create a modern web application so it was not that hard because the the design of archive is all the is 30 years old so it's very outdated um index and upload the metadata of around 1.2 million uh articles abstract titles authors uh dois and everything um I downloaded all the scientific papers from 2000 to 2012 and they are slowly being uploaded to ipfs and as an experimental feature you can mint your paper as an nft on the polygon right net so um what's next for curva we should upload the rest of one terabyte more of data source and PDF file to ipfs so the source files are the latex document the figures and everything I would like to create a community to Define and deploy the community reviewing process and also improve the web application so with that let's jump right into the demo so you can see here that we have all the texts telling me clearly laid out uh either you're only sharing the PDF so we can see the browser oh thanks thanks for that so let's go back here we can see that the taxonomy is clearly laid out with all the different categories that archive archive has um so let's jump right into computer science for example uh cryptography and security which is my field and here you'll be able to see all the different papers that were recently published you can expand expand the article CD abstract and you can download from ipfs um if the article is still not available as a pragmatic solution you can download from archive as well and here we have our upload feature where you can put your title the abstract upload your PDF to category in which uh your paper is posted put the author and as an option Minted as an nft we plan on having a thread where you can vote on different papers to raise their visibility or not and to conclude the website is itself hosted on ipfs using flick it's a great service so I'll really consider checking them out it's really easy to use and it's really useful to post your websites on the decentralized web and the full website is open source you can start us our PR us on Gita on GitHub to raise the visibility of the project again and the site is live right now at www.carva.org so with that thanks a lot I would like to sell you the organizers the sponsors and the participants thanks for being such a great community amazing thank you so much for that awesome demo and another exciting project that uh that's live um everybody can check out immediately um I think somebody already just pointed this out on the chat but there is a very clear theme on some of the ideas shared from our kickoff talk typology and metallic and Juan that a lot of them became real ideas that people can use immediately so uh so with that let's do our last demo for today and that is finalist team number 12. uh data wallet slash byofm so uh whenever you're ready we'll feature demo hello hack FS uh we are two's compliment and four of us from the Indie Dow have built the data wallet and the byof marketplace to show an example use case uh the data wallet has social graphs of trusted people so that any Gap can load data curated by specific communities so we'll start with some context here we've had decentralized data for quite a long time now but creating a civil resistant method for curating indexes of data has proven to be very difficult without recentralizing those indexes the graph has done an incredible job of tackling this complex problem with chain-based data which has inspired us to create a user experience for user-owned off-chain data these great projects and many more allow people to host and use decentralized data however when using adapt most people only really care about a subset of that data now if we put our trust in a single party to Define these subsets we're actually recentralizing it and leaving ourselves vulnerable to attackers that can spam the data set so who can I address what data should adapt load for me specifically and we experimented with these ideas on to review at eat Denver and realized a need for curated groups of people who are trusted so that people can pick a trusted group of people use that data for any dap to load in and use this list of trusted users is actually different for each person and already represented by their social networks so we just need a standard that all adapts can use in order to aggregate that data from someone's personally trusted Network enter the data wallet so first users upload their data to ipfs and filecoin then they index it with their idx then communities or users can Define groups of trusted idx identities finally users can tell adapt to load their preferred subset of curated data imagine people bringing their own data to each data they could say something like hey you're the people I trust load all of their data for me to interact with and then be able to switch between communities like load my Dow or load people I follow on Twitter or you could do it based off of tokenomics or something like load all FWB token holders much like visiting a subreddit that aligns with your personal interests this plugin is the missing link for dapps that want to pull in curated data specific to each person's social graph and trusted communities it's something that we've been challenged with by judges that pass hackathons and we've actually felt the need for on real projects at TC so to demo an example of how the data wallet can be used in real life we built the byof marketplace recently several projects have either chosen or been asked to take down certain parts of their daps that are hosted on web 2 DNS around the recent unit swap edits Sandy tweeted bring your own front end byof reminding people to bring their own UI choices removing some of that burden on the core Developers so here's an example of data how data wallet can help in a real life example to bring your own friend Marketplace a demo that lets users bring their own front end to a Smart contract using their curated data wallet the data wallet loads decentralized records from the user's curated list of trusted people then show them what front ends per smart contract are being used by each community this allows them to select a front end and load it directly from ipfs or filecoin in their browser completely bypassing the need for DMS as truly intended then the data wallet the plugin itself can be added to any data so like here it is on uniswap users can create their candies that they trust so you could build this out here where you create a new community let's say we want to represent the TC Indie Dow we just put in all of the bids of the members of that dial maybe this is voted on through a multi-sig or you could just import from an existing social graph by Twitter Discord whatever Community you're already part of so let's take a look at this demo in action so here's a live demo of the code so we'll start by logging in our metamask getting an instance of idx so here you can see we have one record this is just a fake smart contract it might be the unit as well one I think actually pointed at hack Fs in the website uh deployed to IPA ipfs so here's this demo that I set and you can see it the Gateway wants to load come on Gateway okay Gateway doesn't want to load it but it would be to point there on an ipfs so you could put any Gateway and grab it uh and then you can head over to an admin portion and check take a look at the trusted identities so right here I only have one trusted identity which is just myself but in theory I can add anybody else by their dead right here and it will aggregate the data from their accounts as well and then we can set these actual byof records kind of like DNS so in this instance with my zoom window in this instance we could take the smart contract and we could point it in an updated version so this is just an ipfs hash of an alternate deployment that'll say hack file version two so if we come back here and Bring It Off you can see that version two has been set as my Raptor so if I come to that if it loads you see that that information so web3. storage is loading in the full front-end code build and then pulling out a metadata schema and then pulling in that information for the site and then I can also select existing communities or sets of curated data so if I wanted to load the Indie down this has that list of dids of all the teammates and it's aggregating all of their data so you could see different versions as well as validations for how many people have each record set so the older versions can kind of show that they're not as popular as newer versions which helps you find the right front end to go to so uh we just launched the Indie dial recently so you can follow us on Twitter to get updates on this project and you can check out the actual data wallet code prototype on GitHub and we'll deploy the actual Marketplace to filecoin using the publisher app which is another submission uh shortly here and so we're super excited to tackle this specifically for hack FS we've been thinking about a long time and huge thanks to youth Global all the sponsors and hope you enjoyed our hack awesome thank you so much Nico that was a really cool demo and uh it won't be a live demo day without Murphy's Law coming in uh but don't worry it's not you um what's happening is there's some DNA shortage going on or that is going on a couple other teams are affected and I've noticed this happened uh behind the scenes so for a few more projects so this was great being able to keep actual data portable and really take it wherever you wanted to take it with customizability is kind of the way we get excited about for web 3 in general so seeing a project that makes it a lot easier is incredible so uh that said those are all 12 finalists some really amazing demos and projects and so many of them are just ready to be used by anybody out there um and I'm constantly Amazed by the quality and the the level of energy and excitement that all the teams um bring on and uh and showcase when they're demoing but also participating at all these events so that concludes all of our demos uh before we go into the prize which I know a lot of you are waiting for I want to quickly bring on Luke from protocol labs this event has been in partnership with the protocol Labs team and uh they've been amazing Partners to work with this is our second year running acafes and uh I'd love for good to share a few thoughts on on their experience from the event too thanks Karthik yes so I wanted to thank everyone for participating also I would like to mention that last year I was actually participating in the hackathon but as a hacker afterwards that I joined the protocol Labs but it was a great experience back then and it was a great experience today being part on the other side so uh this year was uh great and we have seen like a protein applications by a high margin but we have also seen the quality of the application grow a lot and uh yeah overall we we felt that there is much excitement in the episode of nfts and everyone that is currently I'm going that was kind of expected for outside thanks for organizing this now of course uh this uh this was funny because I did not know that uh that this was the whole Loop of you kind of going from a hacker to now on the protocol apps on the other side and now coming back as a as a a key player in in this whole event so uh this this is the perfect example of how we kind of close this Loop and make this full circle on bringing more people into the community so I'm just so happy to hear this great surprise for me I should have done my research here on this one but uh I'm glad that I didn't this is amazing so thank you so much thank you sorry go ahead yeah at the end of the day we are all here to to actually make a substantial impact that is going to happen in the next five to ten years and this is just the beginning and I think that most of us that have been in the consistent for a while are aware of that but it is also important to understand that from a hacker's point of view it's not hard for you it's just the change of The Parting that we've been waiting for for the last 20 years and if you get good at this right right now it's going to be great for you both in the professional standpoint but it's also going to allow you to do some impactful work in your life which is probably much uh it's much more important than anything else uh looking after the situation today absolutely and I think um one thing that I that I like to mention every time when we were doing these events is that uh it's the incredible things that all the participants and hackers do that end up becoming important pieces of tooling for making it easy for the next wave of developers and and participants to to not do the work from scratch so just being able to participate actually further solidifies the rest of this ecosystem because now every month you get to kind of just leverage and import a thing that wasn't there before and it does make your life a lot easier and this is the exact definition of technical progress um and and how we actually build on top of each other's work and actually collaborate at a global scale so thank you so much for uh for those kind words um and I really appreciate working with vertical labs and and seeing you here so uh the moment all of you have been waiting for I've gotten a lot of DMS we got a lot of emails um and I know that there's already a lot of anxious people on the chat here uh wanting to know what's going on with prizes so uh let's jump right into it so our biggest contributor to prize and our biggest category of prize is the protocol Labs so what we've done is we've asked protocol labs to also share a video on their experience at the event and also who won their prizes so we'll get the video rolling now and we'll go over all the remaining prizes immediately after so uh let's uh let's hear Dietrich comment on all the winners foreign welcome to the end of the event my name is Dietrich I'm from protocol Labs I work on the ecosystem team you may know me from many previous Global events and hackathons and hanging out on the channel helping you build your web 3 dreams today we're going to share our winners of the protocol Labs sponsor prizes first reminder why we're here what we're building what we want the future to look like thank you so much for joining us participating in these events thank you for showing up with your ideas your questions your hopes and dreams and a real dedication over the last month to making those things real by building your projects we had two classes of prizes for hack Fest for protocol Labs the first grand prize five of them actually ten thousand dollars for the file coin each top five projects we had a group of Judges from political Labs looked through your submissions judged cross design novelty technical depth complexity the usability of your solution across large numbers of people to change their lives daily and how much fun and how creative well-designed your projects were we also have a pool prize for anybody that uses used our new service web 3 storage as well as estuary.technft.storage slate.host that you've seen previous events that is a total of fifty thousand dollars in file coin divided evenly between all qualifying applications fantastic to look through these submissions and see the wonderful things that you have built without further ado I'll share with you the grand prizes first crypto Shooters uh wonderful design really fun well done execution really slick example that other projects can look to to build this type of application a bunch of moving Parts delightfully done thanks team for building it and next Grand Prize winner data wallet and the ability bring your own front and Marketplace especially in this world of decentralization we don't have centralized places to go look for our stuff for our apps for apps that are recommended by others by others that we know and trust not just anyone these trust models are especially important when we think about what decentralized ways of curation are going to happen team did a great job building a really nice user interface really easy to follow implementation a very thoughtful approach to trust models for curation and sharing and overall excellent and very pleasing execution to look at thank you Dee the third grand prize for argument starting with the premise that the decentralized data economies that we're looking at Primitives for decentralized Superior networks and tools and the malleability and usability and availability of data on the decentralized web makes it the perfect solution for data science tooling and applications to ask the question why isn't there more of it and they built an application to make it as easy as possible to interface with simple centralized and decentralized data sources and work with them easily fantastic implementation and execution really a joy to look at how ipld was creatively used in this particular solution fantastic job uh the next Grand Prize winner check out FS uh this is a very practical approach towards a new solution for things like Shopify but that work on the decentralized web again uh that really the combination of of uh design implementation and uh thoughtful approach towards their user base made for a stand-up entry submission thank you check out FST and the final Grand Prize winner it was games fault uh this was another area where we're seeing where where's my stuff where's the stuff I want how do I discover it how do I share it another uh fantastic implementation for a collective decentralized uh store or launcher for decentralized games as more and more of where we spend every day is on uh depth and in Dows we're going to need these types uh implementations for decentralized front ends to have a high level of quality the place that we want to spend our time that we can share with others has ease of use and excellence in design so thank you James fault and thank you to all the Grand Prize winners of the protocol Labs sponsor prizes for hack Fest thank you for submitting to our prizes what comes next uh you may have seen our talk about the file coin and ipfest grants programs before what do you do when you want to keep packing on your project when you want to turn that project into a business maybe you want to take it to the next level we have several different types of Grants programs we would love to support you in your use of decentralized Technologies like ipfs coin with P2P you can come find us and our GitHub repositories uh github.com grants and slashcoins project upgrades we would love to be able to look at your idea and support you making that idea a reality we also work with a number of different accelerators incubators if you've already built the concept I think you have a business idea that's really going to work out and you're looking to grow that into a business work with long hash outlier techstars these are some of the just some of the partners that we work with the field of fund help fund projects like yours so please come find us thank you so much for participating in hack FS your projects and your work matters the things that you learn help you build the reality that you want to live in and it helps us learn about what you need to be able to do that challenges that you're having and all of us doing that together makes the web better and we all live in a better place thank you so much [Music] amazing some really kind words by Dietrich and lots of encouragement to all of you to keep building whether that's making this a business over long term and going out for the accelerator programs or simply getting a non-diluted grant to continue uh funding yourself while you make the project even better and add more things or fix more things to it so a lot of amazing projects and a lot of cool winners that were just announced what I'll do is I'll just summarize them again for all of you who miss them uh protocol Labs is giving ten thousand dollars in Fall coin tokens to these five grand winners for their category and these five products

wrap this up I want to say a few quick thank yous a lot goes on in the background for making an event like this happen over close to 800 people in total are participating in hack FS from so many different parts of the world and that includes obviously U.S hackers we have judges speakers sponsors mentors volunteers that give their time to making these events run really smoothly and and delightfully and want to just make sure we give a quick shout out to all of them to thank them for all the time and work they put in so first I want to thank all of our judges and mentors who were there talking to all the amazing submissions being able to look at 150 projects in a day is not an easy task let alone do that and also provide advice and guidance on how you actually take this to the next level and improve it so I want to thank all these amazing judges for giving their time then I want to thank all of our speakers who did workshops and talks and office hours and feedback sessions so many incredible uh people talked about what you can do and how you can make your lives easier as you were thinking about your hacks and um without their hard work and time uh we would be not in the best place to encourage all of you to quickly get started and also not do everything from scratch so I want to thank all of our speakers and then lastly also want to thank well not Leslie I also want to thank all our sponsors who are here uh actually hanging out in the trenches and uh and talking to all of the attendees whether it's a question about what they can do with some of their protocols or their products to any general question that you're stuck on and be able to get guidance and help and advice on so many incredible people here that are part of our ecosystem whether it's on the ethereum side or the protocol lab site or just overall even previous attendees coming in and helping each of us each of you be successful at your goals so many people that make this happen and I want to thank all of them that have been part of hack Fest and also a lot of our volunteers who ran a lot of anywhere from judging to the zoom sessions to a lot of uh talks and workshops behind the scenes they all dedicated their time to make sure that you have the best experience so I want to give a quick shout out to all the volunteers as well and lastly I want to quickly thank the global team a lot of people here on this list do a lot of amazing work in the background that you don't really get to see and and that is an honesty the quality of the really great event when you don't have too many things to complain about you don't notice what's happening behind the scenes so uh to Nisha shangan Luke Emily Andrew Jacob Heather and Liam all the work that we get to be proud of is because of all of their time and effort and dedication so thank you to the global team as well so um let's wrap this up in a few minutes so we had 12 teams come in and uh present uh what they built for this hackathon and we also talked about all the prizes for uh everybody who uh applied for a sponsored prize but uh we still call them finalists um and and there's a reason why we call them finalists is because we don't structure any of global events as a competition we really want people to just experiment and see what's possible and that means you have a whole spectrum of people who are just curious about trying something out whether it's a hello world to people who are interested in making these businesses and everything in between and we call them finalists because we don't really want to make this for a second third thing um and and sort of discourage anybody from continuing to just explore and see what what is happening um and whether it's for fun or for profit so we call them finalists because for us all 12 of these teams equally came in first and uh the way we want to connect thank all these teams for doing all the same amazing work and showcasing the projects is that every team that is a finalist each team member is going to win a thousand dollars in die from these 12 teams so this is a small thank you from the global team for really making uh really cool projects and and being part of our community so all finalists team members are going to be getting a thousand dollars in and die so uh with that that concludes hack FS 2021 it's been an amazing four weeks with so many people um so many first-timers and so many people that have already been part of our ecosystem from the past events I want to just really thank again all of you for giving us your time and and sharing what uh what you have to offer to the rest of the world as well and just being excited about everything else you're doing um before we wrap this up I want to make a quick comment so there is uh one or two more prizes that have not been confirmed just yet so what we'll do is we'll award them directly on the Showcase we will just see who won the prizes and uh also um similarly we'll be sharing the full list of prizes on Discord very soon so if I missed a sponsor or if we couldn't get them back in time uh don't worry it doesn't mean you didn't win anything it just means that time wise it didn't work out and we'll share that very soon on Discord so um with that this concludes hack fs and this wouldn't be any Global event without us telling you what's coming next so uh before we close this off I want to announce our next hackathon and event that's going to be happening and that is it online this is going to be Global's biggest event of this year biggest in terms of size time
