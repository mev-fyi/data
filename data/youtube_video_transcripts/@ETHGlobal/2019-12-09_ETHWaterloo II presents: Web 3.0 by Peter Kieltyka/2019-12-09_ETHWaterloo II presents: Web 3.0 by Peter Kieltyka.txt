his co-founder was the co-founder and CTO there is also the co-founder and CTO press today he's the co-founder for the first time two years ago the first one and actually the important from all fours the Pegman check game is pretty sweet and now yes nice to be here with you guys after spending two years working on a video game which will show you so my team and I which were 22 of us now we're very excited about exploring video game experiences and incentives in the Western era so I'm here to tell you about my perspective what web 3 means from a product perspective so first you know focusing on kind of web 1.0 really which is a kind of get the interconnectivity of information so kind of looks like this back in the day you guys remember starting with Netscape downloading is just rather bold like tapping into this endless sea of information that's hyperlinked kind of starting interesting where it comes from like starting from HTTP transport protocol you know resource a unifier a locator to connect information in HTML that document standard all of the standards really protocols and the browser which really you know represents this world wide web the vision of open and connect information to allow me to access to publish into this network is something really that started us to be here and definitions my life and have spent hundred thousand yeah and so when we think about web 2.0 you know it's it's about the connectivity of applications networks and people and that's where we are today and so what kind of occurred obviously browsers became incredibly powerful javascript in the browser essentially converged to the ability of abilities of what a desktop could do to the extent that you know companies like Firefox and group or Mozilla and you know via Firefox Chrome Google their browsers are like operating systems and in fact even today when we talk about like web assembly as a kind of essentially a universal machine level language it's people are even putting web assembly in the Linux kernel which is just wild and no car chains of course soon and it's essentially deepen the experience that allow anyone to instantly access applications and software for anywhere from any device for free without you know in a sandbox in a kind of a secure environment and interestingly this right here is autopilot which is actually a web application in a browser this is actually chrome of most reviewers Melissa and so of course there's also an emergence of networks of social networks the connectivity market became online obviously like e-commerce was kind of fulfilled by usability and the collaboration across ecosystems like clouds and you guys this is this is webtoon 2.0 the Kinect so we kind of came to the point of the connectivity of information and the kind of emergence about the wide global connectivity of individuals and people as Bruce and now you know what I think about what web 3.0 is really the internet of value and so it's kind of looking back what to attorney these applications and networks into economies and this is again my view and that I'm extremely excited about and so what's written what makes it possible is to create and participate in open and secure digital economies so for example the simplest thing would be has a user of an application you can actually generate value just by being a user evaluated and just like we do on mining just a couple underneath your it started just typing in my mistake might help you secure the network you also get to earn the near token of that network and if in this case I leverage apply offering like compute power I can really theory which is pretty sweet and so another great example of kind of offering you know in a lot of ways it's kind of like value share right you produce value you get and so the great browser which offers it you may buy the extra syllabic CEO you know they have there such as a privacy derivative browser where you have access to the control as to how my appetizer is where people actually you your fingerprints on and you can opt in to choose to do that and advertisers publishers can target you with you'll actually earn back token as a result of that you signal you can take that about token converted for various different pairs of the Marquis of gesturing or guy or whatever stuff maybe he'll sell it back to advertisers who want to be targeting other users which is pretty cool so surfing the web you're earning family so I'm working on a game called Skywalker this is what we can do it for two years really excited looks like this it's actually a wedding my gmail game built our own engine it's a so it's a 1vs1 multiplayer turn-based strategy game similar to night Pokemon ukyo hearthstone and so forth it's available on 74 platforms will just magically annex iphone into right but and it's you know it's so the idea of our team as you know targeting a theory an ecosystem is that we have four hundred different types of collectible cards these cards are yards 1155 tokens but forget the number not really that important or to the extent is that their type of cryptocurrency token that exists in your wallet so you're able to all done and you're able to trade them with one another it's really cool and it's funny in in the digital cardinal space what is it you know two billion dollar market they're actually not you know you might hear that turns TCG or CCG they're all CCGs because they're just collectible card games in the digital space there's really no one not even magic together make that are less you trade with your friends it's really interesting and funny and because it has great implications to the economics but there's also a ridiculous sentence by having the opportunity to own these items but also being able to make game the final you know the idea of generating value and acquiring value so as a user as they're leveling up in your and your clogging the ranks the production of our assets and our economy such as which is our card you know our economic asset is the actual game card itself on a weekly basis this is probably inter assets so the top players that are simple weak unit to a bunch of silver cards over in and we distribute them to people's wallets and that's the other way to get produced on you win the card you put it in your wallet and this is real honoring to be we have a good number of users and it's only growing and getting people love the game actually the guy who worked on the game is the guy you could work on metric together you could play it everywhere obviously so there's a fully integrated wallet you can see on the awesome ether we have arcadia point it's essentially a stable going to private time and it's actually capability but you can see the reward from the leaderboard here I have I can actually go to my wallet I decide to send it to my friend if I want to like a descending there it goes or I can actually put the market place and I can you know the cards that I've went through the leaderboard in a free video game I can there you know sell it on the open market for you know you know whatever the markets accepting at the time you know really seamless experience and that's kind of the point as to what I think we're all kind of obviously heading in terms of all the sudden ease in Greece's for protocol design there's a puzzle productize that could have an intent experience to be able to deliver what I think oh you know value sure and so in you know climbing is longing for opening so yeah sky we were free to play later go to sky without net and give it a go if you like it's on the rickety Network and I think that's generally my presentation but the message I would leave everyone is just did that he of critic value have any really different values and perspective that I think is very novel of what these technologies are allowable and it's really just the beginning for wife three there's there's so many vectors and use cases for it in this open commerce on formal and you know really exploring the space so really excited and thank you very much [Applause]
