that weren't recognized in the front end thus restricting access to the back end we'd like some further assistance with connecting the back end contract to the front end web app as well as some methods of transferring ether into the smart contract on a more personal note i'd really like to thank market make for all the opportunities and resources they've given us over the past month we're a group of extremely motivated individuals with a lot of time on our hands and we'd really like to pursue this project even further we believe d5 is the future and we want to be a part of it thank you well that was great awesome uh so we'll start for for awesome thanks um yeah awesome presentation guys um i guess one one so it sounds like this is sort of like a prisoner still i'm a game for employer employee relationships and presumably the idea is like you want to incentivize some outcome regardless of whether it's a positive or negative outcome rather than having is it like you you don't want the i guess what is the adverse case here that like the employee just doesn't hear back yeah so the worst case scenario is like if the um if the employer basically puts in money and then the employee says that they've done their job after the time that um you know when the employer can actually call the refund um and if that happens well um the employer the employer wouldn't be able to get the money back but the employee wouldn't really get the money in you know either way um so the money will just like be in the smart contract um still and basically burns got it okay um well uh you mentioned that you're interested in pursuing this further what would you do as part of pursuing it further yeah totally so um i the biggest trouble that i encountered when you know we were kind of building this out was connecting the back end contract to the front end we needed to figure out a way to um after strapping in the metamask um being able to send ether uh from the front end um and then onto the smart contract and then having that contract uh subsequently transfer ether over to the other person's wallet um and so uh considering that we are all kind of like uh blockchain beginners uh i you know you know read a lot of documentation but wasn't able to find a way to do uh you know that tech technological piece so would have really really liked um you know some continued assistance on that technical matter um what what are you kind of using as part of your stuff are you using ethers or web3.js yeah webvjs um and we're using ether as the method of you know trans transaction currency right um definitely definitely check out uh ether's js i feel like the documentation is a little bit easier for people who uh like who are still kind of getting their feet wet just because it's a little bit more expensive wow thank you so much for that resource really appreciate it that was awesome guys i really love the enthusiasm here and the originality of the idea as well i think it's i think it's quite cool and something that i haven't really seen um done before in the space so yeah kudos on that um i don't really have too much uh too much feedback just uh oh questions sorry i just wanted to give that feedback keep up the great work guys really appreciate it man he means a lot to here uh probably echo the same sentiments i think it's uh yeah it's actually pretty interesting to um consider what what you guys are gonna build up um in some extent um i'm curious if you happen to have any any other plans to build also um features around um i guess communication um channels and and the platform that kind of make it easy for for people to kind of get um get a chat with each other in case uh just before the arbitration essentially happens but yeah that actually sounds pretty pretty awesome in in terms of what you guys managed to pull out so far thank you so much for that thought originally we were actually talking about um having like a communications platform on the actual web app um so then people can actually talk to each other regarding you know like the first check-in um and you know making sure that both sides complete their end of the bargain to prevent any ether from getting burnt because we don't want that right um so um you know that's definitely coming in the future you know iteration of the project um for now we were trying to bang out like the uh the mvp of the actual web app um so yeah but thank you so much for that suggestion really really appreciate it um just one more comment on that uh we are actually planning on having a chat feature within the uh within the website um but the chat feature would kind of close once the contract is agreed upon uh because what we figured out in the game theory is that if you were to be like an employee scammer and you were trying to scam the employee you could just message them like oh i'm just going to click cancel you can click yes and you'll get your agreement fund back or you could click no and you'll lose everything um so so that that um canceling of like any communication between them kind of makes it so that the only way for somebody to do that to like we we called it like a fund hostage situation um would be to like explicitly write that in the contract um and then in that case it would just be the fault of like the employer not reading the the contract or kind of not really um right not really editing the contract to their liking yeah but i just want to thank the panel of judges again and also thank mark and make um for you know giving us the time to do this um would really and you know like arjuna offered us i would really appreciate like the resources um or maybe like some pointers maybe for where we can continue to read more documentation and grow our uh blockchain slash eath coding skills awesome that that puts us in time everyone that was awesome uh presentation thank you guys uh we're gonna break now for for 10 minutes um so i'll ask the judges to um you can make sure you're muted feel free to turn off your cameras we'll return at 10 23 eastern time in 10 minutes and the next team uh before everyone leaves is going to be derry one so if you could raise your hands and you'll be back in 10 minutes thanks you you you you you you foreign all right we have returned wait until judges are good to go and turn on their cameras technically we're not done yet with break but start in about a minute all right looks like we've been hopefully joined by a couple of the judges maybe all right okay everyone is back the first team up is dairy one feel free to share your screen and begin hello um we are team dear one and we are building an on-chain options aggregator and the problem that we are trying to solve is that it's very difficult for both developers and traders to get the best options across the protocol and the difference between uh protocols are pretty huge for example last last year at the end of last year i found that the price difference between hazard and open was more than 50 dollars and now we are going to demonstrate what we have built um during this hackathon so this is the front end that connects to the smart contract and as you can see traders can immediately know what the ethereum price is right now as this is pulling the live data off point gecko and then this is the form that they can type whatever rate the shrek price range they want and the expiry date of the options and they'll return it in this table below whether it's hg or char so let's say they want it from first of january to march 31 from let's say two thousand dollars and ten thousand dollars the option size will be five and then once i click submit they can see the premium they can see the expiry date they can see the option size and the price so egypt does ten thousand tron has a option for 2200 and they can do that and they can just enter whatever input they want the option table will return different prices all right so to explain our system more in detail when a user calls our contract with some condition like strike price and expiration date the contract fetches all the options available from hedrick and charm protocol for now and uh it calculates the price for each and they return only much options with the price to the front end um and all all of this uh requires no gas so um people like traders and developers who call our contract do not have to worry about the gas price at all and for our future plan um at first we're going to add more protocols um i know that there are at least more than 10 particles right now so we keep adding them and then um at some point we will start at more assets like wrap utc um and uni and then also since we support only call options right now you would want to add other options type like put and cover calls and finally i think the logical extension of our protocol is to expand to other derivatives like futures and yeah we are pretty excited with what we are bidding and thank you so much for listening awesome let's open up for questions uh i really like how original this is i don't think i've seen something like this um before within the ethereum space and you know it makes sense as you said there's like 10 or so kind of options protocols now probably more you know there seems to be a new one every day at this point so having an aggregator for this uh is is really important i think and you know the fact that there's no gas required to fetch this sort of sort of stuff as well is really great obviously from a usability perspective uh as well i guess on that note are you going to build in kind of functionality into your own app for people to execute on these things to like you know buy this option or whatever on your app or is it just meant to be like a soft kind of aggregator yeah so um you want to focus on product smart contract cloud mostly uh but we are obviously creating the front end uh part of it as well and i've talked to other um you know developers in the in the in this industry and uh i know at least like two other developers who are interested in on integrating that protocol to their front end so um we so we will have an official application but we're also open to collaborate you know with other front-end applications awesome awesome well yeah great work guys thank you um i guess in terms of that um i'm just kind of curious what your considerations are when you kind of stop thinking about integrating with other i guess option protocols or um potentially including more complicated um i guess structured products if i might go to that as part of what um is part of what this this contract can accomplish so how how um how easy would it be for you to kind of speak around the existing contract architecture to kind of support um other forms of um options and other forms of integration such as uh yeah i mean we need to understand each options protocol in detail uh like how their mechanism uh their interface like how their contact blocks how they you know their uh pricing phone and stuff like that and we also want to make sure that these particles are legit so um it's very important for us to choose which protocol we are going to add next and understand on each particle deeply that i asked your question um oh yeah i think i can get where you're coming from uh just just kind of curious about what what it might take uh on on your front on on your side to actually independent along those lines and how flexible it is um i guess how how important is it for you guys to be flexible in terms of the contractors so support other forms of options so yeah okay but yeah i mean it's it's just uh just uh thought so what would anyone would be interested to kind of take a little deeper and see how um how you can kind of actually uh be it might be easy enough for either you or for other teams to kind of start considering and creating this as part of what they offer up to the users and start just and actually see this is a distribution channel so um yeah all right um i want one question that i had was like how are you actually are you are you aggregating just like the actual like option prices um between between these different protocols or like also things like like other other fees that are baked into the protocols themselves um we the most important thing is a premium option price but we we also um need some other data like strike buys installation date um asset type or you know um football call stuff like that so so the front end in the front and traders and developers can get all the things done okay that makes sense um yeah i like i was just gonna say i like how you've done it because i was asking because i'm just comparing it to other aggregators like one inch which are just like horrible interfaces because they're just they're trying they're like pulling so much data from on chain and i like the way that you guys have done it it's a lot cleaner thank you cool that puts us at about time thanks guys all right thank you everyone thanks for your job um the next team is avgmarket feel free to share your screen the project avg market so um in this question the user acquires an nfc coupon with a unique critique number by purchase ticket a random tk is drawn at a fixed time interval and eliminates the number from the pool if the ticket number is the same as the loader number the user can get the coupon and users can swap coupon today with ava fortune run easily this is demo first of all you can create this retribution coupon so set the coupon token name and set the coupon tekken token uh symbol and also you can set the nft token images which is 30 uh deploying to ipfs also you can set the ticket price as a number and also set the distribution interval is based on the menus and duration for buy and token for buy the submit first of all the images is different to ipfs then you can approve the contracts just processing the contracts right now then yeah so coupon successfully created so in the landing page you you can see the newly distributed coupons so you can view under your coupon you can buy the ticket of the coupon so you once you close your submit i first will approve the contracts for buying ticket once of proving is done you can make the process for the contract after done yeah so you successfully bought ticket then you can see the different state of the ticket so you have one ticket right now so [Music] when the distribution is complete uh you can see the the resource of the occupant status like so if you win number is just rotary numbers so if the rotary number is matched with your ticket numbers it shows is a win is yes so so you can get the rotary number so you can to cram the coupon just click the coupon approving then make the contract process also you just recommend your coupon is yeah to cover it this is the finished state so you can see on the metamask on your account you can get the yeah nft welcome great thank you let's open it up to questions i think we lost we may have lost victor yeah let's see if he will give him a minute to join he may have dropped off oh is that will oh yeah sorry sorry about that feel free q a to begin any questions uh from the judges i guess uh there was there was mentioned of the i guess swapping the coupon to die with an other uh flash loan i don't think i i saw that in the demo or was it is that um something that that you have built that's that's part of the the demo or is that something you have to build still um actually it's for the tree i tried to actually it's the first time to the upgrade uh the d5 solution to the depth so i tried to upgrading the the fresh run with ave so that is my idea actually so uh first of all i should want to wanted to follow the fresh run uh normal process like swap deposit borrow a payback process so at first launch as many die as the value of the coupon and then swap another coupon which is less current value uh with that die uh maybe from decks like uni swap or one inch then after selling to existing coupon then we paid the amount to die to ave but i already implemented smart contract uh but i actually there are some blockers actually while connecting to the other restaurants contracts so and there's no because there's not enough time so i just yeah present the demo what i did yeah yeah that's okay i totally understand i thought it was just like a cool idea as well so yeah all good thank you um yeah yeah it just give the sense that um how how um easy was supposed to kind of um uh start using i guess the the um integration for you i guess what was there what was i guess the um was there something that that he kind of found was unusual the surprising ones but you kind of use use use that um you just use the vrf um functionality or um yeah oh sorry as i oh where's the questions not that yeah the person was just just around the notion of how how easy you kind of found to do to actually start using the guess the uh the chain link vrf and it would kind of integrate with um with the uh yeah with what you kind build out which is part of the component system um actually normally so so to generate the random numbers i just use number used with the chain link vrf it's really really easily combining both of them but as i said that so is regarding fresh run is really difficult and um yes that makes sense that's pretty cool uh what would actually be yeah i think it's awesome though that we're kind of trying to construct something along these lines so yeah i would also kind of encourage you to kind of have a look at uh some some of the the price book builders that um that put together is kind of uh plugging together so i guess that might kind of make it easy for um thinking of doing uh um i guess custom interactions with um in in some sense and kind of uh use use that as a plugin to build build this out and see how that works but yeah it's it's awesome okay thank you right that puts us at time thank you very much avg mark appreciate it yeah thank you bye and the next team is diary prosperity feel free to share your screen i don't have anything to share because i wasn't really very successful in the past um but basically my project was to build a an app a decentralized app to issue nfps that were personalized by the creator and then the nfts could be used to create signature tokens that could be distributed and they would tokens would have a short lifespan so they basically they would authenticate a person's identity to prove they're a real person not a body and the signature tokens would uh melt away quickly or vaporize after a short period of time so that the user would have to reissue get new ones so that when essentially giving the person like a business a [Music] um so essentially the idea was to have of a let's see if i can get back on track here to have the credit delegation don't worry take your time being used as a means to capitalize and keep this thing funded so um let's see the wallets that are credited delegates would create a funding a liquidation pool to essentially fund the whole project as well as give a high return back to the depositors and essentially i had too many technical difficulties so i wasn't able to get very far with the actual coding but most of what i was able to accomplish was just trying to understand the technology to to verify as a backup my ideas that it has some merit because essentially trying to prove people are real online is a very difficult situation uh where i was trying to go with this what were some of the difficulties you ran into um well my difficulties were just trying to get the development environment going because i don't have up-to-date systems and i had already in the past i tried to get like node.js and stuff going and so my system was a massive i didn't want to mess with it so i just went to aws and set up a server and started trying to work that way and then there's lots of little everywhere i turned there was something else i had to figure out but i finally got to got uh scaffolding up and running and started working on it basically ran out of time so my main difficulty was just trying to figure out like what kind of questions i could ask because it was so many different things to learn here that so i was just mostly just going from all directions trying to pick up different pieces of information from all the different workshops and the resources everybody was making available i was using scaffolding how was using it did you run into any issues with that or was it specifically like um once i got it going it worked pretty good um i i had got it going i got it going before about a month before so i kind of had some experience with the getting it set up on my computer but then like i was trying to do it remotely which made it more fun to try to figure out so i which um uh often griffith helped me there he figured it out real quick i had a problem where i wasn't talking and so he just kind of said oh here it's right there it's just kind of you're doing a local host you're not doing it local hosting you need to change your court open your portfolio oh yeah so um yeah uh yeah i have a lot to do on this project i'm not giving up well that's awesome and it certainly sounds pretty interesting um so i'm trying to understand a little bit more it sounds like what you're doing is issuing a temporary token um and then that token gives you access to uh like rewards in the form of tokens yeah the idea is to where the depositor is like pausing in a bank the and the money on deposit is like the idea would be a stable coin deposit and then it would be credit delegated and then using all that money for you know funds basically blended out to generate returns that and they can basically keep this whole thing afloat using basically every different protocol that i saw there is about they all have different features in them that were i could see as fitting in to make it all work and like the governance because i i see it but i want to occur as this thing you just decentralized just running and essentially no company or nobody involved like like essentially once people's like identities are put into ipfs back in an encrypted form so they can be drawn from when they're essentially they use the personalized token the nft would be like a um like an access control mechanism basically yeah they would like kind of a boxy or something like that or be something some hook to it to make it interesting for people to want want it but then it would be used as like a authentication fee so so they could be used to create signature tokens and then those would be used essentially a person would give it out to authenticate themselves and it would be trusted because they could see who they are and stuff i have an idea for how the person is i think i'll thank you as a real person different ways of going about it creating a pretty elaborate sort of method but basically trying to separate it so that it's secure so no organization or person you know unravel it so basically every person can be one person in this environment and kind of give them back their individuality of people you know weird sort of way that's awesome yeah that's awesome that puts us at about time but thanks for you know all the work and learning everything that's the main goal of these events we did here keep on it thank you um presentation thing is a learning thing for me yeah awesome um we're gonna do it now a switch here um the next team isn't here but the earlier team bizarre finance who we had to um skip over before is so they'll be our last team um bizarre finance if you uh can share your screen and remember to share audio and begin can you see this yes okay this is bizarre finance a scalable continuous financing for open source project via altruistic yield we're solving the problem of misalignment between value capture and define and open source dependencies a project might create billions of dollars in value however the software that the project is dependent upon is only able to capture less than one percent an average maintainer have an unpredictable income having to rely on grounds on the other hand for the project themselves they may be willing to find open source but they know that their treasure is finite although they may value having their dependencies maintained most will struggle to justify the roi we believe d5 can fix this we solve this problem by better capital allocation we allocate a fixed portion of monthly interest earning on your savings to a recipient and the rest to your account every month we split the interest into two trenches one is a fixed amount allocation that goes to make open source revenue goal and the excess amount is distributed to the depositors a frictionless public good funding with positive yield let's say they deposit is sushi swap and the recipient is hard hat under the hood a treasury made deposit died through the heart had fallen we didn't take the diet and then deposit it too overnight giving us a diet that's streaming interest sushi swap would there is b die representing the principal and the both parties can start not receiving interest maintainer receives predictable income while the d5 protocol gets to make constant donation without spending generate revenue from interest and giving the core team the peace of mind that the upstream software will continue to grow with them there are other benefits to this construction the smart contract that we do develop is completely trustless and autonomous their revenue earned can be rolled over to the next month and the deposits go into allowing you the barrier to entry for the next depositors for the depositors they retain 100 of the capital without a backup period and as total value increases the interest earned becomes competitive we have developed a working decentralized app deploy and integrate it to ave on copentestnet so here we can browse through the list of projects we'll select hard hat here you can see your balance your principal and down here you can see total value block income goal and the total amount raised so we will deposit 2 000 guys and just like that your b token balance increases and started earning yield for hard hat and ourselves there are more efforting for us to go next including ways to increase speed token utility such as this ability for depositors to vote on features or github issues as for depositors there are ways to read i'm going to have to interrupt for a second we're only seeing the the one screen i'm sorry i didn't notice it first come again we're only seeing uh we're not seeing the demo as it proceeds the opening slide bizarre finance oh no um is there a demo that a video demo that plays yeah i think so could i yeah could i share this on our zoo yeah okay i think it could be something wrong with my my desktop because the video is playing on my end okay okay hold on give me a second here stand by i'll see if i can share okay all right um you can stand by sorry about that guys sorry about that all right i'm about to share now sorry thanks for pointing it out andrew i was like refreshing my screen over and over again trying to figure out if it was on my end yeah is it sharing now it is not okay stand by guys i'm having my own technical problem here don't worry it's always it's always the last all right restarting i will restart i now have everything set sorry about this okay scalable continuous financing the altruistic heal we can just see our discord not the video okay try that again give this one more try guys okay now let's try define and open source dependencies a project might create billions of dollars in value however the software that the project is dependent upon is only able to capture less than one percent an average maintainer have an unpredictable income having to rely on grants on the other hand for the project themselves they may be willing to find open source but they know that their treasure is finite although they may value having their dependencies maintained most will struggle to justify the roi we believe d5 can fix this we solve this problem by better capital allocation we allocate a fixed portion of monthly interest earning on your savings to a recipient and stream the rest to your account every month we split the interest into two tranches one is a fixed amount allocation that goes to make open source revenue goal and the excess amount is distributed to the depositors a frictionless public good funding with positive yield let's say the deposit is sushi swap and the recipient is hard hat under the hood a traditionally made deposit died through the heart had fall we did then take the diet and then deposit it too overnight giving us a die that's really interest sushi swap would there is a b die representing the principal and the both parties can start receiving interest maintainer receives predictable income while the deep protocols gets to make constant donation without spending generate revenue from interest here we continue to grow with them there are other benefits to this construction the smart contract that we do develop is completely trustless and autonomous their revenue earth can be rolled over through the next month and the deposits go into lowering the barrier to entry for the next depositors for the depositors they retain 100 of the capital without block up period and as total value increases the interest earned becomes competitive we have developed a working decentralized app deploy and integrated to ave on copen testnet so here we can browse through the list of projects we'll select hard cat here you can see your balance your principal and down here you can see total value locked income goal and the total amount raised so we will deposit 2 000 die and just like that your b token balance increases and started earning yield for hard hat and ourselves there are more efforts for us to go next including ways to increase speed topic utility such as this ability for depositors to vote on features or github issues as for depositors there are ways to reduce overheads such as depositing into index of projects like youtube clients or whether it be tooling or a pool that acts as a git coin and grants donation master we did the map and reached 50 million in total value lock we will have enough to fund over 100 developers at a minimum based income of fifty thousand dollars rethinking our solution amongst the next level of open source contributions within the ethereum ecosystem in such a way that you truly scale alongside of the application layer with full sustainability but there are finance scalable continuous financing for open source project the altruistic yield you can visit us at the bazaar.finance awesome guys thanks let's open for uh questions um this is this is fantastic like holy crap this is an excellent idea uh with excellent execution um then it is extremely extremely needed in the space so well well done um i so there's there's i also really like the the possibility of like having indices of different like open source projects because i think that's that's probably that was actually gonna be my first question before you uh before you mentioned that because i think like as a as a person running a company like i wouldn't want to have to go and do due diligence on a bunch of open source organizations like it would be nice to just like blanket support all of them um i guess my secondary question would be like uh i think uh you know people running protocols and like protocol treasuries are going to be significantly more risk averse than uh your average d50 gen and so um i think one one concern or like one thing to to to like think about is uh what is the potential you know like risk associated with depositing into these protocols and like have you guys thought about like insurance and cover against that yeah um we did think about that and and for us it's uh we also look at those like group of three positives as two different groups so i think being like treasury i think they can absorb more risk um so so one of the things we're looking at is ways to uh using like nexus mutual or other insurance protocols and a way to for people to select different uh yield like interest bearing um protocols that they have like a risk tolerance for so that's definitely something that we thought about yeah i'm certain that treasuries would be willing to accept a lower interest if it included like like protection downside protection against like any potential hacks and things like that yeah absolutely yeah i thought it was really good as well i'm pretty pretty impressed by it i'm a big fan of kind of like bitcoin and funding you know open source projects and and this you know makes a lot of sense right and i'm with you you know there's a lot of money kind of floating around and not a lot of it goes to the you know the underlying technology that actually supports all of this stuff so everyone else can make money so yeah i just wanted to say you know echo arjun's thoughts here that i thought thought it was a really cool well-executed project as well i don't really have any questions just wanted to give that that feedback uh on that note anthony is that uh we we see that as open source not getting funded as a kind of like a risk as well to these protocols so so effectively from perspective of risk that arjun just brought up it actually de-risked them because if they are a patron if they're a sponsor then they make sure that these like protocols that they are consuming that continue to grow with the uh with the application that they're building yeah i mean that makes a lot of sense as well because i mean even if we go as low as the ethereum base layer like i'm not sure if you've seen like the core developers and how they're like you know there's not many core developers right that work on this stuff and they're responsible for the whole network and you know they um it's not just them but like all of these other kind of dependencies so yeah definitely uh uh kind of feel that would uh this just be interesting to even expand upon and just encourage you to think about what it might mean to and include um i guess uh the the notion of utility that you touched upon for b tokens because uh that might essentially translate into um might be very very interesting to actually see that being used towards the um just the creation of other other forms of licensing schemes and how especially for um i guess um the the the core developers were working um on some of these um on some of these public utilities and such uh but yeah i'm i'm very very curious to see what what people would make of this in terms of um having um having external um i guess feedback from from the community and and having that way in into the overall roadmap but yeah i think it's it's going to be a very interesting um i guess way of introducing more um more more forms of feedback in that context um especially around the utilization of the the resources as they come because uh yeah um fundings funding is an awesome awesome thing that that's that's that's always needed uh i think it's it's gonna be even more interesting to kind of get uh people to kind of weigh in with yeah it's gonna be super super interesting to see how that goes forward so are you are you guys planning on following up with us like continuing to to build this out yeah absolutely uh actually at the start of the hack we were planning to deploy to mainnet um so so we spent kind of like significant time on the smart contract side and now we didn't want to spend a thousand dollars to do that yeah exactly that's that's exactly where we were um but but yeah um we're looking to explore what it means to integrate with like bitcoin grants and i think like getting plugged into this ecosystem but also getting getting feedback right uh from from other applications and then and yeah absolutely that's awesome i just wanted to add um do we still have some time yeah ticket uh yeah i just wanted to add that um i'm i'm a part of several like grands giving dowels and we're currently looking into uh treasury management um options um and also like the value that we're adding to our grants recipients as well so as a treasury management solution um i think this is an added feature for bizarre finance for dowels to just possibly contribute to the projects that they're supporting in the ecosystem yeah that's absolutely a really really good idea i know a bunch of dows are just sitting on funds right now i'm not really sure where to deploy them and like it's it's really like really like the main trade-off that you have to get people aligned on is like what is the risk of deploying this capital in this way versus versus just letting it lay there um and if you're able to sell people on on like like i would almost i would almost even say that like most organizations will not care about receiving interest themselves as long as the risk is low um yeah all right that'd be better that this is the time awesome job thanks guys uh that's actually the last um project we're gonna do tonight or today this afternoon this morning wherever we are uh i wanted to thank the judges you guys are awesome uh thank all the teams um judges note uh you guys will get an email from kartik about follow-up and next steps and stuff like that um thank you once again we have a couple more judging sessions tomorrow and the closing ceremonies later this week uh this i'd like to say goodbye to everyone thank you very much awesome thank you
