foreign [Music] ERS of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to pragma these compasses are a fantastic opportunities to just connect with a lot of diverse people in the entire space the evolution of the zero knowledge proof space and the future of scaling using their large groups and the the really interesting properties that Ezekiel Roll-Ups Ezekiel proofs in general can give you four blockchains we want to have a lot of voice and saying no no look this is is this really important this is working people having access to micro credit or they're getting paid they're able to work in the digital economy to me that is sort of what's going to define the future of ethereum I think we're finally at the point where we're hitting the scale that we need to really support really big useful applications so I think that's very exciting for me the space have been incredibly inviting and welcoming and it's been a really interesting journey I met a lot of very smart engaged people ethereum is going to serve as the foundation of the world's on-chain economy which is just starting to be built but over the next few years we'll go from you know less than 10 million people who are transacting that economy to billions of people who are transacting the economy and ethereum is going to be sitting at the bottom of all of it to me the future of theorem is first and foremost scaling with validity proofs in particular I think Starks are going to be the way I think the power of the technology stack is that it is global and so even sort of what may seem like a small idea can turn into a massive public good or business what we're trying to do with Suave to ensure that the future of ethereum and crypto more broadly is decentralized is allow the centralized infrastructure to be turned into smart contracts on a decentralized platform we are always pushing to get to improve ethereal with a single goal that's to bring this technology to the humanity to solve real problems of the people and to make a better world so now polygon 2.0 and this highly scalable interconnected web free infrastructure built on top of ethereum we can really explore very interesting new use cases and Tackle important upcoming Talent the mission has been very clear this one has been for me also it's very very clear that you know we want to take web 3 mainstream it's really important that we're collecting via as a community really thinking about this and really building from the ground up the moment is now for creating the applications that will bring the next billion users on chain because the infrastructure is ready the technology is ready the the platform's ready ethereum's ready we're keep working keep pushing the the boundaries of the space forward together and it's going to take all of us to make it happen
