foreign thank you all right foreign thank you and four minutes what's happening with the video what's happening with this slide of course the timer what's the time all right so this will show your screen only um timer we're gonna have someone at the front do I need oh no no no get rid of that it's a it's gonna be countdown okay then straight to your slides so wherever you want to start off right when the video is done okay okay foreign the video they know after the video we'll go straight to his slides on the other voting oh ethernet you have a reserve seating at the front yeah yeah um display or a mirror display for ethernet you know it's already connected yeah you don't have to do anything you just turn off the Wi-Fi if you want yeah testing one too hello [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] laughs [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] good evening Tokyo how's it going [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] are you all excited good afternoon everybody and welcome to the clothing ceremony for each Global Tokyo my name is karting with the co-founders of Youth Global and can't wait to get this started this event has been phenomenal for the next one and a half hours we're going to be making you clap a lot and I can just see this room behind me packed so I hope you can hear me in the back 1500 attendees are here in this building out of which almost 1100 of them have been hacking for the last 36 hours and they're here from 59 different countries and the best part of it all is that 35 of them are brand new to web3 these are existing Engineers trying to understand what's possible in crypto 400 of these are Japanese and 70 of everybody in this room is from Asia this is amazing give yourselves a big round of applause our biggest and our first event in Asia now this is not a conference this whole event is a hackathon and that means if you're in a youth Global event that is a weekend hackathon we care about onboarding developers into this ecosystem and we do this by focusing on three key things I want to bring all Builders together our goal is to help you learn get help and grow and upskill yourselves and we really believe that showing is more important than telling which means that everything we're going to see today is going to be a live demo and not just a PowerPoint so let's go back to the hackathon I know all of you have been super tired from working on Amazing projects and I'm super excited to announce that after submissions were due we had 311 amazing projects that came out of this event that is absolutely mind-blowing that is a lot of projects in this space and we're going to Showcase some of them just in a few minutes before we get to all of that I want to give a few things to a lot of the people that made all this possible most importantly all of our judges who've been looking at hundreds of products over the last four or five hours giving all of you feedback giving all of you pointers onto how to make this better how do you take this to the next level and just helping you improve and make this more successful post this weekend so please give a big round of applause to all of our amazing judges I want to thank Ken Vera Denison the man Richard James Joanne John Jeff Tom lastly Makoto Windra Jack Masa tomorrow lionstani Austin Paris and Tomah Heroes they've been incredible here talking to all of you and we can't thank them enough for all of this more importantly oh there's more Chris Jane Madeline milk or second you know I was I'm surprised this is not 28 but more importantly 38 incredible partners that are here that are giving all these amazing prizes and have made this event possible so we're gonna keep clapping and the faster you Clap the faster I'll try to say all these names so without further Ado let's roll one inch metamask nosy Shane Taiko polygon toku Mina World coin transported call airsack falcoinuma Avi Grace style curved great save with their Foundation the graphs and hyperlane super fluid in Max doing as well foundation hudlow One Secured Finance quick note buns lit mask roll mantle push protocol reason neep life here sismo and quantstaff all these amazing partners are here I'm gonna be talking about all the prizes that you're going to win from each of these companies so let's go back to the 311 projects 9am all these projects were submitted from 9 30 till 1 pm we looked and judged all of these projects here in this floor and also upstairs from this we came up with 11 finalist teams what's going to happen now is that these teams are going to come on stage and they're going to demo what they built to all of you and we're going to see some really cool things that we're excited about and some interesting and impressive trends that we're going to see and we have been seeing in the space there's going to be a lot of interesting and recording themes that we probably saw a lot of workshops on today or over the weekend and people talked about and just ideas they were discussed so we're gonna get all of that going and without further Ado want to announce all of our 11 finalists so please give a big round of applause to our 11 teams pop boarding ZK Voice key bailout Aoki app octo floor or Minot probably nothing that works if swap Tanuki Euro and super play all 11 of these teams will come on one by one and demo what they built now before we get to our very first demo I'm going to take a quick second to thank 300 amazing teams here I'll move out of the way so you can take a photo just because you were not one of these 11 teams it does not mean you were not good enough it does not mean there was something wrong our goal with the judging process was to highlight really awesome and interesting themes there's more uh interesting ideas and projects that everybody was excited about in this space especially our judges and we really want to make sure that all of you are not discouraged from working on your project after today and we are here to help we'll help you connect with anybody you want to know or get feedback or just be introduced to anybody whether it's our judges or some Mentor or some other person in this ecosystem please uh take the time to reach out to us and ask for any help that you need and we'll be able to make sure that we can get you there on top of all of that uh this is being live streamed So for anybody joining us online or if you're on your phones you can head over to eth global.com showcase and see all 311 of these projects now they're all public and you can check out everything you're going to see here and a lot more about how they built it why they built it and their source code so I'm going to stop talking let's get our very first demo for this afternoon please welcome introduce yourself hey everyone [Laughter] I'm Zach I'm Mia and we built palmboarding pom stands for proof of membership protocol and our goal is to allow any community of any size to be able to decentralize themselves without having to rely on any centralized Authority let's get started you'll notice right off the gate that we're using email for authentication over connect wallet behind the scenes this is generated an ethereum address foreign awesome it just verified that I don't belong to a specific community and now I'm going through the onboarding flow sweet so as you can tell uh this is in a in a type form format so it's very easy for anyone who doesn't have you know crypto background to still be able to onboard their community and right now the emails that are being in here it looks like you're just inviting other admins to this platform but in the background we're actually creating a multi-sig for this community yep and with that multi-sig you have some basic permissions on top including who to allow to add and remove members after the multi-6 made and how do you add other admins to the platform our default is majority approval sweet and onboarding is really the main focus we had for the hackathon um right now as I've finished up a multi-sig was created with me as the sole owner on safe core and there are two unconfirmed admins that are able to join the platform as the admins join I will get a notification through push and then be able to come back to the platform in order to onboard them too experience that would allow anyone especially those who are in the web 2 ecosystem to be able to onboard into web3 again without any crypto knowledge so that we can onboard the next billion communities onto ethereum and other web3 ecosystems thank you amazing thank you for our very first demo next up on my right is ZK Voice key so please give the ZK Voice key team a big round of applause [Applause] hello everyone so we would like to introduce Jacob brosky it's allows you to create a unique Instagram account just using your voice so it is very useful for values kind of or key problems of installing so when we use it for the key recovery system if you even if you lose your private key and you don't have social equally and you don't have any Spirits private key you can recover this one using your using your voice and when we use it for the on-chen two-factory authentication the smart contract will require you to or speak some or special words when you when you do some special or action on chain for example transforming a large amount of issues so in this model basically or we have a registration process and authentication process in the registration a user generates the hash value derived from the user's voice and store it on on the Siam production and in the authentication process I use the place that it's a user knows the voice Theater which corresponding which is corresponding to the published hash values so in more detail it has three technical features first it extracts speakers feature vectors from from your voice using machine learnings and second we use still Notch Loops to protect the privacy of this authentication process because if you review the old data in this authentication your voice feature will be revealed to the public so we have to protect this privacy or using gkp and third and basically the voice data the humans theater are like voice theater is valuable even for the same person so our system can't sell this noise this noise of data using fluency commitments so even if your browse has some elements from the reference status we can extract we can extract the same hash value using fuzzy commitments so let's show your demo okay thank you everyone I'm really honored to stand here and let me do that quick demo so uh this is our application so what we have to do to recover the key is firstly we should record a register our voice okay so what you have to do is just to talk to this UI okay we only have five seconds so watch out I uh the sun is shining and the birds are signed singing oh I mistake Okay so it's my mistaken voice uh commitment was created and after that uh metamask should open what's up wow okay so metamask should open but uh not opening uh okay so when we recover the okay okay when we recover the uh address uh what we have to do is to yeah okay let's think that both I'm Bob but I uh forgot the secret Instagram address key so yeah I have to recover so what I have to do here we can we can try again it's okay let's just do it let's start from again beginning yeah okay let's try to get it working let's start uh the sun is shining and the birds are singing okay thank you oh I was really upgrade okay so yeah uh now it's sent to ethereum and have to wait and I cannot wait so I will speed up okay got it so now that our voice is registered okay but now next is the important okay we switch to Bob oh no no no before that ah okay now I'm not I'm not the owner okay I forgot the address but uh so I'm not the owner of this address but the commitment exists so this is not the voice feature about itself but kind of past and commitment so it's safe to save this own change and this is saved on chain okay so let's start to recover and what I have to do is to speak again the sun is shining and the birds are singing okay hope it works well okay so uh yeah this is the commitment that's deployed on the uh on chain and this is the recovered so from The Voice I could recover the commitment so and uh actually it's create a dkp but it takes five or ten minutes so yeah this time I will skip doing this and now I could just I succeeded to recover and I am the owner of this contract address yeah for the demo that's it thank you awesome I can't wait to see 50 more interesting use cases of of this I think there's something more please thank you everyone next up we have our third demo and that is Project bailout please give them a big round of applause [Applause] hey guys I'm I'm James I'm Kuro I'm Akira this uh we are bailout we build our wallet security pipeline between eoa smart controls wallet and cold wallet and uh two fa uh smart contract fluid which can be signed by eoa and Google account and using bailout you can use metamask mainly and put your main asset on Smart contract wallet and eject your asset all asset to code void with a single button when something happens like uh like losing your private keys or devices okay so let me take a demo uh first you can see your your address and balances here and there are civil setup panels below and the social recovery setup is a country a bit hard-coded okay let's go so now place the 2fa setup button and signing with your Google account and then execute our lead action to mean the lead protocol pkps to uh to your MPC wallet and sign to create a smart contract wallet uh and set up the UA address and NPC wallet as in sinus and wait a moment and check the address yeah it's waiting and yeah same again it's trying again yeah now the contract light is deployed and this is your contract wallet it's sitting at 2fa signed by your Google account and eoa account and then Now setting up your social recovery so set that contract wallet and deploying your lead action to ipfs and then you should set up your publication ID for lead uh lens protocol for the social recovery ah and and set your social recovery address to the evacuated by your smart contract wallet and set up the social recovery switch to the network and sign it also meeting the lead um pkps and set up the your social recovery address and other status on the smart contract and check the status um okay this is your social recovery address approval address and social recovery Escape address sitting on the contract and then you should send some money for gas fee to the your social recovery approver and this is your social recovery volatile this is the now balance is zero and execute the social recovery in one click and this execute function can be executed by any other wallet address without the gas fees and wait yeah okay so the balance of the smart contract Lloyd is transferred to the your social recovery worked others thank you and this is your smart contract wallet address and that balance is now zero and the social recovery function it was executed that's all thank you guys [Applause] amazing thank you all right next up is Aoki app nft and we're gonna go with a translation here so this one will be a slightly long demo but trust me it'll be worth it so without further Ado let's welcome everybody on stage [Applause] hello I'm Aoki in our cap I'll introduce my project Aoki app nft in recent years a generative nft become very popular in particular nft with stacking layers of mainstream but this I think this is not technically challenging I think onshine nft is a technical challenge but once NFD has many gas costs so and so the way of expression will Limited so I proposed I'm sorry so I propose a image compression method based on principal component analysis and applied our knowledge of linear algebra and and compress aubergine JPEG and the nft the vector is become sft so user can buy a better experience so let's go demo uh so I'll try my best to translate so please look at the images so what she's doing right now is prior to that she actually took 15 000 selfie images as a kind of sample data and based on that she run the python basic compression mechanism to compress into 32 different elements and based on that you can basically manufacture uh 256 powered by 32 element which is almost infinite number of expression so what she's doing right now in the first element is just showing the different wearable lighting but all can be expressed as part of NFD and in this second one is actually showing that each kind of toggle of the 32 Elements which you can kind of toggle to all the way to 256. so not only just the uh lighting she can also make some expression changes like you know blinking and like it's it's not like she can't open mouths and stuff but like you can do more subtle expression changes or uh be as a generative nft this is eye blinking parameter [Applause] amazing being able to represent all of that directly on chain as compressed vectors uh that's just awesome and this is on mainnet or on on chain not on there twos so please give another round of applause to that project and next up we have octopower so please welcome them on stage hello everyone how many of you are new to web3 please raise your hand quickly so why I think it looks like everyone is experiencing it anyway so uh we built in AI power blockchain Explorer with human readable answers so um block query make it easy is our lovely slogan so I'm sure that you in webto you probably heard of you know uh that people usually say the data is actually all there on the blockchain everybody can see it but have you ever wondered how easy or how difficult it is to actually query multiple data simultaneously on the blockchain whether it's ethereum polygon the answer is actually very difficult right so we have built a natural language query powered by activity and uh we basically put the results in really comprehensible format that very easy for human to understand so we'll go over the technology architecture yeah so the the kind of magic that's behind all this is two layers of llms um and so the first layer is an agent layer and the role of the agent layer really is to from a natural language query decide which llm to use and so the second layer is basically a bunch of models and we've supported lens protocol and airstack in in our kind of MVP here today but it basically you can accept any number of different llms whose job is to translate a natural language query into a graphql query and so you can imagine that since as a community we've kind of adopted graphql as a very common protocol that we can go and plug this in to many many many more models that are all trained to generate graphql queries based on certain schemas and the agent will help us decide kind of which one to use given a certain natural language input and so there's also a second layer where we have a renderer and because we don't really know exactly what the query is going to return us we actually have to go and build out a mapping of all the entities that are possible and build a render on the front end to decide okay this is actually the data that we've gotten this is how we want to show it to the user and so we'll go into our demo now okay so the first query that we will do okay let's go with the yeah show me the nft pictures on ethereum held by Paradigm dot is please so this takes a bit of time because there's again there's these three big steps so the first thing that happens is that you have the agent that looks at this query and says okay which model should I use then it forwards along that query with a bunch of other information in order to actually generate the graphql query and lastly we actually make the graphical request to the graphql API and generate and get the response back that you can see here as you can see this is all the images owned by paradigm.e so quite an interesting collection of image now let's go to our second query which is this time we deal with collection stats so we'll basically we want to find down the aggregate collection start in monthly sales monthly volume also in the wood for the currency nft collection it was a very famous piece made by Damian host very well well-known artists in also in web 2 web 3 world the collection address is that so as you can see now you can actually see the chat here on the vertical axis is the average sales price in usdc and on the horizontal axis is actually the progression of the price right since the minting of the collection until the present day so it's it hasn't been doing so well because you know we're in the bear market right and you can actually also see the table here for all the raw data that we put in nicely format and we can actually send this via push very easy to do so we've sent it to my teammate wallet address right there so he will input it in send the message and yeah it will arrive to his wallet after we approve this transaction it's just as easy as that yeah thanks to our sponsor two and next let's look at the third query uh find the top top 10 lens profile and then return the ID the handle the name and the number of followers sorted by the number of followed number of followers basically so so in this actual bottom component that you see here what we're actually doing is it's actually the same component that we're using and all it's doing is it's actually looking at the response that we get parsing it and deciding how to render it so then as you can see the chat is and the table is probably easier to see here lens protocol is obviously number one on this 90 is number two with 85 000 follow very popular and yeah the top 10 so as you can see and now let's um switch back so that was our brief demo uh quickly talk about the tech stack the review We mainly use a lot of Open Source libraries and software activity Lang chain react.js but we actually expressly would like to thank our sponsor for push protocol for enabling the messaging airstack and lens protocol without them obviously we wouldn't have the data to show and then uh some of our roadmaps that I would like to talk about obviously in 36 out there's only so much that we can do right but ideally in the future we would love to gather more training data to improve the model accuracy and then expand the use cases and also adding in aggregation so you can actually do a lot of interesting maths like some averages and improve visualization and result in a dynamic way and then expand more data sources as well to multiple different protocols and then raise funding and go to market and make it happen so we actually and this is the theme that make it happen we have a product designer Andre who's unfortunately not here at the moment the smart contract developer Felix over there myself I'm the product manager um key and Wilson law are to expert full stack developer so we hope to with this simple yet easy to use app to be able to help onboard web 3 users who are new to the web3 sphere but also would be useful for data gigs who love to explore data with the web3 journey and that's it thank you thank you awesome blockchain and AI have finally started to merge together that's going to be fun all right next up is Project my9 it's going to be a really cool Hardware hack so we're gonna have to spend 30 more seconds on a little bit more setup and we'll have the camera zoom in when we get to the hardware part please give them a big round of applause um hi everyone my name is Dan and I'm here with my teammates and good friends hideyoshi and hiroyuki today I would like to share our hackathon project called Mina I'd like to open another question um what if we told you that more than 60 to 70 percent of the Japanese residents already have a hardware wallet the answer is yes it's true they just don't know it yet project and minor is a browser wallet specifically for Japanese residents that lets them use the government issued ID as a hardware wallet to send and receive crypto payments so this is the Japanese government issued ID it's called the my number card as you can see it's an ID card issued to all Japanese residents including children and foreigners storing the information you see here like name address birthday gender and a unique 12-digit individual number the my number cards have an IC chip in them and as of today they've been issued to over 80 million people in Japan which represents over 64 of the population the main use case right now is limited to identity verification but going forwards additional use cases are going to be added by the government including the phasing out of the health insurance card and driver's license which will eventually be integrated into these mine number cards so our mission with minor is to drive mainstream adoption of web3 tech in Japan by enabling the Japanese government and residents and connecting them with developers across the world the problem we're aiming to solve is private Key Management as you know it's very difficult to write down your seed phrase and keep them safe even for the most sophisticated users Hardware wallets as well are relatively expensive and have a steep learning curve making it very unrealistic for them to be used by most people especially here in Japan which is which has the world's oldest population our solution is the minor browser wallet and this enables Japanese residents to use their mind number card like a hardware wallet giving them a simple and safe way to self-custody their crypto and send and receive payments with just a few tabs of their card we also used account obstruction to generate erc4337 compliant contract wallets for each main number card enabling features such as social recovery so before I pass it on to the demo if you could imagine a situation where any child or elderly person can receive nfts with a simple few tabs of their my number card and with that I'll pass it on to the demo thank you uh I'm gonna show how to use the our bullet let me see okay uh so this is our brother red and uh this uh my number card is uh and actually a near field communication using yeah field communication so we need an energy leader so but I don't have time I didn't have time to buy initial card reader so I turned my Android phone to uh I'm going to connect this uh uh connect to this uh Android NC reader uh be a very Bluetooth so okay I found then I'm connecting okay now the uh the uh this browser and NSE reader has been connected so then uh I'm going to generate the wallet actually the account obstruction word by one tab so let me see so I'm going to tap the this uh Japanese government issued ID card okay so then uh address is generated and actually this is uh this address is a determinist deterministically generated by account of abstraction so uh this other account has not been deployed onto the smart contract uh blockchain but you can send the ether or other nft assets to this contact address so and also I I have another card here so I just uh connect again okay then yeah just by tapping the code then I generated the other word that is actually the the thank you very much it's awesome okay yeah actually this accountable obstruction word has been uh deployed and then I sent some Esa uh here I'll check thematic here yeah and then you know could you please explain the uh yeah okay and uh let me quickly uh talk about the technology uh we used uh we use the ELC 4337 compliant contract wallet which Fox space our system which are algorithm why I I always say signature algorithm is because uh my currently my my number account only supports LS signatures because that only supports analysis signature hours and we derived the account contract account address from the modules which is uh part of the RSA public key and then when when verify the signature from the entry point to the contract wallet we verify the RSS signature uh there this uh the idea is very simple but uh yeah we have a lot of use cases using these kind of ID card in the other wallet so next yeah and thank you and just to wrap up so um during this hackathon we built a browser wallet uh where um users could send and receive crypto payments um post hackathon we plan to build a browser extension where users will be able to not only send and receive payments but to be able to connect to web 3D apps as well thank you for your time and we'd love to hear your feedback if possible so please reach out to us thank you amazing how cool is that this is like a really amazing real world application congratulations all right next up is probably nothing dot works I'll give them a big round of applause and let them tell you what they built [Applause] and I'm brave enough to do a hard words in my life so hi everyone my name is Jason and I'm from probably nothing works hi everyone I'm Akira hi I'm Ray hey and I'm Alan and we're going to talk to you today about permissionless ads protocol back to Jason and I'll begin a little bit introduction or background about what is advertising and who the players are just so that you can set a stage uh on the on the left side we have advertisers so Adidas on the right side we have in the industry what we call a publisher in this case Hugo labs and then the community in this case board ape holders and the our permissions app protocol basically matches the advertisers who want to reach a community and then Publishers who want to bring interesting messages to their Community as a way to kind of sustain themselves huh showing kind of our architect of how we do this is everything starts on the lower left with a transaction so you we because it's permissionless so you can buy sell ads campaigns all on train we have a cloud function that observes the order and then once it observes it it means an empty that represents the what we call inventory or the campaign it displays it and then we for this bigger then we'll take the data back to Google ads manager for reporting which will show so we'll begin with a quick demo of what probably nothing that works looks like and as you can see it is just a very random or website with ads on it and to prove that the ads work you can see that we've basically pre-populated with some random stuff so that it's a live we're working at are we banned for the YouTube ad so and now I will show you as a community how you can offer a collab and I'll begin to show our three contracts and try to Mint a ad unit the two the two contracts we have are ad units which is how communities say I want to offer a cold app and then a campaign is how after they say hey I want to work with you on this code app okay so he's jumping over and showing now that there's some history of campaigns that got created and then we're going to be doing doing some minting inside of uh inside of ether etherscan this is deployed on sepolia so as you can see we have a budget we have a cost per click we have an image we have a name etc etc so we've already pre-minted some campaigns because the campaigns on the on the ad server side uh take a little while to populate even the nft minting is of course um instant on on the blockchain but it takes a while to for the campaign to start so what we're showing here is creating some new inventory so he's creating something uh to one zero with size with some with some size parameters x x y with height and uh you're gonna did you submit it okay and then submit the transaction and then back on the back on the website at probably nothing that works that's adapt so it's it's totally not interacting with the back end at all it just reads data from ethersjs to get the information from sepolia and then it renders the ad so as soon as that transaction commits it'll it'll be live when the campaigns were minted we should also call it there's a few parameters basically what gets submitted is the the creative so it's a banner in this case a landing page URL uh price per click if you want to run a price per click campaign let's say 10 cents and a budget so so what we do is we we're taking um the total budget and collateralizing the campaign at that time into the into a vault and then based on some reporting which Jason will show you in a second uh is uh is is uh what we get what the the publisher of the ad inventory gets it's paid out from you just created this one in the lower left right that's correct so as you can see we just permissionlessly created a new advertising unit that people can click um oh yeah okay and so now what he's showing is one of the nice things that's built into this uh centralized execution of the ad server is Google's put a lot of uh resources into making sure the the clicks are are not fraudulent so it's civil resistant in that sense and um what he's showing here is that we can collect some click data from each of the ads that showed up and also it's optimizing revenue for the the owner of the the space where the ad runs to make sure that the the revenue is maximized so not it's for example if something has a very high price per click it doesn't mean it always runs if there's another campaign that's going to expire soon you might want to harvest that uh Revenue quickly before proceeding with the longer running higher paying clicks so that's all happening here and then the reporting data we periodically uh pull this data into an Oracle and then make the micropayments out to the advertisers sorry to the Publishers who are are displaying the ads quickly to summarize it is a permission uh probably nothing that works is a permissionless advertising protocol we allow communities to monetize their own Assets in the future we can have Futures like moderation that tells them say I want this I don't want to do this and the whole point is to connect web to demand versus web 3 communities or connect web to demand to web3 communities and then lastly because these as are actually nft right so they become a tokenized revenue streams what that means is is a yield bearing asset and you can do all the very cool things you could do with D5 things for example the fundraise what with them borrow land use them as collateral do an interest rate swap whatever it is you want and these things are obviously tradable highly liquid et cetera Etc and that's it for our demo thank you so much for your time awesome another amazing real world application it's good all right all right a few more damage to go without further Ado let's welcome app swap X please give them a big round of applause [Applause] hey all I am Mohit from App swap X team and I am deep so we started this problem saying that smart contracts are passive scripts and if we were to build automations on top of account abstractions let's create a smart contract module and that's how we started building out app swap X which is a smart contract module that allows you to automate transaction based on price change of a token or time change I'll take it over to mold to show you how the product works yeah so let me uh go through the contracts that we have so basically we are currently live on polygon chain and genosis mainnet chain uh we are like live on some other chains as well uh for this demo like I would be like swapping my tokens from polygon to genosis and it will be going through it it will be an automated uh smart contract process which will be like powered by galato and we will be like making the transfer of the assets and we'll be doing on-chain swaps on the like the target chain uh through like the Conex and all that stuff so let me talk about like this is our polygons scan deployed contract uh the same kind of contract with some additional features have been deployed on genosis so our contracts live on multiple chains uh and uh what I'm going to do is basically I will be creating a deposit so it's like you as the user who who wants to like swap your usdc from polygon and you want to transfer it to the genosis chain uh to like the Geo yeah limit order on the geot uh gno token so what I will be doing like I have this create deposit I have like uh Auto like already filled some of the values so what we have like if if you are transferring like any native token you have to pass it here then we have like this from address which is like from which address you want to transfer the money it can be your smart con smart Wallet account address or your UA account address then we have like this two address where on the uh the target chain you want to receive the amount and then this is the amount that we want to Target this is like 0.5 usdc and then there is like the price so the price is basically at which price I want to do this swap on the target chain and I want to like transfer the assets from this and then this is like the from to address which is like the usdc address on polygon scan and this is like a two token address which is on Genesis chain uh so I would be just like quickly creating a deposit so I would be doing some aggressive because I want the fast transaction yeah so let me wait for the transaction to happen so the contractor is trying to store the X call data as well as how it needs to be sent from The Source chain as well as on the destination chain where it will be integrated by X receive yeah so this transaction that deposited confirmed what I will be doing is like I have this uh gelato ID which is triggered in the event I will be just searching for this gelato ID on the gelato Network so you can see uh this is like our execute limit order that is automatically created from on-chain Smart contract there is no nothing a server in between like we have no node.js server on any server it's directly from the smart contract that this is happening and you can see like there are some task logs So currently uh uh this is trying to execute but the price is not matching so this will not execute now what I will be doing basically I will be like forcing the price I had set the price of 82 000 so I will be just changing forcefully the price because actually we are getting the price from oracles trustless oracles but for like this demo I am just forcing it to happen uh so that we can do this transaction quickly let me do an aggressive transaction yeah so let's wait for gelato to execute this process if you can just show up the functions yeah on gelato yeah one second so all the functions are stored there so it's transparent to the user how the X call is going to be carried out and what proxy is given to gelato and I think by now the execution should have happened yeah so we have got the transaction hash which gelato has basically automatically uh executed and this transaction hash you can see on the connects so if I just search this transaction so you can see like our transfer is happening from the polygon chain to the genosis chain and we already have like Bridge the assets from the uh the polygon token and if I yeah just copy this and like search on the like logs how this is happening under the hood yeah so you can see like it is going from uni swap it is like finding the best path to execute that Swap and from uni swap to like it's our contract and then it is passing to the Conex time and and then the gelato is basically executing this transaction in an automated way and we will soon receive that funds on the uh Target chain so our yeah so our motive with this project was like uh we want like if you have funds in your smart account and you want to like on the Friday or Saturday or at the price like uh 150 or 250 dollars when each reach that much amount and you want to execute a swap on any of the chains that are not in your wallet you can use our product and you can integrate our product in any of the smart contracts and do that stuff like totally in a trustlessly your funds are totally safe with us so that's our project thank you awesome cool D5 is not dead and this is the type of automation that helps us do a lot more with what's happening on chain all right three more demos to go so for our third last demo please welcome project Tanuki foreign [Applause] we're the team from home Dao we've built Tanuki so Tanuki is a trustless wallet score provider so what is a wallet score um a wallet score is derived from unchain data and it's basically just a number that is associated with an address for a given service so we categorized uh the scores into three categories you have credit credit is based on your previous activity on D5 protocols and it's useful to give you a credit score to determine uh lending rates social is uh useful for protocols like lens where you have a lot of bots and this is like quite a common problem right now a lot of people from lens are telling me this is a pretty hot problem so you can build a kind of indication of um whether someone is a bot based on their historical on-chain data uh do yourself trading so you can give rewards based on volume so it's quite common in tradify to give uh you know discounts on fees based on volume that you trade in a protocol so these are some protocols that we identified that we think will benefit from the uh scores so uh humor for example is a credit line protocol and right now they have a bunch of signals that they use to calculate credit scores but these are mostly uh they have some off-chain components always so it's not fully trustless so there isn't really a solution right now to like aggregate data from historical on-chain data and build a score based on that so our solution uses uh Axiom which is a ZK co-processor and this allows us to trustlessly generate scores based on historical data so we write a circuit a ZK circuit that essentially Aggregates data so it could be summing up transactions or something or something more complicated like summing up volumes that you've traded on a given uni swap pool um and that gets pushed onto a smart contract where the proof gets verified and scores get stored in in the score provider contract and then this allows services to consume this in a really simple way uh through a view score function so Tanuki is trustless you don't have to rely on any any oracles it's completely based on uh historical engine data it's fair um an issue in Trad Phi with credit scores is that the uh you don't actually know how exactly the credit scores are calculated and for certain demographics or for certain people they're not sure why they have a low credit score but here you can see exactly how it's calculated and you can verify that it's fair and it's transparent because you can see exactly how it's calculated on chain so this is a quote from vitalik the most important scarce resource is legitimacy and this is super relevant for on-chain data because you have a lot of very very valuable data that's sitting there but it's it's not being utilized and it can be a source of like a good source to um signify if a given wallet is is a legitimate user so we built two use cases uh we built two services that build on top of the infrastructure that we built one is a dow um sub gas subsidy service so based on your activity in a dial uh the more you use the Dow the more gas rebates you'll get on transactions so we calculate a score in this case it's 600 and based on that they have a subsidy of 22 on any votes they do through the Dow second one was uh lending so with uh with Ave um as an example lending protocols can use the historical engine data as an input to how they calculate uh lending rates a few more use cases so obviously this can be used for lens like I mentioned and other social media protocols for spam prevention can be used for airdrops um so right now all Air drops involve an off-chain component and it can also be used for insurance so if you know someone is uses certain protocols based on the history then you can tailor Insurance specifically to them uh so in summary we think that there's a lot of very valuable data sitting on chain and it's not being utilized in a way that's decentralized and trustless and we think that a lot of services can use this data to build uh services on top um and in combination with a car abstraction it can be used for gas subsidies and other use cases thank you awesome all right two more demos to go without further Ado let's welcome yoru [Applause] hello everyone my name is Charles and the me and my teammates and Randy here we are a team uh yoru and we're glad to be here to introduce our project so okay so yoru is a privacy preserving DF for social crypto payment and there are two major Concepts behind that the first one is uh Steel's address which is uh for better privacy and the second one is a App Store account which is for better user experience and let's say I just want to transfer some token or some asset to Bob so instead of uh transfer those token and asset to the address of buff directly uh the ls will generate a one-time address for Bob and transfer those token to that just generated address and the new generator address is actually a wallet contract and it's actually a abstract account for Bob so the Bob actually has the ownership of that smart contract wallet and there's a formula of the how Alice can generate the the address for the Bob and when Bob trying to withdraw his phone that he just received all he has to do is that uh calculate the the new private key from his original priority and then provide the value signature uh to uh to uh to to submit to the blockchain and uh and because uh the the newer address is the abstract account uh actually uh the withdrawal can be gasless which means that the uh Bob doesn't have to send some ether to the new address in order to you know uh withdraw the token uh uh on that account so here's a link of our repository and let's go to the live demo okay our demo is pretty simple it's comprised of two transaction the first one is the sender sending tokens to receivers still address and from everyone else's point of view this address is like a random your address nobody knows that this address belongs to the receiver and for the second Edge for the second transaction is for receiver to spend the token received from the sender and what's amazing about this transaction is that the receiver is going to have a third party paying for his for his guest fee and deploy his account abstraction and also transfer away the token and this great user experience is only made past possible by the erp437 account abstraction okay let's begin our demo foreign okay so first we're going to have a receiver uh log into the dev and he's going to register why this register is necessary because he's gonna publicly sure his public key uh this is because the sender needs private key to compute the receiver's still address and but don't worry this information does not leak or compromise receiver's privacy and you can imagine that in the future when did system is ready you can attach Twitter handle or telegram handle to your did and from this information center can after sending the transaction via uru you can notify the receiver via the Twitter or Telegram yeah okay now the receiver has registered and now we will have sender login and meta transfer so uh now uh as a sender I want to send some uh ether to the recipient so uh I can use uh like uh different social IDs to uh to get the property of the recipient here we use uh EMS domain for example and then we choose to send some ether to the recipient also we support us finding and nft as well so now I click Send and confirm the transaction in my wallet okay and now the transfer is uh really a simple uh erc20 uh ether transfer but it will have a event immediate on but on the blockchain special event email address blockchain uh in order to you know let the recipient be aware be notified that there's an incoming transfer that he may want to you know check on uh the blockchain to see uh uh whether which which uh transaction he is receiving oh the management yeah see okay so um now the recipient have to uh log into to the app to scan through the the blockchain to see whether there's an incoming transfer for him so he could uh received and then he clicked the scan so now you can see uh uh there is a a new address new generated address for the recipient that uh he can collect the funds from the address okay so so right now he can click the withdrawal to get the fund okay after confirm that transaction we can check online uh whether the the transaction uh how the transaction is uh is executed positions okay this is the second translation we demo as we previously mentioned this transaction is amazing because it take care of the having third party paying for the guest fee and deploy the account contract and also transfer away the token and this is all made possible by the kind of abstraction design okay and that's our demo thank you awesome a lot of account abstraction all right last demo and the last finalist for today please give a big round of applause to Super play [Applause] everyone uh we are super pay and I'm Marky from Super play and I'm Leon nice to meet you Andrew yeah so we are like building super play for our website gaming and our mission is just very simple the combo in the next billion people to Webster gaming you know we believed Webster gaming is the key for Mass adoption but you know we have a lot of Market gap between the current situation and the whole day gaming industry so as for the comment situation we have only one million uh wallet address for the nft and gaming but as for the gaming itself we have more than 2 billion uh users in the world so as for the market Gap we have more than 2 000 you know like Market gaps so if you can get more than 10 10 or 50 of those kind of gaming users to crypto it's huge you know so we have a lot of Frontiers for the crypto Market but still like we have a lot of problems you know between onboarding for onboarding game users to web3 you know like it takes a lot of calls products setup for the beginners and also like you know for gamers like uh like crypto stuff is too difficult for them to understand they're also the gas fee as well so that's why we build super play yep so onwards with uh what we actually have built we have an infrastructure SDK well this slide is very very bright um SDK for implementing essentially um account abstraction through just an email registration so essentially we have we have been using web3 auth as a service that will generate an eoa account and then from that your account will generate an A account a rather a count of fashion right um which will serve as a intermediary between the user who's just logged in with his email essentially and the game which is on chain with this we also fund the AAA account with erc20 tokens which will allow the user to actually do stuff on chain and then later on if he or she wants to continue on playing they can subscribe and get more tokens and more funds to actually do on-chain stuff so I will quickly just now go through the architecture I know this is kind of small guys in the back you can probably see this but on the left side we have the creation of the account essentially what's happening is the user just submits his email through web3 auth um it goes through our service so our service actually uses um saves SDK which creates a a wallet and also uses super fluid as a token streaming platform so essentially what we do is we fund the a account with tokens and we create a stream that goes back to us from the user account so essentially we have essentially built a free trial period for a game on chain so that's the creation part and then the interaction part on the right side is a bit more simple it's essentially a user is doing an action that can be any game action and it's actually very easy to implement that it goes through our service then it goes to a relay which is essentially a off-chain executor and then from there we actually execute the transaction through the a account and the game now we're going to go to the demo SEC all right so if we click Start here and wait for it so this is the web 3 of interface and essentially I'm just going to do login with Google I'm going to use for example this mail and what's happening in the background essentially we have generated a ethereum address based on the based on the email the Google off authentication okay so we create an account and this is essentially a very very basic um game interface let's say so essentially on the left side we have the profile this is the profile of the user so on the left you can see the name and then we have these SP tokens those are the tokens that we have airdrop to the account and essentially as you can see on the right there's says 100 SP per week so essentially seeping out 100 SP per week from the account and essentially by doing that you can actually set a period of time by which his uh or hers free trial of the game will well be finished right so and then on the right you just have whatever the game interface once so essentially you can buy some game buy some items you can bet all the users or do essentially whatever you want so essentially the whole idea was to create a modular SDK it's very easy to implement and yeah one other thing that we can do is actually charge so if the trial is done and we're happy with the game we can just click on charge and by using saves um um basic safe kit we can actually just use stripe to pay in some more crypto and actually continue playing on the game um yeah I think that's about it one sec this is our Tech stack uh I did the demo and this is our team rashimichi isn't here currently she's the speaker at DSi uh me Leon yuchan and moriki and just as a final remark and as the final demo of the day I would like to thank all of the organizers and I guess we'll see you in Lisbon thank you and congrats those were our 11 incredible finalist demos I know all of you are tired so I'm going to try my best to wrap everything up as quickly as possible but I don't think you'll have any trouble staying up for the next part because we're giving away a lot of money um before we get to that tough crowd um I'm also tired it's okay don't worry I'm not offended uh well before we get you all to all of that stuff um the most incredible thing here is that there are some obvious teams we're seeing a lot of stuff around dkps becoming more and more common and fast uh they're we're seeing a lot of real world applications and as you've already guessed looks like a kind of traction is about to be everyday thing so effectively his events become a way for you to see what the next year looks like in all of web 3 and Tech and we hope that you get to take home some of these themes and make them better for millions and billions more people all right let's get to all the next stuff I want to thank all of these 11 families one more time for coming here doing live demos it's not easy things can always go wrong so congratulations to bombarding ZK Voice key bailout Aoki nft October minor probably nothing that works app swab Tanuki uru and super play and you can see all of these projects and all the remaining 300 on eveglobal.com showcase so before we go into all the amazing prizes stuff I want to do a quick reminder that you get to finish the survey it'll help us make the ethereum ecosystem better this is the survey from is talk from the opening ceremony just quickly take a scan here it'll take you less than two minutes maybe more I don't know uh it'll be very quick it helps us really understand how do we evolve the culture of ethereum and how do we actually make all these events better and bring more people in so uh I'll wait for five more seconds but I really appreciate you all doing this there we go all right let's get right to it for the next 15 minutes my job

myself for this one all of these teams are going to be receiving a lot of small amounts of money but five thousand dollars will be split between these 68 teams and looks like the world is excited about zkevms and last but not least these two prizes are going to be announced very soon we couldn't get to all of them in the the time uh to do this thing so we'll be notifying all the reason and huddle 01 prize applicants if they want those prizes over email and they'll also show up on your hacker dashboard with a really nice pop-up message saying you want money all right these were all the prizes and in a couple hours you'll be able to go on your own project and refresh the page and you'll see what prizes you've won so if you didn't read this or you're sleeping now which doesn't matter because you won't hear me you can just go on your dashboard and you'll see all the prices your team has won so congratulations again to everybody that was more than four hundred thousand dollars being given away and I I have five minutes before I'm being told I need to stop talking so let's try to wrap this up quick notes on some Logistics all these announcements are tentative and not final which means we're going to verify everybody's source code we're going to make sure everybody followed the rules nobody cheated and that'll take us two to three weeks this also means that if you are an applicant and a winner for a pool prize and we end up disqualifying some team for cheating the numbers will change and you'll be notified of any of those changes so we'll take the next couple of weeks to do all of that and all prizes will be delivered on May 5th or by May 5th what does that actually mean it means do not ask me again when the prizes are coming before May 5th okay thank you speaking of thank yous no no you got you got to take a break because we're going to clap constantly now for the next seven slides so all right this is the last part of all of what I'm going to say before we enjoy the rest of our evenings so before we wrap this up I want to make sure we give a big shout out to everybody that made this event possible and that's a lot of people that are involved in making this successful 1500 people is a lot just look at this room behind you it's packed and it requires a lot of logistics a lot of people to make all of this work and these are some of the people that are doing all this work behind the scenes want to make sure we give a quick second to thank them for all the time they put in this weekend and months and weeks before but before I get to thank all of these four categories I want to thank all of you hackers for being here with us over this weekend congratulations to doing something amazing you didn't have to be here in a building locked up for the last 48 hours but you chose to do this you chose to build something you were excited about and that means a lot and that means we get to see more and more cool things in this ecosystem so thank you so much of course I'm all of our amazing judges for taking the time and talking to all of you so please give our judges once again a big round of applause so many volunteers and mentors taking 24 7 shifts not sleeping sometimes sleeping too much but also helping everybody get to where they want it to be and making sure everything runs super super smoothly so thank you for all of these amazing mentors and volunteers all of our amazing speakers who gave all these talks workshops that you get to use and learn from without this none of this will be possible this is the education we want to bring forward and make available for free for everybody so thank you to our speakers and I know you won't be able to read it but this is all the list of people who are behind the scenes making all these things possible from all of our incredible Partners once you see any of them here thank them for all their work and time and also taking their time to spend the weekend with you to make sure you're successful so please give our partners a big round of applause and I want to give a few special shout outs to a couple people Mia Reno and aru and Juan you've seen them constantly running around and of course Arena Tomo Masai and Tara for helping us pull this event off for the last four months for being incredible host making sure we don't make stupid decisions really and helping all of this be successful and last but not least I'd like the biggest Round of Applause for the Youth Global team I'm here on stage but they did all the work so a big shout out to Oregon Taylor Fred Rory Wilbur yours Chloe Kevin K Kevin Ivan Cree who we see Minnie and moas Emily Andrew and Jacob the sign of a good event and amazing operation is that you don't have too many things to complain about and if nothing is there for you to notice that means it was running smoothly and this is a team that makes it happen so they deserve all that recognition so make sure you thank all of them whenever you get a chance okay well I lied there's another section the finalists so we saw 10 teams come up we saw a lot of prizes from our partners and you kind of saw okay well all the prizes were for the partners but then not all the teams were listed there what's going on if you've never been to a need Global event before there's one thing that we do differently than everything else this event is not a competition our goal is to help others get into the space and understand what's possible and as part of that we want to make sure that we get to surface interesting ideas and not make this competitive where we get to force people to be first second third so effectively all 11 of those teams are our first place winners and as a finalist they all came in first so congratulations to all 11 of those teams and as part of being a finalist you'll be getting a 500 usdc in addition to everything part member from each global for being an incredible incredible participant this weekend but wait there's more that's not all all of these teams will also be getting up to ten thousand dollars in credits on ews in case they want to make this forward 10 simple you eat poor member so you have to worry about all the test net eat an ens domain of their choice more than four characters for all the pragmas we're going to do at youth Global you'll get a free entry to all of these events if you
