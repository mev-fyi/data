all right we're gonna get started in about two minutes with the closing ceremony so come on down hello I like that Wow holy moly dip it connect jokes get funnier when you're tired one more time that's enough no more bit connect jokes all right I think people in the back you might want to come sit up here for this one it's kind of the main event now how we feeling how's it going are you tired not tired come on are you tired I'm feeling good all right we are going to do a little selfie come on people we want to see you in this picture so put your hands in the air thank you guys make so you can see yourself and retweet later on well there we go that will be somewhere at some point nice all right we do want to hear from you I think we should definitely put our hands together for this crazy event please give yourselves a huge hand I want to hear it come on nice 36 hours have gone by it's wild oh do you have the clicker nice so this was the largest etherium hackathon in the world all time thousand attendees a hundred and twenty-one submissions this is like way more than I think they expected so this is amazing and there were 30 judges that helped pick the finalists do you want to do you want to let us know who those judges are let's read the judges our judges were imran khan dan elite Sir Chris Lee Linda che Simon do lariviere Joey Krug of each o gog robert Havemeyer mich kosowski Karthik tal wire jeff coleman EG gallano italic boo turin evan mass will Warren Jung Woo Ethan Wilding Moe dong Loulou Liam horn raza Claussen cows Imani Marchal Abby Robbie Ben and arroz Bjorn Wagner Connie Yang Cassandra she Fred Arizona and Ryan zarur put your hands together for those judges Thank You children [Applause] so this is the main event now we get to find out who the finalists are are you excited to hear the finalists are you excited cool but wait first I'm gonna share the runners-up this was really hard for the judges to make this selection but I'm gonna basically say a big thank you to these runner-ups sinful futures MediConnect laser bought radical pixels walle wallet that's a good name heir prediction Satguru promote primitive open coverage and read a lot let's give them out you're gonna know this the final it's nice and our finalists let's have you come and line up you can actually get a chance to present on stage so when you hear your team name come and come over and line up to get ready to give your demo you will have five minutes we are going to be very strict about five minutes I have a little like vaudeville crook I'm gonna pull you off stage for the good of all of us to be respectful of all of our time so our finalists auger pro se Toshi yeah Sabu brat browser extension atomic X Arden Harper grads giftee Sen put Korra splitter converter and crypto pay congratulations guys congratulations to our finalized you can make your way up here that's gonna be awesome cuz we're gonna have you present one after another um so I guess first to the stage maybe first on that list if you have it first on the list was auger Pro auger Pro ready come on up you have five minutes [Applause] seems important we work in tech yeah okay I guess we're gonna it's gonna take a little bit of time to do this are you guys have you guys checked out the planes I think we can hear them like right now Evan you want to come hang out with me he's like no I mean I guess this always happens right it's all just building anticipation which which begs connectline to you I mean dude yeah which yell it out shout it out oh god do that do it I'm definitely not doing that one no no no my god my wife doesn't even believe in me I always like though we are cutting them they're coming in waves that's a fail the first time we've had to try to do stand-up comedy and first time I've ever had to read your idea okay beginning the end of our comedy careers yeah what do you guys want us to talk about anything material hmm [Laughter] [Music] my hands on a different laptop with with my laptop's make sure the feed is good from here to the back of the room before so apologies for the delay we're gonna do a little test on this so that the rest of the finalist presentations are very smooth please bear with us stay here hang out [Applause] Evan do you have all right we're gonna call the second team up while we deal with technical issues because that always happens next up is saying Toshi [Music] [Applause] hello all right and just for efficiency's sake we'll have the on-deck circle will be safe ooh browser extension so get ready for your charm all right nummy are you coming all right yeah so we're team say Toshi and we made a decentralized social media manager on aetherium and the simple idea is that anyone can connect their Twitter account and can have us tweet for them and basically get paid for us tweeting through their accounts but the trick is that it's actually not us tweeting on their accounts it's everyone in here and so we've set up a Dao that will act as a sort of decentralized social media manager for all these people that has sort of crypto economic primitives similar to a token created registry where anyone can propose a tweet for any person who's connected their account and people in the community can vote to either approve that tweet or reject it and that sort of contention between approvals and rejections creates sort of economic opportunity a the influencer so let's jump through a quick demo do I go through yeah so in San Francisco's account is actually connected and yeah so you can tweet anything you want and then if you get a quorum which is 1% of all of the token holders the tweet will go out after 10 minutes so let's see how that works with very bad internet right now cool so yeah we actually we this is on may net as well and if you want to join in its say Toshi calm and you can have you can use your own tweets tokens at Satoshi calm slash air drop yeah any one of the Neath SF github can can participate so let's see yeah so this proposal is being being created right now it'll probably take a little while but let's see yeah let's look at some other ones let's see what other ones are like open right now all right there's one for Toshi bot what's the what are the open tweets are the chairs greasy weird anyway so basically this the idea is to have anyone propose any tweet you can do it right now and sort of vote on what uh what is going to tweet it out and so yeah I would suggest going to say Toshi calm and trying to tweet for the eath San Francisco Twitter handle because it's available right now I think thank you [Applause] thank you guys thank you guys so much so we're back on track it seems that's awesome maybe you can give a little big big round of applause for these guys come on good okay next up it's a foo browser extension come on up so I can just turn that just atomic X shard please get ready to come on next hello everyone we're presenting Saifu our browser extension to help keep your private keys and addresses safe ooh basically the concept here is that we noticed that a lot of us were keeping private keys and addresses and like a text file locally so we figured you know we could put it in a put in a Chrome extension instead and also add some interesting bits around us some abusing like a eath call to uh to get a bunch of balances both balance and token balances really quickly so here's the contract we're gonna be giving out kind of an explanation right up in a Tilly library soon TM yeah so so like a typical wallet token scanner today is making a bunch of calls so like our approach basically just makes the single calls to get many addresses balances both eath and token it's the safe way go so we're gonna give a brief demo on on the safe extension you can get it now at save food XYZ sweet okay so it was so fast you couldn't even see the loading one more time please all right about it about a second so that's loading 65 220 contra many tokens of loading hundred 180 tokens are loaded across four addresses including regular eath balances and so you're seeing like and you know the Wi-Fi isn't the best here so pretty pretty instant response there we have edit functionality QR address it's fully fairly full-fledged we're gonna continue improving on it in the next coming days and get like a decent stable release out and have like some Easter eggs that we'd like to show as well so audio isn't plugged in but if it was you would hear first row got it it's if anyone watches the snow cheat YouTube videos you get the reference out it safe through Chrome extension [Applause] congratulations next up is atomic XR and in the on dark on-deck-circle by that sign right there let's have heart burger ads come down coming up guys hey everyone so we implemented some sharding stuff we did we worked on the I'm sorry getting distracted by the feet okay we're good on the feed so we worked off of this charting solution so we had this shorting proof of concept that we started working on in Berlin where we had two shards now we went up to this big tree of shards like any number of shards with a great visualization and our we used to have just messages from two shards with her beside each other in the tree but now we could do routing across the shards and we can move shards in the sharding solution and we implemented this all in the last couple days and even how to do some research on the fly so but I would say like let's take a look at the simulation you guys see that yeah so we have some shards here there's they're oriented like this thing on the left so the shard is like connect it with an edge underneath if it's following the parent shard and it follows the parents hard to maintain consistency these arrows that you see is the messages being routed across the charts when this countdown goes to zero there's a good chance like a quite a high chance that we're gonna see the shards move around there it is oh it happened a little early the shard 3 went and is no longer a child the short one and is now instead a child of shark 4 and the you know so and now messages if they were rerouted again will go out through short for to get shout chart 3 whereas like before they would have routed through the shark one so we have like the routing system also being kind of preserved by these operations to move the shards around and the point of that is basically to do load balancing anyone want to say anyone want to say anything else yeah so the core idea here is that for as long as since if there is a cross hard transaction and the message is sent between two charts or between any number of charts to the intermediate charts then it will never be the case that some of the blocks containing the message are approved in some in some charts and another short the blocks that receive the message or send the message and not approved so either at the end all the blocks are finalized that had the message being routed or noticing look of them is finalized and so that enables executing cross chart transactions that touch any number of shirts yeah the way that I describe that kind of technically is that like you know if the if the protocol has liveness then your transaction will either be completely orphaned and not make a single dent on the Washington state or the route will be completely complete and like you know from like origin chain to the end chain Oh check it out the Chargers changing changing directions right now changing orientation this last chart on the bottom it orphaned by its parent and didn't have its new parent pick it up yet and so it is momentarily an orphan shard that didn't have a parent at all in terms of its fork choice and then it like found his parent in number four and that actually turns out to be just fine for the routing too because the route the routing tables keep track of where the messages are going and the child gets picked up before any messages arrived to it because we have this like a once in time message delivery model once in an order as you know we would like to have and the other cool thing is that because it's like a kind of for consensus protocol we can achieve really theoretically optimal kind of overhead where we have relatively small number of orphans and a relatively large number of finalized blocks although like we haven't done any explaining of the finality these these visualizations by the way show each a sliding window of the of the tips of the fork choice and these individual lines here so messages from same validates let's follow this guy the message being routed here from shard seven to shard three that's you know a decent number of hops oh we've got like messages coming in and same color from both directions it's kind of confusing normally they'd be different colors oh there we go so we got like the full route complete from message from shard like seven two three and now we're gonna see in a moment the shards like changed change orientation again and we're gonna see hopefully this shard be orphan for a moment not have any parents there we go and then it's gone I had it was only orphan for a moment that time we won't you know I hope you like it and you know check it out it's open source find it on github way to go alright next up we have harbored your ads and can gift ego prep for coming up after welcome guys how's it going so we were really excited about the concept of harberger taxes it's been a hot topic lately because of Glin wheels new book radical markets he also did a paper with italic and so we hit sig the concept of Herberger taxes if you're not familiar with it i first knew about it because well let me tell you about it first so you would self evaluate property in doing so you agree to pay taxes on it if you were to say your property is very cheap pay very low taxes your to say your property is very expensive you'd pay expensive texas the kicker is that whatever you say your property is valued at it becomes for sale at that number so you have to be willing to sort of give an accurate number of what this property means to you because somebody comes by it away from you so you might want to protect it by making it really expensive but then you're stuck with really high taxes you might make it really cheap to have low taxes but somebody might just take it away from you I was first familiar with it because I'm from Kentucky I grew up around horse racing and the most common horse race is called a claiming race claiming race uses basically harboring taxes claims race means that you want to race your horse you put it into a thousand dollar claims race all the horses that go into this race are for sale for a thousand dollars if you were to have a really great horse that you know will beat all these bad horses but everyone else knows as well because it's probably worth ten thousand dollars you put it in this race somebody's gonna buy it from you for a thousand dollars you lose out nine thousand dollars where the horse and so what feels like this really amazing way to force people and uh actually giving an accurate price for property has come up again and we were excited to try something else with it it's a little scary to apply this concept to houses because people live in them maybe we shouldn't be experimenting with something that's so important to the livelihood of people so we thought we'd try it out in something a little bit easier which is advertisement spaces so we made harberger ads it's at pads that XYZ you can see we have a interface where you can sell your ad space eath San Francisco has been gracious enough to let us list on theirs so I'll just list that take their oops if San Francisco com SF Oh plea the demo God's work but this transaction through once we are done we can look for ads on my sites San Francisco we can take this embed link and just pop over to the website now we can see there is a harberger ads blank add up there now say I come in as another user and I want to buy this ad space I can just click this link takes me over to the website I see currently the price is $1 so I want to purchase it I say actually this thing is way more valuable than that it's worth $2 I want it to go to I don't know my name I don't I know what I do I take it to Yahoo image URL we're gonna go to yahoo.com and we can confirm our purchase we pay for our transaction in doing so we've given the permission to remove ERC 20s from us we've allowed the app beforehand now when we come back we see that our Yahoo ad is at the top of the San Francisco page [Applause] feel free to come along take the ad away from us and pay more for it and get texts on the accurate price sorry taxes go to the site owner we use the graph for syncing our data and I think that's it yeah thanks ago all right fantastic next up is giftee come on up guys and send put get in the on-deck-circle please thank you [Applause] everybody worked 50 my name is Alex this is Andrew so we're really good friends we've known each other since high school we're really into cryptocurrency and crypto collectibles but a lot of our friends and family aren't and we really wanted at this hackathon to create a really good way of introducing people to their first crypto collectible so one of the issues with actually sending somebody a crypto collectible is that you need to know what their address is so what we've built is a open protocol called gifty that allows you to send an NFC over SMS or via URL so you can share it inside of a chatroom we're going to show you what it looks like live alright so let's take a quick look yeah I mean my coinbase wallet happened if you notice now next to my collectibles there's a send button I tap on that send button I get a share sheet and I can now text this link over to Alex alright we'll switch over to Alex's device okay in just a matter of moments with Internet permitting they'll get a text yeah it looks like two popped up so if he taps on this link and his text messages it deep links him back into wallet and he's now claimed that collectable so that's kicked a transaction off on my device so what happened there Alex tapped on that link and and sent the message to our bridging server encrypted to let my device know that this is the address that the collectible is now going to and we can now sign that transaction and submit it so when the transactions confirm that collectible appear in Alex's wallet so we designed gift II to be an open protocol you can implement this inside of your own wallet application all you have to do is implement a specific URL scheme we also have the bridging server it's fully open source it's well-documented there's a flow diagram if you do want to implement this flow so please do go ahead and like check out our github which is available via the dev host link there's a flow diagram that lets you kind of see what's happening with the bridge server it's pretty trusts minimizing you don't ever send your address to the bridge server unencrypted the bridge server does not know what your collectible is what you're trying to transfer who you're trying to transfer it to so you could run this yourself if you wanted to thank you [Applause] thanks giftie next up we have sin put you guys could come up set up and also yeah welcome also Korra if you can get ready for the next one and we're also looking for crypto pay so if you are here please find me or Evan now cool all right Korra you guys set up you know tweak some resolution cuz it's currently like Windows 2000 well that's a little small but it should do okay awesome so my name is Ellie day I'm a software engineer this is Lee Ann she's also a software engineer we often you know accrue expenses related to flying out for a job interview going to a conference various things that will eventually be reimbursed from either our employer or a potential employer or a conference organizer but usually because companies are slow they have processes it takes at least five to six weeks even if we are right on top of submitting the expense report so what we decided to make was something called send foot and the whole idea is instead of waiting five to six weeks to get paid for your money that you're owed and then you've already spent you can actually get a short-term loan VSN put that uses two key bar chain technologies to reduce risk and actually get people to fund these loans so I'm gonna go straight into the demo if I can find where that window is it's very small hey cool so this is send put the way you get started is you enter in your email I'll enter it Leanne's email and this is how you design up it's really easy because we've actually integrated with blooms API which makes it really easy to know our customers and get out there verified information when they're going to apply for a loan so just click get paid and I'll hop over to the ends Gmail which she logged into over here and I guess they're thanking her for tracking out discord I'll try to keep some of your email to a minimum but looks like we have an email that came in and it's asking to confirm your identity with bloom so the cool thing is you can actually just scan a QR code which is provided via blooms SDK it's cher kit so once this loads the end we'll take her bloom app and scan to confirm her identity so there's a QR code somewhere in this internet so she going to my computer from somewhere else so you know those things often take a while I can see things moving the image on my computer so that means just open it up or actually there you go QR code and app froze cool so I can't see it but the Ann's gonna swipe and maybe it's processing with some nice little animations it was confirmed so what just happened is bloom verified her information with explicit confirmation and sent us a request with her verified information so now we can jump over to here and we can take a look over here and we get an email saying thanks for confirming your identity so what happens now is Liana could actually just forward her expense reports or outstanding expenses to us and every time she does that we can essentially process alone and every time she does that we can actually that goes on to Dharma so this was alone I submitted earlier and she submitted earlier for lunch today because you know just cheese and bread isn't really gonna cut it after we've been code you know we can't so this is for attend I it's a very like small expense but you know if I'm a person with lots of atheria more like crypto and I just want to get access to like a vetted sure source of loans I can actually go and fill that order right from the application and now you can see that I actually have an assortment of loans once this loads so that's the general idea terms of go to market one thing one way to do it is to partner with companies they have no they have a slow process and just in the same way that like airlines sell you travel insurance through a partner big companies can just to be like hey like we take a while but if you want cash soon or just go through Sen foot and yeah it was really great using the to to vendors yeah thanks [Applause] great thank you send put up next Cora and while they're getting up splitter convertor would you come up next by the sign and give it up for Cora [Applause] alright hey everyone I will keep this short and sweet we know how tired everyone is so we were focused on tackling the problem of a lack of structure when it comes to communication between different stakeholders in different crypto communities so we've heard a lot of theoretical thought leadership and thinking around the topic of governance but very little done in practice so we wanted to build a tool to help remedy that we want to make sure that we're engaging all relevant stakeholders and conversations between different crypto communities and we think that the current existing structures like telegram like Twitter like slack etc are not structured in a very engaging way for different stakeholders right so what we came up with was a tool called kora which is a governance tool that allows you to structure guidelines around this course and allows for identity identification stakeholder discussion participation and engagement around a distributed decision-making process so what we really want to do is provide a framework for different stakeholders to engage with each other right as simple as that and it's really all about engaging the relevant stakeholders in that discussion so we're gonna show you guys a quick them of all you wilt and we're also using identity with bluem so we'll dive right in so my friend Kevin spoke about engaging the right stakeholders right what how we are implementing is that is we are assigning every stakeholder a governance token which is like specific to that proposal and that gives them rights to participate in that discussion so let's say if I have 200 tokens I can use them by commenting by liking proposals whatever I want to do with them but once I'm out of my tokens I'm like I mean I cannot participate anymore so it's a way to avoid spam and limit the involvement of every stakeholder so I'm just gonna create a new proposal and yeah so I'm going to create a new proposal which I would like the community to deliberate on we chose the example of the etherium Community Fund which ones who let's say fund two projects and would like to know the views of the community which one would they like to fund right and in what in what order like as in 50 person goes to one project 40% goes to another or like whatever balance right I create a description for my proposal then I say what is like the minimum quorum of the participation tokens that have that have should be like that should be spent for me to be able to reach a particular decision right exactly like how a quorum works let's have a 75 okay oh yes again in this example really using allocation to two different options in this case we're using the etherium Community Fund as an example of how they would go about making a decision of allocating funds to two proposals that submitted for a grant oh the transaction feel for some reason I'm just going to try that again okay okay I think I don't know what they chew is just give me a moment sorry about this my Tomas has like still account nonce unless i refresh it so sorry about that and this gonna do it again okay so this is the yeah and now the discussion and what I'm gonna do is here is I'm gonna prove that I am a relevant stakeholder using bloom as the identity provider so I'm gonna scan this QR code bits yeah Alex well he doesn't he's just verifying that he's a relevant stakeholder in this discussion using bloom ID verification so it's actually matching his email domain with the one registered with the discussion and he is if he's accepted he'll actually receive governance tokens and he'll be able to spend them to actually post a comment engaging signaling within the discussion itself in this case allocation of two different resources right so then he'll be able to submit a comment and this will actually average out the responses from every part to spend so the core team actually has a better idea of what the relevant stakeholders actually feel about that decision all right thank you sorry about the technical differences splitter convertor and if crypto pay can get ready nice glad we found you guys welcome to the stage splitter converter [Applause] nineteen greetings fellow humans just gonna adjust the resolution here name is Chris Cassano I'm the CTO of deco Network and we are building the on chain infrastructure to help Dow's find work and get paid through milestone based contract development work so what I built for this hackathon is called splitter converter and in short it lets you put a idle T to play a contract that can split and convert any incoming aetherium or die according to the percentages specified right here so the example use case that we're gonna go with is that somebody wants me to build the next FOMA 3d gap and I say I'll build it but I want 10% of all the profit forever and I want it in dye because I'm very risk-averse so we can deploy this contract and in this example the the person who's funding this project is the the first address they get 90% of any incoming funds and I get 10% as died down here and once it deploys we can send some Smith and dye to it and and demo the rest of it so I think that this has a few different really interesting use cases the first is sort of like a royal tease scenario where as a software engineer instead of working hourly or per project you can capture long-term value and passive income from the projects that you work on and get a share of the profit forever I think it's also really useful for ad-hoc teams so if you want to work with someone and you want to you know split the money that comes into the project a certain way and you want to do it trust lessly you can use this and another great use case is even just for yourself you could put the same receiving addresses in here and maybe you want some of your incoming aetherium to be converted to die because again you're risk averse may need to pay bills so this this would let you do that and this uses the khyber network to do the actual conversion what I'm doing right now is I'm sending some eath and some dye to the contract that was just deployed give it a minute to confirm and this is running on Rob stone and it's available at deco dot network slash splitter right now so you can feel free to give it a test if you want go ahead and pull ups the ether scan pages for both of these addresses so that you can see that they're empty there they're both empty no transactions looks like the eath transaction was confirmed oh and now the die is confirmed to cool I'm gonna come back here I'm gonna click withdraw and it's going to split and convert simultaneously and send it all out where it needs to go this is the pending transaction and here's just some some math to demonstrate a little bit of how it works so we sent in 1/8 and we sent in Tendai account one wanted to get 90% in eath and account two wanted to get 10% and die so account one should get 0.9 teeth and account - you should get one die and then the the Easter that the die is converted to eath for account one which is accounted for here and the eath is converted to to die for account 2 and that's a you know that's basically how it works here's the contract you can see the ending addresses were 81 and 27 so 81 gets 1 53.9 27 gets the 59 plus the 1 die so that's it thank you very much guys thank you splitter converter up next crypto pay come on up and in the art in the on-deck-circle auger Pro come on and get ready second time's the charm in it hi this is Satish here and I have my team so me and submit we all came from India to hack participate in he eats SF so what we what we did as part of this hack is build a simple NAB we named it as crypto pay what we wanted to do is there are there is so much of community working all over the world we wanted to create a payment link payment gateway kind of an interface where anybody could use it create a link share it with anybody all over the world and they can accept payments in crypto now what we did is we integrated this with Khyber and Maker Dow and then Khyber we are using any time any way any token anywhere feature where we can actually swap on chain any token so the user can pay in any coin and we will automatically swap it to die so we have taken died as a stable coin here because we want the person who creates the link wanted to make sure that if he wants to make sure a stable coin we plug a again it's USD that's how I built it so here is the dashboard so what you can see here is the the main stats like how many active links are happening how many transactions are going on right now and then the die received so far and then here on the top you can see that there is a accept payment link you can just when we click on it you can get a small pop-up window where you can give the description name and then you can give the die and then you can just create a accept payments here and then you can see that lists coming up in the bottom of the table here so if you just you can copy the link and then just share it so this will just show up like this like a small pop-up where they can integrate it with their websites or they can just share it with anybody and they can use the change token and then they can actually select any of the tokens that are available on the on the khyber network and then just save it like you can I can just select the OMG and then automatically it will be converted to oMG and then I can just say pay now it actually will pay immediately and then it will just submit the transaction on the blockchain so I'll have so may explain a little bit more about the smart contract and how we have integrated with maker now and tybor so on technique so on technical background our script appear smart contract whenever is whenever a buyer comes to our gap and make a transaction for example 104 1.6 oMG our smart contract talks to Qyburn at a protocol that we have this much of OMG we want $20 worth dye which is the example we are showing Kaiba Network then will eventually send us dye which will be released released to the Sailor so so the Sailor don't want any fluctuating currency as a receiving payment if they are providing $20 what service they want $20 not any currency which will fluctuate but the user who are buying the services may have lots of token 22 tokens many tokens so they can just pay with any token and with an Shin liquidity of Kaiba network we are converting that token into Diane that sailor is getting a sailor is getting into the dye similarly so they the other use case that we have is we wanted to make sure we use the the seller should be able to take a small CDP for the transactions that are happening from this so they can just go and use the pay by loan option and the pay by loan option what automatically does is it actually creates a on-the-fly CDP on maked or platform takes the dye that is required to be paid to the seller and it actually does everything in one transaction so if if you know the maker Dow at creating a CDP itself is the two old transactions so we actually participated in our last hack in India and this was one of the idea that we had like we wanted to minimize the transaction and gas cost so we were able to do it here so I can just do a paper alone and this will automatically create a CDP if the CDP already exists on the make it off with this address it will just keep adding more ether and get the draw the dye from that CDP the other important thing that we wanted to do was like what is the incentive for anybody to use this kind of platform because when you are anyway doing a stable coin then it is as good as fiat so what we did is we actually created a option for settings where the seller can decide what is the percentage of split he wants the payments into the what kind of crypto here so we have taken Ethan died here as an example 30% 70% we are going to on the flight split the transaction stores 30% of it in ether and 70% goes into the die so he can change this transactions he can you can decide to do this changes on the fly so we are going to decide like we have still not completed this part we wanted to do whether we should do a batch kind of a job to bulk transactions or we should do a transaction by transaction we are just really thinking and we need to work more on this so I think that's all these are the main use cases that we are trying to cover here and some ik has some point that you want to make about the make it now and Lowell first we used known form a big payments like house like car loans and others now my favorite feature about my favorite this is my favorite future like just create loan and you can do the small loan payments with help of make an operative all thank you thanks guys alright we're gonna have our pro backup thank you guys for coming back up here we're gonna test this out and also all of the sponsors giving prizes can you guys go get set up over here we're gonna be bringing you guys up soon fantastic okay hey everyone we are auger pro we we had some technical difficulties before I don't know if you guys know it auger is most of you probably do but it's a decentralized prediction market built on top of a theorem and you anyone can make a market on an auger so someone could have made a market about whether our presentation would work this time and we have we had the idea we love the technology behind auger because because the decentralized oracle and and how it all works but we wanted to build a really mobile friendly user interface to augur and we also wanted to expand the market a little bit more to show how you could use our markets to you know as in a trading style interface but also in a bedding style interface so this is our mobile app for iOS and as you can see we are connected to a hosted augur node which we deployed on Heroku and these are live main net markets on augur and you can see a list right here of the featured markets that we pulled in so max can go ahead and click on any of those you can kind of see you know we get you give you more market info and we give you the amount of F at stake we also convert that into US dollars how much at stake given the current price of the current trading pair of aetherium in the US dollar and we also tell you when the market will end we provide american-style betting odds for each market and then we also provide a time series pricing chart which really gives you the implied odds for the yes event so the likelihood between 0 and 100% that the current market thinks that that outcome will be yes so it's really cool to be able to see the history there and then max you can go to the categories of view we also pull in some of the top categories of markets on augur and all these you know are pulling live data from augur as soon as you click into the market so the category you see you can click on something like politics and now we see there's at the top there there's even a finalized market weather Cavanaugh would be confirmed and you can see that the chart has already gone to 100% basically even though the market ends in January because people have bit up the yes side all the way and if you go back you can check the Trump alike to be reelected market so pretty pretty stable and yeah that's about it we have we're gonna have a real test flight we're gonna post the link to that in the agora discordant thanks so that concludes the finalists I want to let I think we got to give all of these folks a big round of applause thank you guys for coming up and presenting so glad that that worked ok so as you know

so much cool next up seller hi I am mole from Center and this is our first ever time releasing our speak and it's so excited to see a lot of people in our SDK and we're giving out straight prizes the first see in a way pricy innovator price which is that Boatner the most innovative idea yielding seller goes to slake which is a 205 to a $2,500 in East and they are building a of chain you know guests most option you know market basically and the CP order price which is 500 Inglis goes to air prediction they're building a prediction market using our conditional of chain transactions and the

component that you can easily compose and build like a server based contractor templates so that's all thank you very much and next up chain-link hi everyone I'm from chain-linked we're a decentralized oracle network that provides data access to api's and off chain payments to your contracts we had a grand prize winner in in the form of micro subscription giving them $4,000 worth of link what they did was they had a contract watch a cloud service via chain link so if the cloud service didn't deliver uptime and it fell down the cloud service no longer was paid and when the cloud service provided the uptime it promised it was paid according to you know the performance of its guarantees which the contract learned about using a chain link in second place we had a link set for $2,000 worth of link which used a price feed to dynamically rebalance a basket of crypto tokens and trade them automatically based on price changes and an in third place we had B Threepio for $1,000 worth of link where they basically had a voting scheme where they pulled in data about candidates in each state they populated a contract with that data about candidates and then they allowed that contract to send out votes in the form of absentee ballots that a robot actually signed or executed on paper and that that's how you need to execute an absentee ballot so they got a bunch of data about candidates and then they had a robot send in absentee ballots in physical form and so they were in third place for a thousand a thousand bucks in link thank you next up fiber network test us hi everyone my name is Desmond from khyber so we had a total of nine projects that were working with us building on top of our protocol it wasn't easy to decide who was the actual winner but we

flume hello everybody we had four prizes totaling $11,000 was really hard to pick we had over 15 entries and I think they're truly innovative so our first prize you may have seen biology's tweet about a proven merkel digital document signatures think of it as decentralized DocuSign that goes to block you sign using bloom ID to verify those digital signatures our second prize which was one of the top ten finalists here employee expense reimbursements take weeks month send put lets users get a fast loan using bloom ID for financial data they receive a $2,500 prize and I think that's much needed in the world our third prize which I think is truly truly innovative one of the Holy Grails of crypto is getting a Fiat loan getting a Fiat loan without a central counterparty lending party makes this a possible with bluem ID they receive a $2,500 prize and then our last prize you know one of the biggest problems in journalism of the day is fake news I think this one is absolutely just super innovative they have a way to do sighted an anonymous source but actually prove who that person is without releasing that private information truly innovative crypto source uses blum ID to make those anonymous citations verified they receive a $3,500 prize thank you to everyone who submitted for Blum API next up is Gwon stam everyone I'm Jarrod I work with Kwan stamp we are currently a beta net on may net protocol to do automated smart contract audits check us out baiting a big net concept calm and apply to run to be a node the winner are for the bounty NARS wins $2,000 for best improves the audit report and we thought that Quan staff badge is a really simple really clean way to display github badges on slippy haunt stamp audits online so it's really great we're really happy so thank you so much have a great day next up connect I'm saying that right hey everyone i'm rahul from connects and we're building a micro payment network based on state channels so first of all i just want to thank all the developers and awesome teams that we got to talk to all throughout the weekend we got a lot of great feedback on our own developer tools and api's which we're definitely gonna iterate on but without further ado our prize for best use of our API is for their use case was canopy so they're building a currency agnostic data payment protocol for data and service marketplaces and our other prize for the most innovative project using Kinect is K NXT connects so they built a decentralized version of our state channel hub using orbit DB and ipfs so $1,500 each so thank you guys very much [Applause] next up Dharma hello everybody hi my name is Dadaab I am from Dharma Dharma is a protocol that enables borrowing and lending of crypto assets anywhere in the world so we had two prizes that we were sponsoring one was our kind of first-place prize for the most innovative project built on top of Dharma and then we had a runner-up prize as well we had a whopping 11 submissions that we had to sift through and I just want to say this is a really hard decision for us to make so kudos to everybody who built on top of Dharma this weekend the runner-up prize goes to send put so send put was up here earlier they were building a platform that allowed employees to receive reimbursements from their employers instantly by Dharma alone as opposed to having to wait you know two three weeks for the actual reimbursement to get processed so kudos to them and then our first-place prize for $2,500 goes to Lone Star which was a gorgeous iOS native app that was basically like an iOS interface for borrowing and lending buy at Dharma and we were just absolutely blown away by the quality of the submission so so great job everybody thank you so much are you gonna oh loop ring hey welcome loop ring hi everybody thank you so much this was our first eath global event we had a great time so we had $7,000 across to project requests the first was just build a dex on top of loop ring I should say we're an open decks protocol build that Dex or pewter peer trading protocol we are giving that to looper advanced Dex trading tools who built some advanced Dex trading tools such as stock orders on the client side and did deep linking with our iOS wallet in second place for that or we were giving to SV OTC who built a permission liquidity pool using civic as a front end to access our decks so we'll give $500 in LRC to SV OTC and 3,000 to loop advanced Dex trading tools our second task was to build a smart contract for our version 2 protocol which allows fees to be paid in any token kind of economic abstraction at the user level which we have to convert into LRC to burn at the end of the day so crypto pay who you saw up here before used khyber network to convert our non LRC tokens they did that in their spare time super impressive and so 1750 to them and also Mariano from ez trade used loop ring itself to convert the non LRC tokens so 1750 to him as well so thank you everybody thank you next up coinbase wallet hi everybody my name is Pete from coinbase we want to help get your projects to actual users for those of you thinking and thinking about taking your hat hacks to to actual users to market find us on our discord you can find our discord link in the development section of our website wallet coinbase comm our prizes thousand teeth no I mean that wasn't dollars worth of ease I'm sorry yeah for Best mobile optimized occasion and it goes to say Toshi congratulations Michael DeMille Paul and Graham thank you so next up it's POA Network hi I'm Jeff with poa network we're a side chain of aetherium if you're developing on aetherium check us out we're faster and cheaper and who doesn't like that we had such a hard time taking only three winners there are so many out there I think everyone in here deserves a round of applause for developing this hole this weekend so thank you so much yes yeah exactly right so we've got three three winners in third place we had fungible non-clinical tokens they tokenized non fungible objects in second place we had 50/50 raffle a novel use of blockchain to have a raffle and are in first place we're really impressed with a block work and the work that they were able to put through on our network thank you again everyone and 0ex protocol hey everyone I'm Tom I work at zero X where a decentralized exchange protocol I think we originally went to the hackathon with one $2,500 or 2,500 year XPrize but we really blown away by the number of submissions and quality of submissions I think people are really being creative when it comes to inventing new tokenized assets and training those assets in new novel ways so we actually giving out to 2500 ZRX prizes the first goes to pre motif they're a they give access to global markets like the SP 500 by bundling together auger and dy/dx assets and then trading them on top of 0x really really cool really professionally done nice work the next is fungible non-portable tokens they have fitted a way to be decomposed ownership of an NF key into multiple fungible assets and then use those assets to vote on how much the NFT you should be bought or sold for when to sell it etc using 0x underneath so congrats to both those teams you can see us back at our booth and we can we can meet up thank you thanks a lot thanks to all the sponsors prizes yeah big big thanks to

giant yeah let's do that thanks guys see you later we'll probably just use this one hey everybody I am super tired so I wrote things down and I'm just gonna read them verbatim in case I don't miss anything so it's so great to see everybody here I am super happy that a lot of you are not sleeping entirely um and after 48 hours we're coming to an end and I know that we're maybe five ten minutes away so I'll try to make everything quick fingers crossed and I just want to thank all of you for uh just kind of being at this event and we're super thrilled that this this weekend kind of went through successfully and everybody had a great time we were we were talking to all of our sponsors and attendees and getting feedback and so we're super happy to see all these amazing connections and projects and just in general experiences being shared this weekend so today ten teams presented on stage and thanks to all of our amazing judges who did all the hard work or finding out and figuring out who those tens should be out of the 120 we kind of got to see a lot of those demos on stage live and if you've never been to an eighth global event what kind of sets us unique is that this is not set up to be a competition we don't have a notion of 1st 2nd 3rd places or actually we don't even announce our official prizes other than the sponsors ones beforehand we want this to be about kind of learning and experimentation and just being able to come down and play with the ideas and kind of see what what is possible and use that as a starting point to work on iterate and just make something and just ship so we've never had specific ranks and kind of with all that set the top 10 teams that came up on stage are the official of winner of this event each of the members on those teams will get to eat as their prize and I just want them to just want to give a big round of applause for all of our 10 teams we'll be reaching out to you over email and coordinating all of the delivery we're gonna go in the next slide for a second however we'll just switch on slides I'm gonna pass this to Liam all right surprise oh no all right all right awesome great so I don't know if you guys have ever run events before have done anything like this but it is exceedingly hard work like it is shockingly hard how much ridiculous logistics goes into like all of this av that like random lamp over there getting all the sponsors inviting all of you like it's a Ritz it's like months of efforts and so I really want to make sure that we get a chance to kind of take a step back and think about all the people that have put in all of this time to make this situation that we're in a reality I mean it's it's it's honestly really meaningful to me we've we've done so much by taking this event and bringing us the theory Omega system and then there's kind of two main things that we've really like been able to help in pushing it forward the fact that we kind of come together these events every like three four months with Denver and Buenos Aires and Waterloo and Indian on all of these we're iterating as a community on this technology faster than like anything I've ever seen we're constantly finding problems solving them working together and honestly I think that's like just an immense success so we should all be very proud of that and so what I want to do is just bring attention to the people that have likes deeply believed in the vision that we're working towards and kind of made this reality so the first kind of kuba people is the core organizing team there's some very specific people that literally for the past several weeks were just like lost lost sleep trying to make all this happen so they are Andrew Dunn's coma was our lead operations manager dthe global Heather Davidson from Elle for Josh stark and please like please join me in thanking these folks Jacob Williams McCann from Eduardo resulta Sathya pari Paul Martin Helena flack Nikhil Gupta Ethan Wilding Shakti cope and Nashville these folks have like done so much to make this happen so please honestly join me in thanking them like as loud as you can the other folks I really want to do thank is a you probably seen them wandering around with the buffer corn t-shirts the the eat Denver team actually flew out here specifically to help make this event a success so specifically John Paul are just in Moskowitz and Dan shields I think they're over there please like I join me in thanking now there's also about 75 volunteers so I'm not only just San Francisco but from around the world that I've flown in specifically this list they just wanted to come here be a part of the vibe and help out and make sure that everyone was having a good time that you've seen them with white shirts let's see a bunch of you right now can you please join me in thanking the volunteers who spent all this time in the weekend too and finally you've had the pleasure of watching them and being a part of them this with us Evan and Anna few opening summers and clothing stammers please join me in thanking them they've done an awesome job as well so I'm about five minutes from concluding and I'd like to go back to the slides actually so it says one more thing but it's actually a couple more things and he's had to submit my slides early so I couldn't change it but today is the 7th of October 11 months and three weeks ago we hosted our first ever event eath Waterloo and back then it was the first-ever etherion marathon was also one of the largest active it was actually also the largest I come on in the world we had about 500 people attend in Canada and that sparked what now is eath global we've seen so many amazing things come out of this anywhere from amazing companies to developers to new developers getting into this ecosystem and as of this weekend we have crossed over 4,000 attendees from 40-plus countries in the past one year added global events and this is just absolutely amazing we never thought we'd get there especially this fast and just to keep this momentum going this wouldn't be a neat global event without announcing the next one so without further ado I'd like to announce our next event which is also our official last event for this year each Singapore happening on December 7th in Singapore with each Singapore in in about two months we would have done six events successfully this year and not only that this cycle just keeps on repeating we're already starting to plan what 2019 is gonna look like that was good good sound effects we've already started to plan what 2019 looks like by the way you can apply for each Singapore right now applications have officially opened as of this morning and not only that we're also super excited to announce our first official event for 2019 it's eat Denver happening on February 15th and it's already set to be the biggest event we're ever gonna have it's gonna be twice the size of each San Francisco so we're looking forward to these two events and lastly on logistics we got one quick thing so you can check out East Singapore go and eat denver com2 to find out more about the details as well as any other information you'd like to know about the event and lastly a quick logistical detail were we're about to wrap up in San Francisco and after this event starting five o'clock we're hosting a happy hour happy hour with Maker at the lot SF on 2101 Lombard Street so we'll be making our way there from five o'clock and we'll go on to 8 o'clock and we hope to kind of see you there after kind of in a couple hours hope you get some rest and get to pack up and before we leave we have this one last thing we want to do we hope that this works because live demos or life attempts will are always sort of dodgy so what we'll see how this goes yeah so the one last thing just as a means of like thanking everyone here and kind of getting a collective memory of what that looks like we actually have a photographer if you just all kind of stand up and turn around just up there and top of the mezzanine we're going to try and get I get to get us a photo of all of us kind of just like getting a chance
