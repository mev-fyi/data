all right looks like we are good to go bear with me one last second while i check the stream excellent okay we are live um welcome everybody to this third session on week zero of eath online um if you haven't noticed we've got quite a packed week i know a bunch of people are already showing up to multiple sessions which is great to see so without further ado we can get this started this is the brainstorm session so what are we going to do here we're going to talk about what you can build what general ideas to structure your hack around how to integrate sponsors anything and everything we're going to try to touch on it all so hopefully you're here to think about some crazy ideas because that's kind of what this session is going to be about i will stop talking and intro our panelists who are going to be sort of guiding the discussion um first up we've got mariano conti many of you probably recognize him next cool he was formerly head of oracles at maker and now is an independent dev uh working on a whole bunch of different things in the space welcome mariano uh then we have hey thank you sorry you want to say anything about the intro no no um i'm really happy to be here awesome we're glad to have you too we've got andy who is an engineer at maker as well um or not not mariano is uh he's not at maker anymore but andy did you want to say a few words he used to be yeah hey guys excited to be here and we've got uh the ghost step um stephen gosselin uh he's working on a project called onboard.money and we're hopefully going to get a workshop later in the hackathon from him but um today he's going to be giving us some feedback to ideas and helping us brainstorm hey everyone then last but not least adrian is also an engineer at maker and we're very happy to have all four of you on here um i know i couldn't carry this session on my own so without further ado why don't we get started i'm going to re-link the computer and level ideas doc which is sort of a running document we've been using this year to just collect defy ideas collect hackathon ideas so i will re-link it in the chat and why don't we start off with just some general ideas from any of the the the people that have been invited to guide the session what what do you think is interesting what have you been riffing on lately um let's start with some high-level stuff here go ahead mariano or whoever yeah um i can start real quick of course lately there's been two things on my mind one is d5 the other is nfts and the third one is the combination of the two which um until a while ago it wasn't really that clear right and so i so i think we're at a point where we got past much of the the the food coins and are entering a new a new era that i i think is going gonna be the most fulfilling um of course i read a lot of things about nfts that say hey i i i just uh copy pasted your your nft now i own it we i hopefully know hopefully nobody here thinks that right the the idea behind art is that it is unique and you know it is traceable to an owner and what better way than with a ledger right so i know it sounds right saying you know d5 and and now nfts because it's what's in but i expect a lot of projects to end up uh with a combination of these two yeah for sure first one that comes to mind is was it called avigacha abigachi something like that i think it's it's building that exact intersection of nfts and d5 maybe somebody else knows a little bit more about it yeah nft is a really interesting space i would actually link to this nifty inc site from austin griffin who started building some better user experience around nfts given the high gas costs probably like an interesting inspiration as well oh right because nifty uh is built on top of xdy which is the other thing that i um forgot is like guiding the the conversation right now which is uh scalability right so layer twos um anything that that you know moves uh transactions out of the main chain and into a sidechain or a bridge or a roll-up or whatever you want to call it um that is also the that is also something that that's been on everybody's mind and uh you can trent you can probably say there's there's likely a sponsor that that is an l2 probably more than one and and they for sure maybe have extra prices for somebody for yeah we have mata matic is one of the sponsors and it's definitely if you've been using mainnet at all this summer you know that uh layer two solutions can't come soon enough um hopefully sooner rather than later yeah i'll piggyback on top of nft stuff um something that i think or just kind of a general thing to think about that could be pretty cool is i feel like right now the nft marketplace space is really basic you basically have an nft and say how much it costs people can buy it from you and i think there are a lot of other weird ways that you could sell nfts either with blind auctions and dutch auctions and all these different things that um just aren't really well developed marketplace spaces right now i think that could be something that'd be really interesting to just play around with definitely for the uh the the things you can buy these days made of nfds you have the unisocks you have the thame t-shirts so that's a whole new fashion space i guess you can say yep pretty interesting one thing i forgot to mention at the start of the call is if there are any hackers who actually want they have an idea and they want to get you know some initial feedback before everything kicks off this is a perfect opportunity to bring it up to some people who are deep into this exact sort of stuff um so if you are interested in sharing your idea or getting some feedback raise your hand and zoom or just write your message and i'll unmute you um this would definitely be a really great time to do that one sponsor that is sorry uh one sponsor that i see which is pretty interesting as hell is a protocol labs and especially fall coin uh it's a bit of a change of topic from nfts but we can always get back to that um seems like fall coin is coming out soon and there are a few cool developments happening around that one that i've been seeing recently which is pretty interesting is slate which is basically like a really like a replacement for dropbox they seem to have an api which is pretty cool to integrate with i could see like interesting like web3 hack done around filecoin as well it could be nice yeah actually we we did uh a hackathon specifically around file coin and protocol labs earlier this summer and slate was one of the one of the workshops we gave is very cool demonstration of the things that they're building over there um okay let's let's um let's try a different prompt of you know if you were going into this hackathon what sort of things would you be thinking about it doesn't have to be a specific project but um what sort of uh projects would you be looking into how would you be framing your approach into this so think about like the hackathon experience even if you haven't done a hackathon yourself i know the maker guys are i think they just finished an internal hackathon recently so maybe let's let's switch gears a bit and talk about what you would how you would approach this yourself personally mariano uh i usually have a list of ideas that a hundred different projects that i would do if uh i could clone myself a hundred well uh if i could clone people who are better than than me at coding 100 sure uh and i could put them in my house most of them have to do with d5 just because that is that has been my interest my main interest um so so what i do is i i have them organized between stuff that would be you know almost a new protocol that would take a lot of time and then things that are mostly uh a mix of just calling existing things which is that is going to be part of um of my talk on friday the the fact that you can have two lines of solidity and you know get a flash loan or open up a vault or get a loan or do all sorts of things with just a tiny bit of code right um so then what i what i say is okay what is available to me flash loans are available um liquidations and this and that protocol are available um swapping a token for another is available and then maybe some kind of yield farming maybe maybe uni swap right now is available what can i what can i do quickly that uh you know will make me some money or make somebody someone and then you know if it is uh something that could take maybe a day or two i try to code something in solidity uh and then if it's something that maybe doesn't even require a ui i i don't even bother but if it does i always try to have a designer friend available because mostly for hackathons they end up being the the people who tie everything together you know a ui person right i think now i'm i'm mostly just giving tips uh for hackathons but if we uh if that's the thing then um let me continue a little bit with with this idea um i don't know how many of you and there's plenty of people like the 65 people i don't know how many of you are new to hackathons or if this is going to be your first one this one is a month long right so so yeah so it's a little bit shorter than than hack money and hack fest so the entire event including judging ends on the 30th so about a week shorter if you had previously been impact money or hack fast it's a little bit shorter than that but okay so yeah three weeks there's still plenty of time uh if you go over the the document that the trent linked the ideas i i think there's a lot of good ones and actually a good exercise would be to grab two different ones and try to mash them together into something new because uh yeah i i look at mine and they're the ones that are tagged mariano they mostly have the same the same vibe to them so i would try to match something that i wrote with somebody completely like the opposite of me or or you know two different people from two different projects you grab something from d5 something from identity or something from prediction markets with uh something from social networks and yeah yeah i think you can get a weird new project with the with that exercise so to summarize i think one of the first things you said was look to projects that already exist leverage something like uniswap it's a foundational piece for the d5 ecosystem don't try to you know reinvent everything we have it's three weeks is long but it's really not that long you want to manage your scope i think one of the things that we frequently see with hackathons is the first week is about trimming out scope because otherwise you end up with something that's too big for you you know what you're trying to deliver within this limited time frame and then like you said um maybe put two different ideas together it's like combining two different flavors which may not you may not think that they go together but actually there's an interesting idea there uh yeah those are some of the things that i and that i would do um as far as the first things that you said i've seen some very ambitious um teams trying to come up with a completely new you know uh foundational protocol uh in a in a hackathon of course that's almost impossible you know in a 48-hour one maybe maybe it is possible uh in a three-week one but um i mentioned leveraging everything that is just because you know as time as we move on and this ecosystem matures there is more available to everybody that's why usually with hackathons i tend to recommend although feel free to ignore this if you feel that you can do something uh entirely new but just make use of everything that's that's out there definitely carl you want to go ahead and mute and share your pitch where you want to work hey guys uh i'm carlos for anyone that doesn't know i've been in the space for a bit been going to these hackathons and it's not nft related but it's kind of related to mariano's idea with that alarm clock with maker dow and i've been thinking about this before which is having some you know incentivized way for miners or third parties to adjust the collateralization ratio if it reaches a certain point i mean i've been talking about this with another friend of mine he's not participating in the hackathon but essentially what it would be is like a user would transfer their vault to a contract and the contract could have like a collateralization ratio and anyone could call the contract to try to trigger it but so using some kind of oracles to uh you know to base the price on as well as also with uh as mainstream uh well as much of a problem gas prices have been lately you know trying to add some dynamics to it where if some third party were to adjust the clatterization ratio it would take into account gas prices through another oracle to give some sort of automatic profit that way it's not just hard coded because that would be kind of bad once gas prices randomly shoot up again so that's just kind of what i'm looking at it's you know not nft related but um it's definitely something that could be used in the space so i i kind of want to let the andy take this one just because i've been talking too much but i like the idea because it is based on something that i wrote yeah no i like that idea too um i think with that there are definitely some things already in the space that are monitoring people's um monitoring people's cdps or loans in general and adjusting them for people so i would say it would be important to consider maybe what you you would be doing differently as opposed to like a defy saver or something like that um and really make sure you nail that down because i think there's definitely space to make that whole system more evolved or have some different niche to it but i would make sure that you're really nailing down what it is that this will be delivering as opposed to a different type of loan saver app so you're thinking what what is the differentiator from an existing product you mentioned d5 saver are there any other ones um doesn't instadap also have something related to this i think they have something they have they have a way of quickly unwinding position i believe but it is not automatic um it is not based on on any oracles or or any incentives for either a third party to call or or you know the service itself while making a profit so i think there is there is still a lot of room for for competition in that space there's actually one thing built by the gelato team around it's called yellatto i don't totally understand it yet but it seems to be automation to prevent a maker vault liquidation and i think it's open source so this could be actually a great starting point for implementation yeah because i've looked at gelato before i haven't looked at yolada though um their documentation is kind of so i've been straight away from it for a little bit but yeah that's a good idea i'll dig more into that one too thanks guys but so yeah that's kind of what i want to be exploring um especially exploring uh something with involving gas to make it still profitable um i have some experience with front end and developing smart contracts i wouldn't say i'm necessarily very strong in either but i can you know i'm well versed in both so um if anyone in this call is interested feel free to message me in this chat or my username is carl farsen just like my name um on discord telegram whatever and i'd be happy to start figuring some out so thanks awesome carl thanks for sharing i just want to say there is a chain link oracle the uh for gas prices as well and i i don't think i've seen it integrated with with a lot of projects but uh especially for things that that try to extract some kind of profit or you know incentivize users to call functions and then pay them back uh something like their their gas oracle is probably a good idea to integrate and like i said before it's likely just one line of code to call it and then a couple of lines in your contract to do whatever kind of logic with the result cool awesome thanks guys all right there's been a couple questions about meta transactions so uh recognizing that we have you know um pretty wide ranging audience there's some intermediate developers we've got people who are brand new does somebody want to give an intro to what meta transactions actually are what they do why they're useful and how people use them in their in their dapps stephane maybe yeah sure um i'm not a transaction maximalist um i think they're required for being able to bring the kind of experience that uh developers want to bring to their users i i know most of the people in the chat here have had to play around with some version of approve and transfer from whenever interacting with the with adapt and the transactions are the way out of that uh that problem um essentially meta transactions plus some level of smart contract while it allows you to bundle together any number of interactions so whether it's uh you want to unwind your your pickle position uh stake into some kind of uh liquidity pool for you to swap and then stick that liquidy position back into another uh contract you could do it all in in a single transaction with with my transactions um now there's sort of a question like why why hasn't it been adopted yet um my theory is that has a lot to do with uh it adds a lot of complexity to the developer experience to uh to play with uh with no transactions you have to make sure that you sign all the messages correctly there isn't really good support on the sdk level for it um so if i can plug something i'm working on this this onboard the money thing is really about uh providing meta transaction um as a easy to use component as you'd have for for any uh web3 app and i really see that as being required for uh using the the kinds of applications that are sort of nft uh types as well but you don't necessarily have the level of sophistications for a lot of the users that um that need to uh use metamask and need to be familiar with all these different interactions uh meta transactions allows you to separate a lot of the security from the transaction execution um and uh and provide some some good distance between the two is it okay if i ask a question sure so my question is what in a hypothetical situation if the berlin hard fork in three to six months includes some sort of protocol support that is you know mostly identical to how many transactions work someone signs a transaction and then they have a relayer sponsor that transaction what does that mean for you and what does that mean for meta transactions in general like is there so much inertia behind meta transactions at this point that it's unlikely that a protocol support would dethrone it or is that something that is going to be welcomed by developers i personally think it would be great to have it at the at the protocol level um i mean one of the things that i've been waiting for years to see is just a simple rpc call for batching multiple transactions together and attending them to the network now potentially in some atomic way and you still haven't seen that uh happening uh so if if there's some additional stuff that can be done later lower down in the protocol for for enabling it it sounds great um yeah it remains to be seen though if that ends up happening yeah i think i just saw yesterday um batched meta transactions efp 3005. so there's definitely still interest in this kind of thing um and like like it's been mentioned it's a huge ui um benefit to you know people who aren't super familiar with metamask if you can integrate this into your product and actually one of the sponsors for ethonline is uh the gas station network which is one of the kind of main driving forces for this this area of research show we'll put some links in the discord for meta transactions what they are how to use them how to integrate them and hopefully some people can end up including them in their their hack idea we're gonna we're gonna keep moving to the ether um i don't know if you have raised your hand but you want to unmute and tell us what your what you've been up to what you're thinking about awesome yeah so my name is madison my title is mcmaster on the ether and you know we've created something that is sort of like a knowledge-based debate system and we're very interested in trying to figure out how we can turn the xp earned on our platform into a non-transferable ft representation of that reputation that can travel around with the user in their wallet and they can use that reputation to interact with other applications within the ecosystem so there's only really been two examples that i found there's erc 1238 which is from nicola who i think is from protocol labs uh he was working on this back in 2018 and maker dao actually just released something with their badges so i i i'm very interested in seeing what people think about this and if there are people that want to collaborate let me jump in and say i i think dx dial may do something similar with the reputation um in that they're tokens i'm pretty sure that they're non-transferable so maybe you can you can look into that uh as well for some kind of inspiration or or see how they did it the idea of of having a reputation that is non-transferable and that it can you know that that you can use in several different protocols is one that is extremely interesting um to me it's like um you know you you have something in your account that represents uh i don't know uh yeah your your credit level maybe or uh you know just all around saying that you're a human and not a bot or or whatever and then different protocols can use them to do several different things imagine and and this is now mixing it up with d5 uh imagine somebody with a high reputation that maybe has to pay less interest on their loans because of uh you know they they have a higher reputation or they can they can borrow more against their collateral i think this is still very unexplored and looking forward to what you build yeah one question that comes to mind is so it's non-transferable what happens when you lose access to that wallet or does it not matter is there some sort of issuer affordance you have like oaf is the issuer of some nfts that are related to some attendance they can technically reissue co-apps is there anything like that for what you're thinking of madison uh so initially yes uh you know our platform is looking at issuing that reputation ideally though over time i think it can be just like if you lose your your private keys you lose access to your tokens you most likely will have to lose your reputation because there's issues with civil attacks that can happen uh there's workarounds but if you can essentially have an easy way to port over to replicate or to get that new reputation that it introduces other problems i'll give you a i'll give you a hint which i think is one that not many people have thought about when it comes to implementing identity and especially the non-transferable nature of it is it needs to have an expiry um if you don't have an expiry on your identity then it's always going to be possible to transfer it if you say an identity is only valid for 30 days and then you need to have some signer that reattests that you are who you say you are then you get around the whole problem of losing your keys or and what not um i think a lot of people are getting closer to this idea uh if you look at some of the stuff that three box is doing for example with uh so sign up stations and social attestations it's getting closer but there hasn't been that like very clean user experience of hey you know i just need to check into this website once every 30 days to refresh my identity great point any other thoughts on identity or nft's non-transferable identity uh hello um can you hear me yes okay uh i'm ministaki and i'm currently joining the 8th online for northern um first uh really uh thank you guys uh to help this great opportunity um i'm uh i'm currently in a project that launched in the in a month ago and uh that is rated nft um we are trying to uh create a decay royalty i mean uh create a organization for the web3 commons and uh try to experiment the concept of security which is uh the author or i mean the artists can get a loyalty even after the second sales so third sale for sale on the fifth sale or something uh so the artist or the the um i mean the the people who upload the nft or something can get their money even after the scam sales and uh trying to experiment uh whether it's or not it works um yeah i'm just just just my already uh we are experimenting i don't know what should what should i say um very cool yeah um i know of at least i think it's wearable which which also does this and there's probably a couple other nft marketplaces that that you know send a percentage back of the sale back to the original artist and i think that's an amazing idea and it's it's a perfect use case for nfts plus um open marketplaces and smart contracts obviously but this is this is perfect um have you how long have you been kind of thinking about this idea or where did you start actually the member of the odyssey he is also in the it online uh and just uh is a is a is a person who come up with idea and that they are i mean here is uh trying to uh realize that uh um with the help of the reg style and the very guild and the and um i mean the concept and uh yeah um [Music] oh man we are yeah and when we are really on just initiating the project initiated the project so i'm just um looking for the people who are who are really interested in us yeah anyway thanks for the feedback um good feel but i mean sure any any other comments from people about you know um art and nfts relating back to the original artist how royalties work and all that i do think something that would be kind of interesting would be i know you mentioned wearable has artist royalties um and i i'm not totally sure i haven't looked at their smart contracts code exactly how they work but i don't believe it is like enforcing on any token like uh transfer pay the payment of royalties i think it's just in there like um in their auction house i think it'd be interesting to have some ideas with nft royalties where anytime there's a transfer event admitted an artist would set some basic amount that had to be sent to them as like a royalty or something where because basically if i you know i sell a piece of artwork on variable and i get 10 royalties but then someone just starts selling it otc to other people uh i would lose that royalty i think it'd be interesting to try to think of ways where we could uh almost like disable a black market where artists wouldn't get royalties because i have to imagine that if this continues to grow that'll pop up pretty quickly of course actually without saying uh an nft black market sounds extremely interesting yeah or make an nft black market and force people to figure out how to do this that's probably the easier way to go about it yeah because if if transfers i i didn't know that um but i want to check that as well you're saying that there's a chance that the royalties is only uh enforced at the ui level in in rarible if uh i know it's in the smart contract code but i'm not sure it's in the token transfer i think it might be uh like a setting for their exchange i'm gonna pull up their code right now to check because i'm curious yeah i didn't realize it was nuanced like that yeah but i think there are some interesting things that can come out of that this i know ever since there's been feasts on token transfers and that kind of thing uh there's been rappers around it and yeah and trying to find ways to circumvent that so wow yeah those are definitely the edge cases you gotta think about uh in d5 and just any open community really somebody's gonna find a way to get around it hi adrian do you want to expand on what you put in the chat uh sure so if i understood correctly the conversation uh basically creating another ui layer on top of twitter similar to what uh maskbook did recently with the dollar signs uh so if you have massbook installed on twitter and if you hover any dollar sign you see this pop over with a nice little chart and links to unit swap things like that around governance especially links to trads could be pretty interesting another idea maybe like a good segue for governance aggregation i think government segregation is a really interesting theme in general since there's so much happening around that space uh something which is pretty simple it's almost web 2 like but just aggregating this discourse uh forum api calls into like a nice little dashboard it could be like a nice easy idea for somebody entering the crypto space with a lot of web 2 experience for example just trying another idea out there yeah definitely the mask book experiment was super interesting it was kind of blowing up yesterday or the day before if anybody isn't familiar we'll throw a link down down in the chat i i see here um fork of metamask that uses smart contract wallet the force defaults to storing a tokens this is um i would like to see i don't know if if this goes uh against what a hackathon should be but uh i would like to see some teams you know take the time to contribute to open source projects metamask uh being one there are there are a lot of things if you just search metamask on twitter like 95 of the threads read like uh you know customer complaints uh i i know that i've been um i've been guilty of this in the past but but you can find a lot of improvement suggestions from people you know things like better gas management um being able to input any address this is this is like i would say one of the most important ones if you use smart wallets or proxies then it is very difficult using metamask to see a adapts ui interact with that because metamask they force you to either connect ledger or have the private key somehow right uh in order to be able to be uh adapt but there's nothing saying that you can just uh you know browse uh navigate as x user so things like that improvements to open source projects like metamask they could also possibly be good project ideas i don't know trent if that i'm totally on board with that idea i feel like that could be an entire you know separate hackathon where it's just people get in the competitive spirit of contributing back to these open source tools that everybody uses every single day but you know might not put time to contribute back to i think that'd be an amazing idea for a hackathon and for sure if if you can find a way to build something or structure something a hack around that by all means that would be amazing big question for you sure what if a non-developer decides to do a ux research or like a design case study around metamosque like better ux ux warnings uh maybe a better usage of gas would that be a uh project they could submit yeah for sure i mean so it depends on what your intent is we'll we'll take if if you've built something or put time and research into a project that you're passionate about um that's that's your project that's what you've built for the event sponsors may not consider it for prizes because it's not something that was built necessarily and metamask isn't sponsoring the event but there's by by no means should you not pursue that if that's something that you're passionate about because that's something that's also really necessary for the space to get better is people that are willing to dig into those specific niche topics like ui and ux um not just necessarily build the same thing that somebody's already built so that it is valuable to build this whole span of um types of projects uh jacob if you are still around i see you've had your hand up for quite a while uh hey guys not really nft related but i just kind of want to throw this idea out there so i was thinking about creating uh an incentivized balancer pool um a private one so that the weights of the assets can actually be adjusted up and down and then you would incentivize it by giving out some token of some kind and people could use that token to vote on the weights of the assets in the balance or pool like adjust them up and down i'm not exactly sure how valuable it is um this morning i registered permanentloss.finance i was thinking about calling them lost tokens and having it be like you put your pickle and your farm and like other questionable tokens in there and then have people vote up and down the weights of you know if you think your token's more valuable than pickle you want your the weight of pickle to be uh higher right than your token it would sort of be this gamified thing not sure if anyone would actually use it or not but i just thought it was kind of interesting idea to have like a balancer pool to adjust weights based on voting let's throw that out there anyone thinks it's interesting hit me up on discord i first off first off you mentioned farm and pickle which are probably two of the only tokens that actually have a business model and uh and are doing somewhat well uh but but the idea the idea is good um anything that's that's gamifiable i i know that i probably still have a couple of gems and noodles and sashimi's and i i don't even know want to know what what andy has his wallet hopefully you sold you sold everything or or you never had any um i i i actually think it's a great idea you can gamify that and i don't know if it's gonna end up being just that you know a game instead of something actually useful but the good thing is you have a lot of time to come up with either an interesting use case or if it ends up just being a food game uh i'm still i still love those they they give you a opening tie they give you a rush it's like oh i'm doing this i'm doing that uh no rock balls please no no pull two just disclaimers all around um i think it's still it's still okay to have fun with this kind of thing and you know there are whales who they don't mind they enjoy moving a large amount of uh of tokens or lp tokens from one farm to another and in the end that's still providing a service that you know their casinos in real life for a reason i think they're okay in our ecosystem too as long as you know they're labeled as such and you know people know what they're getting into yeah i'll echo that i think it's a really good idea i already have a bunch of ideas in my head of what could make that really cool if you want to message me and ask for more i i could spend a lot of time talking about that already i think it's really smart i'd recommend following through on those yeah jacob do you have any like uh a doc that you could share here where are you no i just thought of it this morning but i'll i'll put it in the um hack ideas uh channel and discord yeah definitely write it out a little bit more full and we could we could see um if anybody's interest are you working by yourself or do you have a team uh currently yeah so uh newbie uh uh solidity dev here so cool it's the best place to start everybody starts there at one point um yeah gamifying gamifying stuff is a really neat concept i mean markets are really just it's a financial game right and if you can pull elements of that into whatever you're building it will make it that much more compelling i think to new users to people who've been around a while they'll recognize the value there um i think i had promised the next slot to [Music] rohan rohan hello hey man how's it going hi uh hi i'm rohan so i'm a finally undergrad in majoring in computer science and just came across this hackathon so yeah decided to participate cool so yeah i've done pretty much i would say everything except for blockchain complete newbie in this domain and just straight out putting on my idea it was something similar to like a decentralized shopify something which i came across this protocol called the origin protocol and they have they basically have created a shopify in which there are no middlemen no middlemen involved and you can basically it saves saves a lot of money for the end and businessman who wants to set up their stores or something like that so in the i have i want to build something similar i want to like ask you guys what protocols would help me build a marketplace or some e-commerce store what what kind of protocols help me do that i will say that i always there are there's so much liquidity right now or almost so much liquidity right now that i would like to see an integration that would let me pay with any token um you know it's usually either die or youth or usdc which is totally fine but maybe i have some obscure token that i've been meaning to get rid of and but i don't want to sell and then i see something and it's like oh i would like to buy this and i could check you know you could have uh you could use uni swap or or balancer in the back end or an aggregator to let me buy with any token that i want and you know transparently you can swap it to the one that you want um or the one that the that the shop accepts and it is transparent to both and would be pretty cool thanks a lot so yeah that's actually interesting to have like kind of a token agnostic payment platform that would actually take taking anything rohan have you what have you looked into for you know you said you're you're pretty fresh to developing what sort of tutorials or um educational resources have you looked into yet maybe we can suggest some more so currently i'm just at zero i'm actually currently looking up for resources to just start off at perfect now now that i like like getting to know from you people what would be the best place to just start off and get my hands dirty with blockchain yeah let's do it let's do a quick lightning round each of the people suggest where you started um learning and what you would recommend today for somebody starting at zero adrian uh sure um my initial experience was with truffle uh so truffle suit i think it's a pretty nice package to get your hats around uh smart contracts initially in my three one thing that i suggest more up-to-date is the the builder no actually also from austin uh he has this series of video tutorials i'm trying to find if.build that's it right yeah yep i think this is a great great resource to learn also to try out in the sandbox and to get a few links to other resources that you can use to build your hack okay thanks a lot whoever wants to go next yeah i actually learned a lot of my i started getting into solidity back when crypto zombies was all the rage uh rip i think it's still i think people still use crypto zombies like does it i just tried to load the website and it wasn't loading for me oh she's not promising yeah crypto zombie was a zombie for a while right uh-oh yeah it won't load for me anymore um so honestly i'm not sure how much helpful insight i could actually give you here um but any any amount of current or like up-to-date replacements for crypto zombies that anybody's used recently i'm i don't know what you are you're on crypto zombies dot io because it is loading for me oh yeah it didn't load for me that was what i tried to i got as far as just getting to chapter one i'm posting in chat let me see if anybody else could get there you also have uh the ethernet ethernet yes it's another good one yeah yeah i got the crypto zombies that i oh yeah it's working for me not too i don't know must have just been something weird with my internet cool there's some good resources to start with scaffold.ed is another one from austin uh somebody could link that as well and there's another one um from i think it's paul from savelier uh create app um which is like a template for create react app but yeah probably also has a whole bunch of integrations already there um just you know forking the the yam the the yam finance ui the the yam v3 has a lot of improvements i think there's maybe a little bit tiresome after all of the all of the forks but it is some nice piece of code as well awesome i'm i'm just being reminded that i will have to copy out this chat and all the links that everybody's sharing here so we don't lose them but i'll make sure to do that after this call and then bring it into the discord um we are nearing the top of the hour or sorry i guess this would be the bottom of the hour um we can definitely keep going but i want to make sure we don't hold the panel is too much longer uh they've already given us an hour of their time and we are very grateful for that so if you got a drop that's totally fine um let me go through let's see what i need to hit before we lose people um okay so if you're here in this um in this session and you haven't fully applied i would do that immediately there's only a few days left where we'll still be accepting applications and kickoff is friday so make sure to do that right away after we get off of this call you may have gotten an acceptance email already so check your spam look around your email if you haven't found anything please reach out to any of these global team members on discord or twitter wherever you find us please reach out we want to make sure you get in um if you're trying to get teammates in uh remember that each person has to apply individually that's that's a really important part because there are individual profiles not team profiles you join a team after you apply and then once you've received that acceptance the only thing left to do is to stake this is .06 ether it's about 20 bucks um and we just hold that as sort of a deposit for you to complete the event and then you get it back once you submit at the end and i think that's all the logistics have to go over does anybody have to leave maybe we can go for a few more minutes no i'm good i have to be somewhere at four so i still have some time i can hang out all right cool yeah maybe we'll take a few more really quick um ryan hi everybody uh i've been loosely involved with ethereum for some years uh the only work i've done that you guys would recognize was uh i was the founder of predictions global the uh web new auger market explorer uh that was famous about two years ago we didn't update it for augur v2 because the new auger web app uh does it itself it just shows you the markets right away without a download my idea for eth online is uh kickstarter for ethereum uh sort of sewing the seeds for a generalized assurance contract framework that could be used by developer customers that would uh fork it and modify for their own purposes uh but then there would be a canonical sort of singleton deployment of the contracts that would have a uh a uh pragmatically decentralized front end like git coin uh so that uh you have folks who could come and make campaigns and there may be an affiliate fee system to promote campaigns uh so really taking that uh gofundme and kickstarter magic that's working in the web 2 world and uh bringing it into web3 and one thing that piqued my interest was that uh git coin recently said on twitter that they think insurance contracts or assurance contracts are complementary with the fundraising techniques they currently use so they could see some some lego gluing there where you would for example uh start with an insurance contract and then if it tips all the funds would would funnel into a particular grant or you know around robin a grant so that's really the vision we're looking to take the first baby steps towards so myself computer science background uh full stack react front end back end i'd like to do the product management uh where i'd i'd love to get some help is uh if anyone just wants to chat or uh has has thoughts that that'd be very helpful uh and then if you're interested to contribute really looking for help on the web design side in terms of sort of css and uh being mobile friendly and i'm a newbie solidity developer so i do intend to write and contribute to our smart contracts but uh i'm pretty new there so if anybody has experience there i'd love some help yeah uh kickstarter for ethereum been thinking about calling it east starter but uh yeah if you have a name send it over thanks i i think that's a really good idea and i have on on my to do to-do.txt on my desktop i have eth starter it's probably on the top five um and and every time i wonder why nobody is doing that because it first it's a great idea second it does most of what i said at the beginning that that you can grab a lot of lego pieces that are there right now and and come up with something good vitalik wrote about the icos last year or or a while ago and and the truth uh the tools are already there not only for what you said that for example if it reaches a tipping point then uh only then the money actually uh moves to a smart contract but once it moves then it can you know everybody who participated that is essentially a dow now that they can vote on how to distribute the money and and it could be okay an initial you know an initial payment for a few months to start building the product and then uh putting in milestones let's say you put in the project and you say okay it's going to take me a year so whatever you raise maybe half or a third is given out instantaneously and then the rest could keep be given out either monthly or once every two three months i i love the idea that's and even the name uh thank you ideas uh another aspect of this is that uh perhaps we can compete for some of the larger prizes from ethonline so for example the at-risk funds escrowed in the insurance contracts could uh get yield from from ave or yearn or someone else we could just do a sort of integration at that level and and that would you know qualify us at least for those categories yeah you could even utilize stuff like that um kind of as a payment stream or maybe maybe you could even have some avenues where you don't even have to actually contribute money you just contribute your yield and you say you know i want to use this product and i'm gonna i'm happy to put up ten thousand dollars and you get my you all the yield from that ten thousand dollars on ave loans or or why usd or something like that um i think there's a lot of different avenues you could take it that'd be really cool yeah instead of instead of making it a little more making it complicated where you have to deposit the base asset and then send it into ava you could just like you said andy deposit the a tokens or the y tokens and they're already yield bearing very cool great ideas all right well thanks guys appreciate the time um we're going to try to hit two more really quick again being sensitive of people's time uh stephane already had a drop so thank you stephane if you're listening we appreciate you coming on and sharing some ideas about meta transactions uh we're gonna go next to gokul alex and then vincennes bueller cooler hi uh thank you gokul here can you hear me yes uh i was uh in following tekku ethereum teku client from pegasus the the client is built on java i was thinking if i can uh do a idea a prototype on uh teku on stateless ethereum like implementing uh like there is this is one idea i wanted to do if it is possible uh i want to know if there is any reference uh implementations where people have tried the stateless ethereum client don't take deku second idea i've seen how formal verification of deposit contract is done for the beacon chain so uh on that line i want to do something on deposit contract uh will it be a very it will be useful for uh any of the exchanges like lopering or so that's my second question if i work on formal verification of deposit contract will it serve any practical purpose for exchanges um i think the deposit contract is already formally verified uh what do you mean by that's right that's right yes so i want to do something further on it will it be useful for exchanges if i work on deposit contract i think i'd have i'd have to see this written out a little bit because i don't know exactly where your head is at um with the scope of the project okay and the second question is will this formal verification be useful for stable uh coins and other use cases where like where there is lot of assumptions involved when we are dealing with the data right when you are dealing with the or uh i would like to know the scope of formal verification in deep defy projects like will it be useful for stable coin contracts or will it be useful for prediction markets where oracles are involved i'll let some of the developers who've worked with oracle's talk about that i unless you already are very well versed in formal verification in the first place i would highly recommend reconsidering um because we do it at maker and it's really hard it's the most complex thing that i've ever done on ethereum yeah can i ask you to interrupt why have we chosen daphne over already i've seen runtime verification has done on coke based proofs and i i was just seeing a video on daphne is there a advantage of daphne over uh coke honestly i don't know i'm definitely not a formal verification expert okay okay and uh at maker there is no sorry uh there is no use of um of daphne we um well uh the project uses uh k oh okay nice okay yep um kvm yeah right so could you please tell me is there a practical uh business scope if you do formal verification for stable coins and prediction markets will it be useful for the industry i would one thing that i would like to see yes is some kind of some kind of market for this um a way to build a back end that you know takes by code random byte code and runs it against a set of proofs and so that you can you can ensure via formal verification for example that i don't know if i send if i send a transaction to x contract and i give you the byte code that there won't be any state changes besides what i expect right for example that i don't know my my token balance increases by x or decreases by x but that that is all that is going to happen for example yeah i do think that there is a business case for it thank you thank you so will there be any advice like benefit if we give a is there possible to give formal verification of randomness i got the point that we can give formal verification of byte code but is there a way we can give formal verification of randomness used in beacon chain or in delay functions you mean the like the vdfs yeah vdf from what i understand that still is heavy in the research phase so they might potentially find use for it um i don't know if my intuition tells me that the scope for a hackathon is probably too big for a formal verification project or something involving pdfs but i'd definitely like to hear more about your deposit contract idea because i i think i understand it but i just want to see it in writing before i respond sure send it on send it on discord yeah i'll send it can i ask i think i forgot the teku can somebody advise me what is the current engineering uh like roadmap for teku so that if i can give second attempt on tekku so this is this is a another big project stateless ethereum is um would be a pretty significant change to how clients are architected and the way state is passed around the network so again this might not be the best fit for a hackathon but if you want to start a project by all means go ahead um i would have to refresh my memory on where the tekku team is with stateless ethereum i know that uh i think pegasus has some team or some team members that are working on it so maybe i could poke around and try and find some resources for you but definitely message me on discord thank you thank you we'll do that i was thinking if i can containerize teku like using some of the java concurrency based models you know i can implement actor model and create micro services breaking down teku into individual components i went through the github repo of uh tekku there are it's broken down but not sure if deku is uh made into a micro service level uh implementation seems like it is still a monolith i'm not sure if my judgment may be wrong you may be right i'm not sure there were the people that can answer that yeah yeah i would definitely i'll try to link you up with some of the teku maintainers and get you more information on that but um for now we gotta we do have to wrap up uh this this session i know ventions we promised you to go if you could really really quickly just summarize your idea maybe we'll get a few thoughts on it yeah quick fine um this panel's been pretty awesome so i want to throw this in so background on me uh i'm an energy engineer by training and for me this is all about just building tools that can solve our problems on balancing out electric microgrids and so for us what's important is you know building settlement on our back end that can operate based off real world data feed that's being fed in and from my experience so far the oracle feed-in doesn't seem very secure it seems like that's sort of still sort of broken done project by project but there's also firms that are entirely dedicated to oracle's so my experience one of my favorite products for building applications was the stuff that they're building at uh uh play um play project um where you can actually visualize it and you can see on their play editor sort of an ide for connecting up different modules using lines um and that was something i really appreciated someone building an app or a dap for a real world application without having to build a whole development team so i would like to see like an oracle sandboxing interface um that can handle organization around how oracles are plugged into smart contracts uh shows you know methods for finding for choosing and then for using those oracles to feed into your into your back end um of your dap um i'm actually working also someone right now who's trying to publish a book and they want to tokenize you know the access to publishing rights um so that would also be tracking um you know sales so right now we're already just trying to do that and that's for a crypto uh economic um book that's being published to write about the stuff so we decided to try it out and just test how oracles can be fed into this as well and i think this is something where various projects can sort of work together and come to this once it's available and offer you know feedback and curation efforts towards curating proper oracle's a data feed that they've worked with before on so that people that come in later to build adapt can gain that experience up ahead of time and actually see it in visualizations the lines can have different thickness and different coloring according to risk associated with it according to different elements of that data feed oracle so i think this could help to really standardize it for people who are building dapps that are not really familiar with feeding in data into a smart contract that if that doesn't work out right like that's going to be your weakest point of security and for someone like us that's trying to balance out you know an electric microgrid and there's settlements on the back and if the settlements don't work anymore then the grid goes down we can't allow for that to happen so we can't really move this onto a chain until that kind of thing is fixed cool mariano do you want to wrap the session with your response yeah uh sure i would say um i i heard like almost i think four different things um electrical grid oracles some kind of ui for composing almost legos and then even publishing platform so i would say that for something like a hackathon to uh try to whittle it down a little bit to something more manageable if if if you can manage everything that that of course would be amazing but um from what from what i heard i i heard like four different industries almost um which of course can go together but i don't know if you're maybe taking on a lot for you know three no it's it's not we're not bringing the electric grid stuff into this um this is more something that as we're building our projects you know that's that's what i work on in my day job um this is something that if this tool were available we would benefit from it we know that other people that are trying to build things similar to us would benefit from it really greatly yeah uh the publishing book also you know same same uh category this isn't this would be plugged into it this is more an interface or a project that could be there an app that you can do some sandboxing with oracle data on different sources oh okay so in that case it would be mostly the plugging in oracle data uh almost visually like you said you know then in that case i think it's a good idea i like it just yeah for me it'd be important that there be you know contribution from both firms focused on oracles and dapps that you know a lot more built out have teams that are a lot more built out that can contribute towards both curation weighing a volatility and risk around the data um for me that'd be more valuable even than the visualization visualization you know that's not a huge thing i don't think yeah um really quick just to wrap up i think you should check out there's a couple no code things that come to mind the eth.build sandbox which adrian linked in the chat as well as there's a couple other ones i think gelato i believe gelato has some no code elements um i might be thinking of a different one um but yeah unfortunately we do have to wrap here we have the next session in a little bit more than 10 minutes i want to thank everybody for coming sharing their ideas and just generally talking about the hackathon what they're going to build and especially to mariano stefan andy and adrian it's just been huge really productive session and um looking forward to what people do with these ideas that we've kind of workshopped here and if you weren't able to share your idea or are still thinking of something that you'd like to pitch put it into the discord into the hack ideas channel and somebody will be sure to respond to you um one last thing to mention is that we do have the team formation call tomorrow at 2 30 so if you're looking for an additional teammate or a team to join please make sure to join that session we should be sending out the invites for that uh this afternoon sometime all right thank you again huge thanks to the panelists um looking forward to what people build yep thank you good luck everybody
