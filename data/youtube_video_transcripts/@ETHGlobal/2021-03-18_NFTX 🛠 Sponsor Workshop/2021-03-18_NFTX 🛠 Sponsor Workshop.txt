hi everyone all right so hi run welcome uh to the nftx um workshop with alex gosman um we will be i'll be letting him take over in a second but i want to remind you that if you have not taken done your staking yet for the event please do it as soon as possible so that you can actually participate as a hacker um for any question you may have please post them in the chat and alex will review them as we go we will also have a little bit of time if you want to voice your question at the end and um that's pretty much it so i'll let you take it over alex cool uh hi everyone i'm alex gausman uh founder of nftx and uh i don't have a big presentation plan so i'm just sort of gonna wing this and if anyone has questions when i'm done i'm happy to answer them uh to give you a quick overview on nftx for those of you that don't know um sorry just a sec close discord uh for those of you that don't know um nftx is uh an open org and uh protocol for creating nft index funds on ethereum these index funds are basically managed as vaults so basically how the contract works is that every vault is linked to an erc20 token and then also an asset and in most cases the asset is in nft um and usually in erc 721 and then there's like a one-to-one correlation between these two tokens so when you deposit one of the asset you get to mint one of the fund token and then this way you know we have funds like for instance punk basic which is backed by crypto punks and then we also have funds like glyph which is backed by autoglyphs and there's always this one-to-one correlation and it's also possible to make targeted funds that are you know directly focused on specific subsets of nfts for example we have a punk zombie fund uh which is specifically focused on zombie crypto punks and the way that we do that right now is basically it's it's just like the punk basic fund you know it's connected to the crypto punk's address and it's connected to its own fun token the punk zombie token but then we also add a specific list of token ids and that's called like the eligibility allow list and so you you put specific token ids and you say these are the only ones that are ever allowed into this fund um in the future we're hoping to add metadata links um because right now of course it's kind of gas intensive and just kind of a pain in the butt to have to do it that way but for now yeah that's the best way we can recommend in terms of our actual contracts here let me let me just share my screen all right so um in terms of the actual contracts um we've done a number of upgrades since we launched a few months ago and the the actual nftx contract is upgradable so we have uh version two version three version four version five version six and now version seven and these have all been minor upgrades along the way um and we you know we um we recommend anyone if you want to come on to our github and to check that out uh but we also now have some documentation i believe yeah on our on our docs page that will help you kind of run through all this and see the interfaces so yeah like i said i don't really have a big presentation planned here but um i'm wondering does anyone have questions yet or or should i keep jabbering away for a bit i'd be curious about a walkthrough just like you know like i'm reading the docs and creating a portfolio but like any pitfalls yeah okay for sure so um in terms of the actual product um how it works you just come to the main website oh sorry i forgot to share my screen one sec i see a question here all right okay cool all right so yeah i'll um i guess i'll walk you guys through actually making a fund so we can see how that's done there now let me go to openc so let's do a squiggle find even though i've already made one you can do another one here and uh just so everyone knows what's happening so i have a squiggle so first of all um what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to this contract address and check out the contract i'm pretty sure it's 7 21. i'll just make sure yeah it is um and then i go to nftx i will get our contract address so you can make you can make funds in the front end but i will show you how to do it through etherscan just since that kind of shows how it's actually working so you'll go to it it runs as a proxy so like right now you'll go to write as proxy and then there's two create vault functions um the first one's been deprecated the first one has three parameters the second one should have four parameters um the second one is the one that we're using nowadays so for this fund i would name it squiggle let's say two and then squiggle two um for the asset address i am gonna put this contract address which is the art blocks contract oh one thing actually sorry i'm just gonna check something because there's another art blocks contract as well [Music] let me see ringer ah okay um okay sorry one second okay so yeah okay that's what i thought there's two are different art blocks contracts um so no worries okay this is the one we want to use so what we do is we take that asset address and then we go back to etherscan right here acid address um here we're going to put false d2 volts are so like we only have one d2 vault right now and that's the punk vault and basically that's like a more complex fault which is like an index fund and it runs on balancer and combines multiple tokens into one we have some more information on our docs about that and feel free to ask us but for most people i imagine you put false here most of our vaults are d1 and then connect so i'm going to make that super expensive okay so that's made um then the next part which is a little tough is figuring out which fault id it is we have another contract called xstore and that basically stores all the contract data like the state so you can go to that one and you click on events and it will show that just now uh a vault was created new vault added and it's vault 54. so we'll just remember that then over here so we go back to the squiggle that i originally wanted to start to put in the vault in so at this point the vault's been created um and it's like it's meant it's in a managed state right now and we'll finalize it in a second um and it takes a second to show up on the front end but well not a second it takes about 10 minutes so that'll show up there in a little bit and the way that we would get to that is we would just go it's like right now you know last fund click on one of these that's 47 i think we said this one is 54. so we go 54 here i mean it's not going to show up quite yet but that's where we'll be in a second the next step then is we want to mint an item normally again we could do this through the front end but that's going to take 10 minutes so what we'll do is we figure out what the token idea is here 4461 copy that then we go to this art blocks contract write contract and we're going to approve token id 4461 to the nftx proxy contract here and connect all right so that's approved now we're going to mint it uh here's the mint function so the first uh the first parameter is how much ether we're sending and that'll just be zero uh vault id 54 nft ids so we had that a second ago four four six one and we put that around with square brackets just because it's an array and then the d2 amount is also zero because this is not a d2 fund and then we write super expensive and we can check if this is up yet i doubt it okey-doke so that went through um that should show up on the events as well so on the xdoor events um yeah it says holdings added so basically it says that this you know this item four four six one has been added to the vault uh 54 um and we're still the manager so what it means when you're the managers you have you have some abilities to like just change certain things um like fees and stuff so normally like after the fund is set up the best thing to do is to finalize it and you just go to finalize vault 54. and that just gives up your management control now if we had wanted to like add a specific allow list or like eligibilities we would have done that before we gave up finalization and what you would do then is there's a there's a function called negate set negate eligibility so when the eligibility is negated it acts as a deny list and when it's not negated it acts as an allow list when the vault is created it gets automatically set to true which means it is negated and that way since the list is empty it means that all token ids are allowable but yeah if you wanted to like so if we had been making like the punk zombie fund what we would have done is after we made the vault we would have gone to set negate eligibility we would have set that to false and then we would have gone to set is eligible we would have put 54 and then here you know you'd put each one of your token ids whatever they are and then you'd set that to true and then you do that before you finalize but okay so that's finalized let's see hopefully it's up no it'll probably be a bit longer but yeah the next thing you could do now is if you want to redeem an item so like we will i'm pretty sure here let me check um i'm pretty sure we will i will have one token of this now so like if we go to the even though the front end's not up yet we can still check some of this data so what uh what i'll do the x token is what we call like the fun token the erc20 um so here it's like if we check at that event when the when the vault was created this is the token that it created and see it's called squiggle 2 so if i and if i check if i check this token if i check holders see a quantity of 1 and then i'm the that's me so that's me i'm the only holder with the quantity of one right now uh so then you know check one more time ah thought we had it okay um i'll do it through here so then what i will do if i want to redeem an item first i have to approve this right contract so first thing i have to do is i'm going to approve sending this over here extender node okay i'll get this one queued up so the redeem is pretty straightforward um put zero for the ether vault id 54 the amount is just one um because that's like the amount of nfts that we're going to be redeeming it's approved so i'm going to send that and then obviously when i redeem this it's going to give me the only item which is in the vault right now normally when when items get picked during the redemption i mean while always it is a random selection but in this case since there's only one item it will obviously be that one and then once that goes through again you know you can check that in the extort contract on the events and i doubt it's up yet but yeah the idea is after like 10 minutes or maybe a little bit longer the fund will show up here and you can you can get to it by typing in that specific or specific vault id um okay so i think that sort of gives a run through and ate up a bit more time let me see if anyone has questions um yeah please feel free to ask any question thank you for your your presentation and sorry if that was like put anyone to sleep no no no um thanks uh is there anyone who has more questions on this please please uh write them in the comments or um feel free to take the mic so yeah to answer kiba here um yeah anyone's able to create uh an nft fund um one thing that's one thing that's kind of cool that some people might want to explore so like the the idea of the managed vault um kind of came from balancer like when you create a balancer pool at first there's like a manager and that person kind of gives up management so then we had like a similar idea that we would do the same thing the cool thing with that model is that it's actually possible to transfer management uh to another smart contract and so that's kind of how balance or smart pools work is that you have you create a pool and you're the manager but instead of saying you know what i'll just give up management you say i'm gonna make this other smart contract manager and then all of a sudden you have what's like basically a smart pool because you've given this other contract privilege so yeah if that's something that somebody wanted to work on for nftx it no one's done it yet but it could be a cool idea sorry just thought of that but yeah thank you everyone for the compliments i think that's most the questions um anything else a quick question is um is it a one nft contract per vault it is yeah um and that's something we we would like to change in the future but yeah it's just one for now do you mind them directly into the vault or can you mint them first and then transfer them into the vault no you meant them directly um although there is one um there is another function um called a mint request and basically so like right now we have these funds which are their targeted funds uh but some of them are really big so the kitty the uh the cryptokitties generation zero fund for instance there's like 40 000 generation zero kitties which is way too much for us to add to the actual list and we don't have metadata yet so there is a function called request mint and basically what someone can do is they come to the vault and they they realize that the token id that they want to mint it hasn't been added yet but that it should be allowed so that they can request a mint and that kind of like locks up their kitty and then our dao comes along and says okay yeah we approve this meant and then that nft goes into the vault and they get their token uh it's kind of a cumbersome mechanism that we're hoping to move away from but that is one other feature that we still have so is it minting a new one or is it like locking the old one in the vault so it's just kind of doing the first half of the mint operation um so like you know a mint is is kind of two parts it's like i give my nft and i get the token back so if someone wants to come along and they want a mint but that their token hasn't been allowed yet because it's like a really big fault they can just do the first half and basically say here i'll give you the kitty and then giving my token back when you approve it and if it doesn't get approved then they just get their nft back it's it's really not a feature that i recommend most people use we're hoping to move away from it so we should just so we should make a new like nfp contract and mint tokens and mint like new nfts directly into a new fund is that right yeah yeah um no it's best to yeah create new vaults and to actually yeah then uh send the items in and get the tokens um some other questions here yeah so we are actually hoping to move more into like so right now funds are um basically like a holder product for people that want exposure but we are realizing that a lot of people would like to create like curated funds sort of um like sort of like an influencer could come along and say hey i'd like to make a fund of all my favorite nfts um so we are hoping to move in that direction more again it's not something that like we really have ready yet and we're kind of in the middle of transferring to a version two um but yeah the best ways that people could kind of extend the protocol right now would be to try and do like a a smart vault type thing probably by proxing management to another contract or um there's also really cool things you can do with like lending markets uh with nfts and nft tokens oracle yeah and they yeah there's definitely cool things you could do as well with hooking up to oracle's um that we haven't actually tried yet does do we need a safety module no i don't think we do we're not like we're always fully backed um so there shouldn't be any problem like that unless we try and extend our reserves more in the future so yeah things that i think that would be cool um a landing market is something that i've always really liked the idea of so one thing that's really cool about the our funds like the punk basic fund um is that it it can be lent to any so if i have a if i have a crypto punk and i want to get a punk basic loan what i could do is i can lock up my crypto punk and i can get you know one punk basic in return we don't have that yet but i've always thought that would be like a really cool use case um because basically it's perfect collateral right if i if i lock up a crypto punk that crypto punk can always be used to mint one punk basic no matter what um it's just that i want the liquidity of the punk basic so it'd be cool if someone like like right now if i want a punk basic i actually have to give ownership of my crypto punk away but i've always thought that someone could build a protocol on top of nftx basically that says hey if you what if you don't want to give your crypto puck away what if you want to keep it sort of like keeping your each when you make die that's more of like a lending use case and that's something that could happen on top and then it kind of becomes like a pawn shop right you can come here with your nfts and you can say hey hold on to my nfts i'd like to get some liquidity you pay a small fee type of thing it's yeah it's one use case i've always really hoped that someone would go after but it's not super easy to do in a weekend but that would be cool hey alex hi so on that particular point um are there any mechanisms for um separating sort of if you if you're going to do a lending scenario like that there's a concept of holding the title to an object which means like you're the you're the uh account or contract that can change ownership which is one thing and then control of the uh asset which is the ability to say um set there is a the resolver for an ens domain or maybe breed a cryptic idea although i'm not too too sure how that works but this idea of sort of like having title and then a sort of which is ultimate uh control um versus sort of possession which is immediate control is there anything like that or how is there a way to log into a game like god's unchanged if the tokens owned by a smart contract and you want to log in to prove your own own that item there's nothing there's nothing that i know of yet that does that and there's nothing that we have in our protocol but it's definitely something that like we're really interested in and another reason is just because we see nfts as being like becoming productive assets right so like we have an aximistic vault um and we would really like it in the future if like we could say hey let's put like some sort of somebody in charge of this fault and put those axes to use right get them breeding get them battling they'd still be in the vault um you know if someone had an aximistic token they would still have a right to one mystic axe at any point um but yeah in the in you know in the meantime like somebody um we could put someone in charge of kind of managing them without actually having ownership and i think that's kind of what you're getting at um so it's it's not yeah it's not something that we have yet i think that that's i think it's a really cool um concept another thing i'll just throw out here i'll put out there as well and i probably shouldn't be saying this but i'll say it anyways um is that as much as i'd love people to build onto nftx since we are kind of in the middle of like a version one to a version two you know it could just make sense for some of you hackers to literally just look at our contract uh like the the basic functionality is very simple you know you have this vault you you keep track of the nfts and you keep track of the balances in the airstrike 20s like if people wanted to like fork our original contract just keep the really basic functionality but then start adding new cool features in there like you know having a vault manager or something like that i think that would be really cool you know it's not something that we could leverage right away but it's it's great having like mvps like that so yeah it's something to consider if people are thinking about that sort of thing thank you alex yeah yeah i hope that was all right yeah i want to cut their question um yeah thank you everybody we're running a bit over time so um a big thank you for this presentation and everything all the questions that came in if you do want to stay in touch with nftx or have more questions for alex please find him in the sponsor channel that you all have access to if you're part of this hackathon in our discord channel and we will all see you on discord yeah thank you so much you
