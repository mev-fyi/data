foreign [Music] let's get started um hi everyone my name is Arissa and I am the co-founder and CEO of Sega Finance Sega is a decentralized exotic options protocol and we have created smart contracts that handle exotic options which are conditional option statements and so we'll go a little more into what our products are but today the topic is building blocks of D5 derivatives this is a super loaded topic and you know I think there's so much that I can go into about this and I'm really really excited to talk about this with you today so the thesis that I want to share with everyone today is this key takeaway that I believe defy derivatives will drive institutional adoption and this is critical for the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem what does that mean so first how has crypto grown in the last 15 years of its existence and what are derivatives and what are D Phi derivatives there's been no denial that in the last few years there's a capital Market that has formed around blockchain technology I think what people don't realize is that we have literally increased by almost 700 times since 2019 in terms of our Market size for everything that is on chain this is a fascinating metric because it just shows that you know as of June of 2022 the size of on-chain markets was essentially the size of a small emerging markets in traditional Finance or the size of a small Commodities Market in traditional finance and so it is very much the size of a legitimate Capital Market that requires um more you know institutional notice more you know professionalism I think this is something that you know people don't realize like Defy is a very big Market but people don't realize this because it is a small dot compared to a traditional Market we can see here that in traditional Finance when you look at the market capitalization it is over a hundred trillion dollars whereas defy even at its height was at 77 billion dollars so you can see that you know even though defy itself is the size of a small emerging market or a small Commodities Market we are very very small and we're at the cusp of this large growth and super super excited to see what is going to drive this large growth I think people don't realize this um and you know people in DFI I'm sure notices this but people outside of D5 I think often conflate the timeline of D5 with the timeline of BTC um BTC and you know blockchain technology has been around for 15 years so it's been around I mean it's still really early but it's been around for a while D5 has only really been around for the last five years and since early adoption it's only been like three years maybe even less than that and so really we're talking about Innovation that has happened at a third of the timeline of the entire blockchain history I think for how long D5 has existed the innovations that we've made in this space is fascinating and I think it also shows that you know the issues that we talk about in defy it's I mean I would almost say it's natural that we have these issues because we are so so early and I think what will really trigger the massive growth of Defy is institutional adoption so much of over 90 percent of existing usage in D5 is actually retail and there's still a very small number of Institutions willing to invest in defy and D5 products and I'll go more into what the problems are in the space but you know we need to bring in institutional adoption for Mass adoption and you can see that in the history of BTC the cusp of institutional adoption was also the cusp of a large bull market cycle that really created the foundation of where BTC is trading today so BTC for instance started in 2008 but in 2013 the very first institutional asset manager was formed does anyone know the name of this First Institutional asset manager anyone well so it was uh it was Pantera capital and you know they're one of our investors and they were the very first institution that actually said um all of their Investments were going to be in blockchain asset classes and in 2013 um between 2013 2016 there was a very large cycle of the rise of a BTC price and then in 2016 the cabinet of Japan was one of the first developed economies to actually recognize BTC as a potential real money this again was the cusp of institutional adoption and as all of you may know from 2016 to 2018 there was another very large market movement and a very large adoption cycle that now created BTC as a very major currency in the world and this has helped establish BTC as something that um you know every country every regulatory entity and you know every institution talks about today so how does this translate into defy and what can we do in order to make something similar to this happen in D5 where we see signs of institutional adoption and I think it's D5 derivatives so for all of you here today you might not be as familiar with D5 derivatives so I'll go a little more into what are derivatives and how does that translate into D5 and then later in my talk I'll talk about how this is going to impact institutional adoption so in the purest form derivatives are all about managing risks I put a farmer here because the very first use case of a derivatives contract was actually in agriculture farmers were worried about their crop yield every year because of a very volatile environment that was affected by weather and so the very first form of a derivative contract was actually something that said okay I think the weather this year is looking bad so I want to hedge the risk of you know bad weather and bad yield through having a contract with someone who is willing to insure my crops so it's all about managing risks some can say it's insurance and what a derivative is is it is actually not the underlying asset but it's a contract that bets on the behavior of the underlying assets so here we have different asset classes like stocks bonds and crypto and I put dotted lines around these boxes because this dotted line is what represents a derivative it is a wrapped contract in outside an asset class and so as an issuer or a buyer of the derivative you actually do not need to hold the underlying asset it is a contract between two parties so an example of this contract in this Farmer's case is you know the buyer of the contract says Hey I want to have the choice of receiving a hundred dollars for my apples in the next 27 days if I can't Harvest and you know if the apples do Harvest then they want the option of not actually having to exercise this contract on the other hand we have this issuer who thinks okay um they're probably going to be able to harvest but I can get 20 up front so they're like okay pay me 20 right now and I can give you that choice so this contract that helps establish this insurance is actually called a derivative and you know both of these people are basically Bound by this contract and in defy this happens on a smart contract So In traditional finance that insurance happens on a piece of paper and then there's a value of the contract which is the twenty dollars that the issuer mentioned and in the hundred dollars is the payout so in devices the contract between the two parties is a tokenized smart contract that is worth twenty dollars and then if certain events happen the buyer of this contract can redeem a hundred dollars within 27 days so that was like D5 derivatives in a nutshell and this is something that is still very up and coming within the D5 ecosystem I think D5 derivatives is a very natural evolution in the market and it is imperative that this happens in the next few years any Capital Market forms from an asset creation so in the case of defy the last talk was someone from makerdale and you know maker was one of the D5 protocols that created the first type of decentralized asset which um you know in their case was a stable coin and then from an asset creation there's a spot market so spot markets I'm sure all of you are familiar you know uniswap um whatnot they created amms they created clubs they create exchanges and then there's a lending market so money markets form on top of spot markets because people start wanting to borrow and people start wanting to lend when they have multiple Assets in their bags so there's a lending Market that forms and then based on a lending Market there's something called an interest rate and this interest rate creates a foundation for more products to form on top of it like a Futures Market that allows users to take on Leverage and on top of a Futures Market where you take uh linear leverage you can take an options Market which creates a non-linear position for how you want to express your view in the market I know I went through this pretty fast but the tldr is Defy is a capital Market that has formed and you can't ignore it there is a Futures market and an options Market that is forming in D5 and it is going to be very very big so in order to become very big we need institutional adoption and the thesis today is that I actually think with all the builders here if you build more D5 derivative protocols it will actually lead to more institutional adoption so it's not that Institute adoption will bring D5 derivatives but I actually believe that the more D Phi derivative protocols that you build in this space the more institutional adoption we will have in our markets and I think this because institutions in order to enter Capital markets need certain capabilities and these capabilities are currently either fully there not really there or somewhat there in D5 and you know the the categories are a bit um unclean um but I think the first benefit or the first capability is actually having a benefit and utility in the products and for institutional investors benefit and utility means good returns the second one is Supply and liquidity so for institutional investors they need to be able to invest a large amount in positions but right now D5 Market is still 77 billion dollars at most so it's really hard for institutional investors that want to take like a billion dollars in position because they'll be taking more than one percent of the market share so how do we increase the supply how do we increase the liquidity I think D5 derivatives is going to be able to answer this question and then the third part is trust and safety obviously it's very different investing a couple of hundred dollars out of your own wallet versus investing a couple of hundred million dollars out of a wallet that has a lot of stakeholders so how do we make sure that there is more trust and safety in the market so that institutional investors want to invest I actually think that by building defy derivatives we can build more trust and safety in defy and lastly it's about lower cost of operations right now we all talk about the philosophy and the love for D5 mentioning that by implementing more defy we're able to create accessibility and transparency all these very beautiful stories but when you look at gas costs it's pretty expensive and the argument here is that by building more defy derivatives we're actually able to optimize for costs in the market all of these are pretty interesting points so I'm gonna go through them one by one the first is benefit and utility so I mentioned that for institutional investors benefit and utility means High returns and making money what I think is that in current D5 ecosystem the returns are sometimes a bit fluffy I'm a huge I talk a lot online about this but for instance um I think V tokenomics is uh is very hard to actually create value and I think with the existing spot market and a lack of a strong money market and you know a very small options Market it's been very hard for people to find attractive yields and high yields don't actually mean attractive yields because a lot of high yields are very fluffy and defy and so by combining D5 derivatives and by combining options where there's actually a lot more opportunities and information that could allow for more flexible views in the market you're actually able to drive a much uh higher real return that is attractive for investors so I think that is a key benefit for D5 derivatives that will attract institutional investors and then the second Ben the second part is better trading mechanisms so with D5 derivatives you can actually Implement things like much more efficient liquidation mechanisms which previously in DFI were deemed very hard to implement so for instance in leverage in D5 existing markets require either over collateralization or dependency on external liquidity sourcing and this is super Capital inefficient because uh for instance you know you're trying to leverage but you're still putting in locking up your asset into the platform for the duration of your trade so like essentially like you're just putting in all of your assets there and taking on Leverage with like your own account or you are dependent on LPS which obviously makes the protocol not very scalable and as more leveraged protocols form or as more perpet access form there's fragmentation of liquidity so it becomes harder and harder to leverage as much as you want um with options you can actually create liquidation mechanisms for instance where you can create spreads of uh say put options and by having a put spread you can actually create a baseline of where you get liquidated so that in the contract in the smart contract there is a determined point a determined price point in which your returns become zero and it is deemed on the smart contract that you'll get liquidated at this point so you actually do not need to over collateralize or you do not need to Source liquidity from an externally state capital this is a super interesting idea for instance because then for the same 100 usdc that you were putting in and then you know trying to figure out liquidity uh through like you know through external liquid uh external stickers to leverage your position um the same 100 usdc can take on Leverage without this external dependency um and you know your 100 US dollars is the collateral for a position that is worth 500 US dollars um and then the third part is flexible views on the market so in spot markets you can only really bet up or down which honestly at a certain point for institutional investors this is um no longer very interesting especially in a market where volatility becomes lower as the market matures investors want there to be ways to show their views on the market not just up or down but for instance is it going sideways is it going to have higher volatility um you know you can use derivatives to show views that are not just directional and this will allow for institutional investors to take on um a much more interesting view that will allow for the market to mature faster so um all of these benefits are driven through D5 derivatives that could lead to institutional adoption the second is Supply and liquidity this is actually a bit more of a chicken and egg issue but I believe that by creating more defy derivatives protocols you're creating more liquidity in the market not just for D5 derivatives but also for the layers below like money markets um as well as spot as well as asset creation so when you trade an option for instance um you're buying a call there's a market maker or you know an individual maker whoever who is selling the call in order to hedge out that position as a maker because you know as a taker you want to take on that position but as a maker you're trying to neutralize that position you actually need to do something called a hedge where you buy the underlying if you're selling a call and then you also want to buy some volatility so that you're hedging out the Vega and this type of hedging requires more it brings up more demand in the market and so by creating more defy derivatives and tokenized derivative assets it actually will lead to more demand and supply of the spot markets and money markets through these Hedges and also something called access which are like all the positions that you hold it also creates more secondary markets of your tokenized assets um and then and that leads to more derivatives because people will then have a larger position that they want to hedge through having derivatives and then they'll hedge that derivative by having like by having more liquidity of non-derivative assets and so it just becomes this flywheel of creating more and more volume in the market so like creating D5 derivative protocols will actually increase the volume of every part of D5 and that is the key to creating the large Supply that institutional investors will want in order to come into the market the third part is trust and safety so it's very different running a 10 million dollar business out of your bedroom versus dealing with a 10 billion dollar fund that you have a lot of stakeholders in so my thesis here is that by building defy derivatives protocols you're actually able to build more transparency of flows you're able to help create more uh your help suit you're able to help de-risk counterparty credit risks and you're also able to help with things like institutional custody and a lot of this goes back to the example I mentioned about how derivatives can actually serve as an insurance and insurance brings trust and safety so for instance um tokenized derivatives if you are able to create single positions in a tokenized derivative you're able to look at the flow of funds inside the contract and that creates more transparency which creates a sense of safety for these institutional investors so you're not just investing into something that you don't know what's going on about and then the second part is counterparty credit risk so you know a lot of people are working on this right now but defy derivatives such as credit derivatives are currently working on on-chain identity issues that helps actually look into um you know how credible uh credible like your counterparty is and so these types of credit derivative Protocols are actually helping to create ratings and limits of uh different wallets that you're interacting with and the more credit ratings and safety measures that are being put in place that allows you to understand who you're trading with who the other position in your smart contract is that creates a knowledge base that also helps create this trust and safety and so you know in the next couple of years as this D5 Market matures more these derivative Protocols are actually helping to create a database of everyone's trustability that is also going to serve as a data point for institutional investors and then lastly institutional custody is something I'm really interested about and there's not a lot of this uh existing in the DFI markets today but I think defy derivatives uh will do a lot for institutional custody so for those of you who don't know what custody means um you know if you're running like a 10 billion dollar protocol um or a 10 billion dollar fund you actually can't have a single person like deploying all 10 billion dollars so what happens is there's like you know smaller funds underneath that maybe allocate like two billion dollars each and underneath there's like you know even smaller funds that are allocating like say uh 500 million dollars each and so there's this whole notion of people who are um allocating the funds for dislike main uh 10 billion dollar fund um and these uh these funds will have to have custody of the assets um the issue with custody is that it could get lost it's scary like you know the the funds uh if you give it to someone that you don't know to face of like you don't know where it's gonna go but by implementing derivative protocols you're able to do things like insure against the chance that a custodian of the assets loses the funds for instance and so again this leads to this notion of trust and safety where creating more derivatives that are able to ensure against loss of funds loss of assets it helps institutional investors feel safer about deploying their large sum of money and then lastly my thesis is that D5 derivatives will help optimize and reduce cost of all operations in D Phi this is kind of similar to the trust and safety portion but for instance gas optimization maybe the engineers over here will be able to talk about this a lot better than I can but by having D5 derivatives you're actually able to create um two-sided liquidity what that means is you know there's more uh there's a lot of buyers and there's a lot of sellers in the market but oftentimes in a spot Market it could really bias towards One Direction and and what that creates is you know when there's a very high concentration in One Direction it increases the cost um and increases the communication cost to the blockchain uh which could increase the gas price but if we are able to find ways to match orders that um you know happens before uh that before everything um goes uh gets written in a transactions um that could optimize your gas fee which can reduce the total cost of operation and then the second part is on team pricing so right now um you know on-time pricing is extremely complex there's a lot of mechanisms that are being put into exchanges in order to figure out like what the right price of an asset is um and what I actually think is through having uh derivatives the price of derivatives actually increased data points of what the right price of the underlying asset is and so it creates More Sample sizes and basically with the availability of a D5 derivative asset data you are able to create um you know a better pricing system that should also lower the cost in the long run and then the last is protocol fees I mean we also take fees on all the transactions that happen on our platform so you know this is something that you know I hope will reduce as time goes by type I think D5 derivatives for instance create real high yields that was like one of my first points by creating real high yields there's a lot of Revenue potential that happens just with the positions so protocols should be able to make money by taking on these positions rather than taking on a large fee from the trades itself from the users and so with the emergence of D5 derivatives and real high yields my thesis is that it will actually reduce the fee that is currently being imposed on the users in D5 protocols that again will make all of this opportunity attractive for institutional investors and so actually yeah retail is a lot less sensitive to fees than institutional investors so cost optimization is a pretty big trigger and with the emergence of more D5 derivative protocols we're able to optimize for gas get better prices and then we can also reduce protocol fees so that was a lot of reasons why I think building D5 derivatives will help bring in institutional adoption which is the key for the growth of the entire ecosystem creating a robust 35 derivatives ecosystem is very very important and I hope that this was something that we all learned today so I'll wrap my talk uh my I'll wrap my talk up by talking about um where D5 derivatives are today and where I think it's actually heading towards so this is the D5 derivatives landscape today I categorized it into three main buckets some of you might have different categorization and you know please feel free to let me know um I think the first part is exchanges so those are like you know they're very front-facing platforms that people are able to trade D5 derivatives on and then the second part is Operation so this is more of the middle office uh back office work that um you know it is really important for like the building blocks to make sure that everything goes smoothly and then the last is tokenization so it is the creating the actual smart contracts that represent uh Financial positions and these capabilities vary greatly but I think roughly these are like the three main categories and I put some um representative protocols um on on the bottom of each category and I think for each of these categories you know I have some thoughts so for D5 derivative exchanges um these are actually maturing really well and I almost think it's a bit saturated like I just feel like every single D5 derivatives protocol I've spoken to is like trying to make an exchange and and yeah like you know I think fast execution low fee like all of that is really important um but yeah like these are all actually really good products that are existing in the market today so we first have uh Perpetual dexes um who I'm sure all of you guys are familiar um they are like Futures that allows you to take on Leverage um in like uh the direction of the market and then we also have option indexes that are forming um you know Avo just launched last week and I think there's a lot of uh interest in also offering non-linear products on a decks um there's so many so many selections of exchanges and that's really exciting um because that means there's just more platforms for different types of investors but I think a really uh tough part is actually in D5 derivatives the operations are still very very nascent a lot of the tools and services in backend middle office operations are very limited and um especially things like Risk Management custodial Solutions Clearing Houses you know Insurance these are the parts of D5 derivatives that still needs to get worked on and these are very hard problems to solve you know people haven't really figured out on chain identity yet people haven't figured out um you know how to how to figure out you know balance sheets on chain and clearing houses and custodial Solutions um these are all very traditional financial terms um and you know how do we actually create custody of an asset in a very large wallet without it being centralized or how do we create accountability in like a third party that helps helps clear transactions so that you know it reduces counterparty risk without that being centralized and I think though Solutions are imperative for institutions to deploy larger amounts of fun onto the market and people have not solved this problem space yet so if you are a hackathon participant looking for ideas I know it's already like the second day but here are some ideas that I think you could work on and then this is my passion and what the problem space that I work in which is tokenization tokenization is the act of putting D5 derivative products on a smart contract so it is transparent it is accessible and you know that you know it has some sort of a payout and this area is not saturated but seeing a very exciting innovation so um you know in like the last few years we've seen kind of the vanilla options space really form with emergence of open um which tokenized options and then um I would say platforms like ribbon Finance Jones Dow they really uh listed these tokenized options in order to distribute them to users and then we also saw synthetic Delta ones which are more like um tokenized linear payoff derivatives that people were also listing and I think uh and emergence of Sega was a key um it was a key signal to innovating this tokenization space and D5 derivatives um as Sega created the first exotic option smart contracts I'm going to talk a little more about Sega so exotic options is a very interesting space um it is actually kind of the most advanced type of derivatives where you create conditional statements on like a normal option and it helps create products with a much more flexible views on the market so an example of an exotic options position so in Sega a very popular strategy would be I bet in the next 27 days neither BTC nor eth will fall more than 50 percent and in return I get a 12 apy so that is like an exoticoptions position that combines two things it combines a basket of options so you're looking at a basket of BTC and eth options and then it also has something called a knocking barrier which creates this principal protection of up to 50 mentioning that you're actually not incurring any loss to your principal for 50 of the market movement so even if the market Falls like 45 you're still making 100 of your principal and 100 of your returns um this type of product is very very common in traditional Finance uh it had it's around 16 trillion dollars in Market size and uh it is often marketed as a high yield savings account or it is offered to Private Bank clients um in developed countries and uh yeah we put this on chain because we think it is a natural evolution of the market it is very important to have exotic options on chain and we think it will bring more institutional adoption into the space by creating uh safer yields involved Health Market environments and yeah um I talked uh a little more about our product but um in sega's products you deposit usdc into our smart contract and we run these uh exotic options trading strategies that helps you earn yields ranging anywhere from five percent to 50 apy and we offer protection against downside risks so we actually uh protect your assets for anywhere from thirty percent to ninety percent of the market movements and all of this happens on chain with a very efficient mechanism so um if you are interested in checking out more of our strategies it's on sega.fi so um you know do try it out after listening to this talk and you know as I mentioned earlier we're solving problems in the space uh like lack of product Innovation declining yields and safety our mission is to create safer yields in volatile Market environments because um at the time that Sega was formed which was at the end of 2021 beginning of 2022 we saw that um the existing products in D5 derivatives were all vanilla and very risky kind of dangerous we saw that everyone was uh forking each other's protocol and not really creating their new own protocol not being very creative and then there were a lot of unprofitable strategies so we wanted to create real high yields that were not inflationary that was not a Ponzi um and then we also wanted to just make sure that we weren't rugging our users so um these are some of the concerns that we saw initially and then now we're really building this in order to create an expansive D5 derivatives ecosystem that will lead to an expansive crypto ecosystem for Sega we're live on ethereum as of last month and we are also live on Solana we've done over 250 million dollars in trading volume to this date so we're actually super excited that makes us number one in Solana defy and it also makes us number four across all chains in this world so Sega has done quite well and yeah we just launched on ethereum so I'm super excited to be speaking at an ethereum conference today and also uh this week um it's us today but we actually use this slide like three times um today we are launching something called leveraged option vaults I talked a little bit earlier about the beauty of having D5 derivatives and building more efficient liquidation mechanisms uh we created leverage option walls which uh is at the cusp of D5 derivatives Innovation it actually allows you to take on a leveraged position of our vaults without the need of additional collateralization or without the need of dependencies on external liquidity and leverage option vaults will allow you to earn a magnified yield of 20 to 50 plus apy on top of still having a principal protection of anywhere from um 30 to 50 of the market movements you can take 2x 3x 4X or 5x leverage and it's uh it's really an interesting product that you know you haven't really seen in any protocols ever so um if you are interested in checking our products out um you know please please try after this talk and please come to me if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer and yeah thank you so much for listening to The Talk today um please try out our product um if you read this QR code there's a bunch of links for like um how to get started with Sega it also tells you um it gives you like documentations to like our back tests our scenarios um if you want to learn more about our products in detail and our Twitter is uh Sega underscore Phi um my personal Twitter is uh at erisatoyo so um yeah please um DM Discord talk to me in person at the hackathon ask me any questions about D5 derivatives about the defy ecosystem and about Sega thank you very much
