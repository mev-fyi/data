foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of eat Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to scaling ethereum all of you are watching this on heathglobal.tv for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is the platform we'll be using for the rest of this month to host all of our topics workshops and Summits and you're in for a amazing time learning about everything that's happening in the world of scaling ethereum all right let's get started this hackathon is brought to you by youth global if what was an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running toothpicks hack bonds and summons and scaling ethereum is no different we have an amazing next few weeks planned we're going to host three summits two of which I can talk about the first one is a click on Summit you're going to talk about you're going to learn about all the amazing things happening in the world of Roll-Ups right after we cover the hackathon logistics then on March 24th to Friday we're going to talk about what's happening in the world of muv with the flashbots summit and a super secret announcement coming in on March 27th the Monday a few days after the flashcard Summits about something that this entire ecosystem has been eagerly waiting for we're going to release what those announcements are and what the summit and those speakers are uh very soon so stay tuned for the next few weeks to learn about all the impressive progress we've made as an industry in the last couple of years all this will be on heat global.tv and today we have a summit that's going to cover all the things that's going to set the theme for what everybody's doing to scale their amp but the next 30 minutes are about the hakkaban we have so much going on for this event and I want to make sure we take the time to talk about everything that we're going to do to structure the next few weeks for U.S hackers and for those of you joining us for the first time telling you how everything works for those of you are coming back welcome back and stay tuned for a few changes we've made to our previous formats so this is already an impressive and massive Advantage we have over 1200 people from 89 different countries participating in working on projects related to scaling ethereum and building on l2s and they are from 24 time zones we finally managed to cover whole time zones and I can't wait to meet all of you here and see what everybody's excited about I also put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming from and it just continues to blow us away because we have representation from six continents at so many cities around the world so the last time we counted this a few days ago that number was closer to 500 unique cities so that's awesome to see and welcome everybody and thank you for staying up or staying late early everything from all these time zones we really appreciate this not only just family of 107 mentors who are going to be here helping you over the next three weeks to make sure that your project comes to life and 19 amazing partners that are getting at help guidance prizes and mentorship to make sure that you succeed in building on top of ethereum and layer twos and they're also going to be giving out over two hundred thousand dollars worth of prizes so there's a lot of prizes that we can do and we will be doing and talking about so not only can you learn everything that's happening in this world you also get to win some amazing amount of prizes for building interesting and useful things I'm gonna give a quick shout out to some of our amazing partners with optimism polygon scroll gnosis chain ethereum Foundation output virtual machine hyperlane apecoin fuel UMass connects polybase PSC the graph it Max Zeke strings era mantle Taiko and which border call all these companies and our partners are here with us for this entire month helping out talking to all of you telling you about how you can simplify your life by using a lot of these sdks and not Reinventing the wheel and also giving out a lot of prizes but enough of that let's talk about some of the stuff that you all need to know specifically about the hack Bob Logistics most common question we've gotten is what can I build uh there's a lot of you who are joining us for the first time there's a lot of you who are seasoned engineers in big companies that are trying to understand what's possible in crypto and some of the themes that we think are going to be very helpful for you and also what others have said they're going to do is is on this slide people are very excited to play with different D5 Primitives and thousand nfts on different l2s so you get to take advantage of a lot of the scalability benefits and low gas costs for making those type of transactions and you can do a lot more interesting stuff or a lot more stuff that can be corrected on chain if if something requires higher transaction uh amounts uh not from a dollar standpoint but just from the number of edits or commits needed to get to any outcome we have a lot of support for building on ZK Roll-Ups there's a lot of things you can do in terms of understanding how we can add anyone from privacy to some more guarantees to just hiding some information that should be not needed or must be publicly available for somebody to act on and you have a lot of support for doing this for anywhere from account abstraction to D5 to nfts just simply making just better tooling for the next wave of people to do all these things more efficiently and faster of course the reason why we're doing this Advantage for the second time is because we feel like the layer 2 ecosystem is still lacking really really good developer tools and we want to really get thousands of more people to build on top of these scaling Solutions and even if you can't find an app or you realize that something was really hard as you were doing your app you get to take some time and make a tool that makes it easier for yourself and somebody else and let them make applications on top of these Solutions better or faster and and more quickly and of course it's okay to not work on an app there's so much to do here in this entire ecosystem that you can also take the time to build some guides or documentation or simply clarify how somebody can use it and help educate everybody else on how they can be in this ecosystem faster or quicker or just you really get into some of the nuances that everybody needs to know to build on top of any of these Solutions uh if you are one of the teams who's working on making easy to understand how to do something or how something works you also have the option to submit those guides to youth Global guides or be more than happy to publish one of these guides here and if you do end up writing something that can help thousands of people uh we'd love to make that an official guide on youth global.com guides all right now let's talk about the next three weeks and how all the logistics is set up for everything I'm going to cover what you can do to find a team member how you can get any help all the prizes of course we're going to talk about all of our Summits uh and I'm going to talk about the most important thing which is how judging and product submission is set up so the most important thing is communication so let's Dive In everything is going to be on Discord that means if you are a confirmed hacker you would have seen a connect Discord button on your hacker dashboard on neat global.com and you should be able to see a scaling ethereum section up here on your Discord sidebar that means that only people who are participating at the hackathon are going to be able to see those channels so really make sure that you see that and you are actively connected to Discord because that's where all the announcements talks prizes help all that will be managed there including talking to all of our mentors and these are private shelves which means that if you're not part of the hackathon you will not be able to get access to them and and it helps us understand how do we make sure we effectively communicate things precisely to everybody who should hear about those announcements and that's also where all of our partner channels are which reads if you're working on any of the particles out there whether it's on an optimistic wall up or is it your roll up or some Dev tool or send app or any push notification service you can message anybody on that team through those channels so please make sure you're connected to slack and also make sure that your team members are there because you also get to talk to each other there and that's where you can just make sure you can ping anybody including the global team and partners and our mentors and all the other hackers too on top of that we'll also be sending out calendar invites for all talks and workshops you would have seen a calendar invite today for for this very session uh there's a handful of other talks and workshops happening some of them already happened yesterday we have a lot more next week all that is going to be notified to you on your calendar so it normalizes itself for the different time zones everybody's in and as a note all this is meant to be very asynchronous which means that we try our best to do things multiple times over the course of the hackathon and repeat this so we can optimize for multiple time zone overlaps but even if you have other obligations whether it's school over work or or something else everything is going to be recorded so even if you invest something it'll be available on youtube.com it's Global immediately after it ends and we make sure that everybody to catch up and watch things at their own pace all their own speed limit and and really understand what's going on and not miss out anything and to see what's happening everything is going to be on our website you can just header over to ethicalworld.com scaling there you'll see the full schedule if anything changes you'll see that reflected there they will what's on the website is going to be the source of Truth so we make sure that everything whether it's your calendar invites whether it's the top titles whether it's a five minute delay it all that is reflected properly on our hackathon website so the most other common question with gun is how does this hackathon work for those of you joining us for the first time uh it is fairly straightforward the hackathon eventually begins now and you can start working on your projects you can work with them uh with the team and you can have a team of up to five members and you have the next two and a half weeks to hack that means that whole thing is about three weeks long as an event that includes some of the extra time we have for judging and doing the closing ceremonies and going through all the Prize winners but you have the next little while to talk about all these things and work on our projects so I'm going to spend a bit more time here on all the things that matter here for project submission and all the things that you need to know so the rules and criteria is the most important thing everything that you're doing must start today and must be done from scratch which means that you cannot work on a pre-existing project you cannot add features to something you've done and you also cannot just deploy something you've done in the past to some Layer Two and call that a valid submission on top of that only people who have successfully rsvp'd are eligible to win prizes which means that if you're working on a team of five and three of the people are listed as your team members at the point of submission and the other two were accepted but did an RSVP properly or didn't join your team if you win a prize in the situation only those three people will receive the prizes not all five so please please please make sure that all of your team members are rsvp'd and listed and confirmed on your hacker dashboard and also there's going to be a lot of edge cases and we totally understand that so if you have a situation where you want to clarify something you can just message us on Discord or email or direct message or Twitter whatever it is uh we'll be able to understand what your unique situation is and help clarify and address any any issues so don't hesitate to Ping us and if you have anything that comes up you can let us know and we'll be able to get to it immediately next and the most important piece is judging so here is something that we're changing for those of you who joined us in the past submissions are due on Sunday March 26th at noon eastern time everything we're going to do is default to Eastern time which is Eastern time New York and you have until March 26 to work on your projects after that we'll kind of talk about how judging works but what it means on that Sunday is you will have to create a four-minute demo video to submit what you've worked on over the past few weeks this four minute is what's going to be a snapshot of what you have done and what everybody will look at to review your submission for any prizes or any cuts this video is required this video is also very strict over time so you cannot go over we will the dash will log in would prevent you from submitting something that's longer than four minutes and we also review all these videos individually to make sure that everything is as part of the rules so if you speed it up that also gets you as qualified if you try to make it too long you'll just be stuck on being able to submit your project and if it's too short that also helps you not convey what you built on properly so please make sure that it's appropriately and as close to four minutes as possible to really lighting or Enlighten everybody on what you worked on for the past few weeks and please please please please please please don't prepare this last minute we see everybody realize that they need more time to make it better to make the demos work really well to sometimes focus on conveying the right messaging all that takes time we recommend any block at least two hours to do this even though it's four minutes it will take you a few revisions to get things right but make sure that everything's under the time limits and all these details are going to be on your dashboard right now you're only going to be able to see how to create a project but next week onwards you'll be able to see all the specific things that you need to do to submit your project and how the video works and some previous good videos that we recommend using as a reference for what a great submission looks like all those things are going to be made visible to you on your hacker dashboard very soon now let's talk about what's changing for judging and how everything is going to be set up after your subject project we have two tracks of judging the first one is main judging which helps you become a finalist for this hackathon and the other one is a partner price judging which is only if you are interested in submitting for a prize but not anything else for those of you who've been part of our events before uh the format's the same but we're adding an additional step moving forward so I'm going to talk about what the main judging looks like and how it's going to work it's going to be set up in two rounds and this is how the first round looks like when you submit your project on Sunday the next day is when we're going to do round one of judging which means that instead of joining a live call which is how things were done before there will be a asynchronous round with our judges who review your video submissions and we'll also be checking anywhere from your git history to the quality of what you submitted to the live demo links that you published to everything around your submission and qualifying you for the next round for the live demos that you are used to this means that not every project will move on even if you wanted to be part of the finalist track and within 24 hours of submission our goal is to notify the teams that are moving on to the next round to default to a live demo to our judges where they get to have a conversation and talk about what they built so as our judges look at all the submissions on that Monday we'll be notifying the teams that admitted to the next round and that judging happens on Tuesday for round two the way round two is set up is fairly straightforward all those teams will be sent a zoom link you will then be able to go on that call and simply demo what you built uh you will still get four minutes and we default to playing the video that you submitted to our judges you'll be a different set of Judges as well and in addition to the demo you'll also then get a few minutes for a q a after that is what we'll have to determine who our finalists are and that's what sets up for the closing ceremonies or we're going to demo some of our top teams to share what they built and what they were excited about as some of these teams so the zoom call will be synchronous and this will happen from 12 pm to 2 30 p.m eastern time and this will allow all of us to be on the call synchronously and chat about everything that you're excited about everything you built or any questions our judges have about your submission so that's the net difference we'll notify this again to everybody over email and all this information will also be available on your hacker dashboard as soon as submission opens in about 10 days and then for those of you who are not interested in the finalist track and want to just go for partner prizes That Remains the Same as before which is the partners will look at your four minute video and your source code and your live Demos in the project description to determine what is the best team that represents the values that they're trying to accomplish for that price they will look at this at their own pace asynchronously and contact you on Discord or email if they have any questions so this means that as long as you specify during your submission process that you are trying to go for X prize the partners will be notified that you are one of the teams and this is your submission and they'll be able to look at this and over the same window before the closing ceremony they'll be able to tell all of us who the winners are for their projects this also means that if you forget to notify in your submission process that you wanted to go for x or some some specific price then we have no way of knowing that this is what we wanted so please make sure that you select the actual prize you were trying to qualify for otherwise we won't be notified the progress will be notified and if you say that how come I didn't get this provider outcome someone else was chosen ever may it means that nobody had the information that he wanted to be part of that price so you'll get to do all of that through your dashboard and all that will be available to you very soon but in summary you have to make sure that you take the time and make the video cut that is the best advice I could give you which is that foreman represents three weeks of work and making sure you get the time to highlight why you're doing this thing who you are wide matters and why you're excited about it is going to be very critical that video is what determines you receiving a prize you're you're going to round two of judging and also being a finalist for This Global events so make sure you take the time and don't ignore the work you need to do to make your submission look amazing and of course I don't want this to be intimidating to all of you the biggest question is well what if I'm new to all of this well not to worry this event is designed for a lot of beginners and our goal is to make sure that we do everything we can to make it really easy for everybody to understand what's going on and really take the time to learn and use the next few weeks instead of just a hackathon weekend to make this useful and knowledgeable and a good learning experience for them so a lot of content for beginners and experts uh no matter what your skill set is you have things to catch up on here and you can watch those talks you can watch historical Talks on YouTube or learn about any protocol that's out there in the space and get a guide to tutorial read talk to the people who built it directly so a lot of these talks and workshops are available if you want to just understand what's happening thematically that's where the summons come in we're going to start off with our first summit in 20 minutes and our goal is to tell you at a high level all these things that you're excited about whether it's how optimistic pillows work Aussie girls work or if you saw the announcement about coinbases mute op chain based all that will be told to you on why these things are excited very soon and there's a massive set of guides and resources available to you in your infocenter it shows up now on your nav bar on the hackathon website you will see that link on your calendar invites too you can see everything from the rules the criterias the submission guidelines to list the previous submissions that we think are really well presented all that stuff is available to you to read up on immediately and you can just go that go there by click on the info Central Link and of course if you have any questions this is a live stream I can see all the questions on the global.tv chat so just ask away to your questions and we'll be able to answer them one common question we've already gone is do I have to decide between the main judging tracker the alternate price track the answer is uh yes on just the main judging track which means that if you pick the main judging correct you are still qualifying for the partner prizes it's just that if you only pick the partner price track that means that you cannot come back and qualify for any of the main judging unlist price tracks so no matter what you choose you are still going to be looked at for all the partner prizes and make sure we make that way more obvious as well but you are not going to have to make a decision between UI one as partner Prize or not all cases you qualify for that and the last thing is everything is on our YouTube so of course there's a lot of you who are not sure what you want to build yet or you're not confident in the way you have will be accomplishable in the next few weeks or maybe you need help on specific skill sets we got you covered all that stuff is also part of the thing which is the reason why these events are multi-weets is because you really get to learn and then try it out and see how to do these things so there's a find a team channel on your Discord there you can see a couple hundred people who are also in a similar position as you where they're looking for somebody with specific skill sets or just want to pair up with somebody and you get to meet new people from across the world you get to meet really really smart people who are excited about what's happening in web 3 and work together on a project over the next few weeks and really accomplish something amazing and of course because there's so many of you from literally all time zones close to 500 cities around the world we want to know who you are why you're excited about this thing and and what you really are passionate about so go to the scaly 2023 chat Channel and talk to all of us say hi to Gold members uh say hi to everybody else participating and we'd love to understand how you got into this space and of course it's also possible to hack so you don't need to have a team it's just easier if you have somebody else working with you because you then don't have to do everything yourself so if you want to do something on your own that is also totally fine you can submit something individually but if you are trying to work with somebody and reduce the workload or just get complementary skill sets involved you get to do that with a t and there's also now a tool on your dashboard to help find team members this is a double opt-in tool only which means that on your dashboard if you set that you need help or you're looking for a team member then with the second you check this off you'll be available on this tool and other members can find you based on the things that you can do for a team whether it's front-end development design back-end development solidity development all that stuff you can specify and find other potential team members have those skills or the skills that you have that you like to contribute to another team now let's talk about check-ins this is going to be very important our goal is to make sure that you can understand what's happening in this space especially from so much information that exists out on the internet and to help simplify that process make the best use of your next few weeks we Implement something called a checking a check-in is a simple form for lack of a better analogy a quick survey or a stand-up update that happens on a dashboard and you just get to tell us how things are going if you finally have an idea that you're excited about if you're stuck on something if you try to get an answer to something about an sdt and you didn't hear back or you couldn't get the right person to answer your technical questions or you're stuck on this book and it's just really stopping you from moving forward all these things is what we use to check in support and from that we get to Route and triage you to the best course available to help or just simply help you ourselves we're excited about building on ethereum we're excited about the UK Technologies we're excited about optimistic Roll-Ups and we want to get people to build really really cool things and these check-ins help us get you to where you want also the check-ins are a big piece for getting to the submission piece so you do have to fill out the check-in just so we know how things are going well we can do better as equal all all this will happen via your dashboard and some really quick forms should take you no more than 10 minutes and anybody on your team can fill this out next week and go to after the way we kind of think about this thingy is that as you're thinking about your projects you should break down the work into these equally adjusted timeline so you should take the first few days of next week to really brainstorm what could be possible understand some of the stuff that is also were not possible with different Technologies watch behavioral workshops and talks and talk to a lot of our mentors and see hey I'm trying to do X does this make sense or is there a better way to do this thing or is more efficiently doing something and as you kind of gather all of that interest use the week after to really build something that you want to submit and get people to test it out get people to give you feedback and then as you learn through that iteration finalize everything you need to do whether it's really make a nice design make it really easy and friendly work on the copy or anything that you want to do here you get to do that at the last week just before submissions on March 26th and to make the best use of all this we also are going to be doing a feedback session every week which means that as you are thinking about brainstorming your idea or you want to see what people think or what some of our partners think or what some of these Founders who are building these Technologies they're using think you get to join these two sessions the first one is next week from 3 to 5 PM Eastern the next one is the week after from 9 A.M to 11 A.M Eastern and you can just come on a call and really just get direct feedback and just behaves like a college office hours you get to see what people think about this or if you're stuck or if you really wanted direct help on a on a call and they can anybody can help you there as our mentors or our partners to tell you what you can do to get unlocked and I also want to cover a few seconds on our code of content even though this is an online event uh we have a code of conduct that everybody must obey and the event rules and the code of conduct is on evegible.com rules you can read everything in a lot more detail but the gist of it is that please be respectful to everybody in this community and harassment and abuse will not tolerated on any form and specifically about the event rules anything that you built here is going to be solely owned by you and your team which means that either us as a global nor our partners or anybody else owns the IP for what comes out of this it's solely you and your team members that are the owners of everything that you built and if you need any help or if you think that what you're doing for your project might be violating some of the rules or you may get disqualified for not doing something you can just reach out to us and we'll be happy to clarify anything and let you know if something is within the guidelines of this hakuba in all that information again is on the website including everything I'm going to say after which is the prize stuff all the talks all that is there and you can just go to eat global.com scaling all right so before we get to our Summit let's talk about all the stuff that you can actually win and all the prizes that everybody's giving out so I want to spend the next few minutes on the prizes and then we're going to kick out with our Summit so let's get right to it so the first one is from optimism what we asked was we asked the operation team at Natty Too share us what optimism is doing what they're excited about and what they think you should be excited about and then also the prices they're giving out so I'm going to invite Addie here on stage and tell them more about the prizes hi my name is Maddie I'm the head of developer relations at op labs and we are scaling ethereum by building optimism we're part of the optimism Collective and together we are building a lightning fast scalable ethereum equivalent layer 2 called optimism magnet this is all built on the op stack which is our open source Dev stack that powers all the interconnected layer tunes that will form the super chain the other thing you need to know about optimism is that by being part of the collective by growing the ecosystem you qualify for retroactive public goods funding which means you can earn more funding in the future for the impact you have on the ecosystem so we have three hacks for you today the first one hack the op stack show us what you would do with your own L2 take the latest release on Gurley do something cool with it past examples include a Game Boy emulator and that ran in the execution and environment or a ebm roll-up that use Bitcoin as a data layer and so the top three teams will win 5K 3K and 2K respectively number two identity if you're building Identity or reputation we want to hear from you and anything involving communities or badges or doubts deployed on optimism mainnet and incorporate our attestation service look for ways that you can add them to your project free teams will win two thousand dollars each and lastly the pool prize and adapt any tool bring it to optimism it's evm equivalent which means it uses the same tools and flows that you're already used to it's very easy to ship and start tapping into the optimism Community if you're looking for resources to get started we have a lot of the head to the prizes page I recommend starting with the starter kit that we just released as support for wagney Foundry rainbow kit and more if you're looking for ideas we have an ideas list we collect hard interesting or just downright uninjed ideas and we publish them for Builders so if you're looking for inspo head to this URL and that's it I'll be in the Discord ping scaff do you have any questions and good luck and have fun awesome so you got a quick overview of all the optical surprises are if we talk about a lot more on our holdups work but I'll just quickly summarize which is you get to win a lot of prize we're hacking on the op stack and there's a big emphasis around identity and reputation so interesting that attestation ideas are going to get two thousand dollars each and after three of those so you get to see all that very soon but let's go on to some of our other prizes oh and by the way there's also pull prize which means that any interesting project that uses optimism or deploys on Main Nets in a meaningful way is eligible to win 400 each so 10 teams will qualify for that and they'll be able to receive four thousand dollar split ten ways up to 10 ways so it could be more next up is polygon and let's go right into airing what step has to say about the Leon Pulliam hey hackers I'm stephilia from polygon labs and I'm here to tell you about the twenty thousand dollars in prizes we're giving away to all of the builders who are scaling ethereum during this virtual hackathon the first prize is five thousand dollars for the best web3 developer or Community tool we want you to scale ethereum by creating and documenting either a tool a dashboard a Dev Library a transaction Explorer a dow coordination tool or a general web 3 public good that will supercharge development and coordination for the web3 community and beyond our second five thousand dollar prize is for the best app deployed on polygon ZK evm get ready for our polygon ZK evm mainnet by deploying your scaling ethereum hackathon project to our polygon ZK evm testnet we've got lots of docs and tutorials to help you start building either with hard hat or remix and we even have a ZK evm full stack development tutorial that you can use to get start building your dash next prize is five thousand dollars for the best T-Rex on a project using the DAP store kit this is a Community Driven tool kit that you can use to deploy successful evm compatible dap stores using the decentralized App Store kit framework we want you to build a intuitive beautiful user-centric dap using the kit and explain all of your different ux optimizations and choices within your readme check out those dap store docs to start building last but not least we have five thousand dollars in prizes for the best use of polygon ID build a full stack dat that uses polygon IDs decentralized identity solution to give your users privacy by default so that they can verify their access rights to use your dap without giving up any of your personal data check out our polygon ID Wiki and our Builder tutorials to learn how to set up your own issuer node and verifier service those are our prizes super stoked to see what you build if you have any questions at all please ask us in the Discord see you soon awesome so I'll also summarize some of these prices you can you can visually see as well so the best web query developer Community tool will receive five thousand dollars through polygon the best app deployed on the polygon ZK ebm will receive 5000 the best ux on a project using the dev store kit from polygon will also receive 5000 and the best use of polygon ID will be receiving five thousand dollars so it's twenty thousand dollars in prizes for a lot of themes that you're going to see as recurring in this world of scaling ethereum and you get to check out all the specifics here on the scaling website next up is scroll and they have iTune to talk about what you can get from scroll hello everyone we are scroll we are very excited to partner with escobel and to be part of the scaling exam hacksaw event we all know that a Serum is great and has a humongous community and developers on top of the extreme Network it is known to being decentralized by having hundreds of thousands of geo-distributed validators and have been secure and censorship resistant however due to the blockchain Fatima ECM cannot achieve the scalability as they prioritize the first two properties so how to solve the scalability problems on the Instagrams more than two years ago Metallica posted this blog post about Europe Central grow map but they plan to scale the exams through the robs that can process more transactions on the data tube and have efficient settlement of analyzation on top of the ECM layer 1. so scroll is committed to build an ebm by code equivalent to zkevm and zkraw player 2 to scale the experience while committed to scaling the experims we are bought by the following three principles first we aim to build evm equivalent to the Europe that can achieve the Best in Class using a developer experience second we keep the security first mindset when building the layer 2 where the zero knowledge protocols can explicitly improve the correctness of all execution on layer 2 and we also actively having external and internal auditing on our code base and third we believe that decentralization also matters in the layer 2 context the school is committed to decentralized across all different layers including a defensed approver and sequencer Network for user and developers because of the evm equivalence using the screw is pretty much the same as using the svm last let me in the scroll hackathon and multi-program in this event we have photos three different tracks first we just ask you to deploy your smart contract on top of the school test net the deployment process will be just like the ECM and you only need to change the RPC endpoint and second we knowledge so show us your best application building new use cases that leverages the power obviously knowledge proofs and third we want to see devs taking advantage of the cheap gas fees and fast block times on a layer juice for more information you can check out the website and hope you enjoy hacking on top of the scroll thank you it's awesome so to repeat some of the prices from scroll if you deploy your smart contract on scroll there's a ten thousand dollar pull prize which means that any meaningful deployment on scroll will be splitting this ten thousand dollars equally and you get to really deploy our ZTE VM but really test out what is it isn't possible or what is working as advertise it should be everything um in addition there's a category for the applied CK improvements and empowerment so tool teams will get 25 million dollars as the winners for this and you can see the specifics on the details on the price page and there's a cheap at last utilizer award category track and you get to also understand how you get qualified by winning on some of those specific key points that matter to be really cheap at best click on scroll so next I want to get to noses chain so Nelson's chain is also giving out a lot of prizes so the most Innovative apps are now says chain are qualified to win effectively twenty thousand dollars so the best price gets eight thousand the second place will get six thousand and they're going to be two runner-ups we're going to be receiving three thousands for three thousand dollars each for deploying an interesting application on necess chain next up is Falcon Virtual Machine or fbm this lets you really add programmability to your data without having to leave the solidity world that you're already excited about and understand so if you are integrating with the flat one virtual machine you get your win prizes for all these categories so the best application for datadel is qualified to receive 2000 the most interesting application that works on storage markets is also qualified to receive 2000 the most interesting tooling on the fem ecosystem is qualified to receive 2000 as the best project there's so many Primitives and infrastructure missing for black one virtual machine as they ready their mainnet next week you get to be one of the best projects making that easier for others to build on top and there's also a wild card category which means that any other project that doesn't fit all these things but it's too super addressing and impressive will receive two thousand dollars next up is hyperlane hybrid Lane is a permissionless and Shopper Billy glare so as you want to think about modular security between different chains you get to use hyperlabe so the best interoperable solution is going to receive four thousand dollars the best use of hyperlinks warp routes SDK will receive two thousand dollars as a prize and any infrastructure project that is making the best use of hyperlade will receive two thousand dollars in terms of helping you scale things on ethereum next up is it coin eight coin Foundation the eight coin Dow is giving out prizes for the best integration of a project into the apcoin ecosystem this is the Portage ecosystem if in case you uh you were not familiar from that the downside and there's also a category for the best contribution to this system so whether that's on a construction or anything that you're doing to scale ethereum you get to do uh those tracks and receive effectively close to ten thousand dollars each uh ten thousands in total for working on the Bitcoin ecosystem so if you're excited about nfcs you want them to be more accessible and fast for everybody in the consumer world out there you have the opportunity to do so here next up is feel feel is the fastest execution layer or a modular blockchain so if you are building a smart contract that's working in sway language you get to win a thousand dollar prize and a runner-up will receive 500 then if you are building a pulse stack tab on top of the field and deploying it on the fuel Layer Two you get to qualify for three thousand dollars a price for the best use and if you are using predicates on the fuel Network two teams will receive two thousand dollars for the first place and five hundred dollars for runner-up category next up is connect connects also lets you communicate cross chain and transfer assets between two different chains so the best cross chain application will receive up to three thousand dollars from Connex and if you end up taking any existing protocol cross chain which means you end up bridging something that already is on one of those chains using connects and help it be available on a different chain you get to win one thousand dollars it's a very simple Bridge contracts and if you are using The x-call Primitives SDK there's a pool prize which means that anybody who deploys and sends any data with back call and you get to exploit a thousand dollars so I'm gonna see stuff it yourself next up is polybase polybase is a web 3 equivalent of Firebase so you get to use postgres or any sort of relational database or it's a key down in store quite easily and make your applications real time and quick to use so the best use of power base will get fifteen hundred dollars and the runner-up will get a thousand dollars and there's also massive Pool price which means that all interesting projects that make a meaningful integration and use of the polybase SDK of the databases will be splitting 2500 each then we have the graph graph is an indexing protocol if you want to query any of your blockchain data you get to create a subgraph already tap into an instance subgraph and request that on-chin data as really nice Json through graphql so the best New subgraph Creation will over 60 000 and 1 000 for the runner up and the best use of existing subgraphs will receive 1400 for the first place and 600 for the runner-up spot then we'd have it Max it Max is a layer two that helps you make really quick and fast consumer apps the best use of in Macs and deployment on that protocol will receive 25 million dollars and two projects will receive this price so you get a chance to be one of the first amazing applications on a Max next up acq6 era this is a layer to CK ebm designed to scale blockchains and they are giving out a price for the best account abstractions on top of the ZK evm you can win two thousand dollars for that and three teams will get the best developer tooling related prizes for a thousand dollars each so if you get to improve how do we make it easier to play more on era you get to win a thousand dollars then we have mantle mantle is another layer two for building modular well it's leveraging model architecture for building and scaling the theorem and smart contracts and especially so mantle will receive five thousand dollars in total so 2500 for the first place take down here for second place and one thousand dollars in third place in the bit toe case then we have Taiko Network and there are building a so you can eat me up which is of type one so the best steps on Taiko will receive 1500 for the first place and 1000 for the second place uh they are also interested in making infrastructure improvements to working with the type of protocol and the first place winner will get a thousand dollars secularist will get five hundred uh there's also a lot of opportunity to make the CK improvements and just interesting applications of ZK um specific Technologies are just SDK functions and you get to win 500 for that prize and if you are one of the team members who wants to understand how do we improve the economics of that Network you can also receive our knowledge prize for going a bit more your research instead of coding something on NZ kbm and we have Push Builder to call the push Builder call is a communication protocol for web3 so if you want to Ping somebody or might have push notifications that are native to browsers and applications and react on top of on chain events you get to use push forward call for all these things and also to chat with people so the most Innovative use case of push across different chains will receive a thousand dollars this is all about scaling if you are using the push chat SDK the best and most interesting use case we'll get 750 and if you want to make with something interesting from a ux side of things for on top of the push sdks we'll get a 750 as well and there's a pool price of 2500 which means that all projects sending a meaningful use of push protocol will split 2500 each those are all of our amazing prizes I know you may have a lot of questions we'll be able to answer a lot of them here on the chat and get to them we'll get to them on Discord but all that information is available to you on e-global.com scaling including very specific information about each of the prizes on what qualifies to a dozen how you can watch a workshop of somebody telling you how to use them to the documentation links to previous examples that they see YouTube or replace all that stuff it is on the website so with that I want to stop talking and wrapped up with Logistics and really go into our Summit so as you get started with your projects please remember to pace yourself we really don't want this to be exhausting for you this event is meant to be intentionally multi-week so you get to really ramp up your understanding and then tackle something instead of going all in and sacrificing your sleep or help or anything else to really build something that you are excited about that could potentially be the next few years of your life and we really want you to have fun so please uh make sure you are thinking about all these things in a calculated Manner and in a in an easy way so that you get to learn more and understand how you can be more involved in this ecosystem and remember all these things about experimentation and learning which means that it is totally okay if you don't get to finish what you started our goal is to help you get there and if something doesn't work out that is totally okay you can absolutely demo something that was partially done and continue working on it after this event ends and our goal is to help you get to that finish line and however possible way we can so keep all that in mind and happy hacking so you can find us now on Discord by heading over to global.com Discord or your dashboard and we'll see all of us all 1200 plus of us on the scaling ethereum channels all right that was all the logistics which went a few minutes over but I am super excited to talk about what we have now planned for are Insurance healing Summit so let's go right into it I want to talk about our kickoff Summit which is we're going to highlight all the interesting themes themes and things that are happening in world of scaling there so today's schedule is as follows we're going to have Kellen talk about how wolves actually work and how potentially exit boss may not be real we'll see about back then we're gonna have Jesse talk about bass and as you may have heard uh bass is the neop stack chain from coinbase we're going to talk about why coinbase is excited to do this and how they want to bring on the next building users into ethereum then we're going to have portal lines that talk about Yeti 4844 44 minutes or less uh 40 44 is a really interesting standard that simplifies so many things to help make these things really consumer friendly that ishan is going to talk about how to think about Zeke envelopes and the CK evm this is obviously a really interesting topic because everybody's trying to push this into compatibility and making it easy for others to integrate to so we're going to learn a bit more specifically all those things and lastly John from hyperlane is going to talk about how to properly think about the multi-chain feature and how you can do interesting things and build cool applications that have context from different chains
