welcome everybody to the matic intro workshop titled transforming d5 using matic network joining us today is arjun and pranav who will be taking us through the session one quick reminder to everybody to join and create their projects by today as we will be prompting check-in one and with that i will be passing it over to arjun and pronounce to introduce themselves and get the session started all right thank you uh thank you so much emily um again you know great great to be here um so just just uh just quickly introduce so i'm arjun i had growth for matic network uh along with me i also have run off runner hey guys i am pranab i am a business analyst at matic network so yeah right so uh so so both of us essentially are part of the growth team uh pranav also leads a lot of initiatives on the solution side so he's been working with the sort of the app ecosystem and helping them with the technical integrations and things like that uh so what we want to do today is just just give you a quick brief about matic uh what we're doing in the d5 space uh we're gonna talk about some of the projects and things like that uh apart from that uh we'll also take maybe like uh 15 odd minutes so that runoff can cover uh you know can go sort of give you a short demo about how you know apps what kind of apps are being you know built what they do on the technical side um and yeah and if you have any questions we will take that in the end and yeah so let's let's just get started let me just quickly share my screen oh can you guys see uh yeah perfect awesome awesome so again uh just to uh so let's just jump right into it so uh so again just to jump right into it right so matic essentially is a layer two scaling solution uh we're essentially a side chain which is built on top of ethereum something like a shadow uh to uh to ethereum and and uh essentially the reason why matti came up and so we were founded in 2017 and and uh you know during that time you know ethereum was just growing and then there was this phenomena with the crypto kitties right where just a simple game sort of ended up uh clogging the entire ethereum network and making it unusable right and then those kind of situations sort of brought to the four the main problems with uh with the blockchains at the time right so the biggest problems was number one the contract was really really slow so what that meant is that you know users would have to wait a long period of time it would spoil the cons you know customer experience and certain business models were simply not possible and and the same thing was compounded with high transaction fees now you guys would have experienced if you if you've been using uni swap over the past couple of weeks that the fees on um you know on on ethereum have just skyrocketed right and that again makes many different business models uh completely obsolete and and it just don't work anymore uh things you want to do on the nft side or the gaming side if you want to build like a social network or something like that you simply can't do those kind of things and all of this combined leads to a really poor user experience so clearly some solution had to be found in a way that we could take the ethereum network and sort of extend it in a way that you know we could bring somehow high performance uh to the battery uh you know ecosystem then a lot of other things would be possible and we'll be able to build a much more diverse and more sort of composable ecosystem um so again you know building an l2 solution is um is is something you could say is like a technical problem uh there are many solutions to this this kind of scaling uh problem uh we've come up with a solution which has worked really well and is you know proved to be uh sort of production ready um so essentially we've come up with a hybrid uh plasma pos sidechain uh sort of approach so our uh you know our side chain essentially is a combination of uh plasma and uh um it uses plasma technology so that means that all the transactions which happen on matic are checkpointed on ethereum so all your assets are safe and at the same time the the consensus mechanism is proof of stake and and what that means is that uh you know we have we have the capability or the ability to build a really really high performance stream since we're not you know sort of how do you say um limited by proof of work anymore um and so so what does this mean in terms of metrics and things like that so in terms of metrics pure and simple like you know we are able to uh our our sort of sidechain scales beyond uh you know 7200 tps uh it's capable of performance a lot higher than that uh the block time is two seconds so every transaction is confirmed in two seconds the cost of transaction is roughly one ten thousand thousand ethereum so a typical transaction on matic for example just like how stated on the slide costs something around zero point zero zero zero zero four dollars it's practically free and at the same time arts are the matic sort of uh development environment is is or rather the environment which matters uses is the same as that of ethereum we use we use the same evm so what that means is anything which works on ethereum books and matic uh at the same time all the assets are erc type so we haven't created like an evm compatible chain with you know our own token standard or something like that we use the same erc style tokens which is your erc20 erc seven to one erc one one five five uh so thereby everything you can do which you can do on ethereum you can do on matic but at like you know very high speed and at like 110 000 the cost and and what this does is that when you bring high performance to this kind of environment what it essentially does is it brings a huge focus on the user experience right so once you have fast transactions you can build a really like how do you say smooth user flow um and that is what you know keeps the customer engagement high and keeps more and more people uh coming to you know sort of blockchain applications and trying them out and sort of um you know engaging with that um so again here uh you know we've seen phenomenal amount of growth over the past few months uh we're doing on average 50 000 transactions a day 160 000 unique wallets uh you know 100 000 strong developer communities growing rapidly we've got almost 80 plus daps already deployed um and i have some examples of some of the apps today but you know we have a huge number of apps deploying huge number already in development are our sort of reach across or across the twitter's twitter versus also sort of increasing on on a daily basis so so we've seen a huge amount of traction and and in 2021 we you know we're going to continue the growth story with lots of exciting announcements lots of other different dapps and ecosystems deploying automatic um now of course you know uh one of the reasons um and again you know just to quickly get into this you know one of the things which has also helped a lot with adoption in in general automatic has also been the kind of engagement we bring uh to the app ecosystem so for example you get technical support so if you're having you know trouble let's say deploying something on matic you have questions things like that you know we can help you there we provide marketing support so for example if you want to you know put together announcements and things like that if you want to do like amas air drops and things like that we'll help you and work with you to organize those and sort of get those executed so giving that support to the ecosystem has essentially helped you know a lot of the adoption and i know it's something which which uh which which you know appeals a lot to developers you know especially when you want to reduce that time to market you want to be able to sort of engage and build something really quickly and roll that out and that's kind of where you know our sort of ecosystem enables you to do that um so just to get into uh some of the quick um um sort of some of the dabs which are deployed on automatic um you know if i were to just so so again you know there are several uh several sort of the apps you know on the d5 side you know if if you were to just talk about d5 this easy five uh version x is deploying any mm this auto pocket quick swap just just uh um went past a million dollars in liquidity it's it's sort of a uni swap uh uni swap clone uh similarly you know we have dows as well like mahadao peer-to-peer swapping dfin recently also went past you know so they've they've built another protocol for crosstrain liquidity called router protocol and they went past a million dollars just yesterday in terms of liquidity on their decks and it's climbing fast um we also have you know lots of other uh sort of interesting d5 products being built uh on matic you know so you have your typical d5 but you also have something like parcel which is like a um sort of a crypto treasury management kind of solution you know for crypto companies which are coming up which are doing well you know you need to manage your entire you know companies finances and be able to do crypto payments so how do you solve for that so things like that so so this huge traction on the d5 side uh if you check out the checkout matic on d5 pulse you will also see that you know liquidity on a daily basis is steadily rising so that is also attracting a lot of other defy uh sort of developers to come and you know make use of the kind of high performance you get automatic and sort of be able to build interesting kind of experiences um we're also seeing other interesting um sort of kind of uh you know models like steel bird is trying to build some bring some sort of ai to dexes things like that burnley had a very you know very uh sort of successful uh coin offering um and if i want to get into other things so of course stable coins are natively enabled on matic so you can use usdt ty usdc uh you can directly fiat on ramp these stable coins uh we will also soon be supporting other like algo stable coins as well so we are in advanced discussions there um apart from that also on the gaming side we built a huge portfolio and this is very interesting because nowadays we are also seeing sort of this a combination of nft plus gaming plus d5 or nfd plus d5 um which which is amazing you know where all these sort of different elements are coming together to create value and and to create like amazing user experiences so on the gaming side i would say that pretty much any like any major game out there which is either being developed or has been developed is either on matic or talking to us and and if you just look at our portfolio in terms of you know the top games like neon districts omnium space terra virtual decentral games you know hugely popular zed run 0x universe and then the list just goes on like this is just a small snapshot like all the names i'm showing you right now is just a very small snapshot of all the apps which are deployed um you know just just to also quickly mention mega crypto poly which is doing really well amazing game um decentraland of course chain guardians uh you know prediction markets just bet anarchy games intergalactic gaming you know big on esports um you know very interesting concepts there flower patch you know came out of our uh matic accelerator program and sort of done did really well marble cards balkan verse first blood again esports platform you know again moving to matic paulian games runs one of one runs a node for us horizon games uh uh coming up with this very polished game sky beaver you know which is very exciting and and and also like you know you have other d apps as well like you know you have like sapien which is deploying a social network zavadi which is a ticketing platform creole which is doing you know carbon credits uh trading but but on blockchain you know to make the process transparent and faster epns which is your you know ethereum push notification service for smart contracts and things like that so lots and lots of you know interesting innovation lots of different types of d apps um you know i can have like a separate like two hour conversation just on all of this but uh but what we're gonna do right now is uh sort of uh you know jump into some more of the technical stuff so again you know like on enterprise side we have cargo x deployed dramatic wild cards which is trying to raise funds for endangered animals um you know through nfts um so again i just want to quickly jump into uh you know some of the developer or some other technical stuff you know why developers love matic um so uh pranav you wanna you wanna just quickly take over and sort of cover on some stuff on the website yeah can yeah sure i just stopped sharing my screen so you can go ahead yeah okay so [Music] let me just share my screen can you guys see my screen okay so as origin told uh uh okay so as urgent told like you know why developers love matic the simple reason for that is that because you know uh matic is a evm compatible chain so you know if you have deployed your you know you have learned solidity done your coding on this particular thing you have made your smart contracts you don't need to change anything right to diplomatic network because we are evm compatible totally for that particular reason i'll be giving you a small example of how this particular thing works right and uh we will be going through this whole thing i would encourage you guys to just follow along but if you cannot i would suggest you you know after this video is recorded just try it out yourself as well how easy it is to actually go ahead and deploy automatic networks right so first of all i'm currently on the remix network you know it is a very popular compiler for the solidity thing so this is a basic you know set name get name contract currently i'm on the robson networks you guys can see i'm on the option networks right now i'll just go ahead and deploy click on deploy like what we do right you know so okay just let me shift to inject web3 and deploy right i have to sign in with metamask if so much amount of fees for the ethereum sign the transaction and you know uh it will be confirmed at some some amount of time right this is how normally we deploy on the matic net uh on the ethereum networks robsten is a test network to the ethereum networks and this is how you do it now i'll be doing the same thing on the matic network c the contract and the code remains the same but i'll be changing the you know rpc url and doing the same magic on the matic networks right so let's see how it goes first of all i have to shift to custom rpc right select matic test net right i am doing it on the mumbai networks okay so uh our mumbai network is the test net of the matic networks right i'll shift to rpc a mumbai dot matrix dot today chain id is eight thousand and one uh it is matic and the explorer we have is mumbai explorer.today save it right and now i have to reload it all right yeah so now i'm on the matic networks and i'll be you know i'll not be changing any code or anything but i'll be deploying on thematic networks uh by the way whatever you know network information i gave you can find it right over here network information mumbai test net or you know this is all that was required explorer and things like that uh so just go ahead and check that out very very easy very confined document whatever is required is there inside right so just go to storage.sol again i'm on the matic network from right now right and i'll just go ahead and deploy right let me just shift to inject web3 i'm on the matic network c 8001 chain id is for matic networks i'll just go ahead and deploy it all right inject web3 let me just compile this okay compiled deploy [Music] and i'll be able to you know deploy it so one particular question that you might have is you know how will you get the faucets and related things right that are required for testing things so this is our faucet.metric.network right i'll just shift to a particular account which has less amount of matic right and click on here and i'll be able to get whatever faucets are required right for testing things so you know so we have created all the infrastructure that is required for actually you know doing things so you can see here as well we also have a block explorer right explorer dot explorer mumbai dot matic module dot com here you can see all the transactions that actually happen right so as i was telling you guys i'm able to deploy on the matic networks as well and it works the same as you know it would have worked on the ethereum networks i'll just you know run a set name again it will do the signing of the transaction using the matic networks right and the thing will get confirmed yeah so this is how it works this is how precise and you know beautifully things have happened no code change just the rpc url change and the magic happens on its own right so this is the best part about why this is this is why you know arjun was telling developers love matic because you don't have to do so there are minimal amount of changes and maximum amount of results with you know uh 70 200 tps and you know so great amount of throughput and less amount of gas required right so this was the first part you can deploy on the remix now i'll be doing you know so this is just the smart contract part right if you are wanting to develop a decentralized application you use some of the tools available for example you might want to use truffle right so next section what we'll be doing is we'll be deploying on the uh now we'll be deploying on the truffle uh thing right so this is a basic uh smart uh just this is some you know truffle uh package that i've used you can use truffle metacoin or something like that right this is a basic thing right it has contracts migration dot sol are very favorite and you are uh tutorial.com just a simple contract that you know uh i have created on openzapplin so this is the contract side it has some src some you know front end to it and this is all about it right now i have truffle.js currently first of all i'll be deploying on the local test networks uh local networks so for that i have to do ganache cli let me try to you know first of all do it on the on the local networks right and then we'll be you know uh we'll just you know change its small snippet inside the truffle.js and deloitte on the matic networks right it is that easy that's what you know we are trying to make you realize that's all so truffle my great reset i hope you are able to see my screen let me increase the size a little uh-huh okay is it too much okay now i hope you'll be able to see the screen right now it is deployed now let me just you know npm start i don't know npm run dev it will start working right so this is the whole picture of how this particular thing works now so so this is working now right on the test networks now what i'll be doing i'll be doing it on the uh on the matic networks for that what i have to do first of all just go ahead and shift uh you know just just uh change the whole code snippet this is the extra edition that i have done and now i'll be able to deploy it on the matic network itself so this particular code snippet you can find it in our docs this is our docs and this is the truffle part over here truffle right and here is the code snippet that i have been using right you can just copy this paste it over here paste it over here right and then we are good to go what i have to do again i can just you know now stop because i am not using the local servers i can just talk over there and just deploy the same so i have not changed the code i have not changed the front end i have not changed anything but the code will be deployed on the matic networks this is so exciting and this is so easy that's why you know we say that we have a good amount of adoption so just you know truffle uh my great dash dash net to work matic and dash dash reset all right right so this is how you know this whole thing actually works uh let me just you know have this copied and paste it over here and then run it have i saved okay i've now saved the file now it will work source dot env all right see so i have not changed anything right i just copied the mnemonic that was required and it gets done i just have added some few lines of code let's just count 14 to 19 that's just five lines of code and i'm able to you know deploy the the whole decentralized application on the truffle on the matic networks you can you know even you know we can just copy the transaction ash and just see it on the you know the block explorer biomatic you can just see see this is working right so i'm able to do the same thing without changing the code right i just have to add some code snippets and your application becomes blazing fast right with low gas cost and things like that lots of benefits coming off layer 2 right so this is the whole benefit of being a part of the matic ecosystem right so this is this is all you know i had to show now the thing is let's just you know try to interact with the application deployed on the matic networks right npm run dev right so you can see here right so this is the contract deployed let me just switch to the first all right it has 1200 tt and let me just try to transfer so you know i have to be on the magic test network to actually make this happen right i have to if i have to interact with the application which is deployed on the matic network then i have to you know do this rpc url thing and then start you know testing the matic network or you know start uh interacting with the decentralized application build on the matic network and this is something you know which causes customer friction and that is sometimes you know might lead to some kind of problem let's say you know if i have to transfer this particular thing i have to be on the matic network and then only i'm you know see a matic test net and don't then only i'm able to you know do this particular activity so to say right let me just reject it for now what i'm trying to tell you got it right so this particular application i have to first of all you know just go here change the rpc url and then i have to interact with the application deployed on the matic network and this causes customer friction and for that particular thing at matic we for us the decentralized application and the experience that user gets for the apps deployed on the matic networks matters the most and because of this particular you know uh customer friction that my talker we have you know uh created a particular uh function for that but which is known as the network agnostic feature that you can you know include in your decentralized application right that is known as network agnostic transactions i'll just give you a small demo of how network agnostic transactions work out and you know without changing the rpc url may you be on any network you can interact with your decentralized application cashlessly without using you know any uh um any of the uh gas that is required for example right now if i transfer something i'll have to pay some fees right this is the fees that i have to pay right now for doing any kind of transactions or you know for interacting with the application deployed on the matic networks as well so let's just see the how the network agnostic transactions actually work out okay let me just clear this first right and now i'm going to the network agnostic thing right so first of all for that particular thing we'll first of all require the relay infrastructure to actually work out so how this particular thing works is that first of all uh you know there is this application decentralized application and then there is this relay infrastructure uh for the demo that i have used i have used my own relay infrastructure i have created my own relay infrastructure but you can use one by economy or you know you can even use uh gas station networks right so by economy has created a maxi sdk using that particular sdk the relayer is already created you can just you know import that particular sdk and start using it to do gas list transactions so what happens is that your decentralized application that is created interacts with the relayer and the relayer does the transactions on your behalf on the blockchain right so it just uses your eip712 signature and puts that on the blockchain right so you just don't have to have you know gas you just have to sign the transaction what that means you just need to have a public private key and then you are done you can you know interact with the decentralized application what you are doing with the centralized application but with the power of ethereum right so if i've done so much of uh you know uh good good good stuff about this particular thing let's see how this particular thing works right first of all this is the relay that i have you know first of all created you can see right this is the layer that i have created three layer infrastructure that i have created so first of all i have to roll that relay infrastructure out node server index.js this is the relay i've created by the way all the code that i'm going to do you will be able to get that i'll give you the repo at the last of the you know my presentation so that you can yourself also try it out i would recommend just go ahead and try this particular all of the processes that i've you know explained from remix through truffle and to network agnostic features so that you also can fell in love with matic as i have right so this is the second thing now so first of all i have rolled out that you know the the relay infrastructure that was required now i will go ahead and just uh you know deploy this particular thing right so open right we can see here uh next connect all right so we can see here i just hope the network the relay is deployed yeah relay is working and we have you know just rolled out our application so you can see here let me be on any you know let me be on ethereum mainnet let me be on any you know uh so to say per se let me be on any of the networks doesn't matter why because i'm using network agnostic feature of this particular whole infrastructure which uses meta transactions all right so i am on ethereum mainnet you can see here i have zero ethereum right right now zero ethereum i'm on ethereum mainnet let me do a transaction all right let's do a transaction sign this particular transaction and the transaction gets executed despite me having zero ethereum you can see here right gaslessly i'm able to interact with the blockchain if you you know can't believe just go ahead and see this particular uh thing just go ahead and see you know block hash this is the block hash let's just go ahead and paste it over here our very own explorer and just see see the transaction got executed right so this is the best part about network agnostic feature you just need a public you know you just need a public private key pair and you will be able to do the transactions very very seamlessly without you know carrying on which network you are right so this is this is the best part you know one of the great great features of the matic networks now the last you know so as i told you you can also try it on your own these all the features i'll paste this particular link bit dot ly slash matic uh you know network this is the documentation i have you know first of all explained you uh how the rpc ul is set and things like that you can find all the documentation over here the last thing which i want to cover is bridge right so if let's say you have a asset already deployed on the ethereum network you have an erc20 token you have an erc 1155 token you have a erc 721 token whatever the uh the asset may be you can transfer that asset from the ethereum network to the matic network using a bridge that matic has created right so you can use a pause bridge or a plasma bridge that depends on you know on what kind of security you are wanting so how the bridge actually functions is that there is a predicate contract deployed by them first of all you know you will have to go to the uh this particular matic dot uh this particular you know website let it open right just go ahead and request a particular transact you know you have to request the mapping to be done right once this particular thing gets approved what happens is that you will have just have to you know just go ahead and uh uh what will happen is that there is a predicate contract deployed by the matic network on the ethereum networks right so this predicate contract so what will happen is first of all you will deposit cc so yeah this is the depart this is the approved contract using this particular approved function you will deposit your ethereum on the predicate contract right so they will get logged in the ethereum networks so once these particular assets get logged on the ethereum network the root chain proxy manager will be sent a signal right by the root chain manager that you know we have logged these particular transactions for that particular thing this particular you know approve a functionality is used right then the second thing that you have to do is do a deposit so once the predicate contract has locked and you know the signal has been sent to root chain proxy manager this deposit function will transfer your tokens from the uh from the uh from the ethereum network to the matic network so your assets have been transferred from the ethereum network to the matic network now let's say you want to transfer them back to the ethereum network so how that exit mechanism works is that first of all you will burn the minted you know uh tokens uh that have been created on the matic network you will first of all burn them and you will generate the proof of the burn on the uh you know your proof of the burn is generated you will just go ahead and just you know go ahead and put that proof of burn on the ethereum network so what essentially would happen is first of all you burn the burn the tokens on the matic network and then submit the proof on the ethereum network so you will be able to exit so what will happen is that predicate contract will unlock your tokens that you had created and you will be able to exit so this these are the scripts that you have to use first of all go ahead and map your tokens right then you have to approve so that predicate contract locks your token then deposit so that you know your uh tokens are transferred or in other words there is a minting that happens on the matic network then if you want to exit you can burn and submit the proof of the burn on the matrix networks so that's that's that's pretty much it of how the whole feature works we started with remix and saw how breezy easy buttery it was to deploy on the matic networks just we have to change the rpg and it will be able to do it similar is the case with truff um truffle just change five lines of code and you're deployed on the matic networks then we did something about network agnostic transactions how to make the user experience as good as possible giving the experience of web 2 while being on web 3 then we discussed about token bridge how you can transfer the tokens already deployed on the ethereum networks to the matic network using uh using the lock mint and burn uh feature right so this is this is all about it uh so so you know as arjun was telling developers love matic why because we have provided the whole infrastructure that is required for actually you know uh making a application work pretty much every oracle services that exists like chain link band chain razer provable are on matic network chain live chain link was the first chain after you know ethereum network which deployed on the matic network right and uh so the so similar is the case razer will be deploying very very soon all these oracle services are available on the matic networks as well all uh you know the popular wallets that are there are you know uh somewhat on the matic networks like for photomatic metamask we just tested fortress tourists all of them are on the matic network truffle we were able to test ganache uh remix id tenderly all of them are using matic network you know can be utilized for matic network so pretty much every infra that is present meta transactions for meta transactions by economy gsn right all of them are there on the matic network and that's what makes the whole ecosystem work properly right at last what i would suggest you guys is go ahead and test all the activities that we did in this particular workshop using this link that i'll be pasting in the chat yeah then you can take it from here sure thing thanks thanks um for covering all that um so what i'll also do uh you know is just cover some of the other things about the network which would you know sort of uh lend color to uh some of the things which plan i was talking about let me just quickly share my screen so just like how uh pranav was sitting so we we've tried uh so so we we've tried to create a sort of uh so so here at matic we consider ourselves a developer first kind of ecosystem like everything is focused on making things easy for the developer with the mindset that if developers are given all the tools and a high performance sort of network then they'll be able to build the kind of customer experiences right which which will attract many many uh users and even web 2 users to sort of come and you know experience uh sort of uh blockchain b apps um so again that being said like uh also wanted to say that we have very comprehensive dev tooling so all your typical oracles like your chain link band tracer uh provable are you know work out of the box it also the upcoming uh newer oracles like api 3 dr data a few others are also deploying on matic and all of those should be live by possibly the mid of feb um all popular wallets are supported automatic so metamask you want to use fortmatic porters taurus arcane has got a you know wonderful wallet as well if you want to use that solution uh similarly all your build test tools meta transactions you can use bi economy or gas station network whatever have you also additional tools like for example uh if you if you don't want to use uh let's say you don't want to use infuria so you can use some of the infrastructure from block widget uh which is one of our partners which is working on providing that infrastructure you know if you want to sort of use something else um um so so you know we have very comprehensive dev loading so it's essentially an environment where the developer has you know uh it makes it really easy for any developer to uh sort of uh create apps or port apps to matic as planned i've already showed you guys um some of the other things which i also wanted to cover so we've got great documentation so i would encourage you guys to um go through our website go to our developer documentation um you'll find some examples there as well so if you want to try something you know there'll be uh examples there to help you and understand you know what what are the steps you need to take apart from that we also do lots of campaigns and promotions so if you uh if you follow matic on twitter you'll see that we do a lot of promotions for a lot of the apps on our ecosystem so as an infrastructure provider uh as a side chain or a blockchain like you know our objective is that you know if sort of so the way we think about it is if the apps on our ecosystem succeed so we automatically succeed so i think all you really need to do is just help 30 apps on ecosystem and that's what we try our best to do so we do all sorts of different types of promotions launch campaigns we also have things like grant support so for example uh you know micro grants for to help cover developer house things like that for teams you know looking to sort of uh experiment with matic build on matic you know connect with like you know influencers things like that um at the same time you know we run several developer support programs so for example uh we've got a build and on program which is our accelerator so they were almost like i think 30 day apps last time in the last cohort or the new cohort will come up at the end of know at the end of uh i think february um apart from that we also have you know we're supporting we also have sort of a d5 program where we put put aside a certain sort of amount of funds to you know help grow the d5 you know sort of ecosystem and as you can see with market make and any major you know sort of hackathon which happens globally you know we always support them all each events so we support like a huge number of hackathons we we also provide sort of customer you know sort of developer support programs custom developers more programs for teams which need a specific kind of you know sort of grant funding so we open to that as well so these are some of the things we do uh to help help the ecosystem succeed um and you know again um you know a lot of exciting other updates are going to be coming uh out you know in the news about my take over the pa over the next uh you know we've got some big d apps launching things like that so you know all of those news all of that news will be out on twitter um so you know be sure to follow us and yeah and and you know i really hope that you know this this presentation was helpful and and it was able to give you a good flavor on on not just matic from a technical perspective but also like what we're trying to achieve what we're trying to do um and and if you have any questions at this point just feel free to ask us you know in the chat uh we'll be happy to cover anything uh you know ecosystem related or tech related or you know about any of our programs um and you know so i can i can cover that as well so yeah thanks so much arjun and thanks pranav that was a really great session uh i see you've already been answering a lot of the questions yeah actually yeah you've already forgotten yeah that being said now that i've covered this i'm gonna just leave my uh telegram id there in there as well so if you guys have you know any interesting ideas you know you're looking to develop um front of operanos put is there as well so you can get in touch with either me or pranav and and you know if you have any interesting ideas already you know you you part of market makes already you i'm sure you guys are already thinking ahead of you know exciting things to build um and if you have any specific other interesting ideas you know things you want to just discuss with us or have any questions about thematic network um you know i'm you know

so just just feel free to reach out to us you know for us you know a sense of community and is something that's very important that's the reason blockchain was invented in the first place you know to

you know we will respond to your questions thanks agent yeah and you guys can also reach out in the sponsomatic channel under market make as well and um you you can also just drop your telegram chat um tags in that chat channel as well because obviously when zoom closes they won't have access to it anymore so you can drop it there as well um has anybody got any other questions for the matic team you can feel free to unmute yourself or drop your questions in the chat now and if you don't have a question right now you can also reach out in the channels thematic team is there to help i think there's a question about widget um is there anything specific uh i think it's sri ragu raman anything specific you'd like us to cover about the widgets also there's a couple of ways you can use widgets you can use them to for example like let's say it's a defau in a d5 app you want to let's say um you want to do a like a inbuilt fiat on ramp right so so within your website somebody can do the fiat on wrap and then use the d5 as well so so feared on ramp on automatically supported uh you know through a transact transact.com um you can use fiat on ramp they'll soon have off map as well if you want to buy matic on on the ethereum network you can also use moonpay um we'll also soon be integrated with ram.com and a few other uh payment fighters as well uh with respect to the widget right i would encourage you to check out um yeah check out defense so these guys um yeah so so i would suggest sriracha ramen you can check out defend.network so defen has used this uh widget to you know do this kind of on-ramp kind of thing and you can use it for different things it's a widget at the end of the day you can you know put like you can maybe do something interesting and add some interesting options there so so yeah so feel free to check that out i think they'll give you a very good idea also you know so the faucet for matic is dot matic dot network so you can uh so that will allow you to get uh sort of tokens for both all the networks so for example if you want to use on on the main net or or if you want to for example get that on the test net you can there are options there just just check it out um all right so gavin plans to use matting and avagoshi definitely man have a gucci ava gucci has got an amazing project and it was an interesting case for us because avagochi skipped ethereum directly went to matic because they realized that if you want to do anything serious at scale on nfds you got to do do it you know on a network like matic where transactions are literally free so you know i encourage you to check that out um anything else guys anything else you want us to cover technical non-technical um all right great i think i think we've covered most of the questions for now but then again just like uh what if you need matic on the main net all right so you can just check out uh you can check out this or you know you can just use trans transact.com so if you have existing funds on the ethereum layer one you can use wallet.matic or network to get them onto uh matic and then uh you know or you can use transact they have like on their website they have this like inbuilt widget kind of thing where you can just put in your credit card information whatever and just buy uh buy crypto directly onto the matic network so using transact you can buy matic if you like or i mean matic tokens and you can also get usd uh usdc uh die like you know stable coins uh flash flow normatic yeah so you have uh so you know let me just yeah easy fire you can just check out easy five on matic so easy five is sort of like a compound kind of a fork which allows you you know things things like does matic put the same 24k limit uh so when you say 24k limit do you mean in terms of mining the tokens uh like what what exactly is this yeah that was a question that came from youtube they may be elaborate okay okay that's okay that's okay so what we can uh what i would suggest is that if you just check out wallet.matic.network right um there is a there is a tab uh on on the top right so this wallet they'll also be staking right next to it so you can just click on staking and you'll get some details about the network the number of tokens locked number of tokens which are there so that'll give you a very clear idea of you know what the so i would suggest just check out wallet.market.network just on the top like horizontal bar there's like wallet there's taking as well and delegation and things like that so there's a lot of details there about how the token distribution is and things like that so i think that should cover matic setup on metamask for test net or mainnet so you can um yeah soprano shared that link for that staking quality automatically network forward slash taking right so um so so the setup on metamask you you can just check it out on our matic developer docs or let me in fact just uh see if i can uh uh give you that exact so yeah let me just let me just put that here right here so i've just put a link which will give you you know access to all the network details so if you want to set up like metamask a certain way you can just check that out also that will allow you to shift to matic network or test net and things like that on metamask i'm sure if you want to do like testing and things like that right also you know when i gave you that particular demo in that particular you know i use test rpc url you just have to change the chain id which is 137 for the you know mainnet and change the rpc url that's been shared over here the network details you can find and yeah we support mainnet and testnet both so yeah right so and our documents are very uh sort of quite comprehensive um so you know i think that should cover most of the common doubts with respect to anything specific comes up just feel free to reach out to us just like how emily said on on you know the discord channel uh anything specific like that and and you know just if you want to just experience matic right first time you know you you know developing developer aside i just encourage you to check out uh check out neon district very fun game check out mega crypto poli oh god i got that spelling wrong okay let me just make crypto polish very very fun game as well you can check out z run you can check out easy fire you can check out quick swap uh which is like a uni swap clone uh or rather fork on using swap v2 pokematic um and uh yeah it's a question from youtube bridge free issue raised by poly market any solution on the plan so it's already solved um so that was like uh that was something there was an update we had to make to our js files we did that uh mata.js that's all the problem also like we've implemented in fact other solutions as well so we are doing um sort of a fast exit kind of a solution along with two different teams so one is bi economy and one is connext so connext has come up with this vector node approach which is like a more decentralized sort of approach towards uh quickly moving liquidity from l2 to l1 like you know fast exit which is also secure but also exit by has also come up with this very interesting fast exit scheme where you can have two pools one on matic and one on ethereum so if you have usdc you have one pool here one pool here and whenever you move across the networks you are essentially you know your sort of balance will be added subtracted so in a way you know just simplify so by economy is trying that approach both are actually live um they're being tested right now i think we'll roll that out for the public and possibly another maybe a week or ten days once it's been you know once poly market has used it for at least at least two two weeks now that's that's kind of how it is um yeah uh yeah go ahead go ahead okay yeah also you know the poly market issue that you're talking about that's when you know you are transferring acids from ethereum to matic and matrix to ethereum so that particular gas that you have to pay is of the ethereum networks for depositing you know because you're essentially doing the transaction on the ethereum to transfer the tokens right so that's particular thing that's when you know there was a hype in the ethereum gas prices right but now with connext there is you know a state channel created that that particular approach and as uh uh arjun described and that will definitely get solved so yeah yeah so so we're working on like bunch of approaches once i think they're in production then that will make the process even smoother and sort of solve this uh little hiccup how many nodes secure so you guys can check out that staking system currently we have 81 81 nodes uh as of for today um and if you you can check out the details uh so if you just go to that link which uh let me in fact just share that link again um if you just check out uh wallet automatic network staking you can see all the different node details there you can see the number of nodes you can see all the different teams which have set up the nodes the delegation details uh if you want to for example you know if you want to buy matic uh and you know delegate you free to do that as well the apr api currently is pretty good um it's about close to about almost 28 30 so so yeah so you can check that out as well anything else yeah great thanks so much um a lot of great questions coming through and thanks for getting through all of those questions um yeah for anybody that has any other questions for the martech team
