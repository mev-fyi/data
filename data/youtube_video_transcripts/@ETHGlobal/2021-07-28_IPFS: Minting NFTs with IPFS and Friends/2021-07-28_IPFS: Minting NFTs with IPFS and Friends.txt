i don't want to delay this any longer so let's get this kicked off um awesome so yeah excited to have uh yusuf here from protocol lab side uh he's going to walk us through a nice talk about kind of minting nfts and putting them on ipfs and kind of doing all the cool stuff so it's really important you know as we think about nft is that uh we keep things as decentralized as possible ipfs provides an awesome layer for that um and of course as you think about getting started building with nfts i think usa he's just gonna be your guy to give you all the info you need uh so head over to yousef if you have any questions or anything feel free of course to drop them in the chat here i'll save some time at the end uh so that we can answer those questions as we go along um and yeah otherwise hope everybody enjoys the chat and i'll turn over to you yusuf thanks very much uh it's great to be here and um just go ahead and share my screen and find my slides which around here somewhere i expect there we go uh so um right so we're talking about minting nfts with ipfs and friends which is something we've been thinking about a lot lately at protocol labs uh it's for you never heard of them before it's a thing on a blockchain basically it's a an nft is basically like a record that lives on some blockchain machinery somewhere and it can be owned and bought and sold so some key properties of an nft right it has a unique identity inside of a smart contract or a similar record that's being maintained on a decentralized blockchain network maybe own transferred to a new owner and this is not neces like a intrinsic property but it's true of most systems today where it's that a nft can generally only store a very small amount of data directly inside the record because blockchain data storage and smart contract systems has to be quite expensive because you need global consistency everybody has to come to agreement from the state of the world and that that costs a lot a lot when you start talking about lots of data um and but then to get work around that uh limitation you have links right so most nfts in the world today are essentially like fancy hyperlinks they have a reference to some asset on metadata that lives off chain right so outside of the blockchain network uh usually just using a uri so that's um there's an interface for nfts um there's several now because there are many blockchains and smart contract platforms well i often will speak about ethereum as if it's the only blockchain that's just because i had been working with it most recently but um and of course it was sort of the initial proving ground for mfgs where the whole idea kind of emerged but there are other blockchains of course and they have unique properties that get well into the weeds about at some point um but for now we're just i want to sort of drive home this message which is that http like the traditional hypertext transfer protocol that we use for regular web browsing stuff is not a good fit for linking from an nft record to something in the external world because um you know they're great they're familiar they work everywhere that's that's a huge advantage but they're fragile they like are inherently location based right so when it when you have a web link it's going to have a domain name or an ip address maybe but either way that points to a specific machine and then that points to it and then you'll have a file that points to like a particular location on that machine or the server can do whatever you want with that but there's no guarantees about what's going to come back when you get that url it's just not the way the web works like you can hit a url today and get something completely different tomorrow and you know somebody may have bought the domain or the website owner decided to change it for whatever reason and so that kind of breaks the fundamental you know premise of the nft as a durable you know record of um information and storage because like if you think about what you're actually purchasing right like when you if you buy an nft the that durable information that's written in the blockchain will never change but if it's just a fail link then that doesn't really help you out very much so but we think we have a solution for this in ipfs which is something you know ipfs has been around for a long time and it sort of came the nft use case just sort of fell into place with it so it's it's a really good fit um the way ipfs works right first of all you add your data to it uh and to ipfs on your local machine and it gets uh you know chunked up into pieces and we generate this thing called a content id which is a cryptographic hash of all the data that you have so this one little string it's like you know maybe 40 odd characters of random gibberish that string can be used to locate and fetch the data from anybody else who has a copy and when you get the data back you can compare it to the original strand and validate it so that means that you can sort of must but verify in a way that like if somebody is sending me data and in response to my request here then i can say okay i know for a fact that it's going to be the exact same data that i handed over to them and i don't have to care who gives me the data because i can always validate that it's correct right so ipfs uses this to build this big peer-to-peer information carrying network right so we have nodes all over the globe and people add their data to ipfs i can give my ipfs content identifier the cid to anyone and they can fetch it and whatever is the closest node will respond quickest and i'll get it from them um and if they only have a piece of it i can get the other piece from somebody else so it's cool and it's uh and it works it's been around for a while but there are um and the reason it is a good fit for nfts i should say is that you know we have this that string that content identifier never changes right it's always tied to that one piece of content so there's no danger that like somebody else is going to buy out a domain name or anything like that it's just as long as ipf exists that link will be valid but that there are you know if everybody um gets rid of it so there's some caveats the first is that if nobody is storing it anymore like all the people that um the ipfs knows forget about the content then it's not retrievable anymore although if somebody event later came and added it again you could still use the original link so it is still possible in the ipfs world for data to kind of disappear just if nobody has it online at that moment and the other caveat is that that um that can't happen periodically if uh like when you add your data so you add your data to ipfs it kind of spreads through the network naturally and people keep a copy locally that kind of helps propagate it and helps like share the load of um and retrieving that data but all those copies are kind of temporary and they'll get garbage collected so that means that we want to fill up everybody's disk you know indefinitely so we'll run periodically a little cleaning algorithm to say oh well you haven't told us this data is important so we'll just flash it aside so you can't really rely on like the generosity of the ipfs network to store your stuff but you can sort of contract that out to people and say like hey would you please we call it pinning would you please remember this piece of data and keep it online for me so you can either do that on your own ipfs machines or you can do it through a service like uh there's a ecosystem of beginning services that will do this for you and then you run ipfs nodes and keep your content online um but we at protocol labs are you know when we say so nfc is kind of taking off into the public consciousness and you know it's february march for this year um we're like hey well this is amazing like we should make it super easy for people to use ipfs and use it in a way that we think you know is sort of future-proof because the downside of well the role it is downside but like one thing to keep in mind when you're building for blockchains is that when you write data it's it's forever like you can't easily change it after the fact so you know it's nice to if you you know can sort of make sure that everything is all in a good format for the future and we think i get that has some things to say there and to help so uh we built this thing called nft.storage and it's a probably it's one of the easiest ways to get data to ipfs or to use ipfs without having to install anything because we're running as hosted service it's um you know sort of like an onboarding point into ipfs and then from this ips layer where everything is sort of easily retrievable by this decentralized network we're also persisting all the data that is stored through nft data storage to filecoin which is our other crazy decentralized storage project which is in fact itself a blockchain network although unlike ethereum it doesn't currently support arbitrary smart contracts but what it does support is large volumes of data storage so the way filecoin works basically is you have all these storage providers that basically run data centers and rent out storage capacity and they'll prove that storage like when you you can contract out to like hey i've got a big chunk of data give it to these storage providers and um this is sort of the nft storage flow kind of but sorry backing up a second without nft storage in the mix you can store data directly on filecoin in this decentralized way nft storage kind of eases the path for you by aggregating lots of small pieces of data and making like really attractive deals to the storage providers to say hey like this is this data's in the format that you like it and all this stuff and so we're like taking on the overhead of managing these biocoin deals and all this and we're also providing it as a free service because we want people to use it as much like nft data that is backed up by filecoin and you know on ipfs as we can get because we think that this is a great use case for ipfs and also we think you know this will help bootstrap filecoin and kind of really you know be a good public resource because as more and more digital culture gets kind of like encoded in nft form i think that you're going to start to see you know unless we're careful we'll see a lot of those nfts just kind of disappear as we've seen on the web where you just can't trust links to stay around like if if anybody i don't know i grew up in a web where i had a big well-organized bookmarks folder and when you come back maybe even like a year later at least like 40 of those links are gone and now i they'll only work around that by keeping local copies of everything that i really need to remember so filecoin is kind of like and the whole you know blockchain ecosystem in general is trying to build this alternative path where we can have these really durable digital artifacts and we think that nft storage is kind of like the first or one of the first steps to bridge the gap between the web we have today where it's really easy to use so nft storage is trying to be easy to use in that sense of like we have a very simple javascript api uh it's http so you can you can do it from a browser or from whatever language you want um but then from that sort of entry point it goes out onto this decentralized storage network where then other decentralized systems can interact with this public data and using this content identifiers and stuff so we think it's really cool and you know um will hopefully broaden the accessibility of this whole ecosystem which can be a little intimidating when you're especially first getting used to it all these new concepts um so if you go to nft.storage it's free sign up for an account uh through email or github and then you have the javascript client that makes building stuff really easy and it the one of the nice features too is that like we had we're a little opinionated in this uh store method which i think is the recommended method here about the shape of your metadata because we think you know that's one of those things where like you want to be compatible with everybody so it's good to kind of adhere to a standard if you can and so we kind of guide you in that direction here so if you use the api as it's you know written out here it just does the right thing for you and formats everything with ipfs links the way that you know in a way that plays nice with their ecosystem um so we have a bunch of clients in different languages and these i'll talk to the http api um i'm jumping ahead a little bit so along with nft.storage um we've been building this thing called nft school and it's still pretty early here you can see well this screenshot is a few weeks old so we've chipped away at a couple of these little under construction signs but we are still building it so it's you know you can see the ambition on the walls as it were but i personally would appreciate it if anybody wants to go check it out because i've been building some of these example apps and writing tutorials and things and it's been fun working on it but i need input or what's the most important thing to do next so you can help me out there um in a minute i'll show one of the example apps and we can so get into the weeds about how nfts actually work under the hood so uh yeah let's do it i guess i'll do this real quick um and then after that we'll have some quite q a and just talk about nfps and ipfs and filecoin and all that so uh let me switch over here and nope not there yeah i think i need to there we go so that so yeah for a demo of how this all fits together um using nft storage and kind of using ipfs um i figured it might be nice to talk through one of those ft school examples that i wrote because it's a pretty decent you know sort of intro to how this can work there's a lot of ways to kind of do this i mean there's a bunch like i was alluding to earlier just off the different blockchains and there's lots of reach blockchain there tend to be lots of different tools and stuff so nft school is kind of our attempt to lay out you know some opinions about here's a sensible way you can do it and then also we want this to be a community endeavor so we're soliciting it you guys have opinions about how it can be done please tell us but for now i'm going to tab over to this terminal and we'll start it up and see what's going on so we have this repo that you can check out from github and i'm going to run a little mini development blockchain um this is a ethereum and basically it's just running on my laptop and now i'm going to deploy a copy of this smart contract i'll show you the code for that so see there's nothing up my sleeve it's a very simple contract where um you call the mint token function and that you know increments a little counter that's to become the token id and then you give this metadata uri which is how you link out to the real asset so the way that nfts tend to work is you'll you'll link directly from the blockchain to a metadata manifest which is almost always a json object and then from there to whatever other media like images and videos and things that you might have so that's how this is structured it's using the sort of original erc721 standard which is the first formal nft standard to be like adopted by the ethereum community um so yeah it's just it's there's nothing fancy here and it's not a production ready or anything like that but it's just there to demonstrate how the process works um and so then if we go back over here we can start our little uh front end and that'll take us off to a little react app which is um yeah not the prettiest app in the world but it's um it has some interesting functionality if you click through because it's based on a very cool um starter project called scaffold eth which comes with lots of batteries included for ethereum development so um we can get some like fake money to play with here it's just a little bit of like yeah pretend ether um and then we pick something to uh come in uh yeah so this what this is going to do is upload this image and some metadata to nft.storage and that storage is going to make it available in ipfs and file coin and then the service is going to give me back the ipfs cid for this whole nft bundle and then the code here which uh tab two in a second is going to take that cid let's talk through the code so hopefully you guys can see this and it's not too tiny but so we're making an nft storage client we are going to call that store method with our metadata here and then it's going to give us a cid and a metadata uri that we stuff into our smart contract and then that's basically it that we call the mint token function contract and then we have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed and we get the token id out of the little transaction receipt so that's uh if you want that you know click through this yourself there's links to the code and explanations and stuff on that eatschool.dev article um so then back over here we can on this little site we can say okay like show me the token and it will go and fetch it again from ipfms so this time it took a second because i had to go fetch it from ipfs just from my laptop um yeah so that's kind of a quick example of how you can mince an nft easily with nft.storage if you want to do like the sort of uh like i don't want to trust scores i want to do everything myself route you could check out um on the ipfs doc site there is a guide to minting nfts with ipfs where you use a local ipfs node and it talks about you know the things you would want to do if you were going to set up your own infrastructure or use a remote pinning service or something like that for persistence uh but we are like i said we're really excited about nft.storage and i think you know if you guys want to join the party there that would be great the more nfts we're still wearing the happier we are so uh and i guess i open it up to some q a so we've got some stuff in the chat here so yeah um about the the pricing it is totally free we are subsidizing well it's an interesting relationship because we have this ecosystem of file coin storage providers right who are incentivized to like they they actually get economically rewarded through the protocol for storing useful data so um that's kind of an interesting economic equilibrium there that i honestly don't i'm not the guy to talk to you about that but that's one piece of the puzzle but then the other thing is like we just we really want to boot scraps please all right about the dog um so yeah the it is totally free it's going to be free for as long as we run it which we hope to be forever basically but we in the terms of service we're saying that if we ever have to shut it down we'll give you 90 days notice by email so that you can find an alternate resistance mechanism one of the nice things is that like even if that were to happen none of your nft links would break because it really doesn't matter who is providing the persistence it's um you know that content identifier just needs to be somebody on ipfs has to have it so like you know if nft.storage goes away you can still like you know repeat that promise to whoever followed your nfp so yeah oh yeah if you want to do custom metadata um i think nfp.storage is still probably your best bet so um this mark in the chat is alluding to another secret project called with three dot storage which i'll have more to say about tomorrow um but yeah i think that you would still want to use nft.storage um because there is in addition to the store method you can just store blobs of data through it so you're not like into that standard metadata uh you can do it yourself if you really have strong opinions about it we just wanted to have like you know a nice default for people to use um the kind of youth process there but um yeah so oh thoughts on storing uri data to be accessed at meaning time um if you're talking about fetching data from a smart contract directly there is a thing i can probably find a link to real quick um about sorry the question is like the safe way to store uri data is be accessed at meantime time like a thousand uri metadata pre-made files and nfc is meant to fetch that so i was reading a blog post recently from chain link about audience and how they had for a large token distribution were fetching the sort of authorizations from ipfs as part of their smart contract function using an adapter that jane link wrote so let me see if i can find that link and i'll drop it in the chat but it's kind of interesting i haven't personally tried that so i don't you know that it's awesome or not but it was definitely a pretty interesting read um let me see here so there's a link in the chat and if you're not in our zoom chat you could just google chain link um ipfs audios and you'll probably get there and um yeah the there's some other interesting things that like with ipfs like and nfts we've been talking a lot about um like static data because that's the majority of nfps but we're also working on stories for evolving nfts over time but those are we haven't really written that out yet so that's something to kind of stay tuned to at nft school which is probably where we're trying to put some of those opinions in the future yeah all right um i think you might be running close to time here or does anybody have any last questions before did you all hear well all right well um this has been super fun if you guys want to get a hold of me personally i am you sef at protocol.ai that's probably the spectral and i'll be around at hackafest uh at least one more time for another vlog and i'll be around i'm on uh going to be on ipfs discord and photocoin slack and things like that awesome thanks so much for the chat um and yeah if anybody has any other questions of course yeah like i used to mention there's the ipfs discord there's of course the hack fs discord uh where there's a pro call labs channel or ipfs channel there as well so if you have any last questions or any questions that come up as you explore nft storage and other kind of related products uh that those other places not just me there'll be a bunch of labbers hanging around on various discords so feel free to grab one and you know thrill them about idfs online country awesome all right thanks so much and thanks everybody for attending and i hope
