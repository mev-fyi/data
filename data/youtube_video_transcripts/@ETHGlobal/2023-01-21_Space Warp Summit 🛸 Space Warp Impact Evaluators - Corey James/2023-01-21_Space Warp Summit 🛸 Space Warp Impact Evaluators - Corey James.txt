foreign [Applause] [Music] Corey up onto the stage uh to talk about the impact evaluator so Corey when you're ready feel free to share your uh your video and your audio welcome to the stage um and I'll get out of the way just letting uh you can take the premiere awesome well first off thank you so much Jacob and just all the amazing individuals the Brilliant Minds that I've gone into planning this event it's really just been awesome to see uh take shape and super honored and grateful for the chance to chat about something I think is pretty cool so uh my name's Corey uh and I work on protocol labs's um Network Goods team and specifically the network funding group so we work on sort of Novel funding mechanisms and incentive mechanisms um for allocating Capital towards public goods um and we we're doing this pretty interesting experiment I think over the course of space warp that's basically using these things called impact evaluator rounds to populate a public open Builders leaderboard so what exactly does that mean how exact how will you like really interact with it so I'll walk you through really kind of what what the steps are to to join this kind of initiative are and then I'm going to just tell you more about kind of like why it is that we're we're doing that so joining around really simply you can learn all about it just from this simple bitly limb link down there so uh bit dot l y uh Slash space warp IE um and the first step really simply for being eligible to participate is just submitting your own project so each team can be represented by one individual that can submit up to two projects but we typically recommend that you actually just submit one to try to concentrate your votes into into one initiative and that first round submissions are due on Monday so definitely be sure to once you have all of your sort of like the different eligibility pieces which you can read more about at that link things like your GitHub repo up and running and it's nice to kind of populate your your Project's profile with something like a URL or just um kind of fleshing out like the the really concise description of your project things that sort um check out that link and you can read all about the the round and it has the form in which you can submit your actual project so then you'll actually join once you put your project into the round as an evaluator to assess what you feel is the quality of the other projects participating in that round so I'm going to dive into this in this next slide but basically you're signing up for protocol labs's impact evaluator tool on Monday where you'll have the chance basically to vote on other projects and allocate these things called voice credits and then submit that into the actual round so then the last piece is once all the projects are uploaded into the round um the different Builders do the evaluation process um you'll see we basically take those results and publish them into a public leaderboard format and then the top projects basically will win a portion of a 75k price pool which we've set up for the kind of overall initiative of the impact evaluated rounds so in total we're having seven rounds and there was four early Builders the members of The Foundry early Builders program an initial pilot round that happened just before or right in the middle of December and the next round coming up is again starts the 25th for voting but projects are due on the 23rd and so I just grabbed some screenshots so you can visualize like what exactly the voting will look and feel like but it uses this evaluation method called quadratic voting uh where you'll have um 50 voice credits that you can allocate basically to the different top projects that you feel are most valuable for the space or for fem those rounds will happen about every two weeks we're also going to try to do a live round [Music] in uh at basically East Denver so in Denver during all the festivities and you can see that the round size rose with time so it's important to join each round because you'll be able to filter the leaderboard which I'll show you on this next screen by either the most recent rounds results or the total votes um so this is a really early very lean wireframe of what the leaderboard is going to look like which it's scheduled to launch next week in a much more aesthetically pleasing and robust format um but you can see that the leaderboard basically has the updated um round results for the most recent round and for all of the total the total rounds that that project has participated in that's actually the real leaderboard votes uh with the total votes being sort of a mock-up doubling the pilot round but that is the the places one through six from the most recent round um for just kind of a fun FYI so basically you'll be able to see and learn more about the project on the leaderboard by like expanding and seeing more kind of details about it and you'll have a really cool opportunity to basically showcase your work to the community and the rounds will go on actually beyond the end of the hackathon so all the way up until the end of March and in total it'll be this place where you can learn more about the other projects that are building on fem you can see this kind of like Community aggregated sense of what is seen as like the most valuable projects and those that are participating in both the project submission and in the evaluation process will be eligible to win from the prize pool so all the details you can find uh here at this link which is bit.ly backslash space warp I.E and if you do have any questions or anything of the sort you can definitely reach out to me I'm in the um all basically all the channels but another good easy way to do so is emailing impact dot dash evaluator at protocol.ai um so thank you all so much for your time if you have any questions definitely please feel free to reach out and best of luck to all the hackers awesome thank you Corey um and I think also if anybody is kind of looking back to karthik's earlier presentation you'll note that we're going to do weekly check-ins for the hackathon anyway um so really we're asking very similar information to the form that Corey just mentioned uh so you're already doing the work so you might as well sign up and be on the leadership board so um awesome well thank you very much Corey
