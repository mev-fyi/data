foreign good uh hi hello hello uh good evening uh good afternoon good morning or good night um i do not know where you are dialing in from but i do hope it's from all over the world just as we had over the last few days participants from all over the world here at the eth global and zora hackathon metabolism hackathon um my name is mikhail based in berlin i am part of the zora team and being also one of the co-organizers of the hackathon and the last few days have been incredibly exciting for us um i'm really not exaggerating i really really mean it that the things that have been happening over the last few days were um absolutely unbelievable and i want any of you who might have participated as a builder as a designer as an artist or just as an audience member uh to thank you for your time for your work for your giga brain giga brain galaxy brain even ideas and all the beautiful things that you have built um and i'm quite excited also to see what the jury has picked from i think nearly 100 submissions that we got um on sunday for the hackathon the jury was deliberating yesterday i've heard it was a very thorough and tough process they were fighting for the greatest ideas and the prices will be announced um tomorrow so i hope that you of all people and your team have uh won um so we have also today a wonderful program for you a digital summit that will explore a few ideas that i think and all of us things especially you know here zoro we think are very worth and important to pay attention to when we think about web 3 as an ecosystem when we think about web 3 as a social space when we think about web 3 the technological space or as i like to call it as a techno social space which combines all these wonderful things into one ever-growing wonderful rhizomatic network of ideas technologies communities and all the wonderful people embedded within and um when we talk about you know web 3 very often and especially also within the context of a hackathon very often focus on the technology so we focus on the code we focus on on the solutions and very often and very utilitarian that's like somewhat technocratic aspects of these technologies but ultimately these technologies are way more they do manifest um also social political realities they are not just code you know within stories are embedded within that um whole identities are embedded amplified and hopefully also also empowered and some of these things we wanted to explore now that you know you've had all the workshops you had all the intros you had all the technological deep dives you came out with more wisdom than ever about what it is that you're trying to build but um today we will dive into into the more social aspects of it not not just we'll also have a couple of technological things let me have a look by the way i do this for the very first time so if this is um a little bit rough around the edges um for example you know this slide should have been shown already a few minutes ago but here is me um um two years ago and by the way opium hum that's like how you find me on on all the social media uh channels opium said by the way my dj name so if you ever go to a club you see opium homelands and so at the let's go to the today's schedule so what are we actually you know exploring today if we talk about you know all of these ideas that i kind of try to introduce to you so one of the things that we really would like to pay attention to is gauss so the idea of a dao has kind of changed over the last 18 months to two years which used to be really really technocratic kind of fully unshamed tools of governance those tokenomics has also a little bit um changed into a cultural signifier of sorts so web three native communities that want to signal that they are using a web3 technologies um they call themselves often a dao even though sometimes the technological aspect of the dao are not quite there yet or might not be the priority but nonetheless it's really really important um category and one thing that we've seen is a lot of the of the projects that we've seen over the last 18 months are cooperatives you know they are vehicles for co-production and this is something we would want to dive into with a couple of participants that are really native to web 3 but also come from the culture industries and particularly you know andrea mcdalena from shisetso which is a group of women and femme and queer people in the media and art industries and what i'm particularly excited about elijah who is an absolute legend of uk grime and bass music and music industry heavyweight in ukane she will be joining us as well on top of cersue who all of you probably know and izzy from refraction now and and after that we are going to talk a little bit about how these technologies were 3 technologies in particular can be used for agency how to manifest agency what agency really means especially within the context of politicized bodies so um when we talk about you know building technology that contains equity the question is you know what kind of equity and for whom and i do think that in particular you know trans and queer communities uh that very often are not at the center of when such technologies are built have a unique opportunity using these technologies for not only empowerment but also for building very very resilient ecosystems and this is going to be a panel that is co-presented by our friends from mutual laws a wonderful group of people that you should most certainly um follow like everyone on these panels please please i find them all incredibly inspiring and so will you follow them and a whole new world will open for you uh a no whole idea space um let's see oh yes han von and dobel legendary like this is an artist who was making nfts because nfts before nfts were even invented that is how long he's been doing web 3 and blockchain based art one of the very first artists to ever do an artwork on on chain and he will deep dive into his creative process and um wrapping things quickly up we also will look into the emerging ecosystems of web 3 music so web 3 music is not just minting songs that's one-on-one nfts but they are already whole economies and ecologies of web 3 native ecosystems emerging from on-chain digital audio workstations down to what does that actually mean you know to to bring music on chain and one aspect that scholars and scientists and also builders have been arguing about a lot is metadata standards and even if it sounds boring to some of you it's incredibly important because it enables so much and then something that i'm particularly excited about is um imanibello will join us from france she is a lawyer that is particularly um focused on ai and innovation law and given the fact that the last few weeks were all dominated by conversations around um artificial intelligence whether it's art whether it's not art she will um deep dive um with us into the ethical implications of these new emerging technologies and also the economies that will result from it so this is what we have for now um and um i'm gonna kick it off with the first panel um very glad that is hosted by one of my absolutely most favorite people uh in web 3 jose okay jose on on on twitter and he's joined by andrea magdalene from shisetso isia kampo from refraction dao uh amir aka sirsu from black hand and the man like elijah um i think that's that's about it um let me just uh talk to the production whether we are ready to go live this is a very professional uh uh broadcast by the way so we have people in my ear um what's all attendees present is the host present are we okay to go live we are good to go so please friends enjoy awesome thanks for that setup mikhail um excited to have this conversation with everyone here on culture community and capital um i just want to kick it off by thanking everyone who's here today and everyone who's watching first things to set things up i'd love for everyone to introduce themselves what organization they're here representing then answer the the question that i think uh we're really here to talk about which is um do you think dao's are overrated or underrated i'ma throw it to andrea first hi everyone a pleasure to be here thank you mikhail for the invitation i'm really in amazing company right here some friends i know some friends i'm about to make so um yeah great to be here overall so i am originally from romania and i'm the founder of she said so a global community of women gender minorities and allies in the music industry that's been around since 2014 and right now we're about 15 000 people 15 000 members distributed across 20 global chapters and we still operate in a web 2 way uh but definitely exploring what our future looks like in the web3 space given the fact that we finally have all the tools that we need to properly operate as a community as a collaborative community so excited to chat more about that andrea dao is overrated or underrated you have to answer it's a double-edged word um underrated i would say under it cool i'm gonna throw it to seriously next how you guys doing um i'm sorry sue uh i'm a designer um anthropologist i think a lot about uh agency and what we can do to create uh unique experiences for communities i think it's a designer like our responsibility is to be sort of like a shepherd that has a unique set of tools but also we are kind of a teacher um in enabling other people to take those same tools um and build things for themselves um but dao's um i was trying to find a great segue within that and the two things but i couldn't but i feel like daos are uh hmm i think contextually daos are underrated but i think the way most people look at or interpret a dao i think is incredibly overrated like there's a lot of people that make dallas for the sake of dao's because of the word or the the acronym i suppose and the fact that it's a it's like a term that can be used to capture interest or um you know at least when the bull market was going on like you know a lot of vc money without actually really seeing the the level of depth that uh cooperatives mutual aid funds and a bunch of other like uh preceding like ways of gathering and galvanizing community and organizing for funds or for actions or for the combination the two um they sort of disrespected the fact that they we have this long history of of self-organizing and so like we're saying oh dallas of the future and so i think i think it was overrated in that context because it really um downplayed a lot of the hard work that many of our uh preceding people have put put together excellent thanks for sharing that izzy well thank you um i'm izzy i'm a musician music educator and i'm on the curatorial team at refraction i'm also the curatorial grants or creative grants lead at refraction um underrated or over i have to agree with all the points you're super brought up i think underrated as a coordination tool overrated in the sense that like a lot of the history around co-op squads and collectives kind of gets like a race the web 2 the web 2 organizing that's happened um but overall underrated yeah and last but not least elijah i am elijah i'm from east london um um i guess like my background's in dj in writing and my day job is like as an artist manager kind of spend a lot of time in clubs um and yeah i've got to meet people from all around all around the world um i guess styles for me are like underrated the kind of um a lot of communities that i come from i'm not engaging with them yet and i'm excited to see what happens when um people bring some of their communities that they have offline online and kind of broadly broadly connect with other people doing similar things globally um i think the internet has not to agree but um giving people a home away from um socials would be like the stronger we can get that about cool so the first question i have here that i want to start off with andrea is um you know uh community in web 3 often gets treated like a commodity right and she said so has global chapters and membership in the tens of thousands so i'm curious how do you define community and why was it important for you specifically to cultivate one that's a great way to start off because i was thinking about it the other day you know um i'm gonna go way back to my university days because i always felt that i went to university and wasted my time there i studied media and communications you know a degree that doesn't really take you too far uh but i then remember that my final dissertation was actually on the concept of collaborative work and the power of communities at the time ted was just kind of like becoming this big platform where you can you know learn really cool stuff that you wouldn't be able to get in university or you know traditional education and i was like oh wow this is like literally just generated by the people right for the people this is a really interesting concept so that's where i originally got inspired by um to to create she said so then i was mostly spending a lot of time in tech i was pursuing a career in tech and somehow i ended up with mixed cloud a music tech startup at the time i was employee number five i was really close to the founders and started diving deeper into the music industry which obviously is a very community you know relationship based kind of environment and a very collaborative one as well there's right a village behind each artist between each behind each release um but obviously i noticed that there were some things that were wrong with it in terms of inclusion and representation so i decided to do something about it inspired by a tech community um called ada's list that i was a part of at the time because i noticed that tech was talking about this thing called diversity but the music business was no no you know that's not something we care about as long as it doesn't drive profit sharing so um i was always inspired by tech tools basically and i created this community inside of a google group it still exists inside of a google group and multiple other platforms in terms of our local chapters around the world um when i first created it there was nothing like it apart from maybe one u.s organization that was a non-profit and it was a bit clunky and old and you know it wasn't really relevant anymore so we came in i was living in london at the time so she said still has a huge presence in the uk in europe i lived in london for seven years um and that's where that's where the community grew grew really fast uh but then obviously the music industry is a global environment it's a global ecosystem the word spread even further and then i started having all these people reaching out oh hey i really believe in what you're doing i really love the ethos you know men didn't feel um aggravated by it they felt included in this um you know cis man they felt included in this movement they felt like okay we're trying to you know fix things together and that was something that was very important for me to communicate from the get-go that we're here to create alliances and partnerships and you know collaborations um between all genders really but first we need us women to get together as a group and like sense check each other make sure we're not crazy this is actually something that all women are experiencing help each other out create a bigger voice and then you know show the world that hey we need to be listened to you know just hear us out um and as the community grew beyond the word of mouth level over the next you know three years or so we didn't have a website we didn't have a brand identity social media it was literally just that google group obviously as we scaled and all these local chapters popped up with their own sort of platforms it became more and more difficult to maintain this sort of consistent ethos and and the way in which we manifested that ethos um i i think it's still there if you know people hear about she said so through conversations i think that sort of those values are still carried there but in terms of operations how we manifest how we operate together to collaborate on you know curating playlists and curating events and all of that it's a mess i tell you it's it's hugely difficult and that's why you know i'm at this place where i'm exploring web 3 solutions because there's nothing in web 2 that is able to help us out you know and so for me to go back to your original question we are community means people coming together with shared interests and shared commitment because at the beginning there was a lot of shared interests and you know people asking asking asking for things and it was important for us to introduce this community rule that you first have to give something before you ask for something you know and that you can you maintain your commitment to the community as much as you take from it how you track that and how you manage that and ensure that it's the case and you reward participation you know the way we've done that so far has been very analog and very imperfect so i'm excited to explore these new these new tools available to us seriously you um you touched on this and i think elijah did as well so for for folks like andrea and the communities that elijah mentioned that are sort of like not yet tapped in or just curious or just getting started you've been around the block a bit i'm curious if you could speak to the ways in which you've seen um organic or more naturally formed communities kind of falter as they step into web3 and the ways in which that kind of web-free systems can sometimes trip you up or cause things to kind of go awry because there's uh edges that are difficult to understand if you're not kind of hip to what's going on oh man that's a great question um yeah i've seen so i think the one thing that a lot of folks uh one of the first things that trips people up is that and this is just not just like web 3 and dallas but this is just i think like the nature of crypto in general is that it's not a passive place like this requires a lot of real like active participation a lot of the time it it shouldn't it should still be healthy though it's not like you need to spend every waking hour doing this but because things start with you and like the the aspect of the permissionless like models that we're all kind of dealing with everything's opt-in right like or more so i guess the better way to say is it's like everything asks you if it's okay to do something like so without your without your wallet or without your key or like the means of you like engaging with this space nothing happens with with you in it right so you have to so you're almost in in a way like at the center of your own universe or gravity as it relates to web3 so was everyone else and so like how do you take like uh uh something that is so um i guess centered around your individual agency and pair it up with other people's ideas of agency to create something larger than yourself um and it requires all of you to be really really dedicated to the the cause of getting over the hump right because nothing in this space right now is is very easy or immediate except for the gratification of you send something to a wallet you automatically receive it right um so it's real good at hitting that dopamine on that aspect of it but everything else still requires human work which is often the hardest thing to do and you can't hack it um but the but if you have shared and aligned incentives to say hey let us all use this these like tools this ecosystem this environment because we see how like after we've laid the groundwork that it can start to flourish in ways that we couldn't have had like dreamed of before then that's what really catalyzes that type of like really unique growth um that you see in certain communities for example like fgb right like it started as like a small group of people just kind of sharing and like keeping in touch with each other and discord and it ended up turning into let's start inviting really cool and amazing like dope people uh that are curious about this space and are willing to try it and see how it organically grows into something larger and now it's like one of like the the best like social socially engineered spaces within web3 um but i think that the first thing that trips people up is not really understanding that um it's more than empowerment in this space it's it's all about capturing your agency and actually having it work for you or work like work for you in that sense um i think the second thing is like uh web3 inherently is financialized right like everything is a transaction whether that is real currency or social currency cultural currency somebody is exchanging something for something else um and many people in many ways if you don't have the right guard rails around what your project what your community is representative of then it it leaves room for folks to sort of interpret that for you or interpret that for that community and sometimes you can create a schism when you have folks that are only really interested in just the potential upside or the speculation of how big that upside might be or how wide or how vast like your community might penetrate a particular market or set of markets and so you have to always sort of remind people listen this is this is the intent of why we're here this is why we are you know pushing our funds together this is why we're uh communicating because we see this larger goal and it's okay if you want to speculate on that if you're passive if you're like i want to help because i see the value in this but i'm not going to contribute i think that's okay but what ends up getting an issue is when things get tough and markets get rocky then those same people come knocking and saying well what have you guys done yet like i put three ether in this when you guys started i bought another 10th worth of nfts and everything's like 70 off what's going on and it's like well i mean you believed in us you gave us the money to and to invest in what we're doing but like all good things it takes time um and and so that's the other thing that trips people up to when when folks come knocking and saying hey like where's my piece um you have to have the resolve and the fortitude to say well listen like rewards are comparable relate in relation to to um what you put what you put in but also what you contribute um and if you're a passive player then you are going to be sort of tied to the way the market is working and there are certain things that we can do to sort of mitigate that um but at the end of the day this is more this is a this is bigger than you um so i say like those are like really some of the the two biggest things that i normally see that that create breakdown both in the early stages of kind of porting existing communities into this new paradigm but then also folks that have already been native i think sometimes the financialization um hurts the most or hits the most more so than the collective like agency aspect of it yeah on that subject um perfect setup for something else i was thinking about which is a question for izzy um i'd love for you to maybe talk a little bit more in depth about refraction down what it is and i'm curious specifically with financialization being kind of a two-edged sword um you know do you think that refraction dial and the work that you all are doing could exist in a world without crypto and how are you navigating the the challenges that seriously just talked about that's a really good question um so refraction is a collective of music artists visual artists and i think people who just really generally appreciate culture um i think that maybe to answer your your last question first if i think that it could exist in a world without crypto yes i think so i think that coordinating people who are passionate and share values around music and art and culture is totally possible i think that coordinating at like this scale um probably not and i think trying to have incentive mechanisms that make people want to participate and and encourage them to like have investment in for instance like our creative grants program like being able to apply to the creative grants program and also like vote on the applications that we receive is not something that's i think done in this kind of really distributed way like there are obviously like grants programs and voting bodies and awards bodies that do this kind of thing but not where it's like your community is deciding essentially who's getting uh funds allocated and i think it's in a much less like stratified way where um i think with so many music and cultural organizations it's the same people who get shine and who get access and resources it's kind of like a snowball effect um and i think with refraction we're really focused on just people who are doing interesting and cool work and um because there's so much less of a focus on like one particular region or one medium um i think we see a lot of different artists that aren't like maybe the people that you know within music for instance like not the same people over and over again um i also think just in terms of like the way that i think about like red bull music academy a lot in terms of like what it did for music um a couple of years ago in terms of putting putting people on like doing really cool festivals um kind of like bridging the gap between like underground and mainstream artists and there's like probably to me i don't know if other people agree but like a really big vacuum in that space for like curating really really cool music and art festivals that um kind of like make connections for people and really um are really well curated and thought through and it's interesting because a lot of the people in refraction who like work on the curatorial side and tourist side like come from like they're not necessarily like crypto native like we have people from like a lot we have people from rbma we have people from um and i think that like because of the the tools and technology people are way more reinvigorated to like think about doing festivals and doing curation and doing editorial work um because they're not so focused on like oh i have to do some like really lame brand partnership with some like soda company um in order to pull this off it's way more about the people who are involved and everyone is um aligned around what matters um prioritizing artists thinking about like fair compensation like you know being being able to like really kind of like hand hold and like walk alongside artists instead of like being extremely exploitative and thinking about how can we get the most out of somebody um it's it's really a lot more about thinking thinking through you know what's best for a fraction is also like what's best for the artist that we work with um so it was a little bit long-winded but um [Music] yeah i think i think that what we're doing in some ways could be could be done in web 2 but i think because of the landscape probably not because a lot of people who do the work um have been burned or like lost faith and like legacy systems for doing this kind of stuff yeah and elijah in kind of a similar vein the communities that you work with the spaces that you're in you mentioned that a lot of them aren't yet kind of like plugged into what's going on in this space i'm curious about why you think that is and what what kind of hurdles need to be gotten over for them to to start to experiment yeah in music people are still working like in a pop star format so in campaigns you know like releasing albums and then going to send things to press and my manager is going to do this an agent they're not really thinking about you know the ways they can kind of always be on or be part of things even if they're at a certain level so you have this kind of weird bottleneck that happens with people that maybe have put out good work and have been platformed to a level they kind of get plateaued and they don't know what to do next they think oh maybe i'll do more pr maybe i can get onto a website that will give me better press i'm like no you should be joining the things where there's bounce off and and be giving as much as you're as much as you're taking but i don't think people are seeing it in that way most of the time so you kind of have this weird dynamic where um say like someone's releasing an album and then they'd be like hey elijah um i need a web-free strategy for this like can i make some nfts of my album like they don't know what what they're talking about or anything like that but they know that it's a space where there's a lot of artists and creatives but it's something that's nearly like an afterthought rather than um something that they're building into you know the way they're creating or something that they genuinely want to engage in with people and it's a shame because um in that i guess that two-year period where everyone was at home um a lot of people that i know and i'm sure most of us have battled with like not being able to kind of concentrate on creating or being part of communities and now there is this kind of other thing people just want to be outside they want to be at festivals maybe you know in the park and maybe not at a computer so much show just some of the best artists i know just won't i don't know use twitter or use a computer for beyond making the tunes and um i guess what i'm trying to do um is just be an easy bridge that's like hey there's someone doing this good thing or um people not fearing it and making it as part of their day-to-day routine like how they'll check instagram they would you know check in on this like thing that's going on and see another kind of pipeline of artists apart from the people that they might be you know sharing festival bills with or sharing club night bills with because there's so many people that are creating great work and like as he said but maybe not you know playing shows or already like being platformed that level but in these communities they're already there making good work something that they kind of just came to mind that actually wasn't kind of what i had prepped but i'm kind of curious to get your take on it maybe seriously as well um there's been i've noticed like a lot of artists talking about sort of the pressure that's put on them especially if they're in major label deals to like produce massive amounts of content right and it's like the the work of being an artist is not just the the production of the artistry it's the production of the marketing around it and to cirrus's point earlier a lot of stuff in web 3 does require this like proactive engagement and this ability to like get in the ring and stay in the ring so i'm curious from your point of view like are artists who kind of like move into this space potentially replacing one burden with another and if not like what's the what's the real net benefit to them ultimately because they still have to do some extra work right but what what's the what's the potential gain for there for them there uh i think it's depth to me like um i i think people have oh i've got to make 100 tunes instead of 10 it's like no it's like give an opportunity for people to understand the one tune or the you know two or three tunings that you're working on at a level that you might not like not doing instagram or tik tok um and really like i've been open to exchange like i thought this is maybe what i would have done or just having a conversation about things like a lot of artists i work with the i guess they put out work in a way that isn't conversational it was like i'm excited to release my song you listen bye and i think we're we're all getting so much more out of the exchange and the conversation and kind of back and forth for changing things and letting people you know obviously remix and play around with ideas maybe take it out of a musical space there's so much like it's like there's like yeah literally invite the possibilities when it's brought to the eyes but yeah usually things aren't framed that way from the beginning and maybe that's not in their head but i try and push people to let let let the art go like and let it you know play around into spaces that they might not be like familiar or comfortable with yeah just one question that i wanted to run by um all of you really so uh i'll say the question maybe throw it to one of you i'm curious how in this space you square the difference between sort of the co-production and co-creation of culture and quality control you know in other words um how do you maintain standards in a world where um dallas might be more prevalent more and more people might be collaborating together for a certain end result i'ma throw this seriously on this one first um that's a great question i think the for me it's like i approach it the same way i approach work art or just general life right like there's i know when people excuse me when they saw nfts a lot of people were like oh most entities are garbage and it's like well i mean that's kind of to be expected right like before any of us become good at what we do we do a lot of things wrong at first we do a lot of things that like we may not like that we like but it's not quite where we want it to be right and so there's always going to be like this aspect of i don't necessarily use the word waste but like just this output that we that we generate um that gets us closer and closer to our goal like if we all had the ability to do it like the exact way that we wanted to as perfect as we could the first time um you know i think we would have a completely different world that we'd be living in but we don't like we're we're reformed off of the mistakes that we make and and mistakes that are done publicly at least in this kind of forum um allows other people to collectively find ways to help solve issues so that you can make a better choice in the future and then also that can create a ripple effect for other people to make better choices it doesn't necessarily always work like that but that's sort of like me being optimistic um but i think like um uh the best way to to engage or to at least try to formulate quality is is always having a north star like what's the thing or what are the aspects that are guiding you along your process and do you have if we're talking about dallas for instance like are the are your core contributors your main community also aligned in that because as you're all collectively figuring out what looks good or what's good to put out then you can look at that north star as your guide and say well is it hitting these things and i think at a certain point in time you even interrogate what the north star is because maybe you've hit that point and now you need to go somewhere else um maybe you've you've you've decided that we've tried this aspect and it doesn't necessarily work so we need to figure out something else right um but it's always about having constant communication um and and developing alignment on um where to move uh and sometimes i'll even say this too which is kind of counter to daos but not really um that you don't need to rely on everyone to make a decision at all like all the time right like there are certain things that like require you to make a very snap decision and you should feel again that agency to do so and be okay because the community can back you right um it's not necessarily just going and doing a round robin and asking every single person are you okay with this decision are you okay with this decision but knowing that like everyone is aligned um at least more in the meta context of what your overall mission is that you have the freedom and the space to execute as you need to or as other people may need to so andrea same question how do you maintain the vision for she said so as you start to wade into the world of web 3 with it yeah i mean i already kind of hinted at the fact that you know our community is pretty big at this point and as the more you scale the more difficult it is to keep those things in check within a web 2 kind of ecosystem especially and so for us there are two layers of i guess um curation on one hand we create people we do curate our community and to welcome people who are who share the same values with us so for example if you're a white cis woman and you want to join she said so you must demonstrate in some way that you understand intersectionality and that you come into this community with that understanding and you're navigating it right and and you're occupying space in that way very mindfully or um yeah if you're you know if if like me i'm a white woman cis white woman but i'm from romania eastern europe you know i as a result of that i think i have different sensibilities towards other people's struggles um and so that's pretty easy to to do at the beginning uh right there are more or less different ways in which you can kind of uh introduce questions through the application process that help you uh identify that we have you know we also created resources like our own intersectionality style guide for example uh that we like push to people from the very beginning as they're trying to join our community for them to understand oh i need to like spend 15 20 minutes you know applying to become a member i don't just have to like pay for it you know buy my way into but i have to spend a lot of time digesting all this information and like you know presenting myself to them um and so some people quit like some people just don't even go through that process because they don't want to you know make the effort and those aren't the people that we want in our community but most people do make the effort and then the second layer of curation for us is you know ultimately we are a community of music industry professionals creators artists and so on um and there's a ton of music out there and it's hard to make good music right it's hard to make good that you put out into the world and most amazing things tend to have a ton of people behind them right again an example of how collaboration works best so at that layer that's where things get quite difficult within the web to space because you want you we want to be a community that's accessible to all that promotes you know everyone as uh someone with potential but at the same time when it comes to creating music or putting out music projects uh ultimately the ones that are you know better quality whatever that means to different people will ultimately emerge at least in in our community in the real outside music industry world things are still a little bit different right um and so how do you manage that how do you manage how do you curate you know in a democratic way where the entire community is participating in that curation without having the web3 tools that's that's where i'm getting a little stuck you know that's where it's still a bit more centralized our community from a curation perspective ultimately you know everything does get to me and the various other people who are part of my core team and ultimately we make that decision um and the way that those options trickle down to us again it's very it's a very opaque kind of process and i really wanted to make as transparent as possible so that we can truly give the chance to anyone in the community even if in you know they're in like a small village in romania they barely have internet access but if their art is really amazing they don't need to have a huge network and huge social media following they have she said so you know they have a place where they can put their art out and and there's a better chance for them at it being seen um izzy it's ten years from now uh the floor on all refraction nfts is like 500 eath and ethan's at ten thousand how do you maintain a curatorial edge at that point when something pops off in the space and a lot of times its cultural value is somewhat intrinsically tied to its financial value wow that is a really hard question um i think that going back to going back to like going back to like thinking about art and art like artists objective and like the value that we place on it is like subjective whether it's like because of like the way that we appreciate its aesthetics or because of the fact that we're really driven by the financialization of it and the upside on you know buying something and making money on it but i think having a values align team and values aligned community that has like a shared understanding whether it's through like sops like um standard operating procedures or a manifesto or a way or framework to think about um what matters and why it matters um can you know like other other folks have said like serve as a norse north star because it's kind of the same thing when you know things go up and when things go down it's like it really shakes how people think about value and what matters so um i think having something to return to that's like shared language shared documentation shared values um that can serve as like the grounding point um whether something is up or down um would make would make sense to me and i also think there's room for for expertise um always you know like just because everyone is in this you know in a dow together doesn't mean that like someone's actual experience and expertise in curation or producing or whatever like should just become you know distributed to everyone it's like i think we can trust people who who have expertise in an area and lean on them when um when maybe like it's it's not the best decision for like you know to ask every single member or to put it to like a vote um i think i think there's definitely room for expertise just to drill into that a little bit further i'm curious like because you have people with strong backgrounds and like name brand experience have there been situations where even at that level there have been like clashes of personality or different povs on who deserves a look from an event or not and how those things get handled um i don't know if there's been like um like necessarily like clashing but i think there's been like maybe you know different definitely different point of views about like who to book for something or like why but i think ultimately everyone trusts each other trusts each other enough and i think maybe that's like the grounding point that like ultimately if someone feels really strongly about a decision um and it's in their area of expertise like everyone is aligned enough to to trust that person to make a decision i mean none of this is like life or death like booking someone for a show um so i think a lot of it does come down to trust and a lot of conversation honestly like i think a lot of things just get like worked out and like long dialogues and we have like curatorial team meetings around like okay like what do we want to accomplish for this festival like what is the sound we're looking for like um who's within our community that might make sense um so a lot of it just gets like hashed out in conversation in a really like not like snapshot voting way but just like real communication between people um yeah cool and uh elijah i'm curious like for again the artist that you care about the community that you work within i think a lot about how like technology has been always this like core component and driver of like the success and flourishing of a lot of artists and like the the grime and uk drill space i'm curious then like what would success look like for the artists that you work with um as they like enter the web 3 space like what do you want to see kind of the legacy become over over the next few years um that has a hard question um i think more of us has been technically savvy and not fearing like information and not fearing learning new things not uh being intimidated by um a lot of like the jargon that you're kind of like beating over the head with as you enter the space so much of the language and kind of uh direction comes from like the us so like here in the uk like we've just got different like politics different problems different ways of looking at things and um i i want people to yeah just to feel like a kind of confidence and to be honest like just following on what for what everyone's saying about creating stuff um the it's not the real win but one of the wins and kind of things i get people to focus on is like did you have fun making this are we all having fun here like when we're doing the the dowels and putting together these crews and teams and labels and parties what we're doing it's like this is supposed to be fun and i guess the moment it gets too um you know it's a cool technical you know number goes up number goes down it's like that's not what any of us got into this for so um you know the creative you know being fun to make fun to share like fanta exchange like that being like the driving core of you know what we do like my background is in power radio and you i mean the mcs won't say this but i'm sure like they loved turning up to mc uh power radio maybe why not describe it that way but why would they keep going back every week to just to just mc for free is because they they loved it obviously they could get them somewhere and you know boost their name but there was like a deep love for creating and this space does test out for you your love of create creating and creation and all the kind of language and and things that you have to go through to to get there but if that can enable more and you know creating things that might not have been created without these mechanisms then that's a that's a that's a strong thing for the next you know yeah five ten years like creating things that would have never existed obviously tunes um always going to make tunes but i don't know like connecting with other people other communities might might not have happened amazing uh similar questions to you sir sue like uh coming from a design background working in the gaming space etc like what's the end game for you and kind of your involvement in the web 3 space what do you want to see flourish um for me i just want um people to be true uh holders of their own path right like um my my goal is if i can get one person to understand that things in life happen because they are walking in the direction for certain for things to happen that they're that they're the co-creator of the life that they live that they lead um and they can take that and like charge like their own creativity their own lives whatever it is they want to do and if web 3 is the catalyst for that um you know if i can if i can get one person to feel that then that can be a ripple for other people um and you know i could tell you as a designer i worked in ad agency i've worked in consumer products healthcare you name it i was in every industry at least of you know for over a 10-year span and i never really felt like there was anything that was capturing capturing me enough um to go like that extra mile and like really embodied uh what i felt design could do as a as a as a catalyst or a tool for for empowerment and agency until i found like the web 3 space and since being a part of it and helping um push artists through the mint funds or being able to help gamers figure out that they can monetize their likeness in very unique and amazing ways with the power and tools of web 3 or to even inspire the aspects of what it means to be competitive or to engage in competition i think all these things are are our endeavors that really help people discover themselves through this work um and and if so allows them to live and lead healthier and better lives whether both hopefully financially and also uh creatively too so i mean that's really my end game is to just get as many people on on board with that as possible everything else is an out of effect cool we've only got a couple minutes left so um izzy andrea any closing thoughts before we wrap up i'm just excited honestly i know there's a bit of uh lumen doom out there and on the music industry side there is still a lot of resistance i have to say uh from a lot of people who are not willing to make the effort you know it's it's scary it's scammy out there um but i truly think it's the future of everything um the web3 space will be the new internet you know and uh i'm so excited about all the ways in which we will be able to collaborate both in terms of culture creation as well as how we govern ourselves as societies you know that is the thing that will probably be a big game changer and we'll probably take some time before we get there cool well i'll just take this last minute to thank everyone for participating thank everyone for watching you heard it here first daos kind of underrated a little bit overrated because of the vcs technology kind of whack it but cool if you use it right and if you're not having fun you're doing it wrong thanks everybody thank you so much jose and thank you so much all the participants for sharing um for sharing you know all these all these all these fantastic insights now uh let me just uh here so where we are um [Music] i am such a boomer i have no clue what i'm doing here you should be i think able to see uh i know ah it doesn't matter do you want to see a slide no you don't want to see a slide what you want is more inside more information and some fantastic speakers that will expand your frontal lobes um do you see my somebody tell me do you see my my wonderful slides maybe i don't know we'll never find out uh so this was um sorry i lost my red thread so we are going to the next into the next uh panel which i'm particularly excited about as well um i've already mentioned it we need to talk about the social political realities of these technologies and particularly about agencies especially because web3 is so much about language about agency for for for communities that had no agency in in the platform capitalist age that we hopefully exit at some point and for that we teamed up with a wonderful organization that i encourage you all to follow mutual off um anova and alex will be hosting uh from mutual law of this conversation um unfortunately one of our participants could not make it but we still have lee from super rare zach from the queer museum of digital art uh raven from the 50 millimeter collective jack from polygon and my colleague and friend jem from zora and they are going to talk about trans and queer and cultural and economic ecosystems on chain so i think we're good to go live and i'll just hand over the microphone and the video space to anova and alex and all the participants please enjoy friends awesome thank you so much um hello everybody how's everyone doing i'm excited to be here so let's kick it off let's do this thanks everyone hey everyone my name is enugu kalawar i use he him pronouns and i'm in new york city i'm the co-founder of mutual love the nft marketplace and with three ecosystems centering and celebrating trends and queer creators and culture makers and participating in mutual aid and generational wealth building i'm also a painter curator occasional dj and uh digital community equity activist we are so excited to be here today uh representing mutual love thank you zora and he global for having us at metabolism this year and thank you to this incredible brilliant group of trans and queer web 3 visionary leaders for making the time to be in conversation today we are so grateful to know you and to be building alongside all of you awesome hey everybody my name is alex guerra i use he him pronouns and i live in austin texas i am one of the co-founders of mutual love as well as a content creator and community builder um as a trans man myself i'm super excited to be here having this conversation with other trans and queer people in the web3 space it is much needed and very refreshing so we're gonna start out with some introductions from our amazing panelists here um starting with lee then zach raven jack and then jem um if y'all could just start with names intros pronouns um creative curatorial practice and what you do in web so i'll pass it up to lee yeah it's an absolute pleasure to be here with everyone and sharing um in this very queer happy space within web3 it's just it's so exciting it tickles me fancy but um so like said uh lee knight i use they them pronouns um i was with uh uh i was working as a the technical community manager for sue pereira now that's kind of transitioned more into dei initiatives within uh within the super air space and then also i do a lot with eth denver and so i've been working on that and building that out as well so if you're coming to eat denver please let me know and we can get things happening um and uh yeah i've been in the space since 2017 and so just trying to make the world a better place for for artists thanks so much lee hi my name is zach krevitt i originally entered the web free space as an artist um oh my pronouns are they them i'm located in brooklyn new york um so i have been a photographer for years and years and years was just really dissatisfied with the traditional gallery space and when i found web3 i just had so much more power and control over my work there um originally started as a photographer but have transitioned into working a lot with ai really heavily um throughout that sort of journey i kind of just noticed that there really wasn't a lot of representation for queer and trans creators um you know institutions kind of holding them up so um i along with some of my friends in the space founded the queer museum of digital art kumota which is essentially a preservation effort um you know collecting work preserving work long term permanently um and displaying and uplifting queer artists in the space so we're really a group dedicated to you know hyping up and collecting from queer and trans artists and um it's been a journey thanks for having me hey everybody thank you so much first and foremost for your time in energy and thank you alex and nuvo for this opportunity as well as youth global my name is raven trammell aka raven 50 millimeter my pronouns are he him i'm a photographer and community builder out based in los angeles and aside from my artistry building the 50 millimeter collective with chelsea quintella our co-founder and an incredible artist in her own right has been a major focus currently within my journey in the nft space last year i did a lot of experimenting with my photography and towards the end of last year really leaned into the 50 millimeter collective which is an nftr collective founded by bypoc lgbtqia artists who are dedicated to providing resources and opportunities to historically underrepresented communities we believe diversity and inclusion should be the forefront of web 3 as it is as a global market and we also believe that being an artist for a living shouldn't be some unattainable unobtainable dream and our goal is to fuse together culture community and curation to further uplift and enrich the global art world and so yes that's a bit about myself and the collective and thank you all again for having us for having me here thank you so much everyone it's such a pleasure to be here i'm so honored to have been asked to uh speak at this panel it's really important my name is jack i use she her pronouns uh i am based here in los angeles uh during my day uh i work at polygon i'm the community development manager there at polygons i oversee the ecosystem of the blockchain um and my the the the real work the real fun work that i really enjoy is uh all of my artistic practices that um nfts and uh krypto have kind of found this beautiful outlet for this uh this really deep work uh so i'm a dancer and i work with a motion capture project that will be bringing that uh data information to blockchain which is really exciting go to marketing so more about that later um and then the other initiative that i work for is i'm also a musician and i work for an extension of a web 3 of a record label a web 3 extension of a rapid label that already exists here in los angeles and it's uh its core its core root is uh uplifting underrepresented genre and genres and people so um really finding the the outlets for some of these expressions that don't normally get uplifted and by people that are historically uh under represented in this space so that's kind of the work that i'm doing as well it's me i i'm jam and i pronounce it she all day i'm a singer-songwriter generative artist and full stack creative technologist and i also work at zora doing developer relations i guess my you know the thing that i'm stuck on is i'm as a technologist having access to a medium that is essentially forever and i think that is just such a powerful concept to be playing with when we consider queer and trans and other marginalized voices so i'm just so excited to be working on technology with other people who really seem to be building a primitive but extremely long-term meaningful storytelling amazing what a great note to end on segways perfectly into the first question so thank you all for uh sharing a little bit about yourselves and we'll just we'll just get right into it um just broadly for our audience we're going to touch on archives building community first and gate breaking on chain today with these uh leaders and creators um and um we're just gonna let uh the conversation flow with these three questions so i'm going to kick it off a lot of our intention at mutual is informed by the concept of archiving and instigating trans and queer cultural and economic equity and legacy on the future of the internet the concept of archives in trends and queer communities is nuanced many histories have been suppressed by non-venetic forces but trans and queer creators have been around impacting culture since the beginning of time we are ancient and sacred beings we archive in community and creative practice in incredible multifaceted and multicultural legacies in a world of surveillance sensors and shadow bands in a future impacted by automation metaverse tech and more how does building on chain shift the concept of the queer archive from your unique perspective and how does that inform your practice as a creator and contributor in web3 we would love to start this uh convo off with zach from kimota sure so this is um something that is completely central to our project um in a lot of my work um sort of before this and now still during was with aids activism and when you work in aids activism what you hear over and over and over again is how much was lost the people of course tragically but their artwork right their creation their music um so much of that was lost um there was an effort at the time when people would pass for friends and family members to preserve the work um sometimes that work would be donated to various galleries or museums um and um it was safe for a time you know what we've heard from these from from artists involved in this process and from these institutions is that they are no longer really safeguarding these works a lot of the works are ending up out on the street because either the institution has changed their minds as to the value of the work or they no longer have room to store the work or whatever the reason may be it's just not a permanent and safe solution so with that in mind that was really central to creating a permanent archive on chain um you know even even long after i am here right there will still be this blockchain record of these works who it's by when it was made what mediums are in there and i think that is is so important is something that is really unique to the space you know we've seen how vulnerable um artwork is to to time um and we've seen legacies lost we've seen creativity loss we've seen culture destroyed in this sense um so yeah so for me um this this on chain aspect is is everything i mean that was what really kind of gave us the um you know the courage to do something like this because if it wasn't for unchained technology and blockchain technology there's no way i could store all these works or guarantee that i wouldn't move in some time and i'd have to deal with like where they go safely you know are they being damaged by weather or by you know mold or even these these kinds of things or whether someone's just going to put them out on the street so um yeah it is it is central to to what we're building and i think is really central to preserving the legacy of trans and queer people um globally yeah if i can chime in for a hot second um yeah i mean i think that like absolutely i'm in complete agreement with what zack has just said and he you know is very well put but i think that even like on a on a grander scale uh or let me back up um before i became a software engineer i double majored in art history and music and i'm a trombonist and an electronic musician and then you know i'm touring and playing and all that stuff and so i you know people come to town they call me up hey you want to sit down with us hey we're in town recording you want to record with us like i have been screwed out of like so much not even talking about royalties just credit just credit to be able to say this is what i did and to be able to prove that um and i mean just why is it so hard to just get your name added at the end of the discography um and so with that in mind with web3 with being able to preserve what you have contributed to like one of the first projects that i was contributing to when i first joined the web 3 space was ujo um and you know it was fantastic to be able to see everyone who was responsible for getting a track um developed and being able to even see like the royalty splits of how of how that broke down it's just uh you know it gave me hope for artists and musicians but i just throw them all into the category of artists is giving me further hope for artists in the future to be able to preserve what you have spent you know i started playing trombone when i was 10. and i have spent so much time mastering that craft but like nobody really unless you are a musician nobody really understands what it at what it takes to be able to uh to be skilled at what you're what you're doing um they just think like oh you're just a musician you can show up you can just do this thing here's twenty dollars call i get at the end of the day i'm like bro like to be able to play this like little thing that caught like you know um sit in yeah you you play some air trumpet don't do it you want me to figure it out uh you know that took me 20 years to be able to do that you know it's not sure you only see the the front end of that because you know i'm a skilled position and it looks easy but you know that took time and practice and to be able to preserve that and then you know to be able to demonstrate what your your history is without worrying about it being misconstrued or just like simply just taken off uh is what web 3 is able to offer in ways that web 2 is so limited and is so just stuck in the in the past and so um you know this just ultimately it's just so so much more hope is now accessible for preserving the integrity and the work that musicians and artists have uh you know spent so much shed tears and blood over to accomplish um and you know being able to share that just like the click of a button so i'll i'll i'll add on to that because i'm a musician as well and i definitely know people do not understand that you know what you're seeing is like the culmination of these 20 years uh this five minutes that i totally killed it is 20 years of practice you know to be able to do that um it's also the same with um with dancers i i recently hosted a panel with polygon and i showcased one of my dancer friends and people were very blown away by the fact that you could put dance nfts on the internet but it was a way to capture value it's a way to for for people who have never been able to capture any value uh to find this value going back to like the concept of the archive um here in los angeles at usc there is a queer and gay archive at usc called one archive so i went there and it's only one type of person which is like the stereotypical like thomas finland uh like white gay man from the certain era there was one little corner of lesbians and i was like this is not enough this is not enough this is not enough representation this is not intersectional at all um fortunately i was there because a friend of mine was showing uh and displaying and pointing that fact out um and it was called the show is called the invisible archives by prima janakandra sakhon who is a non-binary um performative lecturers and sculptures um going just going back again to the archive they had to have all of this permission to do all of this work in at usc blah blah blah blah long story short web 3 enables you to do this all permissionlessly which is the hugest like paradigm shift that we've ever seen we've always had to ask for permission we've always had to fight just to express ourselves even visually it's exhausting and so web 3 is this like almost like this outlet like all of these things that all of these songs that i sat on all of this work that i've sat on that i've been waiting for a gallery i don't have to wait anymore i could just put it on the marketplace so that is where the equity of the technology comes into play for me and if i can touch one more time on uh the queer archive i think that it is so important for our histories i mean like if you kind of go back um so i'm also i'm also a bull rider and so like i compete in western sports and um and so america thinks that bull riders at cowboys are blonde hair blue eyes and like everything has been written out in terms of you know black cowboys rancheros like all of this has just been completely erased to fulfill what hollywood has uh deemed attractive and so with these archives you can preserve these histories in ways that you well two things you can preserve it in ways that you haven't been able to do it before but then secondly you have the opportunity to to preserve it and to to share it and so i think that's like one of the bigger things is like getting more people into this space so that we have another chance to write histories in ways that are actually authentic and more meaningful but then we know that they will be preserved and so you know it's just building up our uh community with other like-minded individuals so that it doesn't happen again like we have the opportunity to actually progress and not be stuck in the trends of what has historically happened in the world amazing um cool raven jen do you want to add anything if not we can move on to the next question that kind of segways into um yeah i do want to um i just really loved what uh lee just said about how important this opportunity is um and i feel like that's like what i what i personally stress the most is you know as a trans man as a black trans man in america like this this is this is really our shot like a lot of a lot of um historically underrepresented communities have been just pushed aside and kind of honestly forgotten and not considered um and this is within this space you're able to create the the opportunities for yourself and for your communities for you're able to [Music] with those opportunities empower people and that creates hope and hope is unmatched you know like that can that fuels you and that that motivates you to to keep on going so this it's it's so important and i just have to like shout out each and every one of us who are here in this space as as people who you know are usually an afterthought we're here every day and like doing doing what needs to be done to enrich our communities and it is it is a constant grind but i'm just really i just have to acknowledge that and just say like i'm proud of all of us you know like we're we're really here um we're really here doing what needs to be done and shout out to all of y'all um for that so thank you that was so beautiful right then i guess like the thing that i want to add to that is that you know as i'm as a species like we are we're animals that tell stories right that's that's that's kind of that's kind of who we are and so our mythologies carry us and i think you know i needed myself in the past we've seen what happens um when specific um political groups banned books and tried to erase history and i think with you know honestly i think we're seeing maybe i'm maybe like some of that energy coming back into the world and i think that's scary but we need these stories to um prevail and that is and it's not just we're stories but i think queer stories have been so often left out of this but you know i think what the blockchain offers is the chance to preserve stories of hope and of optimism and of like utopian visions to carry us through whatever kind of period we might be coming into in history and i think it's i'm quite special to know that whatever lies i had i'm the hope and the optimism that we can encode into the blockchain as are books that can't be burnt so i think that's just a really powerful concept amazing i'm i'm just in awe of everybody here so thank you for sharing um just beautiful words and wisdom um amazing so you know speaking of you know communities and and all that you know we're super dedicated to building community first um at mutual love and it's something that we've both been doing in our careers in general um so it comes very naturally and we think of the blockchain as a tool to reflect the already existing queer and trans ecosystem and further amplify and connect communities that are underpaid or even under banked um mutual aid is part of these ecosystems and blockchain can be a tool to build generational equity and access across borders um so from your perspective how can building on chain solutions effectively amplify trans and queer creator and cultural economies and i think we'll start with raven here um all right okay i'm sorry can you repeat the lot just the last part of the question for me please yeah yeah absolutely so just you know from your perspective um how can building on chain solutions effectively amplify the trans and queer economies that i guess already exists um you know and how can blockchain kind of just amplify that like mutual aid um you know equity and all that stuff that we are so often looking for as as a community okay thank you i think um i think we touched on it um i'm not quite sure who it was earlier but uh talking about all of this ecosystem being permissionless and us being in control of the ways in which we want to use all of these really powerful tools such as blockchain such as nfts social tokens and i think we can i think as artists and as already creative beings were able to really use um use these tools in creative ways to not only on board but also encourage our communities um [Music] for example um with with 50 millimeter collective we have a 50 millimeter social token so with every ready wear purchase each consumer earns 10 50 millimeter tokens and with those tokens you'll once will have a marketplace built out and only sell things on that marketplace for 50 millimeter tokens and you can earn tokens from participating in twitter spaces or being in the discord it's not always about who has the most money or who can collect all these nfts to unlock this this other other thing over here or whatever it's it's more about okay who are the community members who really see the vision and want to um [Music] and want to contribute to to helping build the vision and those are the uh contributors who are rewarded with social tokens and therefore can you know who know the social token aspect there's so like we all there's a lot of possibilities within this you know web3 space in general but so with social tokens i just feel um i had i had an example of like the ovo fs tickets were like i don't even know like two thousand dollars i don't i don't remember how much they were they're so crazy expensive though but i just threw out an example of like if drake had a ovo social token where his fans got you know x amount for downloading his album listening to tracks for buying merch whatever and then they could contribute some of those tokens to the sale of those tickets rather than selling their computers or doing wild things to to get that to get that um ticket money that's just like you know one example of how this ecosystem can be equitable for for a larger um a broader audience in broader community so there are also you know parts of the world where being a part of the queer community being represented at any sort of uh you know queer capacity is very illegal um and so there are so many like just like a very simple like basic example is you know trying to create create some sort of um queer alliance or community in one of these places where it is illegal and you need funding and if you cannot create a bank account affiliated with the actual name of what you're doing because it is illegal and then like it could be tracked and uh and you are blocked before you can even start and so by being able to utilize um you know any any of uh you know unchain marketplaces or any like anybody can send you funds and you don't have to lie about it just simply straightforward like here it is and these funds are accessible um unlike you know applying for a bank account then needing to be approved for your bank account and then how are you going to actually extract those funds and all that just like very simply being able to receive financial support in other ways where in other situations where if you're going the traditional route you would be blocked before you could even start or even you know make your case and so there are uh you know from a foundational level of being able to start um your organization web 3 offers a solution yeah and i think that we're also getting to kind of the heart of the problem which is like that conversion you know i think that on chain solutions are amazing but i think that if we're talking about underbanked or unbaked people until there is a system for housing and food um you know common goods that will really will accept these on-chain tokens be they either polygon or or social token from a from a group um i i think until we reach that point i think it's going to be really hard to um have these on-chain solutions go as as far as i really need to go to truly solve this problem so i think that you know there really needs to be um some some incredible minds out there and i think people are working on this but i don't think we've really quite solved it yet um that would really address housing first and foremost um and allow these interactions and these accumulation of tokens whether it be from from you know actions like raven mentioned or from selling nfts to go directly into uh food and housing so i think that we have a long way to go but i think that there are some really incredible people um working on this problem um you know and or banking systems that can guarantee privacy and safety to queer and trans people um that will allow this this sort of system to happen to to extract those funds um you know love it or hate it we just saw what happened with tornado cash um and you know there's there's a clear kind of crackdown on financial privacy happening and um that was really a big setback you know tornado cash is obviously right with its own problems but it did ensure a certain amount of safety for the types of people that we are talking about and situations are talking about so privacy tools um and mass adoption for common goods i think really needs to happen for on-chain solutions to truly empower our communities yeah i mean i think like a the bigger thing like none of this is going to happen unless we get more people like with massive mass adoption is like the first step and then we're actually probably like education but then mass mass adoption um and so like we but we all need each other we all need to share with each other and support each other and then i think with and you know if you're creating a dow like actually use your doubt properly it's not just a buzzword like there are actual uh components to it that officially make it a doubt and how you operate like actually you know needing quorum to you know move move a proposal uh but i think that again these like foundational elements to create a future that will be more sustainable and safer for individuals within the queer community are accessible but we need that education to onboard people and mass adoption so that it is a value so that people don't think that it's not a viable um option for you know transferring funds or ideas or projects um i mean if you can think it you can make it and so we just need everybody like it's just a little bit of kool-aid drink it it's fine so join us come hither love that jack did you want to speak uh okay sure oh oh no worries no worries yeah i just like needed uh yeah no i think it comes down to like uh if you make a a space that is hospitable to our concerns and to our perspectives and that where they have space to live and and be heard and be seen that's really going to draw a lot more people to the space as well beyond being like educated and beyond finding this place of belonging it's also just holding space and i would say like in order for an order for the community to embrace this technology more i think we can just all embrace our own fairness more and really dive into like what makes us safe and what makes us feel good and and really find moments to showcase those attributes in the community because i think i think we're all sort of um in agreeance that values alignment is much more important than than any sort of other like facet that may come up that may be an alignment because if you're in the your values are are aligned then everything else can fall into place but um going back to how this uh on chain building can change the way that we show up in these spaces um it goes back to the permissionlessness and the immutability of these archives of these uh records so uh just keep making that that beautiful queer welcoming space and we'll just have more archive more to add to the archives because of it thank you um we have about 14 minutes left um jem did you want to say anything about this topic before we move on to our last couple questions i feel pretty good on that last one awesome so as we've talked about what you know hope and optimism and embedding our values and our cultural alignments and on chain also accessibility and education and storytelling has come up so we talk a lot about accessibility and gate breaking at mutual love and like many of you have noted a lot of the concepts in web3 are fairly inaccessible onboarding is also a very broad term there's community building storytelling ux it's content bridge applications etc so we would love to hear you know from your perspective what actual accessible onboarding looks like for the global lgbtq community or even the local communities that you are part of from your perspective and uh one tip you'd give to a queer trans creator or contributor entering web 3 in the audience today i would love to start with jack for this question sure i think we have to be very mindful of intersectionality i think that's the only way forward and the only way that we can really truly understand the perspectives globally is by listening to the people who are living those experiences directly so i find that you know embrace your queerness create this beautiful queer space but also you know and ensure that you are uh honoring where people are coming from and making space for that as well so that i do see as um sort of like a core a core uh nugget of how we will on on board the math is educate the masses really it just builds community it's really just building community because once once everyone's on the same page um then you really you really can go very far and then you have other stewards of the community to to spread that great word as well so really just creating space and creating a welcoming environment is really going to take us so much further than than anyone else and i'm totally convinced of that because if this is our chance it's like raven said like this is our chance this is our moment and as artists and and queerful we're not gonna let that just slip away we'll fight for it that's all i have to say about mass adoption i think i think my tip would be um you know take a holistic approach to your education you know um it's not just learning about smart contracts or just learning about this one thing or that one thing but you really have to at least in the beginning kind of be a um you know have a really holistic approach you know so i would say you know study marketing study smart contracts study social media study community management like i think taking at least um a dip into all of those topics will serve you a lot more than just focusing on one in particular um you know i think that's what's missing in a lot of web through education is that there is education for okay how to write a smart contract but then okay maybe you've written your smart contract and you want to sell some of your artwork but then you're you're sort of lost when it comes to marketing um so yeah just really kind of embracing all different aspects um so that you can be you know communities incredible but at the same time there's so much um power to be found in being able to cover all these aspects and then linking up with other community members that are also kind of talented in a lot of different places i think where i would add to that is i'm you know on everyone involved like let's be really conscious of what we're on boarding people too and what types of tools that we're recommending people use i realize that as a newcomer to this space sometimes you know there is a lot of jargon and it's being thrown around and sometimes it's hard to like figure out like the differences between different platforms and stuff but you know in general i feel like if someone is trying to sell you something they're lying to you if someone is you know making you certain promises they might be lying to you like all i can say is like i try and trust in decentralized and permissionless tools i try and trust in systems that don't have gatekeepers even if there are experienced people around to help you learn that should always be entirely democratized so you know i guess i at this point like i kind of have to plug zoro because i feel like that's what we're trying to do is just give people access um to the best tools that we are making for ourselves and hoping you back with those but we're not trying to sell you anything and we're not trying to sell you on anything other than giving you the tools to succeed based on honestly like based on the spirit of your own work and i think that is that is the magic that people always bring to the space no matter how experienced they are in web 3 or in crypto like there is some unique magic that is inside everyone and i think that's the thing that we're excited about seeing and these are just like these are the technical tools to help people out it's a piggyback off of what jim just said um you know the the unique magic that you have within yourself right and if you're new to web3 space i think a lot of the tools can seem very daunting and surprising and then you think that your magic is not as magical as you once thought it is it still is uh and so and that's okay you're learning something you're learning something that's i mean if you if you were brilliant at it like you showed up and you're like i know everything then why why aren't you running the world um but so like aside from that like it's okay to be in that place where you need help and it's okay to ask for help um and so like one of the things that i would do at east denver is i put together a number of talks to help people get into the space and you know a very the general term of you know onboarding like these are people who don't have wallets don't have any crypto like so walk them through the process walk them through adding tokens to their wallet so that they have some foundation no rinsing of what it is to be within the space and then dropping them some uh some crypto so that they have they can interact in the space it's you know it's like one thing like hey go get it get set up get your wallet going good luck to you see you see you at this conference make sure you're in the hackathon it's like that's a lot that's a big very big ass and so you know be willing to share what you have learned i'm not saying give all your time but if you can share so that people can learn and ask questions that's how i got into the space a friend took me out to brunch and just we went through everything step by step by step and then before i knew it now i'm like helping out run run youth denver um and then secondly the biggest tip that i have do what makes you feel good do what excites you because if you're excited about what you're doing then you're willing to do the work to figure out the components of how of what you're interested in operates you know um and so like hey you want to create nfc but you know nothing about blockchain but you're an artist okay start creating your work how do i get this other blockchain oh i need a wallet how do like all these pieces will come into play that and you will have you know that your route will be laid out for you on how to understand what you need by following what interests you so if you're excited about something follow it love that raven do you want you we have like a minute okay but i want to give you the floor go for it yeah thank you um i'll i guess my my tip would would be to um just be intentional with with where you're placing your energy within various communities and things like that it can be a um the space can be a lot there's a lot of information there's a lot going on it's very fast um give yourself some grace to like lee said ask the questions it's okay to that's like encouraged here people are hyped when when when people don't know things and they can be like oh well here's how you know i can help you or here's this information and um definitely tap in with the 50 millimeter collective i've made a handful of youtube videos foundational tips that i wish i knew when i got into this space how to set up a meta mask there's a we have a metamask tutorial and also a tutorial on how to get 50 millimeter social tokens in your wallet so finding different resources like that provided by communities um that have a trustworthy reputation within the the nft space i think is uh where i'll leave it but just thank you i'm so grateful i'm just so so grateful for this opportunity and just like speaking with so many amazing people like i'm my you alex you said your mind was blown i'm over here just like damn what nah now i gotta say something like no just think i'm so grateful thank y'all uh i feel the same way but thank you for that um okay we're getting updates we have another five minutes folks look at that awesome um cool but yeah thank you all um i guess we weren't gonna have time to do this but now we can um would love to pass it around i think raving just a little bit of this but um you know just anything you want to plug before we sign off um would love to give each person like just a quick minute um if you if you want um and then we'll kind of um make room for the next uh group of panelists yeah so uh mean i'll i'll start i talk too much i'm sorry um but uh one thing that uh as i mentioned before like i am i'm a part of eath denver and i i have been since the first denver and uh every year it gets bigger and better and uh we are able to defer more and more to our dei initiatives as well so i would love you know reach out to me on twitter you can find me it's a cool breeze but it's a-k-e-w-l breeze so it shows how old i am because of the weird spelling but anyway um and so like reach out to me reach out to me if you have questions if you're if you're confused like um i mean my my time is limited so if i don't get back to you immediately but know that i will and i mean i think that's that's what you need to do in this space is like feel free reach out ask people and so join me at east denver you don't know how to get involved in eats denver i'll explain it to you you want to get involved in the hackathon but you don't have a technical background that's okay there are other ways that you can contribute there are so many ways that you can contribute in the web 3 space but the ball is in your court to ask how so please ask reach out to me awesome okay i think the other group is here i just wanted any anybody else just like a quick 30 seconds i'll jump in um yeah we're excited to at zoro we're excited to support creators of all different types um if you're an artist looking to you know really dip your toes into the space for the first time please come along to zorotope your events that's a great onboarding resource um and then for more kind of engineering gleaning questions come over to you know follow around with what we're doing um zoro engineering on twitter come to i guess your our hackathon keep keep it you're doing great everyone is doing really great keep doing exactly what you're doing because you're at our events so thank you amazing amazing all right everybody i just want to say thank you one more time um what that was such a hopeful inspiring conversation thank you so much for being with us today zach gem lee raven and jack make sure to check out their projects which we will share on our twitter feed post panel make sure to follow us at mutual to underscores love and um at www.mutual.love um yeah we're also fundraising for our mirrors so check that out thanks again to everybody for being here and making this possible and thank you to zora and east global um for this opportunity so we will see y'all soon thank you thank you see you later thank you everyone for this incredibly insightful um conversation and as anu and alex just said please follow every single uh one of the participants just because they will be a infinite well of insight knowledge inspiration and also if you need guidance so yeah uh i am very excited about the next and i've been excited about every single one of these conversations but i'm particularly excited about this one just because um not only because we have a fellow berliner he is not too far from where i am right now in france or barack i'm in wedding in case you know the geography of berlin but he is really an artist that deserves to be called a legend just because um many of the things we do day in day out wouldn't be the way they are without his work and the work that he had put in the experiments that he dared to do when nobody thought about them and we all should be internally grateful for that but also some of his methods are arcane and mysterious and i'm very happy that han bundendorpe will tell us all about how he does the beautiful things he does so please everyone a warm applause uh for harm vandan uh please enjoy friends thank you for the for the introduction can you can you hear me i will be yes very well excellent i'll be doing quite a bit of screen sharing um i'm usually when i'm invited to to be in panels or give talks i'm usually asked to talk about the the art the the aesthetics the the art historical references and this time i was i was asked to actually more like have a technical talk which is exciting i rarely get to do that so i will be actually be talking about uh smart contract programming and i've been doing that for a while i think i i started playing with solidity in 2018 17. and why i think this is interesting to talk about in an art context is because the what makes nfts nfts for me is that the fact that they are immutable so they are to some extent unchangeable fixed and that means they are resilient they can be taken they cannot be taken down by a government but also it addresses the the difficulty that i experienced earlier before blockchain with digital art because the software our digital art is so easy to change it's so easy to to get to disappear it's so easy to um you have to lose it somehow and the ephemeral nature of of digital art which i've always loved was is really nicely complemented by blockchain technology where you can actually fix certain things of your digital artwork of course with the benefit that it is resilient it is it cannot be censored but also it makes it really um well easier to commodify so you have this enormous now this market of nfcs of which for which artists are greatly um profit um this talk is called off chain and of on chain on chain uh nfts and some people might ask like aren't all nfts on chain so i'm going to show a few examples of how different nft projects are on chain or to what extent they are not on chain and most most of the times the parts that are not on chain make the artwork more flexible but also less resilient and temper yeah more more prone to to changing i'm going to share my screen and i'm going to show some examples so can you see my screen now so this is actually the project i'm going to touch the latest that is my own project for you i think many of you will be familiar with the ethereum nft standard erc 721 where the basically the only thing that is stored on chain by that specification is who owns which tokens so you so you have provenance the asset that it references the artwork or the collectible is most of the time not actually stored on chain because that would be way too expensive and the way a smart contract exposes what it points to or what it represents is by a method called the token device i'm showing this quite famous art blocks project by dimitri cheniak so anytime you are on openc you can actually just go to the contract address so this is the token id i'm going to visit the contract on etherscan go to the contract read the contract everybody can do this this is just open and this is this is free for all and i'm looking for the token uri and this is important i i hope you can you can read this i might get a bit bit larger this is the address that the that the token is pointing to let me make a new text file so this is just a web page basically it's just a json file and if i open it in my browser you see a whole bunch of properties the metadata of this token and this is the one i want to highlight the media one and in this case also the media property also points just to a url so in that sense you could say that this nft is partially unchained the nfd is on chain but the assets that it references the metadata and the image are not so art blocks imagine invented another mechanism to still have the code that generates this artwork to still have it on chain and it should be somewhere here project script by index so i took the number 13 from the token id and i think this project only has one script so this is a lot of gibberish that you i don't expect anybody to understand this but the interesting thing is that here that if this is actually the script that generates the image i just showed oh it's gone and with this code anybody could always reconstruct that token in theory so one of the things if i for example search for the word stroke which is a method that's being called a few times this this method stroke is actually not defined in this code the the method stroke is part of p5 and that's a library that is stored on another server so this this makes it flexible because you couldn't store that whole library on chain that would be too expensive but then also by not storing that you make it fragile so there's constant trade-offs in what can you store on chain how expensive is that because storing on chain is very expensive in terms of gas and how flexible are you let's see where where was i i do something similar with that in my own mutant garden seeder a project that i made about a year ago again i can go to the contact address look at the contract read contract actually i have to remember one after vmware open id here and again you see i get just a web address and if i open that i get a json file and in this case the image points to a factory graphic which is stored on my server how i solve the problem of resilience because if my web server is down where does the nft go is that people can run a desktop application that does the calculates the limitations for you so this is sort of a side chain that runs parallel to mainnet and it it calculates the mutations which is important in my project because in this project the nfts actually change all the time based on the current on the current hash on the current block hash let me see let me open one so all the holders of this project can can download this software and and calculate the mutations on their own without depending on my web server depend without depending on anything really so that aids in the desire for decentralization i'm going to close this because it costs quite some resources a project that many of you will know that is actually having another uh approach is loot and again i'm going to just open one of them we don't have so much time so i can't really get into the projects themselves individually so contact so this is token442 i'm going to expect it again now this is interesting um i i ask for a uri to a metadata resource file like a json file but instead i get this gibberish so it starts with data colon application slash json semicolon base64 comma and then i get a whole bunch of gibberish now this is a data uri so it's not the uri like you're used to like a url here with like a domain name but this is also in most browsers something is being accepted as a as a valid uri so i can copy this whole string and just paste it here you should never do that this if you get this link from like some hacker or something because that this is also can be um risky but if i open it you can see that again it just shows me some json file and json is this format to express the properties that an nft has so it has a name maybe i can make a larger it has a name description blah blah blah do here and then it has an image and again you have you see this this string starts here data called an image it ends here with a whole bunch of gibberish if i copy string and i have to do it really precise so include the data part and end before the quote you see now i have an svg so we can also inspect this see actually this is an svg a very simple one because if it would be a very complicated svg it would be again too complicated to to put that on chain so what happens here this this data uri it specifies here that it's data but from there and it knows what to do it's not http it's not https it's not ipfs the the type of the data that it expects is in this i think it's a mime type actually so it expects oh sorry it expects svg and that's xml and the code this gibberish is encoded as base64 and that is a way to express complicated data like images or sound mp3 or in this case svg to express it in characters that will not like up data transmission because in this gibberish string you cannot for example have a quote because that would ruin it or other like non ascii characters and that's basically the trick so these two steps is first you encode the entire json file [Music] in base64 as a data uri and then again in the image attribute you encode it again so actually in the end the end result is that this svga image has been encoded twice so you also have to decode decode it twice i will go here so this there's actually one one more way uh which is more similar to the first project that i showed on art blocks on my own because in those two projects the art blocks and the mutant gardens either the assets referenced were on a web server on my web server or in the case of art blocks on the art blocks web server there's also one way to store the both the metadata and the the image to store that differently on ipfs so i would say that that's ipfs is not a blockchain but it's a distributed file yeah hosting solution you could say so it's it's already more resilient if you would take one ipfs node away the file would still be there and this particular artwork that i made you can also on zorya can you can always inspect the contract and you can expect inspect the the metadata and it shows okay the metadata for this one is stored on ipfs and the artwork is also an ipfs so if i click on here i'll get this here and i'm inspecting this json through a gateway because my browser doesn't by itself understand what ipves is if i would do this ipfs because this is actually how it's stored in the smart contract my browser doesn't know what it is i also have brave i believe bray does understand there's some browsers who can do it but until that you have to use a gateway and this gateway is provided by pinata and you can see that the image also references again an ipfs hash which is this one so if i'm going to refresh it you can see it takes that takes quite a long time because the beauty of ipfs is that it's shared and distributed and safe but it's also much slower than on a web server so there's all these trade-offs i wanted to show that project as well but we don't have so much time we only have like 10 more minutes um yeah i'm going to show some of the code really quickly of orb live this is also just available you can see it on etherscan so this token uri method i've been calling a few times that you have to pass a token id this is how i did it and i can really recommend also if you like this kind of stuff to look at the work of alberto granzotto i've actually incorporated and learned a lot from him i didn't invent any of this it's i've used a lot and i can also share these links afterwards in the chat or something so you can see what the the what is going on behind the scenes when somebody calls token id like openc calls it or zora to show what the artwork is in this case these animated uh squirkles this this like crooked circles it um it returns a string that is based on and here i'm just doing really crude string concatenation of chunks i'm just generating json here as string manipulation and this is ugly code because solidity is really not meant to do this and you encounter all these limitations and you have to hack everything around which is also fun it feels a bit like early demo scene where people only had 64 kilobytes to make an animation and then the beauty of the animation was sometimes not so much in the animation but in the in the innovation to to to get so much stuff into so little memory and i think that's a bit the case with these on-chain solidity svg tokens as well so here is the um the encoding let's see where encode the image is here and it's the svg method actually does the rendering it does the base64 encoding and the render function is here so one one funny ugly thing let's see because in in solidity where the program is on among us um you can only have like 16 local variables so if you need more you have to split up your your method into arbitrary sized uh subroutines otherwise it just doesn't work so you constantly are confronted with the limitations but that that's also kind of the fun and the amazing thing is i think is that these kind of nfts are not depending on anything not a web server um not ipfs so as long as ethereum exists and as long as we have browsers that can display them this artwork will remain in its animated form which looks like this let's just pick one and the way they that they are being decided uh on the under on the way they look the the colors they have the rotation speed the transparency is all calculated in the smart contract based on uh the moment of minting the seed hash i think it's called let's see if i can show where that is so there's there's many uses of this like random random number generators but actually they are not really random they are deterministic so i can be sure that based on the the seed or the the birth transaction that they will always show the same thing and i decided to give all the orbs uh a temperament or a bias accurate here and there's all there's only four horny deep innocent and vivid and these are just returned as strings for example here trait type temperament where you get bias string and these can also be seen here here as properties i can for as example um decode one of them so again i go to the contract of this one let's say 338 is the token id i inspect the smart contract then contract read contract so these are the methods i could say render 338 you can see this is just the svg code as we understand it in in just regular code but to communicate that we we needed to be base64 encoded so this is just actually it's a public method but it's actually never called because the token uri method calls that so i say give me the encoded metadata of this of this token which is actually quite long you see so in here encoded is the svg code to make those colors and those animation i'm going to copy it paste this here so again well we have still a lot of gibberish but this has become visible now so name description image and at the end the attributes like the colors the the temperament the amount of rings and i'm going to copy this again onto [Music] here and there we have the svg and the svg is actually um well relatively complicated for in the sense of if it can still be encoded uh while developing these kind of things i really recommend before you start getting into the solidity code first finish your idea as just as an svg just by hand maybe is in the text editor then when you figured out exactly what you wanted to do try to program it in javascript because javascript is much more forgiving and when you've done that entirely then port ported to solidity because in solidity will encounter many well uninspiring um problems because it's a very very very tight unforgiving language the tools that i've been using to do that one is called blockchain svg and i can really recommend it so for those of you who have ever developed in for example uh react with webpack and all that um once one amazing thing you can do is like when you are coding the website that you're building refreshes on the fly so you don't have to refresh or recompile it all the time and especially for smart contract programming compiling it and then refreshing it would take a long time so i've been using hotchain svg so you can type your solidity code and then each time with each change it reloads and this is also interesting because sometimes you're coding for a while and then suddenly it just stops because solidity has all these limitations in the amount of variables you can have or the amount of rendering that you can do in at all because there's still a gas limit and with this software you at the most well reported moment you just realize oh it just stopped working entirely because if your smart contract the rendering of svg goes over a certain threshold then it just stops you don't get an error message just don't know what happened at all i will put a link to this also in the notes that was really short and i think i think i'm kind of touched everything that i wanted to wanted to show there's one project that i didn't show um i think i should do that because for for history the first project that like i think it's i think nobody really argues that it's this i think everybody agrees that this is the first unchanged narrative art piece on the ethereum blockchain and um so let's inspect how this one stores its data which is actually quite surprising because like we just said oh i have to remember the token id like i just said the nfts always have metadata as a json file which points to the asset somehow it's forgiven that this one doesn't do that so instead of outputting metadata it just outputs the plane immediately the artwork which is just text and if i copy this it is a data uri but if i just copy this you can see that this is the artwork but it doesn't supply other attributes there's no metadata file there's no json there's no title uh there's no description it just plainly outputs this i don't know if uh openc would accept this for all projects but this is kind of a seminal artwork so maybe openc program some kind of um exception i don't know but it's always a pleasure to end with uh with autoglyphs i think i will give it back to you mikhail thank you thank you harm this was you know for me for someone who does not really write any code it was incredibly insightful because even i as an amateur or charlatan depending on how you define it i understood so much about how to actually generate such such fairly complex and and um works one question you know like is what's like this skill set that you brought to this like what is your your background maybe also because we have quite a few artists watching and and many of them might not you know have a background in coding so was this something that you did before you know are you a developer by trade and then became an artist i i i started programming when i was 11 and you nerd and i studied software engineering so guilty yeah but i i also went to art school but but i must i must say that like i'm not a hardcore solidity developer because i've i've made some some smart contracts and i thought i'm done this works and then i had some of my like real salinity developers like oh if you do it like this you can get hacked or front round or like so i'm still learning and uh i'm approaching it very much from the playful side but not the um i i wouldn't program like a dao or something like that i would not have the skill set to do that maybe one last question somebody who's been you know spending so much time with on chain art what do you think is in this regard the next step the future um what is it something i mean we also have quite a few uh experienced developers that also probably in some groups within the ethereum community say anything that you wish for the future of on chain art oh that's a really good question i by the way don't know i don't need to have to understand the answer you know you can really speak to that audience now one one thing what i would wish in the community is that people are have easy resources or easy go to website where they can inspect how and if how a particular nft is built and understand how resilient it is and if it can be rugged and also see if it's innovative in a technical sense because i think many people just put all nfts on one pile and some of them i think like it's not strange i think i think to say that in like five years half of the nfts we have now will not exist anymore because nobody's paying for the hosting fees or for the ipf exceeding the ipfs hashes and a lot of money is paid for these things so education would be good there i i don't know if much will change after the merge of ethereum if that will change transaction costs because if it does if it makes it cheaper then this kind of stuff might be cheaper to develop but i'm mostly worried about the provenance or the conservationist aspect of the artwork themselves okay this was a really uh interesting answer and also you just gave a little inspiration for maybe the next hackathon project because such if these tools are missing then we should find teams to to build them for everyone's benefit because obviously these are tools that should be open source and accessible to also we can advance the space together um harm thank you so much for taking the time and to lift the devil um so we were able to learn from you and everyone please harm is actually one of the nft artists that you can see exhibiting quite a lot around the world so and his artworks are really striking in their fidelity once you have them really really big before your eyes so please make sure to to visit him harm thank you so much and have a wonderful day my friend you too my pleasure bye-bye all right friends um we are uh continuing we're moving on no no rest for the wicked as they say there should be a um somewhere a another slide but i do not know if you can see it who cares let's hand it over immediately so we teamed up with this talk with our dear friends from water and music so if you're interested in anything in relation of the music industry either web 2 or web 3 water music is the key resource on the internet for that um and we wanted to look into something that also you know harm already mentioned the importance of metadata in particular because you might not consider metadata that important to your music exp listening experience but actually it is the decisive factor between who gets paid who gets attributed and who might you know be able to continue doing these beautiful things and the panel that we have is a panel of builders of engineers of lawyers and music industry professionals so um without further ado i would uh like to hand it over to this beautiful group of people um and to brooke in particular from water music who is going to be hosting that i have fun friends all right thanks so much hello everyone and welcome to the next panel yeah this is great to be here and i'm joined by a really really great group but i'm going to try not to talk too much but at least um i that was a nice intro but yes hi i'm brooke jackson i represent water and music which is a music and tech research newsletter and now dao as of last year and um yeah we do research um on areas where music and tech meet um we attempt to analyze and connect the dots in areas and you know demystify some of these places um such as web3 so a lot of what i'm doing um as a researcher and um biz ops person at water music is looking at music nfts and we have a big database um that you can find um the paid members of our newsletter and dao can find at watermusic.com we have a database that tracks um as best as possible which is part of what we're going to be talking about here um what's going on in music uh nfts i've been tracking these for about a year and a half alongside our founder sherry hoo and a lot of collaborators as part of our dow and um yeah have stumbled upon the problem of metadata in just trying to analyze what's going on so we look at primarily primary sales and do analysis of what is happening um in the overarching trends of the market um and it's tough uh so i'm glad to be talking to people who are behind the scenes um much more you know tech technologically technologically capable capable than i am um that are actually putting this out there so i'm gonna hand it over let's just go around i'll i'll just start with um i'll start to my right here so um you can tell us a little bit about one where what project you're involved with and um you know a little bit how what problem you're looking to solve in music with web3 so ahmed i see you first so why don't you start hey folks thank you brooke i appreciate the intro happy to be here my name is i am a data engineer by background but i'm a dj and producer as well um the project i'm involved in part of a community called the underground violet rave so just a group of artists djs graphic artists all kinds of creatives who came together for music honestly and brought my technical background i was like hey you guys realize we could be doing a lot more stuff if we had metadata so started digging into that did a sort of hackathon project where i looked at the major publication platforms looked at their metadata standards and kind of did like a state of metadata and just started a conversation in our community and on the broader music nft community um because i believe that standard adoption is important for every single industry just go look at iso standards for example if you want a clear example um and i think that uh particularly with music nfts developing a standard and having wide adoption is mutually beneficial for everyone and it's inevitable it's inevitable because with the adoption of a standard comes the establishing of secondary micro services and money talks um so i'm excited to see where the space goes and i'm incredibly honored to just be a part of the conversation with so many bright individuals great thanks so much all right um kyle number one kyle dillon why don't you go ahead with a part or picture sure thing thanks so much um i'm kyle i'm uh one of the co-founders and cto at arpeggiolabs we started arpeggia back in october and we basically created the first fully on chain music creation platform similar to the last talk with harm actually but for music and early on we kind of started thinking about how do we uh how do we represent the contributors uh to a song uh on the blockchain and not just how do we you know replicate sort of the existing standards that we see with music things that are stored in you know pro like that pros handle and traditional publishing systems but how do we actually think about new ways to represent contributors to music and store that and build interesting systems on top of that um so things we're really interested in are we we basically developed a on-chain protocol for music creation um as well as a platform you can use called arpeggi studio so artists can make songs in the browser and all of the components of the song including the uh the samples that were used in that song um as well as any you know i say any stems that were remixed from another song all the components of that song are tracked and basically you could build really cool systems on top of this for distributing splits to all the contributors you know artists of songs will be incentivized to allow others to remix their songs permissionlessly that's sort of the thesis one of the theses uh that we have at our page so obviously this touches a lot about metadata and it's you know it kind of it's a little bit different than i think the traditional way we think about metadata as just being like you know who made the song at what time instead of thinking about how do we literally change the way that we think about uh composition and collaboration essentially in sort of a day and age where remixing and reuse is so common and it is kind of the new paradigm for creating um yeah that's it amazing thank you kyle okay over to the other kyle at lex dao introduce yourself quick hi yeah i'm kyle i'm one of the core contributors of lifestyle and lextow is the international legal engineer guild so we're lawyers who code uh i'm not practicing and whatever i say is not legal advice uh so yeah anyway um what i'm doing is uh we've got this uh web3 music coalition and uh it's uh we offer grants to uh dao's uh what through dallas to go to traditional music events like music biz conference and we're also friends and music biz conference so opportunities to speak at music biz conference and then uh we only started in march but we'll um expand and offer more grants for more opportunities to bridge web3 uh music with traditional music uh the main thing we're working on right now is uh oh yeah well three i guess music collection it's technically a sub-dial of ethereum magicians so um we spent quite a bit time with uh them as well as the cat herders so very much in the eip and at the moment we're building up a group of members for ddex and then ddex is going to have where they already have a working group of traditional music industry and uh and so then we'll have some web3 and hopefully uh i don't know what standards i've come up with i'm just kind of a liaison but uh i assume the standards will bridge between uh d-dex's kind of one-to-one private database system uh into ethereum so an oracle type of thing i saw what uh jack did with web five that was kind of cool i don't know how related it'll be to that but uh that's pretty much what i'm up to and oh yeah my background uh way when was in uh enterprise music publishing with what's now anthem entertainment and so i'm personally really interested in the new royalties that are happening in this space resale is very exciting and from my previous uh experience we kind of expanded neighboring rights and and that's now quite lucrative and everyone kind of knows about that these days and so a resale's like that but then who knows what other rights um these these new markets will produce that will add more um uh diversification of revenue for lardis and i am also very interested in um make sure making sure creators get credits and that's a harder problem that's edge computing and all that but i've got uh robotics uh cut projects that's ultimately gonna come back around for that but uh yeah that's me thanks amazing thanks kyle and last but not least aj hey guys uh thanks for having us uh so aj washington here i'm the founder of float dao float is a music curation protocol with a dow built on top of it our mission is to bring the best music on the internet to web3 and introduce weather technology and nfts to artists as a way for them to you know make sustainable uh make sustainable living and uh you know earn a living wage for from and from their work um you know our our primary goal is to help artists maximize the the the value uh of their work and their reach um and i think you know when we think about metadata metadata not only like you know mchale suggests that at the top you know helps uh in attribution and and payment but also in discovery um and you know discovery is a very big part of our mission helping you know talented artists be seen be heard and uh this discussion is is core to you know that being you know uh that being available to to artists and so um yeah we're very interested invested in uh helping establish a metadata standard helping push that helping alleviate any challenges and roadblocks that you know may be in the way of of that you know being you know being a realization amazing all right let's dig into it so i said to you guys before we started i would love to see by the end of this thing which haha if we could come to a consensus on one what the problems are with metadata as they stand today um what your thoughts are on how we can actually start to solve these problems and you know that could be a big ideal kind of thing or just literally like how do we connect stakeholders in this place to you or two leaders um that are actually starting to um uh take action on this so to start with that let's just hear where do you guys think um the biggest problem is right now as it stands today to getting um good solid metadata standards um for nfts in in the music space and i'll just open it up you guys i won't start if that's okay get us going here um you know i wrote a couple things down uh but i think to keep it relevant i think the most important thing is education especially when we when we start engaging artists and talking them about like metadata like you know hey what's metadata used for usually it involves artificial intelligence or something like that it's like no man do you like spotify and apple music do you like seeing recommended songs are you a dj who dicks for music on bandcamp or soundcloud you know on bandcamp you can go and hey show me hip hop from tokyo japan you know and it'll give you songs that are hip-hop in tokyo japan and imagine if we had metadata for all that music the depth of research we could do on sound selection um that's what was missing for me that's why i decided to do a project but what's what's important about the education piece is you know when we look at the major publication platforms who are the faucets into this ecosystem they're not adopting uh they have the the metadata standards but on the user interface side they're choosing not to allow people to populate that metadata standard very valid reason when you go ask them it's because it's a barrier of entry for artists they see that huge metadata standard and they're like whoa i don't have like three quarters of this i'm not gonna upload music fair enough what i'm saying is if you're an artist and i'm telling you that people are trying to build secondary services to get you paid based off of data that is published you should start asking those publication platforms why you can't populate that data and you should be asking for the option to populate that data yourself and it's going to be an iterative process and building so let's build yeah and i agree i think i think really the you know i think education is is is is uh is a barrier but also you know like uh mood has suggested it's also how how do we uh allow this to be an easy process for artists or maybe alleviate the pressure on artists themselves to populate this information uh and and can we do it in a more decentralized way right and that's something that i think is in line with the ethos of web3 i think there are incentive mechanisms that you know we could think about um that would allow a a broader population of folks who support artists love music you know understand the importance of this information being submitted to uh to participate um and i think that's you know really the the the area focus that we're really interested in uh exploring is how can we make this more communal process and you know create some sort of incentive that allows more people to get involved i kind of uh be i was a part of this uh i'm still a part of this telegram chat called music nft metadata standards and it's been really interesting to see the conversation in that channel evolve over the past few months um my understanding based on following that that channel which has a lot of really engaged and interested folks who want to solve this problem is that there's sort of two questions right now there's actually two different conversations happening in parallel one is sort of the traditional metadata uh conversation which is really important and it's kind of what ahmed and aj are talking about how do we get really accurate uh information about the song uh or the song specifically um and put that in a way that it can be shared across a bunch of different platforms and you know aggregators can display songs using that information um i feel like that is a problem that a lot of people are working on interesting solutions for catalog and min songs i think in partnership with water and music you guys just put out a standard that looks kind of similar to like an isrc which is sort of the traditional music industry standard that's really exciting there's a project called new which is i believe an open source aggregator uh that's taking music from sound.xyz catalog and basically massaging the data using its own uh pipeline and then publishing that to a open source database as well so that has its own sort of metadata standard there and all this stuff is really important um however i think like perhaps a more you know i kind of think that eventually though this question of like how do we basically take the same standards that exist in web 2 and apply them in web3 will get resolved somehow like one either one metadata center will dominate or one aggregator will dominate most likely but i think the thing that's really most up up in the air and up for debate is the rights side it's like the legal side of nft music i think that's the area that doesn't have an answer right now and i think it's probably the biggest challenge the biggest obstacle for traditional artists especially ones who are assigned to record labels for putting their music on chain basically like what does it mean if i create an nft for my song what are the legal rights associated with that and how do you codify those rights into that metadata of that nft like can i make an nf a music nft that actually has these rights associated with it for example fractionalization of royalties um what if i don't want to do that what if i just want to make a pure collectible is there like a standardized way that we can represent that information on chain and i think that's the area where we can really change music permanently as opposed to just like you know getting the same kind of data that we already have for webtoon music for web3 now let's act you know i'm curious to actually hear about uh what what kyle since you're a lawyer but i know it's not legal advice curious what you think about the the right side of this equation yeah yeah your assessment is great uh the one thing i would add to that kind of the first uh track is tags are really useful so um there's uh yeah we've kind of had discussions about what's the core metadata of absolute required metadata so as aj said right some people will just kind of not do it if there's too much so what's absolutely minimum like who are the creators on it and that one's really tough too uh especially because um say some craters left off left out or um they're inputted incorrectly so then how is that updated especially in an immutable chain um yeah so that that the immutability issue in that first track as well as uh stuff that is uh metadata that's yet to be developed because one of the cool things about nft space is there's so much creativity happening that uh just kind of categorizing that sort of secondary metadata as tags can be helpful so bpm i know it's kind of sometimes given its own but perhaps it should be just more out of that tag thing but any case yeah so but on the legal side yeah that's just a really hard problem and so uh i one of the uh one of what we're discussing right now which i think will be helpful for nfts generally is having a legal document standard um just period so in lifestyle we're dealing with real property not just copyright lots of different types of associations but yeah i guess the legal community really is is kind of figuring out i personally have a uh a um a position where the nft is this generous type of property and it kind of should be kept separate from the other property and i i feel when that happens the analysis is a little bit easier to understand um and sort of bundle of properties that were some other people they'd rather not create a suicide generation so see if our existing structures uh work and so don't have to um have a whole almost new area of property law develop uh so even at that at that really low level um those legal questions are yet to be answered um but yeah one of the things that will be a catalog is an example of uh someone that's just kind of doing it on the ground with with their splits and and having that built in so splits is a little bit easier than the other ones because um same as as resale it's part of the uh um what's compiled in the evm so uh it's kind of more practical than uh uh kind of where copyright often is statutory so people have to understand the statute to apply it and so that's another one of the reasons why i think nft should be a little bit separate because nfps are almost like um [Music] returning to natural law where it's possession is nine tenths of the law that that kind of thing that doesn't really operate in copyright because it's statutory but um and physical it really does matter uh if i have my laptop physically here that's you know then i'm possessing it or whatever um and so yeah so with the public private uh key situation that people having control because they have that that secret um which is kind of like a trade secret then it does allow this interesting i would almost say tort like nature uh for for nfts but yeah so anyway but with getting back to metadata more directly i hopefully will have a metadata standard for lego documentation and then something that should also be part of that is a ux where signatures are fairly people understand that they're um that they're agreeing to something that it actually feels like a signature like in a traditional contract and for copyright that's really important if the uh asset is transferred it uh has to be in writing in quite a few territories and so uh colonel communities are they're working on signature economy stuff um so that that's one place that tech could uh happen i i yeah i feel like we're all kind of aware of what needs to be done just have that patience of building it out but um it does seem like the overall narratives are are going in the right direction so i'm optimistic are there any standards kyle since you're it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about this as you said um are there any places that you feel like are doing it really well right now that maybe we can get behind um i know it's been mentioned that open seas standard is sort of the standard that um everyone's using because they're the biggest they were kind of first and um maybe that's not perfect for what we're doing with um music specific um nfts but yet we're trying to kind of cram in you know a little proverbial square peg round hole kind of thing is that the right direction or is there someone else who's doing it that um that you know you're you're looking to that's like yeah you've got the legal stuff doing really well i mean you mentioned catalog is doing it from the ground up but is there any place where or maybe addressing the education aspect um and getting the the right data and to begin with and then i'll have a follow-up question but if i wanted to make sure we noted that if there's someone doing it really well and maybe it's luxedout oh yeah i mean lexdell started the process for a more general legal solution but there is a distinction between the legal that is because it's uh part of a contract in the evm and then legal that is more um well there's that laws code thing right and so loss code when when legal can um it has it's that kind of legal then there are already solutions there but for instance lifestyle has a thing called kelly down it's a legal rapper so it's an llc on top of that and that is uh what is this i think it's called wet code or something like that uh uh there's dry code and white colors and white coats you know human brains uh and so and so that that still needs to be built out quite a bit and and yeah alexa working on it a few other areas or a few other um i guess the political engineers are also working on that but that one's still farther out so the law that is getting built out uh that's already built out to some extent already is is that law that can be encoded and and has been encoded and but that's limited it does also again open a whole new space a lot like resale so the first sale doctrine doesn't really matter so much because there's resale that's actually in the evm so um it's there so again possession is kind of it exists so what are you gonna do um uh yeah uh azor ah i believe is uh um it seems like the uh music entities zoro is has the potential to be where these api standards uh from yeah i would call them api standards that's one of the reasons openc uh is is a leader is it's not just uh it's it's that people can can can secondary so something like spin app they can call into openc and and um uh grab the data and so zora has the potential to for music it seems to be um the leader for for those uh i personally i don't want to reinvent the wheel so as much as we can bring in ddex standards since that's already accepted um do so i and if uh apple is indeed x uh universal sony all that so if they um there's a possibility they they work with zora and uh openc and all that to kind of uh set a um platform standard and that just happens and that's especially important for things like resale because uh these are opt-in and i really like that um vip the ethereum standards choose generally for opt-in and ddex also is deciding to join in on that and opt-in that means though that um uh what might happen practically is that sort of the big names that are all well established will kind of create enough critical mass that everyone does decide to opt in uh and i'm i'm really motivated to make sure that opt-in is as um beneficial for artists as possible and seeing how performing rights organizations distribute royalties uh um there's a good chance that we actually will um keep artists at the center of attention and realize that they're the ones that make this stuff and why we're here in the first place and yeah that's great thank you thank you so much for that and i i think there's that there's the tech side of things and then there's i want to get back to also the education side of things because i think a few of you have talked a little bit about that and i think probably the idea of metadata or seeing a big standard is probably um yeah a barrier to entry a little intimidating um what what are you doing in each of your projects or what have you liked doing i mean ahmed you you said that you dug into a project because you were trying to learn aj i know we talked yesterday about the fact that probably a lot of the problems with metadata are not necessarily like because of blockchain it's because of human error right so um there's some education behind that so how are you approaching with your projects education whether that be onboarding or artists that you're working with um and i suppose kyle you know just understanding like what it means to break up a stem and how that affects future future compositions um you can talk a little bit about what education is doing yeah go ahead almond i uh i just figured out you could raise your hand i had to try it out um i think leading through example you know we have aggregators aggregators are a standard thing at this point you know collecting whatever metadata contract address if there's any pro metadata in there which um i think the catalog metadata standard has isrc just none of it's populated so you know the aggregator piece isn't a problem i think the most important thing we can do now is lead by example and show people what we can do with aggregation um because we can talk all day about you know the future micro microservice ecosystem or whatever but if there's no data to actually build these products that we're talking about um then it's kind of useless to talk about something that doesn't exist so you know with this small data set that we've been able to get and you know folks like water and music has like you guys have been able to aggregate over time um i challenge all of our perception about the future of the music ecosystem and how it works we're moving towards a services oriented future and if a platform makes a service that is able to power a powerful secondary music streaming service or music discovery service or music curating service and people can get can get paid passively we don't have to do any convincing there's not it's uh it's do you want to get paid money then adopt a standard because there's micro services built on this the same way that zoro operates right with the api the apis we're saying we're going to make the data available to you go build stuff with it because it's built on zora that's good for zora that's good for you and so that's the future we're moving towards so um maybe a little bit of a radical opinion but i i think that with the right players involved if we keep good hearts and we keep each other honest and keep doing this in a community-oriented way um all the pieces will fall into place because money talks at the end of the day yeah aj you're doing a lot your whole pitch is about bringing music into web3 how so that's clearly educating artists on that how are you talking about that um especially in terms of this more technical side of things yeah i mean this is this is you know metadata is a boring of a but important topic right and it's nothing you know we don't we don't say metadata ever to artists i think like you know like i met saying you know we talk in terms of dollars right you know artists come to us because they want you know they want capital and they want distribution right and i think it's you know both those things are solved uh by metadata as underpinning to making the music more valuable one right because it's more usable as ahmed was saying you know if you have uh robust metadata you know on a song there's two songs one has a robust metadata set the other one doesn't one is discoverable one's available for use of microservices one's you know one can be monetized in a much uh you know greater way more efficient way than the other right and so when we talk to artists you know typically we're you know talking to them about how to maximize the value of their music uh and i think this is just a part of the conversation we need this information so that we can make your music available to all these you know different places and these different services so that it can be distributed more broadly you can get more exposure you know that's sort of the language that that we use to speak to artists with and i think ultimately what incensed them to you know think a little bit more clearly and closely about um what information they're submitting to you know to us as they're you know submitting music and uh and how we can help them right and so i think this is you know an important part of the conversation we have but it's you know nuanced in how we have it um you know we you know typically uh would start to see eyes glaze over even if we talk nfts and technology too much to artists and so you know we typically try to abstract that away and talk in terms of you know they want to hear and understand and and typically like i said it's you know it comes down to capital and it comes down to reach and value of the work and um and you know we use that as the the leading sort of uh you know trojan horse to have this deeper conversation about okay here's how we do those things is you know these ways that's great and kyle i don't want to skip you if you have any i know i mentioned just the the fact that you're breaking up the actual compositions a little bit which i'm sure is a totally different conversation about let's just move on here yeah i'm happy to talk about that a little bit too i think it's it is a little bit different i think than like i said than the kind of traditional metadata systems uh that we're used to but it's something that we think is a potential unlock from web3 it's kind of built around the ideas about around composability and the power of composability a good example of that is open source software and the open source software movement so like the the analog is that in the software world people started to publish their code openly and allow other people to use it and build things on top of it and people did so and they would build things that were more powerful they would build libraries you know operating systems browsers and make that code available for reuse and eventually nowadays developers have access to like this unbelievably powerful uh ecosystem that's just like of infinite code essentially that you can do almost anything you can imagine you can search for it online and find an open source library that does it and we kind of think about this and say can we apply this to music for music creators can can we have a world where you listen to any song on spotify any song on audios any song on it youtube and you can just click a button that lets you remix that song and you have the legal rights taken care of you know payments royalties splits whatever taken care of handled by uh smart contracts or you know some other system um and yeah it sounds like it sounds like a dream a faraway dream but like we've kind of built a we built a mini version of this ecosystem that's on chain and uses uh uses smart contracts to handle this um attribution and like kind of this permissionless remixing is what we call it and so that's kind of like the prototype that's what we've built at arpeggia and kind of what we're working on expanding and flushing out and our thesis is that in the same way that uh open source software you know started off as kind of a radical idea that goes against everything you know that capitalism tells you about selling and owning your your content we think that hopefully we can prove that there's actually a model where sharing and collaborating openly with other artists and kind of letting your music free in a sense will actually be beneficial for the artist it'll make them more more well-known and they can profit from their you know they can earn an income and earn a living through like all kinds of uh new models that exist whether selling nfts live performances whatever it might be while still letting people remix and reuse their stuff so that's what we built at arpeggi.io um yeah i mean again it's not exactly related to metadata but it is this kind of interesting new approach um to collaboration and songwriting yeah and i think that goes over to what then but saying it's that you're showing by example you're showing what you can do with with this right now and why it matters and then people are getting paid clearly too yeah that's very important it's great for everyone um question for for colleges on sports music is you know as as uh you know producer or artist submits um track samples to arpeggi is there is there just the terms of use that says you know this music is is freely available to remix or is is that you know how how is that um sort of initiated i guess like a better term yeah though you're right it's it's a terms of use and there's a license agreement essentially that people release their music under right now it's it's simply cc0 which is the most you know the most open and free licensing uh terms that you can have yeah um in software that's the equivalent of like the mit license essentially which is basically saying you can use my code for whatever you want got you and that's what we're doing right now but ideally this model can evolve and and we can start to answer some of the trickier questions and supports more complex right systems where people you know are expected to profit from any time their music is used or you have to re-register your songs back in to the system or we could use cc by which is saying that you have to provide attribution um you don't necessarily have to pay me when you use my stuff but you at least have to give me attribution um so yeah there's some options there yeah no we're thinking a lot about open source music as well and you know what uh what an ecosystem could look like where you know any song that is heard could be not only a remix but you know there could be ugc added to it you know as a way to uh you know really showcase the cultural value of of the song or music right so think about you know a song that gets you know uploaded to spotify and then remixed on soundcloud and then there's a reaction video on youtube there's comments you know on all these all these uh contributions but they're all separate you know what if they all you know resided in the same place right and you really get to measure the cultural impact of an inspiration that's provided by you know any piece of music i think it's something that you know artists would love to see and if you have to sort of own an nft to you know be a part of discussion by contributing in this way through not only remixing the song but if you want to create fan art you know that's inspired by it or uh or you know create a visualizer you know uh that's that's uh you know that that reacts to the music um that could be an interesting way to again attribute value back to the artist you have to own an nft nft is linked to you know it's all linked together in this content web and um and i think yeah i mean a a a cco standard would be would be a really interesting way to accomplish that so yeah i i may be following up with you after this yeah please do yeah float was one of the early supporters of arpeggio so shout out aj and float i'd i'd like to say real quick um i've worked with greater commons a bit and i've tried to get them involved in nfd as well and so ddex has been on board but creative commons so far um they're i guess a bit on the sidelines but hopefully they will uh have a working group uh we had a working group with ai so i don't think there's any reason why we can't have a working group with uh nfts uh and i see some issues like song and uh bayman he's he's said he doesn't really like cc0 um because his identity is really involved in the music so if someone synchronizes it to say like a political campaign ad or something like that then it's tacitly saying that he agrees with that campaign so for things like edm stems if it's like a um a drum line that people can't really recognize immediately that drum or something like that then it makes a little bit more sense to do straight up cc0 but hopefully yeah cc will start to get more involved with the nft community and kind of have more options so that uh something like arpeggio can have it so that sync license has to be something that is negotiated but everywhere else like as long as it's on chain and using on-chain system then uh it is cc0 and uh it's really great for memes uh disaster girl she didn't make any money off of that i mean uh but because because it's all public but then with that nft that said this is the original then suddenly she had a private version of it and so uh there's this really great uh paradigm that we can pursue that is taking the best of what copyright provides but not uh overly emphasizing the monopoly and kind of abusing monopoly like copyright has done in the past so yeah hopefully we can build that with creative commons i'll keep working on that this is how we reach the utopia that is promised by web3 right just a few back-end things to do so i'm getting ping that we're getting close um to the end here so i don't i don't want to leave without having whomever's watching this not be able to follow up on um what you guys are saying i know we've already got maybe a a little follow-up between kyle and aj um this is obviously going to be an ongoing um problem that we're having to solve um can you each um let us know where people who are watching could connect with you or what you're doing especially as it relates to the future of metadata standards um yeah and i'll just let you go around yeah sure i'll go first so um yeah people can follow us on twitter at team float t-e-a-m-p-h-l-o-t-e um they can also check out the site float.xyz p-h-lot.xyz and yeah share music with us you know earn tokens and be a part of the ecosystem i would love to hear what you're listening to awesome thank you you guys can follow me on twitter i'd love to you know help with any projects make any data sets available help you re-implement code or anything like that you can follow me on twitter m-u-t-a-h-a-d-i-r and yeah i'd just be happy to collaborate with anything part of a citizen developer group and so advocacy for coding skills you know general web3 knowledge and web 2 technology as well i'd be happy to help personally so yeah feel free to reach out you will get a response from me amazing thank you arpeggio is uh our twitter handle a-r-p-e-g-g-i and you can also find me at ksd underscore eth on twitter that'd probably be the best way to find me our website's arpeggi.io and you can find our discord information there if you'd like to join our discord i'd love to hear from you guys team thank you kyle uh uh yeah so myself i'm best date on twitter so b-e-s-t-a-p-e and then the web through music coalition is web3 coalition on twitter and lex dao is lex underscored val and dms are open for all three uh thanks kyle and i suppose i should mention one more time i'm with water and music um and again we're doing a lot of research collaborative research as the dow on web 3 areas um when it comes to music that can be found at waterandmusic.com some of that is free content some of that is paid membership content but um and you can also follow me at brooke brooke jackson at twitter j-a-x-o-n so um thank you guys so much really appreciated the conversation and i'm sure we'll keep it going offline see you again bye thanks everybody thank you everyone for this very very in-depth and exciting conversation who could have thought that metadata could be such an invigorating topic i cannot wait to have more metadata in my everyday life which we all have ultimately you know when you look at it um you are more metadata than the you are human these days which is one of the main reasons why we are engaging in the technologies that we are engaging in every day here in this weed and wonderful web 3 space and again if you couldn't write down all the usernames um please go on to my own twitter profile opium underscore hum and there's a thread where pretty much everyone who was speaking today is linked so you can follow them for more insights so friends we have now the very very last panel not panel conversation and input of the summit of this metabolism hackathon that we were putting on since thursday or since wednesday rather with eve global so full week of learning building interacting making friends maybe enemies even but this next speaker most certainly is not going to be your enemy unless you are an immoral sentient ai because imanna bello who i happen to have met on an event that zora put on a few weeks ago in paris uh the ecc randomly got talking and her expertise is quite relevant currently and that is the field of ai ethics now one would say mikhail why would we talk about ethics in the context of engineering and technology building but technology is not neutral technologies biased technologies ideological and technology can have more and ethical implications and giving these emerging new ai ecosystems dali being a really good example or pollinations dot ai a project that i really really like um there's quite a lot to think and speak about so um that's exactly what's going to happen and there might be some wi-fi issues because humana is on the road right now so um i do hope that she has a stable connection to you if not we might have to repeat it some other day but please um i would like to give the stage to you iman welcome welcome yes hey thank you for having me thank you so much for having me um thanks to it global obviously for organizing such a great event and as well as to orzara for putting all of this together so as miranda was saying the discussion today is going to be about ai ethics per se we will focus on image generation models and the question is what lessons could be could be drawn from ai ethics for the future of the economy which is as you know webframe so i'm not going to discuss much about about rep free because i don't want to bore you and i know you know that rape free has this huge potential it does represent a parenting shift and we we've heard the keywords surrounded around financial inclusion governance decentralization so we all know web 3 does represent this this new tool this potential to use our collective imagination to design new um digital spaces on on changes so how exactly do we build this future together how exactly do we ensure that the expansion of the web tray actually serves humanity at large my key point here is in the title and it is that aa ethics per se can be a tremendous asset to know what has been done before in the field that also is related to paradigm shifts that is also related to doing things differently and potentially serving humankind at large and that is part of its ethical considerations its consequences its potential harms on individual and groups and that we can just use that in order to gain some time in order to not repeat the same old mistakes in order to get ahead to actually fulfill what we are i think oh here for it which is the potential website so very briefly we say that in ai ethics um there are two type of harms and just so you know before i deep dive into it i will today with you hopefully focus on um imagination models um notably as michael just mentioned dolly because i think um a those models do represent a paradigm shift as well and they will be used in the web to create images to create landscapes to create multi-modal experience user experiences as well so it's important to understand what they are and what their potential consequences could be and how exactly we go around them so aa ethics in general um those who present according to researcher k crawford two type of harms harm a harms of allocation her b harms of representation harms of allocation are harms um where people affected persons are not receiving are not being allocated resources so here you can think of not getting a loan um applying um to get a loan an institutional bank see here we go with financial inclusion and being rejected based on um either a decision that has been made by an air system um or a decision that has been pushed for uh by any system and agreed upon by by a human being either way so those are harms of allegations you are not being allocated a given resource um and then we have harms of representation which i think here we will also deep dive into because we are we will discuss um image generation models so we are discussing images representations of society um structures of power as well so harms of representation is when a given person or a given group are represented in a given manner either they are presented with indignity or they are being stereotyped upon um etc so here you can think of well we will discuss harms of position when we discuss the limitations um of some a models notably a mass generation model so if you haven't heard about them if you haven't heard about image generation model um i'll give you some examples so the first well-known imagination move that we know of is called gpt3 or gpt2 but we'll discuss jupiter a it's a system that uses languages language um [Music] to instruct a large neural network to perform a variety of text generation tasks the input is a language and the output here is also text generation for a doll e uh we have double e and dolly 2 which is the newest version of del e it's a system that was created by open ai [Music] which simply needs a simple text description to generate an image so here you can think of um [Music] a chair that looks like an avocado a chair that looks like an avocado um and then so you input this simple text description to the system and the output that you have is well an image of the chair that looks like an abacus a what the system does dolly too it turns those simple text descriptions into and this is very important into realistic photos that have never existed before a raccoon that done said basketball so it turns text into realistic images that have never existed before um it can also realistically and edit photos so if someone wants to take a very important historical building that exists somewhere um and very realistically a edit the photo and pretend that there is smoke behind um this building it is possible so take take take a second to think of a the potential consequences of of what it could mean solely in terms of misinformation for instance or of representations of reality as well how people understand information how people understand realities so it can turn text into realistic photos it can realistically edit existing photos um and it can also a start with an image and create variations of that image based on the given image so think here of the case by clipped a the input here is the case by gustav clipped and the outputs are variations of the kids so not the kiss but variations of the kiss same colors a different positions but when you see it and if you're interested you can absolutely take a look at those examples that i'm giving those are real examples of photos that are public you can find them on the open ai website if you simply google doll e2 open ai pictures and i wish i could have done a ppt um but i'm in vacations and and traveling so i don't have my computer so i'm just like this is totally me and my words um but if you if you want to take a look at the pictures you absolutely can and they're very easily found um to be found online so just to to to sum up and then we'll dive into the limitations and what we can learn from them for the webre um you have an image generation model that can turn language into realistic picture that have never existed before edit realistically existing pictures um and take pictures and and just like do variations out of that one given um picture in terms of art in terms of landscape creation like for instance for the for the metaverse it could have tremendous applications and we'll discuss the web free applications of image generation models but right here i do want you to take a second to think of um the limitations of those models because there could be errors in the label data so that is a if within the system a picture that represents a car has been labeled as a plane and you ask the system for a plane it will give you a car so there can be errors in the label data um there are gaps and it's training um as well so it's very important to have in mind that the system is limited um and it's not solely limited in in terms of technical limitations which is what i've just pointed towards it also has limitations because it has this potential to harm and i think it's very important to take this into account if we are to actually embrace disparity shift that works we could be the potential to harm individuals or affected groups is notably by reinforcing stereotypes um by erasing individuals by erasing groups by denigrating them or treating them with indignity i'll give you some examples there are plenty um but uh but i i do wish to discuss with you if we have like five minutes at the end of this uh discussion so i'll give you some examples of assumptions that are reproduced by the system a it does over represent um [Music] generations of people that are female passing for some a job occupation or a male passing also for other job occupations so if you do ask um this is tip to represent a builder you will have images of male blessing persons if you ask the system to represent um a flight attendant you will have um images of female passing persons so there's this um [Music] there's also what i mentioned before in terms of erasure of certain groups or of certain individuals because the system does um over represents as well a person's with lighter skin tone or due to its um potential to harm notably by generating a what we call legally explicit content a some images are not um cannot be reproduced so certain experiences for instance um if you're sick if you've been in the hospital if you're a person with disabilities and some experiences have a less chance of being represented so those are just examples of limitations of this particular image generation system um when we take into account the added um capabilities of that system which i mentioned before um so which are a um variations you know the kiss of klimt and then you can do dozens of variations of the kiss um so when you take into account variations and when you also take a look at what is called um in painting so a you know taking a picture and then adding something realistically to it or just editing it um but very realistically um you also have over paths of the pathways of the possibilities and to harm to repeat use um bias stereotypes at scale so here the questions are always okay what is the model what does it do um how do we wish to deploy it um because open ai i thought as really far ahead how exactly they could deploy dolly and they did not release it for the world to use how do we wish to deploy it and which harms are there which can be avoided which cannot which harms do we measure um and those that cannot be avoided how do we mitigate them how do we minimize the risk um so taking all of those limitations into account uh taking this potential harm into account i think it's um it's best to have in mind that by taking some tools that exist that i can create a lot as well obviously that's not the point um it's also it's also best to have their limitations in mind what it means um for the web3 is that you know we could think of using a image generation models for nft creations for profile pictures avatars or even and that's what i mentioned earlier um for you know creating land creating um environments entire environments notably in the metaverse um so we could create landscapes based on landscapes images that exist or ask for landscapes that are that have never been um existence before to be created via such systems and so it has this potential to be used to generate not only images but also entire multimodal experience or worlds based on the limitations that we have seen a or in general i would say um when wanting to align what's work with the paradigm shift that does represent 123 um plus wanting to a use this um this potential for creativity that also does represent image generation models um it's also important to have a those limitations in mind in order to do things differently and in order to actually align the promise of webfree with what we actually uh do um [Music] so one key example that i could that i could just like throw up in the air obviously um i do not have um solutions i only have questions that one can have in mind for a all stages of creating a and design new places whether it's at the stage of addiction or at the stage of team formation or whether it's at the stage of pitching and thinking the project um what does the project do to whom how do we deploy it etc etc so i leave you with this um examples that i really like of publication methods nia epic research a few years ago [Music] there was absolutely no requirements as to how exactly ethical considerations could be taken into account um by researchers um [Music] and i think there was a momentum four years ago and as of now the major ml the machine learning deep learning conferences research conferences do um ask their participants if they wish to be published to take into account not only the ethical considerations of the project but also um analyze their potential and unintended consequences and suggest as well um risk mitigation strategies so a first step to do things differently could be whenever you use the tools that we have um to create new ones to think ahead of the potential harm [Music] that the project per se could embed so my point here uh and i'll be happy to take any questions because there's a lot deep dive into at many stages um my point here is that it's great obviously to have it to have in mind the capabilities of the model um and those should be taken into account but it's best to also um take into account the larger context in which um this images can be used or shared and to do this you know in the present times and also in the future because it it needs to be a flexible approach and i told you at the very beginning that um ms generation models could be used to create worlds and and as of now we don't we don't know for sure how exactly what what exactly the consequences will be um [Music] so based on this recognition you know this humility of we don't know exactly what all the consequences are going to be but based on the knowledge that some consequences are known some consequences have been attached to existing systems to existing technologies there are fields out there that are specialized into um you know centering lived experiences of affected communities to actually um imagine globally a future that works for everyone and so yes i will leave you with this i will leave you with the possibility to to imagine further and based on a given understanding of how social hierarchies work based on an understanding of how the relationship between language and power works um and just with this you know with this plea that there's so many um people out there that would be thrilled to work with you so that you can also interrogate your work and enrich it um with ways to render it less harmful uh to whom in what ways you know and and just do it you know do it better voila uh that's what i can give you that's obviously a very brief introduction on um ms generation models on you know the type of harm that we have highlighted when it comes to ethics um and then you know i'm also very eager uh to learn about your projects and see what's what we can do you know and in the web free that's a very bright future we could build together but if you have any questions i would be happy to to take them i'm not sure how you can ask them but uh but i would be here for it um thank you so much iman um i think i will you know like um will step in in terms of questions we have to wrap it up unfortunately uh very soon but nonetheless um i do think that this will spark a couple of follow-up conversations in particular with artists also i do think that we might might want to workshop this in a different forum because i find the conversation and its implications for complex technological systems or as i was earlier when maybe you have not been tuning in yet been describing your web three is a techno social space because it never can you know the technology can never live outside you know social context and certain things are just impossible to to achieve certain neutralities of technology there's a couple of conversations in web 3 about your incredible neutrality what does that look like is that even possible from a ethics point of view from a legal point of view so there is quite a few questions um that need to be addressed and don't get addressed enough in my opinion in web 3 in particular but i'm wondering you've been talking about guiding principles and since we do have quite a few builders here that you know try to build projects that they want to be equitable you know that want to be um driven by agency you know but very often you know certain experiences and knowledges or you know ideas are missing in the process you know you can't build anything taking like you can't build taking something into account that you don't know of what would be like your ai ethics quick guide to building with outcome to build with with ethical accountability like are there anything any pointers and even if it's a book that you would say that like is incredibly insightful when it comes to these things okay would say um at the stage of ideation and information um it's very it can be very insightful to look for other skills then so will we take related skills and look for ethical philosophical experts i would also say that it's very difficult to know what what one cannot know so as well i would you know um [Music] interrogate the technology per se and try to see exactly um what the consequences could be and then to give an idea of you know one resource that i find very useful to get started in jai ethics i feel like the podcast called radical ai is a very good place to start yes i think it's a good place to start radical a podcast um okay most certainly will will put that onto my pile of things i want to know and i mean there's also you know like we could get into very very in-depth conversations also about about ideas of of ethics you know there's of course like schools of philosophy what does like an ethic look like that is rooted in you know like cosmological principles of knowledge formation you could get very very deep unfortunately we do not have the time for this um but um imanabello please follow her on on on twitter and as i understand you just started your web 3 journey more or less currently yes so i know we will see much more of you in our space this was just an intro to this weird and wonderful world that is our community around the global and zora and i can't wait to have another in-depth conversation with you um as well thank you enjoy enjoy your trip your holiday yeah um have a wonderful evening thank you see you soon take care see you soon bye um so friends uh i clicked again on the wrong thing here um i think i had something to share yes oh no this this i wanted to share yes uh that's it we've done this is the the east global and zora metabolism hackathon digital summit day two um i do hope it was insightful for you if you missed any of the content it is already online so you can watch all the panels beginning from thursdays in-depth hackathon workshops and technical guides to the artist workshops uh with some of the incredible artists like ai art with portrait xo is incredibly fascinating or blockchain as a technology to solve the refugee crisis by leona from african nft community there's quite a few things that you can explore and tomorrow we will have the grand finale the edb ceremony in which we will give out the prices to some of you from over 100 or just about 100 submissions that we have received and i only saw a fraction of them and a lot of them absolutely blew my mind so thank you so much for participating thank you so much for watching um today and we will see you soon either in the zora sphere or on twitter or somewhere else in what is our little version of uh or corner of the web 3 world all righty peace out i'm gonna go offline now okay you
