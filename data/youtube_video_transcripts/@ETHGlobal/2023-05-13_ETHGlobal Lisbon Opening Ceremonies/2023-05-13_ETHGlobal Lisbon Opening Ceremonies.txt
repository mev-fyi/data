what's up from this we're switching straight foreign good evening everybody how are you all doing my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to eat Global Lisbon can't wait to get started this is not a conference if you've been to any global hackathon well if you've been doing a couple events you'll know that this is a hackathon and what makes us different is our focus on a couple of key things our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running a lot of amazing developer focused hackathons what makes these events unique or these three things our focus is on Builders and Builders only these are opportunities for you to learn get help and grow as individuals whether you want to learn how to be a better developer whether it's front-end back-end full stack solidity anything You Name It We want to be there to help you get there and give you the resources you need to be successful and we really believe that showing is way more important than telling which means anything that you do today will be focused on a demo and not a PowerPoint because that's the code we want to see not just something you want to hear you talk about on what you think is interesting and this is something we've been doing for the last five years we've been to all different continents whether it's Argentina Africa North America Asia Waterloo where we all started this was London just before covid we got back last year with Amsterdam Mexico and South America San Francisco in India last fall and just a month ago in Tokyo and I'm super excited to be bringing youth Global hackathons here in Lisbon this is our first event in Portugal and we were absolutely Blown Away by the excitement and the interest that we got from everybody here they're over 975 attendees in this building this weekend and that's amazing from that 650 of these are hackers who are coming in from 51 different countries and about 30 of them are brand new to web3 how do we Define what's new to web3 we Define this as existing developers who are interested in trying what they can do in what three for the first time coming in from web 2. so these are already existing designers Engineers who are currently thinking about what they should be looking at in web3 so I can't wait for all of them to feel welcome and get a sense of our community we put everybody on a map to see where people are coming in from and we have people from six different continents here just here this weekend and so many from Europe and UK on top of all those hackers we have 176 ecosystem Builders these are amazing partners and the engineers and designers and product Managers from all the protocols you've heard of and 23 technical mentors who are here 24 7 to help you get the help you need to get your project to the finish line on top of that all of that already happened a few hours ago we were doing 17 workshops which are on different protocols and because this is not a conference this is a hackathon only five talks which happened earlier today so focus is very much on building want to give you all the time you need to make something that you're excited about happen and come to life by Sunday and on top of all that over 275 000 in prizes and we're gonna be talking about all those prizes and everything you can win uh just in a few minutes and 24 incredible Partners who are here making this event what it is and there to help you succeed I want to give a quick shout out to all these companies so please join me in thinking with a mass around Applause to one inch World coin optimism polygon gnosis chain air stack apecoin CK Bob fuel Labs safe ethereum Foundation cartesi Uma metamask Falcon Virtual Machine lens protocol uniswap Foundation the graph Ave Grand style mantle chain link CIS metal scroll and neon Foundation all these companies are giving amazing prizes and they're here to help you really understand what you can do to save yourself a lot of time in building what you're going to be building and just learn about cool projects that are up and coming in the space so I'm going to keep this very small in terms of focusing on a few things that we want to get across for all of you about this weekend so I want to talk about what the venue and everything looks like we have planned for you this weekend how you can get all the help all the prizes workshops and talks anything about team formations a lot of you are still looking for ideas and how judging is going to work on Sunday so first things first do not use Wi-Fi hotspots we're trying to make sure that the internet is going to work in this middle part that's where most of the signal noise comes from because it's a massive area and you see a lot of bouncing and Echo and the way all the routers work is they interfere with each other and they're automatically set to fight each other on the waves trying to increase their band frequency which means the second you turn on your Wi-Fi because you think the internet's slow you make it worse because now the internet has to compensate for other frequency in there I can talk to you about all the technical stuff too but just don't turn your Wi-Fi hotspots on because you end up making it worse for everybody in that nearby radius we're going to be keeping everything consistent I did a speed check just five minutes before this thing it was 300 down so please please be assured that we're taking Wi-Fi very seriously now let's talk about security everyone must have their wristbands and their badges on them at all times if you lose your wristband we will not be issuing another one to you it's fine if you misplace your badge that's all right we can print another one but if you miss that if you cut this off tonight or some other thing happens and you can't find it that does mean that you will not be allowed back into the building I want to make sure that everybody feels safe everybody their stuff is safe here and everybody's following the same rules so please make sure that you don't lose your wristband on top of all that don't leave your belongings unattended this event in this venue is open 24 7. we are going to not be responsible if you lose anything or if you must Place anything there will be a loss and found in case things come up but please make sure that you keep all of your valuables with you at all times now let's quickly talk about all the stuff that we have planned and what this venue looks like there are two floors here the ground floor where you are sitting right now this is where we're going to be talking today and on Sunday for all the closing ceremonies all the hacking stuff is here at the back of this room is where the food and the catering is on us on the sides of all the walls that's where our partners are and if you want to relax there's a really nice Lounge in there by cartesi you can check that out in that corner which is to my left and your right and that brings us to the second floor there's more hacking spots on the second floor as well and that's where also the workshop rooms are nothing changes for the whole weekend with the exception of one small thing on Sunday on Sunday where the workshop rooms were is where judging will happen so nothing else for hackers but on Sunday you'll be all going upstairs and that's where you'll be presenting your projects to our judges and I'll talk about that more in in a second we also have a lot of late night snacks that we just did dinner but in about three hours we're going to be serving more food so that's going to happen at midnight today and tomorrow uh there's a massive photo booth here you can take a digital photo and get a selfie again make sure you get a photo with your team and get that email to yourself we're also going to be doing a couple yoga sessions tomorrow and all that is also on the schedule you can check that out tomorrow afternoon and that's all the activities in the venue related things in terms of communication want to keep things very streamlined everything we're going to talk about about this event on Logistics will be on Discord and you can go there to see everything that everybody's talking about this includes talking to our partners our mentors and any official announcements from the global team and that's all on eidglobal.com Discord this also means that everything that may change will also be communicated to all of you on Discord but whatever you see on the website is the source of truth if something is running late or something changes or we swap a room we're going to make sure the website is updated first and whatever the website says is what's happening a lot of the workshops are over so that example is not the best situation to talk about right now but in case something changes for judging you want to check the website at all times and that's where everything is going to be and in case you want to know what the website is it's just youth global.com Lisbon and of course remember you're in person this is not an online event anymore just talk to each other if you want to try to find somebody you want to talk to uh trying to find a partner and you want to know how some protocol works you can just walk up to that table and ask them or if you're curious about what the team next to you is working on ask around if you're really stuck on this react book that you can't figure out just shout who knows reacts and maybe you'll get some help this actually does work but let's talk about how the hackathon itself is set up a lot of you are here for the first time and I want to give you a quick brief intro on how everything is laid out hacking has officially begun as a 6 PM which means you can all start working on your projects you can work on a project on your own or with a team if you are working with a team you can have up to five members on your team and you have the next 36 hours to hack 36.5 hours to hack and this is the time you can use to get more ideas talk to a lot of Partners to see what you can not repeat from scratch or just use and leverage some existing protocols or talk to other peers and see if you want to meet somebody who's who has a skill that you're particularly excited about and after all of that on Sunday at 9am that's when submissions are going to be due the way everything is set up is that everything you're going to be doing this weekend should be done from scratch which means you cannot build on an existing personal project what you are doing should be started today as a program and a git repo or a code or design and you have only today until Sunday to work on it we're going to obviously verify everything that you submit everything you do must be open source and publicly inspectable by us and on top of that only RSVP hackers are eligible to win which means that if somebody was supposed to be on your team and something changed for them and they couldn't come in person and they want to hack online that would not be allowed they will automatically be removed from your dashboards later tonight everybody must be in person and if they are not checked in they will also be automatically removed if you have any questions or if any edge cases you were worried about just come find anybody on the youth Global team we'll be happy to kind of look at any questions that you have and of course we have a lot of things for beginners and experts and anybody with all skill sets the workshops accounted for first timers to people who've been in the sequences for years all that information is also on your dashboards in the info center and everything that we did today was live streamed and recorded which means that if you missed a workshop you can just go to eveglobal.tv right now and just replay any of those talks and watch them On Demand and pause wherever you need to pause and on top of that you can just find those speakers here in this room and ask them questions you're in person and if all a few of you who are still looking to meet teammates right after I stopped talking in an hour that's your uh it's gonna be an hour talking we are going to be hosting a workshop on team matching and team formation there's a lot of people who are still looking for teams there are a lot of people who want to join other teams who will bring in specific skill sets like a solidity developer or front-end developer and if you are still in that position you can head over to Workshop room one at 9 30 and you can meet others who are also looking to join a different team and these are also people with ideas who want certain members who can help them make those ideas happen and on your dashboard there's also a find a team feature which means that if you select it I'm looking for teammates or I want to be contacted by somebody you can search people who have specific skills who are also looking to join a team all that shows up on the team tab on your 8th Global Lisbon dashboard and remember 36 hours 36.5 hours Sunday is when submissions are due and what that means is we're going to split up a few ways to do judging and I'll talk about judging in just a second but there's a lot of help here that we want to provide all of you so if you're stuck we have a lot of mentors who are here to help how do you know who's a mentor find people with this jacket they're very easy to spot I can see already 10 of them in front of me and if you see anybody like this they're not here doing construction they're actually here to help you with your code so these are all of our mentors they're going to be here 24 7 they're taking different ships there'll be somebody here at all times ready to answer any questions so you can find them in person you can also ask them in the mentorship channel on Discord and you just add Channel there and any Mentor will be here to pick up that question and come find you or help you debug all those things directly on Discord now let's talk about judging there are two tracks for judging once you submit a project you'll have the option specify if you want to go through the main judging or just the partner judging now this gets a little bit confusing so bear with me for a second partner judging is if you want any of the prizes from the partners if you also want to be one of the top 10 teams that's what the main judging is for it's not a choice of either or it just means that if you're going to do the main judging you get to do both but if you don't want to do main judging you still have to do partner judging I'll clarify that more but what this means is after you submit your project in both situations you will have four minutes to demo your project to the judges we recommend that you also record a video of your demo in case something goes wrong live but live demos are preferred because we really want to see and make sure that you what you did actually works and it's not hard coded also submission will take you a bit of time it'll take you at least 45 minutes if not one hour to fill out the form to submit your project because you have to write a lot of information about what you did how are you using different apis how are you using different protocols and show us the actual line in the code base which means that you have to prep for it submission is going to be available on your dashboards tomorrow so you get to look at what the form is asking for and prepare accordingly but make sure you give yourself a little bit more time really don't know this last minute all that is going to happen on your dashboard everything is going to be visible in multiple steps you get to check out all of that quite easily and in that process you get to specify these are all the prizes I want to apply for that means you pick all the companies that you want to go for and the ones you select will be the prizes and the your project will be made notified to you to the other company and they will know that they're going to expect you to judge your project for that price and after you submit your project you will then have to go to main judging if you checked in the main judging and also the partner judging but if you don't want to go through the main judging you only have to go to the partner's boots so if you want three prizes from three different companies you will go to each of those boots and do your four minute demo three times so that's three four minute demos I have to make sure you have enough time for all of that so don't pick 20 things because you will have to demo 20 times if you also do main judging that means you have three plus one because you have to go to the main judging on the second floor and then individual three sponsors I don't think I'm helping clarify anything so I'll just repeat that again later but make sure that you account for a lot of time for judging if you're applying for multiple prizes and this can be out of order which means that if you if you know they want to present to these three companies you can go to any one of them at any time or if you also are going to do the main Jersey you can go there first or come down here first and do anything out of order none of that's going to be different but just keep in mind that everybody has to see your demo to win and see any prizes that was a lot that's a wrap up code of conduct this still is an in-person event and as part of that you must follow and adhere to our community guidelines and our code of conduct all the rules in terms of Ip what is allowed media policy how to do any of these things all of that is defined on e-global.com rules but the gist of it is that please be respectful for each other and harassment or abuse in any form will not be tolerated we will kick you out if we hear something or if we if you're seen doing something that is not appropriate and if you need any help please contact anybody on the global team or report anything that you feel like makes you makes like a violation of our code of conduct policy and we'll take action immediately so that's everything on the logistics that will help you get ready for everything we're going to do the next 36 hours but let's go into some other pieces that we want to talk about and that is bringing on some amazing Partners who are here to help you succeed this weekend and they're going to come on one by one and we're going to talk about who they are what they do and why they're excited to be part of this event and what you can do and what you can win if you build on some of their sdks so first up I'd like to invite Maddie from optimism so without further Ado please give Maddie a big round of applause [Applause] hello let's get this here all right hi I'm Maddie I'm the head of developer relations for op Labs we're part of the optimism Collective building optimism and there's a couple things you need to know about optimism so uh optimism is a few things it is an evm equivalent layer two main thing you need to know about that is just if you can ship it on eth Main net it is trivially easy for you to ship it on optimism and in fact you should because it is a scalable faster cheaper and it'll let you do different things let you build different applications to to increase that throughput so it is also a modular Tech stack so we make the op stack which is our open source modular Tech that powers everything behind optimism and the important thing there is because it is modular if you have ever wanted to rip out a different piece of a roll-up and do your own thing with it now is your chance and we have a bounty for that so these are the three bounties that we have and and so the three of them are hack the op stack and that is where take the op stack it and bend it to your will if you're doing anything with identity if you're the kind of person that gets really excited about attestations or verified credentials or anything that identity can emerge out of on-chain actions we would like to see your project and we would like to see that on optimism so come talk to me come talk to the team we're sitting right over that way and that gets us to the pool prize so we have 4K for if you don't fit into either of these two categories and you Deploy on optimism then you qualify for this and I'm I'm looking for Kelvin Kelvin are you out there can you raise your hand aha yeah Kelvin is over that way so if you look over there so the optimism Booth is over there look for the trees look for The Greenery so go talk to Kelvin and we have some test net for you so we'll give you some girly eat to help you ship your project we want to hear what you're building ultimately we just want to help people build really cool stuff and yeah we're here to help make it happen so that's it for me I'm happy to pass it on to the next person and thank you all for being here [Applause] amazing thank you next up Miguel from worldcoin please give Miguel a big round of applause [Applause] yeah everyone I'm Miguel or bambia I guess and I would usually start this presentation by talking about civil attacks and how it's important but realistically over the last few months we've seen the world since really really fast we got stable diffusion we go up we could see that not working but we saw stable effusion chatipity all of this amazing AI tools and being able to tell who is human on the Internet is becoming way more important than it ever was before even outside of crypto and so this raises a lot of really important questions both about how do we fairly distribute the value that all of these AI technology generates and also how do we know what's real online how do we know who is human and to solve this issue we've been working on something called wallaby which is a protocol that lets you fully anonymously verify that someone is a real human and moreover that they are performing an action only once so for example receiving an airdrop for the first time or claiming nft or boring a Governor's proposal while still managing to keep the anonymity this is super flexible it can be used in a lot of really cool crypto ways like governance like you mentioned or even web 2 ways like you're in a Discord or signing in to an application and all of this is powered by the orb which makes sure that you're a real human and issues you are already in a completely not Anonymous way if you're if you want to get on board by the urban you want to learn more about how it works our booth is over there and I'm sure my colleagues will be excited to explain how it works and we've made this really cool product that use a serialized cryptography and all of the old magnets to be able to make it really easy to verify that someone is a human line and we've made it this easy to integrate this is all of the code that it takes on your front end to be able to get a serialized proof that then the user is a unique human that you can then verify on say NBR smart contract or often BR API and yeah like I said wallaby it's really really easy to integrate it works on and off chain and kind of sourcing resistance which is something that we've we've been one into for a while and so we have a lot of use cases on our documentation we also have an extended version of ideas that you may want to build with and we have 20K in prices for all of you both for best overall creative use cases governance applications signing with worldcoin a lot of stuff to play with and there's this link welcome.org lisb123 where you will be able to find all this resources that I just mentioned starter kits documentation all that you've been able to think so look that up if you have any questions our boot is over there and let's get the building thank you next I want to bring on Tony from polygon please give tony a big round of applause hey everyone hey everyone uh gmgf my name is Tony I'm from polygon and I just came to tell you about some of the exciting prizes that we have uh polygon is a scaling solution for ethereum and we have a number of different offerings and we also have a very cool identity solution called polygon ID I will not take up a lot of your time but I'm just Keen to make sure that you guys understand some of the bounties that we have available first of all we have um 5K available for the best cross chain hacks so using the brand new polygon zkevm um I'm not sure if some of you have actually heard of it or not but it's it's our very well it was one it's the very first mainnet ZK evm that's on mainnet mainnet beta and I'm I'm hoping the scroll guys don't throw things on the stage at me at this point okay cool I survived I survived saying that um and we want you to be able to to actually build on top of the protocol and be able to send messages to and from the zkevm we also have um up for grabs the best use of polygon IDs verifiable credentials and polygon ID is our decentralized identity solution and if you if you if you want to build on top of polygon ID um we have the core engineering team that's available here so if you come to our booth over there and you have any questions and thoughts about how to build on polygon ID just feel free to reach out uh we are here to support you and if you do end up being successful there's a total of 5K available there um the last price well second to last prize is the best public good with account abstraction or gasless transactions and so we want you to build public goods because public goods are good and so we want you to actually use account obstruction and gasless transactions to be able to power the next wave of public goods because gas fees are not exactly accessible for the global South and we and we recognize that and we want to accelerate the development of um more Equitable public goods and finally we have a pool prize which is um anybody and everybody who deploys on on polygon we just need you to tweet about it and if you go to the to the to the website we'll show you the criteria so I really hope that everybody is excited about building on polygon you could build on polygon zkevm if you're looking for a chain you could build on polygon POS if you're looking um to to actually deploy to our side chain or you could build using polygon ID and extra points if you use polygon ID for me because I'm really passionate about that particular project but thank you very much [Applause] amazing thank you Tony all right next up is Sergey from one inch please welcome Sergey so hi everyone um it's pleasure for me to stay here because and of course everyone like helisborne and it's pleasure for me to stay here because we were born on hackathon exactly four years ago 19th May 2019 we were participating on eth New York on if you're in global hackathon and that's me not this guy on the air mattress that's that's me here with the blanket second sleepless night my body stopped to to warm up anymore so I had to find a solution so and all the Red Bull drinks are not mine it's actually from this guys here who were also on the table um so from in just in four years we grew to like a huge project we have built a lot of products um the first product what we have built on a hackathon over two sleepless nights I personally didn't sleep 56 hours so over this weekend um we have built aggregation protocol we invented aggregation for distress exchanges we came to the idea with my co-founder Anton that makes sense to Aggregate and exchange multiple liquidity sources in one single Atomic transaction to improve the the user experience and the execution the rate for the user since then we have built a lot of things like liquidity protocol limit order protocol Autobook protocol um our Fusion self-castative wallet we are working on own Hardware wallet which will will be the first Open Source Hardware wallet in the world so everyone can participate and contribute and benefit and of course we are working on kind of institutional products as well too to open the market for the periods for institutionals 70 percentage of market share of aggregation protocol 80 percentages of limit orders protocol four and a half millions of unique wallets one out of 80 core contributors around the globe who are participating in software Engineers experts marketing people um business business people are working on one-ish network and um overall we raise 190 millions of US Dollars and this is kind of a good example maybe for everyone here you can build your your own unicorn by just continue to build yeah just if you fail just stand up and try it again and you will you will get it I I'm preached from and if you need any help you can come to us we have grants we have boundaries um here for this special hackathon we have 20 000 US dollars of volunteers back into 2019 I I won just 350 bucks uh bonus from ens with one inch and we're able to pay my airplane ticket back to Stuttgart to Germany so here you have the chance to just get 20K in total so build things you can just come with a new innovation we don't care it's about one ish or not just if you solve a problem uh come to us and you get a good good amount of money and you have also a chance to get a grant from our dollar for example so we have our Fusion where you can build on top of it and on top of our our delegation and staking uh system you can also get a grant so just come to our boothy will help you so that that's it thank you very much it was once again pleasure also for the organizers uh really pleasure to stay here thank you Sergey it's it's amazing hackers like you that uh connect achieve something amazing and bring and share back to the community so excited to have one and support us too well next I want to bring on LA to talk about noses chain please give out a big round of applause thank you I'm the last one guys uh so I'll be very brief there is only one slide uh as you may know uh no this is a community ranching uh proof of stake I'm fully secure by uh collection or a set of validators with 127 plus K validators securing the network it's CVM so all the tool sets it's supported if we go I I lied there are two sides this is the one so if you scan this QR code you will get access to the documentation site where you will find all the protocol specifications uh how to run or how to use an RPC node uh get some funding so please don't you know start pushing too much the the faucet we can help you there we have a booth and also set up a configure um all the dev tools there are 20K dollars in prices for Innovative apps using AI Hashi there is a an underlying technology for bridging an account of traction using the safe SDK we have a booth over there so come and get help and please please enjoy your time hacking and enjoy the weekend thank you well those were some of our amazing Partners there's a lot more prizes that we're giving out and we'll talk about them in just a few minutes but before we get to the prizes and kind of let all of you get back to hacking we want to do a quick conversation about how this ecosystem has evolved and specifically a lot of themes that we've seen the last few years want to reflect on that and understand kind of how things are moving ahead and what I want to specifically talk about is how D5 has changed and what we've learned in the last few years and what we're excited about in the future and for this I want to bring on stani who's the co-founder of Ave and lens to share a few of his insights over the last few years so without further Ado please join me in welcoming stani on stage [Applause] all right GM BD well stani I am super excited to welcome you here because you've almost been to every single e Global hackathon ever and that's one amazing because you've been part of this whole ecosystem from its initial foundings not just the global just the ethereum itself and what I want to spend the next 10-15 minutes on is talking about how things have changed let's start all the way at the beginning how did you get the idea of Ave and how was Avi started or Ethan as I Used to Know It yeah um been quite quite a long journey um and it's actually very fascinating to be here now um after a few years and seeing the community grow these hackathons used to be very small it was just basically me and Karthik no I remember a few years ago we did the world's biggest ethereum event as a hackathon and it was only 400 people yeah so it's it's grown quite substantially so it's uh um super exciting to see like how um ethereum or even like Beyond Webster Community has been growing specifically the uh developer Community um and very early what what was fascinating for me is is that um if you think about blockchain and what we're trying to solve you know it's I personally tried to solve um kind of like a smaller challenge of being able to use a crypto asset as a collateral to unlock liquidity as a use case but what I noticed um what what got my interest is that blockchain and web tree is something where you can solve challenges globally so you solve something for someone but it can be applied uh to everyone it's it's basically a way to create uh Democrat Democratic software borderless that doesn't take into account the background so you can create like a very neutral software that can help people across globally and that was something very appealing to me and I think crypto in general had this kind of like um uh perception as well and got me in the first place to build something interesting and finance uh I've I've been always a finance geek and seeing programmable uh smart contracts was was something that got me excited to to actually build the very predecessor eat land before aave what uh what was the if I like five years ago well back then it's there wasn't DFI so um you know there was one decent Choice exchange um and the kind of like idea of you know what if you could actually trade um against smart contracts and they have specific rules um and and you can let create orders without giving custody of your funds um you can talk about either Delta in case uh somebody remembers yeah there was probably third Delta and something else kyber um radar relay radar relay we met someone from radar relay today which was uh very strange because um you know it's a there's a lot of projects and people in the space even these projects um you know they they change and evolve um but you see uh people staying in the space which is quite amazing at the same time but it was very small so over the years now um I've seen decent just Finance grow substantially um even peaked I think at some point over 200 billion worth of value looked across the and smart contract infrastructures um I think all the peaked at 28 billion or something so substantially grown quite a lot it's still small compared to finance in general but for us you know a bunch of kids building a future of finance that was quite amazing from what you initially wanted Ave to be and what it is now do you feel like it's you accomplished a mission how has it changed how does it differ from your original vision the original Vision was just um you know democratizing Finance providing everyone access um and and mainly the the same equal opportunities so that that has been always the the vision of what we want to do increasing Financial um and and also social uh participation and looking back now I I think we've been able to achieve um some sort of kind of like uh success in in our community um I think I think kind of like the game isn't over yet because I I just feel that D5 has so much potential um it's just for me when I talk about DFI I usually think about D5 as just Finance it's just better faster stronger Finance um and I think that's the mindset you have to think about it if you want to build uh beyond our community so I think the part has been uh right for the Ave protocol especially because it's now this centralized is it's governed by the community so anyone from here can become a delegator create a delegate a delegator platform and become a kind of like a protocol politician or you can as a developer contribute directly to the protocol and improve it and I think that's a big part of uh decentralization so I think we're in the right path that's kind of interesting because I feel like we've seen D5 go from nothing to something I mean forget different Primitives so we can have stable coins until a few years ago like we remember the space before stable coins existed and and you kind of saw everything through the the peak of D5 summer and then a lot of things it means those heels uh well let's not forget covet in that same window but um do you feel like interest in D5 has gone down um in in terms of like the sentiment I would say not necessarily no I think I think I I meet more people that are interested in decentralized finance um something that has changed um especially over the past maybe um a couple of years and especially the past year is that um D5 is no longer the entry point uh to web3 that basically means that we have we onboard more developers um and more users into the space that doesn't necessarily come from the D5 perspective that might be the Creator economy um that might be through dial participation that might be through web 3 social um but that's actually a good thing because um you might be you might onboard from one particular area but you might then gain interest in um in df5 and I've seen this happen you know also um in in in in the space and I I would say that um building defy has changed a lot so um there is not any more kind of like a gap filling so especially like few years now we've we've been feeling different kinds of gaps in web3 um you know we're looking what kind of um transactioning we have in traditional finance and and try to kind of like create similar maybe a bit more improved ecosystem or improved uh protocol maybe it's like swapping or lending um and and have it in in D5 and I think now it's just kind of like a different time to build where you have to build in a way where um you have to figure out like what is the thing that actually suck in traditional Finance um this is a big list yeah it's a big list but it's also a challenging list because um whatever whatever isn't working and you have to figure out that how you can actually use blockchain technology smart contracts everything that we have and actually improve those uh challenges and I think um the traditional Finance has a lot of things that can be solved uh with the blockchain uh with the transparency the accountability um and also the the immutability and and everything can be programmable so I just think that it requires a bit more effort uh which is a good thing because whatever you're going to build um if it's gonna move the needle it's going to move a lot and that will bring new users into the space so times are just a bit different now [Applause] got some fans here um well [Laughter] that's what I love about hackathons it's it's you get to keep things just real and sometimes a little bit interruptive but that's an interesting point because I I think a few years ago kind of the The Narrative but also just what we saw was Defy is the killer app for ethereum and we saw programmability to finance but now there's so many other entry points Dows exist we have nfts as a massive thriving ego system you talked about social gaming all these things are bringing different kind of audiences in and of course that creates a lot of distractions for even developers because they have too many choices um but one thing I'm kind of curious about is all kind of the common complaints we heard about defy back years ago we thought it would be fixed when else you show up fast transactions no gas or cheap gas or yeah you can cancel everything without a penalty all these things but we still want to see a massive spike in defy why do you think that is or what's missing I think also that um leverages is exciting exciting um Innovation both optimistic and ZK VMS um it's it's about scaling ethereum and um you know especially with today's ethereum prices and the more users we're going to onboard um we're gonna have more uh challenges with scalability so so the the idea of being able to transact outside of ethereum and and um and and periodically settle and use ethereum as a finality layer is going to bring a lot of um space to build and I think it's quite early still because um even optimistic rollups they've been around for um I guess like a year uh maybe a year and a half in total it's at least on Main net and even longer yeah it's it's really um I know one year in in DFI is like five years but like it's still very early and I think it's the first time we actually are starting um because like when people say that you know there might not be things to to to to build in D5 I actually see more and more people coming to me and and talk about dfy and it creates this kind of like um um excitement around like what could be the next things to to to build and I usually talk about things more about those yeah yeah I talk about payments quite a lot because um you know Bitcoin in its um infancy uh was supposed to solve uh peer-to-peer uh transactioning um ethereum came um and you essentially had a virtual computer on a blockchain and you can make programmer programmable Finance which is amazing we build exciting things um in in scalable protocols and now with layer 2's we can actually go and intangibly solve the payments infrastructure because you could actually um transact uh in scale and maybe it even requires like a layer 3 or some sort of um additional uh solution yeah exactly but but that's like a that's like a very important problem to solve because um you know we're all crypto users and everyone has a wallet here um everyone has an nft and even I'm pretty sure everyone has paper coins as well but no one actually is able to pay ongoing basis with crypto and and that's a big problem because you know we're the builders and we're the developers and the very first thing that we try to solve with um blockchain we we really haven't been able to do so but now we actually have a tangible choice so whoever like actually goes and starts to think about those use cases um and also beyond that not just building applications but figuring how we bring businesses uh on chain and actually use decent as Finance it's going to be valuable and I think that goes back to my experience when I was 15 and 16 building websites and you know at that age when you're you have some server codes you want to offset them somewhere you know you either at Google ads or then you add payment methods like credit card payments for something and strive was very popular then and it allowed it create this kind of like a certainty that you can actually trust the internet uh payments and effectively what happened is that any business any part of the world could well not any part of the most of the part parts of the world could actually have a global distribution um um and and end user client Network and that was huge that basically bring brought all the businesses um in a financial layer into the internet and PayPal did before that even incredible uh job as well and I really love the 20 bucks liquidity mining that they had as well so it just showcases like how early we are and um if we're able to solve the payment Parts the payment infrastructure that is something where it brings not just end users but businesses into web 3 on on chain economy I think the payment obviously is an excellent point at I mean 13 plus years later after Bitcoin with the title of peer-to-peer exchange we haven't been able to make that commonplace but uh what I guess what I took away from what you just said is seems like we have now all The Primitives we need but we haven't seen those Primitives being used in ways that Find meaning to and consumers is that a fair assessment or do you feel like we still need a few more Primitives that exist in traditional Finance or maybe more in defy that are preventing us from building more useful things I think we have everything we need um we just basically need to kind of like uh move from kind of like building back-end D5 to build front-end D5 meaning that we're using these amazing protocols uh that we have and and starting to think actually like what the experience and and the flow looks like um on the end user side and how we bring closer um web3 for for everyday users or maybe settlements between businesses so I think that definitely exists and another thing that is uh very exciting and valuable is that we've we've built um interesting credit system on chain uh but it's based always on um digital collateralization and in most cases over collateralization so something that we could actually move also forward with is trying to figure out how to build a credit Network or network of credits um yeah I think that was the idea so what it means is that um you could actually use blockchain in terms of like registering different kinds of payment data repayments uh credit scoring um and and evolve a bit from the layer of over colonization and start building trust networks and some of them will fail you know but it's totally fine because most of the thing things in in life and businesses and startups uh fail anyway it's not a trial and error exactly so we want to see more useful payments we want to see a better way of thinking about Credit Systems um I guess I'm curious on with all the excitement we're seeing on icon abstraction zero knowledge proves do you feel like there's an obvious thing that we can do to integrate those types of things in D5 applications yeah and I think that's where um if you're able to prove different kinds of um uh different sort of information about yourself um when you can actually use your identity your knowledge your experience and produce data and improve that as well on chain without exposing the the exact data as well you can actually start building interesting use cases around um validation of of let's say trustworthiness um credit scoring as well so those things are very valuable for the economy because most of the people they do start with a very low um kind of like equity which means that if you want to empower and use blockchain for empowerment and especially with with D5 you have to go beyond the collateralization um because that infrastructure works pretty well um it's fine but you will have to find components how do you Empower by getting and providing more access to to create it and to be honest you could actually build a pretty damn good um credit scoring and credit Network on chain because you know even if you move today from one country to another your credit scoring doesn't passport so it just showcases how clunky the existing system is um and it isn't borderless and Global and I think there's a lot of ways to to fix that with um with with D5 so you can add elements of privacy too there because that helps a lot more Integrations with web 2 or just traditional finance and and defy and I feel like that's also a bit underexplored um yeah especially because uh I think I think even the Privacy itself could bring more people but um I think it's very valuable that uh D5 started as a more like a public infrastructure so not just the markets are public but also the addresses and and balances and that kind of like I created a lot of credibility um auditability as well um and and that creates a bit better Equitable uh Finance but down the line you will have to add more privacy to to D5 and and solving that aspect is is super valuable I absolutely agree um I want to come back to The Primitives again you are building a stable coin which uh has some unique features and I guess I'm curious about what go is why did you decide to build it and how does it work s um it's it's over colonialized um asset where effectively it's based on a Model where we've we've used already on eatland on the overallization we're using it um we use the same model at Ave and where any um reductions of the colonization value will get rebalanced by liquidation so it's a proven model um and what's interesting about go is um obviously you can mint it against your assets that you are supplying into the RV protocol meaning you can also earn on your collaterals while you're minting and borrowing go but I think regardless of the technicalities there's so much information there um and and just uh from our team made a very exciting Workshop today on on the technical specifications but I think one of the biggest things that that differentiates uh go from anything else is the vision um and I think um go probably will be very accessible um Assets in the D5 ecosystem but the idea is to actually get go into more payment layers and and figure out those different kinds of applications and use cases where go could actually Empower and become a payment layer for internet and I think down the line um as you know go gets adoption and there's um more scalability also I believe in this concept of of um having Choice as a user so I I frequently talk about being a liquid citizen uh on chain so where you have a lot of choices uh you can move your funds from one protocol to another and and there's really minimal risk of of doing that because everything is based on very proven uh infrastructure so as a end user you kind of have the choice of selecting um not just consumer applications but also like infrastructures payment Trails um stable coins communities essentially that represent your values and are backing the things that you appreciate in life and I call it kind of like going beyond the face value so if all these stable coins are packed into the same tracker value going beyond that means that actually you could track because of the traceability and the transparency which of these stable coins are contributing more to reduce for example um global warming or you know funding young entrepreneurs because it's on chain and basically selecting that kind of a payment currency on your day-to-day activities and by your choice you can kind of like a as a bigger group of community move the needle uh more so I think that the the vision part of um getting into payment rails and and helping koi says effectively a tool um it's you the builders that can actually build something tangible where uh more people have access to to go um and and have have value um uh in in in these use cases that is a really uh that's a really good way to think about that I think people are already choosing different front ends or protocols based on what they like in communities but extending that to money is something that you just didn't think you could do before I actually had an idea once that we should do at other like uh 15 different front ends and let the users just choose and because that that gives more optionality end of the day I think social kind of peers through everything eventually yeah that's amazing well let's let's try to talk about something that that's more practical for for Founders here or people thinking about going into defy you kind of said that people are not coming to you more and more which is interesting because from the surface it looks like we're not seeing too many D5 launches or the things we're seeing is more reversion upgrades from things that are already out there so I'm kind of curious on if somebody's thinking about building in defy what should they not do I think they shouldn't rush [Laughter] for many reasons one for for sure is that you know it's it's um if you're building the E5 it might be very Mission critical um software so a good example is that if if there's a rocket that that doesn't make to the moon or let's say to the orbit um that might be a hundred million 150 million uh issue um if if a substantially High D5 protocol uh gets exploited that could be that could cost billions um so some sort of a some sort of kind of like generality of of risk um is important risk management um and also I would not go too fast because you have to take time to to to to to build things but um especially if you're you're gonna think of becoming a Founder there's a lot of new things that you're going to learn um and spending time and learning um is is probably the most valuable uh thing to do and I think in my early days things were moving super fast um and I kind of like regret that um I didn't try to slow down and and and and take more time in in learning a lot of the things I'm doing now do you have a kind of Frameworks for how you think about what idea to pick and how you should think about starting something now in 2023 in D5 a lot of people comment on in in terms of like showing kind of like proposing improvements into existing infrastructure so um creating a slightly better amm or or slightly better Landing protocol or slide to better uh stablecoin but I really recommend to do something that is very contrarian and you know maybe even um isn't isn't really a marginal Improvement on the existing D5 ecosystem but actually something that is very even risky but if it works it really proves something um it's actually like can actually prove some new use cases um as well um and also um critics advice is that you should ship I would not say ship slowly but ship shipping in a way that um you it helps you kind of frequently oh I see like frequently but small small updates um will be the good idea small updates small updates that's just incremental increment incremental incremental progress but not incremental ideas I usually say that like the best case is to ship every week something out even something small like you want to leave a Friday night um your computer by you know getting something out and probably by Wednesday it's by by uh Saturday it's already broken but who cares you know it's you're doing it also for fun um and if your app isn't breaking I'll keep this very quick I'll keep this very quick I'll wrap this up in the next two to five minutes I don't know how fast I'm gonna talk we have over 275 000 in prizes and I want to just summarize some of the big ones one inch is our first one so one inch is giving twenty thousand dollars so the best use of fusion API will get four thousand for first place 3000 for second place and two thousand for the third place winner the best yield implementation protocol on one inch will receive 3 500 for the very first prize 2000 for this second place and 1000 for the third runner-up and for the open track which means if you're just using one inch sdks you can win 2500 for the first prize Place 1500 per second and 500 for the second one next up is World coin worldcoin is also giving twenty thousand dollars the best overall hack on top of world coins sdks will receive four thousand dollars the next three honorable mentions will receive one thousand each the best governance app will get three thousand dollars that uses the world coin sdks the most creative use case of world ID will be receiving three thousand and the best sign in with worldcoin app will receive two thousand and the last one is a pool prize which means that all successful Integrations of the world coin sdks will split three thousand dollars equally then we have optimism so optimism is doing prizes in three different categories if you hack on the op stack you can win four thousand dollars for the first place three thousand for the second place and one thousand dollars per third if you built on decentralized entity on top of optimism the first place price is four thousand and second place is three thousand and third is one thousand and Ten teams will receive two hundred dollars for deploying on the optimism main net whatever your app may be then we have polygon polygon is also giving 2 20 000 in prizes so the best cross chain ZK evm hack will receive 5 000 the best hack to use polygon ID will get 5000 as well the best public good with account abstraction will get five thousand dollars and the best and there's a pool prize of 5000 which means anyone who deploys on polygon will be splitting this five thousand dollars equally then we have no such chain the most Innovative daps on no such chain will receive six thousand for the first place five thousand per second and two thousand for third place the best AI project built on top of gnosis or uses the gnosis chain will get three thousand dollars the best product on Hashi will get two thousand and the best project on safe will be receiving two thousand dollars then you have up to ten thousand dollars each from Air stack eight coin ZK buff fuel safe ethereum foundation cartesi and Uma and also for metamask Falcon versus machine lens protocol unit swap Foundation the graph foundation and Ave Grand style all these Protocols are giving individually up to ten thousand dollars in prizes and then we have mantle chain link scroll neon foundation sismo and nouns giving five thousand dollars prizes each all those specifics on what those prizes are how you can find more information is all on the website each global.com Lisbon you can see every single detail about what qualifies what the specifics are links to their documentation if they did a workshop today that Workshop video will be available there as well and all of that will now also be available and accessible to you on your dashboard so last but not the least please please please pace yourself we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we want all of you to have fun and this whole weekend is about learning and experimentation because our goal is to show you what is going to be exciting in a year from now so with all of that I wish all of you happy hacking and we'll see you on Sunday thanks everybody
