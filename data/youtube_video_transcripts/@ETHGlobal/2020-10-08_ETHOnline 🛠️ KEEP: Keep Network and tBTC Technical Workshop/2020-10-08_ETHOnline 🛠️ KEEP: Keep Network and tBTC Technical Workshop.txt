we have carolyn from keep who's going to give us a overview of how to integrate keep into your hacks um and without further ado i will give it the floor over to you carolyn awesome thank you heather um hello everybody before i jump in i just want to give a um a disclaimer so this talk was supposed to be matt lewangro project lead who is designed mostly systems and is much more technical than i am so this overview today is going to be a little bit more high level um more pointing out where you can find different resources i'm going to talk through the um the the mechanism design and and really how both the keep network and tbtc work um but the more sort of nitty-gritties around deploying some of this stuff i'm going to be pointing you to our discord which is where you can talk directly with our team and some more technical documentation so this may be a little bit of a shorter a shorter presentation and maybe you'll have some time at the end to jump into the community all right so i'm gonna share my screen okay and uh let me know if you can't see anything but otherwise i'm just going to keep on moving through this all right so this is the good stuff right um i mean we're first we're really excited to to be here um and offering prizes at each global we love youth global um and this is what we're going to be giving out five thousand dollars um equivalent in keep tokens and the top prize grand prize will be three thousand dollars and then roughly um for runner-up runners-up depending on what what we see what we like uh that'll total two thousand dollars and keep tokens um oops and so quickly this is um this is all up on the eth global website but and i'll talk about these a little bit more in depth but these are some of the prompts and project ideas we put out there um we'd like to see some some swaps um some defy integration projects um it'd be cool to see some folks do something around keep operator pools um tptc tornado cache that's been a hackathon favorite for a while um and uh we'd love to see people continue to work on that new random beacon use cases this is kind of just a broad one um around like the keep random beacon um tbtc gas magic so this is um a sort of an addition to um tbtc and the flow and trying to obfuscate some of the gas there to help bitcoiners and then lastly it'd be great to see somebody do something with the tdt which is the tbtc systems nft and i'll talk a little bit more about that but um it's a cool component that you could maybe do some stuff with all right but first i'm going to talk about like what is keep what is tbtc we'll walk through it um so this is the broad overview keeps an interoperability and uh privacy infrastructure right so it is um it's a um it keeps our private or private data stores on public blockchains essentially that's the simplest way to put it so they're off chain containers for private data and uh the big use case right now is tbtc so this allows for bridges between public blockchains um the um one of the the one of the big components of keep is the random beacon and so this is much like the random beacon that you'll hear about on other chains like the each chain for example coming up but um we've built it and it's been live for several months and it it uses true randomness to ensure work selection and then lastly the second component here is um threshold ecdsa and this allows for safe multi-state essentially and ecdsa is a tech that's been used by other chains i think like finance chain uses it so we've got our own implementation um super quickly about keep the token since the prize here is awarded and keep want to make sure folks understand a little bit about um what the token is and what that means um so keep is a work token and um you have to stay keep to perform work and earn rewards on the network and all apps um you know are built on on the keep network um so i think one analogy that we like to use is um it keep is maybe most similar to something like atom on cosmos where it's a it's a staking coin it's a work token um and and if you have it you want to take it so and this is just a you know straightforward definition of of what that work means um computation and availability required to select and assemble and read those option keys um oh and i want to mention briefly um you know what you can do right now with your keep and what we're going to be rolling out in the next month around the keep network um the key network's public distribution uh and so what we're going to be doing is uh distributing about 20 of keeps total supply to uh people who are staking eth and acting as tbtc signers and i'll talk a little bit more about exactly what that how you can what that mechanism looks like um but but essentially here what this is showing is that um if you're an existing keep holder which is the the um you know the way tbtc works right now um you can stake keep uh and also bond eth right to participate as a tbtc signer um and the rewards that you can you can earn there are in eth keep and tbtc um and when the stake drop opens up the public distribution this is going to allow people who don't own keep which right now is is um you know way larger pool there's not a lot of keep liquidity out there right now allows people to bond eth and participate as a tbtc signer and if they are successful after a six-month term because that's how long the tbtc term lasts they then earned some of these keep rewards um so essentially what this is showing here is the keeps takers are are the ones that are already running the network um and they've got more um just a different sort of profile here for for earning rewards um oh and this is just what the rewards curve looks like for for that state drop over several months just wanted to give folks a an idea of what um of what's what's up with the keep network and the keep token over the next um well a few months and then this this is going on for at least a year if not longer um i'm going to jump next into tbtc because i think that this is more relevant for uh most of the challenges out there so tbtc the quick definition is uh it's built on keep right um but it's a bridge right this is uh bringing bitcoin to d5 it's a one-to-one peg um bitcoin on ethereum and the general pitch is that this you know allows for people to use bitcoin and ethereum so you can earn you can get leverage on your bitcoin it's a trust minimized design um matt doesn't like to say trustless um or you know but it is much more decentralized than other uh wrapped or or pegged bitcoin on ethereum designs out there um and and lastly yes i already alluded to this but the way that it works is um eath bonded keep stakers are securing each bitcoin deposit and i'll walk through that in a bit more detail but first i'm gonna do a quick kind of um walk through of of like of why um and how we got here because i think it's helpful um to understanding like the design choices that we make we made the first question here that you know the reason why we built tbtc um on keep is um you know asking ourselves these questions like d5 is really huge it's super exciting right now the hottest thing in the ethereum community without a doubt um but there's this huge um opportunity right there is so much more bitcoin um than ethereum really bitcoin's still king so of naturally when we think about wanting to bring more um more collateral into defy uh looking to bitcoin makes a lot of sense so how can we bring defy into bitcoin um and also the other way to ask this is how can you make bitcoin available everywhere this is sort of the bitcoin pov and then the other question here is when sidechains right if you've been in the spaces for a while and if you're technical people have been talking about bitcoin sign chains for a super long time but there just hasn't been um anything out there that that works well or that is decentralized um so it's about time right um quickly some of the other models you can seen federations in the past um you know federation is um basically when you you you know there's an mfn multi-stake it's some trusted decentralized party and you give them their bitcoin and you give them some coin they give you a coin that represents um represents that bitcoin right so it's great because you get that price exposure to bitcoin and it is a very simple implementation uh you don't have to write much solidity to have like a wbtc type thing um which is great but definitely some drawbacks right that's not seizure resistant um collateral stolen by custodians right we're not in crypto to trust some centralized institution um to to interact on on on chain right so to me this this sort of federation model is really not what uh what we should be looking at or going for um the other thing that we've seen out there real quick is synthetics so um you guys are probably familiar with this it's like this algorithmic there's an algorithm that pegs um you know a token to some sort of acid out there which is great um and it's censorship resistant right um because if you've got some sort of representation of an asset on chain nobody's going to try to try to steal that right um but um definitely there's some risks there right um there's a lot of um i think fx works in a space you see all these over collateralized things kind of stacking on top of each other and the more that you do that the more that there's some sort of risk of like black swan event sort of things so definitely risk there and and then the second thing is you can't redeem it for bitcoin so if you're actually a bitcoiner that holds bitcoin and you're considering using bitcoin on ethereum um using a synthetic is not attractive at all because it's not actually real bitcoin so this is why we this is why we built tbtc right we wanted to see a censorship resistant fully bitcoin backed erc20 token um well ethereum of course at first um and i'm going to talk a little bit about what tbtc is how it works um and this is the the quick one reiner is it's a relayed spv multi-federation and eth bonded so bonded multi-federated peg is the term that we use um and what that means is that um i really like svpp you're actually checking bitcoin transactions on chain right with the the simple payment verification many federations so that means every single new deposit every time somebody wants to mint tbtc a brand new federation of signers is formed um and then lastly there's recourse right every single sign or set is bonded heavily in eth um it's 150 percent uh in eth to the value of the bitcoin so there's real on chain re recourse if you misbehave so that's the bonded multi-federated pag for tbtc um this is what it looks like uh so you see here that we're talking to two blockchains there's the ethereum chain on the top and the bitcoin chain on the bottom um so this this diagram here goes left to right so in the beginning you the depositor the user requests a deposit creation this sends a ping to the ethereum chain um and the keep network here is um using creating a random using the random beacon to create a signing group right and so this signing group is a three out of three multisig essentially um it's a ecdsa keep and the group comes together and then you see they generate this pkh hash this is the public uh bitcoin wallet address right um and then at that moment once it's generated um that uh that bitcoin address is sent to the um sent to the user the user sends bitcoin to the chain right or to the signing group sorry to the bitcoin chain and over time the signing group receives this bitcoin um and then this third step here is proving that the bitcoin was actually sent right um in the system we wait six blocks so that is a little bit of time on the bitcoin blockchain but we want to be safe uh and then the proof there um here in step three is sent to the ethereum chain that's the spv proof um and then once the signing group here like receives that proof they say okay and they enable tbtc mint and that's the last step there is the user saying great my my bitcoin deposit has been proven and i would like to mint some tbtc and that there we go that's how you get tbtc at the end um getting a little bit more into i'm let me escape this and sort of zoom in so we can see it better um okay do this here this is the user flow so if you're interested in building some um integrations perhaps for tbtc i think it's helpful to understand um what's actually happening in the ux from the user perspective right so um and this is based on um on i'll show you the links um for everything there's some resources but this is based on the implementation dap um that that we've built but really this is like generally the flow for anybody so you start you connect your your wallet it's gonna ask you to choose a deposit size so one interesting feature of tbtc is that they're fixed lot sizes um so initially it started with just one um bitcoin and then we we expanded uh downwards so we've got i think um half a bitcoin like point two point one and point zero one for testing um and then when we we launched we pretty much immediately um it was right in the middle of like you to swap um token drop so gas prices were just like highest they've ever been um so we we pretty immediately put in place five and ten bitcoin lot sizes which is much more economical if you're trying to mint um and so here this is the first step though is selecting all right what's the what's the lot size um how much do you want to mint and then it's going to the dab asks you okay create this deposit address and this is when um the user's signing some metamask transactions and um requesting that the signer group comes together and that they give them a bitcoin address and so there's a small there's gas fee there of course um and at this point this unique address is created they get a um a a qr code an address um the user sends bitcoin from a bitcoin wallet uh and then there's this period of of waiting um and this is the six bitcoin blocks that i mentioned uh you've got one two three four five six but what is uh interesting here which i haven't talked about yet is the idea of a tbtc deposit ticket the tdt this is the nft component that comes in so what happens is when you send your bitcoin um after i think it's just one confirmation so actually this maybe should go after one but that's a technicality after one block confirmation you get this nft in your wallet and what this nft means is or what it's what it's for is a couple things is it essentially what it is it's like a unique identifier for each bitcoin deposit and it's associated with the exact utxo of the bitcoin you sent and two things it's useful for one is if you're somebody that really cares about um not um about making sure that you redeem the exact same bitcoin that you initially deposited you need this unique identifier to be able to redeem that exact same utxo um and and that's and that's useful for i guess it's more kind of like a business legal sense so you can say look it's always in my possession i got it back i didn't sell it um and uh and so that's that's one thing and interesting thing to note here is that there is a deposit term for every single deposit which is six months and that is the point at which um the the signers get paid their fee uh which is five bips it's a small a small fee right now in the system um and after that six month period if somebody has not redeemed that specific deposit using the uh the nft tdt token here that deposit becomes i think unlocked is the term and that anybody who's coming to redeem tbtc and can can redeem that uh that bitcoin deposit now um so that's one cool thing about it the other cool thing about it is you can actually use that tdt to create um other other applications or interfaces on top of it that allow you to um abstract away all of these all of the waiting time all of the other five block confirmations um and so for example you can imagine like maybe an exchange or a d5 app that is building like a confirmation as a service layer so people are coming with their bitcoin and they know they don't want to wait they want tbtc immediately so after sending in the bitcoin and one um and one confirmation the service could say okay for a small fee um i'm just going to you know give you some tbtc immediately um and and you know charge that fee for the risk that they're taking on that like maybe uh that this won't like confirm at the very end of the day um so that tdt nft allows you to build systems like that to improve the ux uh moving on these last parts here are are fairly simple um option a is really what most people are going to be doing but there is an option here i'll talk about option b is to say um you know i'm going to improve with the sbv proof and i'll just i won't mint uh tbtc but i will hold on to my tdt and i could come back and mint tbtc later from the the vending machine is the name of um the mechanism with tdts and tbtc at the very end there but most people will go through option a where they're saying great um my confirmations have gone through i want to prove prove it send the sbb proof in and then immediately mint tbtc and have that there um okay jump back into that so that is the flow okay here's last details here i'm going to share some some resources um and some links to help you guys in your journey um so first up we've got a lot of stuff on tbtc so a bunch of things linked here in github there's a some brief documentation for an overview here basically what kind of goes through everything i just talked through if you want to review um if you're building with tbtc uh uh an interesting um interesting thing about it is it's two blockchains right and maybe folks at eth um ed global have less experience i would guess with uh hacking on bitcoin um so you know we we have some resources here we um recommend using green wallet if you're going to be um using some test net bitcoin um and um you can always reach out to us if you need some test snap bitcoin i'll give you some ways to reach out but there are faucets out there sometimes it can be hard to get um but it does exist here so what have we got so the tbt cdap is on mainnet linked there and we also have the robston connected app here oops um smart contracts tbtc.js so that's a javascript um it's an easy way to integrate tbtc into your dap so definitely check out tbtc.js there that was built for for integrations largely we've got the technical specs and some api documentation and some just some resources about um the the bitcoin test net and how to get some testing bitcoin uh also on the keep side um i will say the resources the developer resources we have here are um we haven't quite optimized them for them and the same way that we've done with those tbtc resources so this stuff is a little bit more like technical and in the weeds but here it is we've got sort of the the keep core overview on github is good to take a look at but really the big thing here on um keep technical resources is to join our discord and at the end i'm going to show you what what that looks like and where to find some extra help um but that's where the the vast majority of like our team is there constantly um and um we've got a lot of really heavy hitters in the community that have stepped up and created some great great resources so they can always help you um but this is this is what we have here so here's um our staking documentation so this is our get book that helps folks uh with keep um set up get set up and start staking um this sticking documentation here also applies to um staking on robston right we're up on testnet so um that's a useful way to get going um whoops i missed a second link here but i will make sure to link that before this this gets shared to folks who are interested um but this is more technical documentation about spinning up nodes um the random beacon and then the ecdsa clients two different clients um this third piece here this is the keep dashboard this is um a dap that we've built um you know to go and stake your test net or mainnet keep and also bond eth for tbtc for tbtc deposits you can do that through the keep dashboard and then a few other resources so the random beacon yellow that's yellow paper that's more the technical spec and then random beacon smart contracts are here and then lastly this is a great resource a lot of it's less technical but there's it's just very broad um overview of keeping tptc resources generated by the community it's a great website um super quickly i'm again with all that contacts going to walk through some of these um projects these prompts that we've put out um so here's some the swaps so this is really uh taking a look at the uh spv relay and spv relay this is the the proof um that speaks to the you know reads the bitcoin chain data and speaks to ethereum and this is developed by um james prestwich uh and the summa team um and uh so yeah so we'd love to see some interesting um swaps um using this and there are the um the contracts there on github to help you out uh so this one define integration projects this is very broad uh as you can see there's a lot of potential for ways that you can use bitcoin in d5 dapps um you can really go wild i wanted to provide these two examples here so we were we went to east denver and um partnered up with compound to do a challenge where i think the prompt was you know a comp compound and tbtc integration just build something where you can earn um with ctbtc um on robsten show us what you can do so there were a couple of um a couple of great winners here i think the top one was bitcoin earned so you can check that out that's just a great interface for like just taking bitcoin minting immediately and start earning uh interest with you know tbtc to ctbtc and then robosaver was another great project that was um a bit of a broader um bit of a broader aim there they were it was sort of like a a uh um like a yield a yield managing um dap that you know allowed you to go directly from bitcoin so you can check that out um so less examples here this is a new idea that matt came up with um but this is something you can learn more about by jumping into our keep documentation and also diving into discord and chatting with um some of the uh the keep stickers right now about um and just learning about what it takes to to run a node um right now um there isn't a way to use to distribute rewards using pooled keep but there is a lot of um definitely a lot of desire in the community for something like this um because if you'll see if you jump into discord we've got quite an active community in but not everybody has keep enough keep to be able to stake an important point here is there's a minimum stake requirement um to run a node and it's um i think right now it's ninety thousand keep um it was a hundred thousand i think the idea is slowly over time that's going to go down but i think right now it's at 90 000. uh ah tbtc tornado cash so this is uh like i mentioned something that we've had other folks work on we participated in a bitcoin privacy hackathon and got a couple of really great um submissions here around tornado cache so these are the two examples so basically we just we'd love to see a strong single implementation here because we think this is a really exciting use case um you know using tbtc and then keep network essentially as a mixer and so take a look you can utilize both both either of these projects um but you know being able to see maybe the native uh bitcoin deposit and redemptions would be really cool um so if this is privacy is something that interests you this is a super cool project um where there's a chance to sort of bring something that's already been worked on to completion uh oh yeah this is another very broad one um just generally like keeping the random beacon brandon beacon is definitely a general purpose blockchain tool so there's a lot of things that you could do here randomness is very useful and tbtc is the first example of us using the random beacon um but there's a lot of other ways you know maybe in in like gaming for example um i don't know it's use your imagination um okay and i think this is we know we have two more so this one this is actually i think this is my favorite because um if you think about the um the main aims of tbtc it's really about like let's let's put that bitcoin to use there's a lot of bitcoin out there um a lot of bitcoin holders and users don't necessarily you know contrary to maybe what you you see on twitter um in you know the bitcoin maximalist discourse honestly the majority of bitcoin users just don't know a lot about ethereum it's more ignorance um ethereum is a lot more complex than bitcoin uh so you know wouldn't it be great if we could offer people who hold bitcoin offer bitcoiners a way for them to earn yield to earn more money on their bitcoin continue to stack sats and a decentralized way but build it um but do it in a way where they don't have to like learn a whole bunch of stuff about how to use ethereum and how to use metamask and all this stuff because that can definitely um yeah that can definitely be a blocker for for new year's years and adoption and then lastly tbtc nft so the tdt token um in the system is it's it's unique and right now um for most users in the interface it's kind of hidden um but it's it's there i walked through the um the two the two reasons why we we built it into the design there but i think that there's a lot of creativity that could be tapped there um so yeah i don't know i sort of talked about a service right this confirmation as a service use case but potentially there's other things that you could do with um with the tdt i think currently at this time i mean tptc's only been live for about three weeks now so the the sky's the limit in terms of um things on mainnet that have yet to be built so we haven't seen anything like this yet in terms of the confirmation as a service so so that's definitely a possibility um so that's pretty much it um i'm going to show you really quickly our discord but this is the big call to action because i know again i um i don't have the same technical jobs as matt and this is like it was the last minute matt unfortunately was ill so i jumped in to give a more broad overview but everything that you um everything that you would need is there in our discord um let's see i'm going to switch over really quickly and just show you um show you what this looks like here okay all right so here is my discord um this is um keep discord i'm guessing that a lot of you are familiar with this chord but i just want to point out really quickly when you do jump in a good place to start here at the top is read me i mean announcements this is news and and resources but really uh welcome steak drop here so this is we labeled that this because the majority of people coming into our discord are um are here because they've learned about the steak drop and they want to know more about how how to earn keep later on um so so this is like our our encyclopedia here of um i think for you guys more of these like staking guides and and resources is and is what you'd be looking for so definitely check that out um and then here in general um or tbtc protocol and keep protocol are are good channels for asking questions from our team just about how the protocol works um development this is more people who are working on projects um what i'm going to do is oh great somebody did it for me beautiful i was going to create this after but i'm glad i've got a team working on this but so this is your channel um we have a group of our team is in here and we also have a group of um um they're the round table knights is what they've called themselves but it's like a group of community moderators and experts that have been like staking for months they know just as much as our team um and so they're they're really going to be in here helping you guys if you have any questions um and then the last thing here is understaking i'll just point out that this is uh we have here staking resources this is more updated information if you're trying to get a node running and understand about staking our our community folks are dropping in new new resources all the time new guides if there's updates it'll be here um and then if you have more specific questions um around how does the random beacon work getting the node up and running how does um the ecdsa client work getting it up and running and then troubleshooting here this is where we've got a lot of community members you're like having an issue you're trying to get the node up and running that's where you can go [Music] yes and we've got some community projects here actually so if you want to talk to the tptc tornado folks and and that's something you're interested in doing we have that here um and tbt swaps as well i think i think that's those are the most important ones um i'm gonna pause here there's a i i know i'm not at time yet but um i guess would it make sense to open it up to questions yeah definitely um let me just everyone can unmute themselves as of now if you'd like to ask carolyn a question jump in i think we're good awesome oh good technical presentation thanks fox great work carolyn thank you so much um so we know everyone knows where to find you join your discord we'd know the channels um we will of course be seeing you in discord oh no weird that's so weird yeah it zoom's been funny i know i just wanted to say thank you and i dropped the discord link and also this the slide deck here that has all the all the resource links um is that something that i mean i can drop it here in the chat but is that a resource that i can somehow yeah we can get that yeah definitely perfect so i'll grab that and send it out as soon as we get off this call okay great awesome thank you so much carolyn i know people are gonna be really excited especially those tbtc tornado folks well have a great day thanks so much thank you guys cheers
