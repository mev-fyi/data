so my unicorn is ready okay stream is up i'll just wait a couple minutes all right looks like the trickling of people has uh slowed down enough you want to get started no no soon as i say that more people join all right uh sergey there there we go awesome uh cool well thanks everybody for for attending um welcome to the ama uh with the one inch team so you know today we've got uh sergey and jessica from their side um sergei is one of the co-founders uh this is the first time we've ever had uh one inch sponsor one of our events but definitely not one of the first time we've seen one inch at one of our events um so we're definitely going to talk about that but uh yeah really really excited to be working with them in such a big way for the first time and um to have them kind of go full cycle uh from project uh to sponsor so we're 100 gonna be talking about this for most of the things so i don't want to spoil it too much um but yeah big thank you for everybody who's here and big thank you uh for taking the time sergey to chat with us um looking forward to it uh hi everyone yeah nice to be here um awesome so yeah maybe we jump into it um i normally like to kind of talk a little bit about sort of the beginning times so before uh before the kind of current thing you're working on um so we'd love to kind of get a sense of uh what were you doing before um you know where you started one inch um and then sort of what were you sort of thinking about what kind of problems or or kind of what led up to uh the founding of one engine we could talk about the founding in a minute but uh kind of curious about the the stuff that happened before so um what we did before in front of my co-founder is uh we uh we had my own channel on youtube uh and what we did uh was uh security i did some live streams we uh just discovered new smart contracts uh where a lot of people put a lot of money it was back in 2018 and it was most most of these smart contracts were scams we tried to explain the people they shouldn't invest in such a scam we discovered back doors and blocks in such smart contracts and show it publicly we teach the people to to read the code to not trust them just because it is just a smart contract um so you should you should understand that uh yeah it's dangerous to put money into not only smart contracts totally yeah so that was when you guys were working on the crypto maniacs channel right yeah um and uh yeah i mean the first time we met obviously was at an east global event um so maybe i'm kind of curious about sort of when did you first hear about you know these hackathons the series of events um and what was your first one that you attended so um i i i heard from ethics global from anton and he actually uh is uh is a kind of old hacker guy who participated multiple times already in russia he won like 50k over overnight on one of those hackathons and um yeah one day back in 2018 he asked me may i would join a trip to singapore the th singapore it was it was great so we uh we had really long flight but it's uh it was it was really great so we uh just won three sponsor prizes and found out that oh we can we can do it every month participate on every every eth global hackathon and just try to to get a bounty and it was really that we participated every month on each global hackathon around the globe and i i stopped count uh the all the hackathons which we are we participated and it was not about money um it was like about the fun uh and the experience yeah we learned a lot from from from the hackathons how to deliver fast and really high quality how to pitch yeah and based on this experience we were able to build our startup so from from my point of view awesome so yeah so so singapore was your first one i remember that event was it was fantastic i mean it was we we had like unlimited beer everywhere which was pretty awesome and it was just like uh i mean a really great environment even though it was a bit of a smaller event it was it was awesome um so okay so then we did a whole bunch of other ones in between and then i'm getting to the most kind of relevant one which was east new york so singapore was um i think december of 2018 um and then east new york the first one was uh in may of 2019 so not that long after only about five months um so of course new york is is where kind of the idea and kind of the birth of one inch protocol was so we'll have to kind of talk about sort of um what that experience was like you know building that project and i guess did you always know that this was going to be a big thing did you was it just a fun thing you were building what was that experience like so we actually didn't really know what we should build on each new york uh we uh normally what we how we probably [Music] yeah our approach was uh to just come to hit the hackathon fill the hackathon speak with everyone uh and with every sponsor and then we we thought what we can build yeah so in new york uh i was picking the vitalik a little bit with hayden adams and i i shared shortly i did which i got about um about in kind of the app which would offer you uh all the different taxes so you can you you should you shouldn't invest your time to find the best price and uh then in in the middle of the hackathon uh we found out this anton that we can actually use the approaches from arbiters trading which we uh uh implemented in our arbiter sport we were playing like months before with a really very efficient our avatar sport and uh we used the gas token there and we implemented its own um uh on logic to discover all the liquidity and on the hackathon we thought why not also split among all the daxes uh at the end combine all these small liquidity pools into a single one and provide the best price because uh if you swap more you you get worse the price if you swap a little bit everywhere then you have better price yeah i didn't sleep uh over two nights so i i wake up at friday morning and on sunday uh um six o'clock six uh i was in bed and in between we didn't sleep it was it was crazy so at the end i i lost my orientation already uh but were able i was able to to pitch and it was it was actually okay but not um my best pitches i had to pitch to two teams and one team was uh rule amused the other team didn't understand i guess because of my betting and we actually won only 300 bucks from ens uh i was happy that i was able to pay for my uh airplane ticket uh so and uh yeah and one inch was born um we actually solved a problem we found it out after after the hackathon that we really solved the problem and yeah we just continued to to continue to work on that yeah awesome no i think that's you know it's a great story i remember i think maybe around 1 or 2 a.m on like maybe the saturday night you explaining to me like what you had been building and i remember being like uh i'm not really sure what's going on here but like best of luck um and i mean it's it's funny that you even notice especially that like you know um one inch you know despite being you know this massive platform and and what it is now like it it didn't actually win well the event right it wasn't one of the finalists and i think that that you know goes to show that you know even if uh you do build something that isn't you know maybe one of the finalist projects doesn't mean it won't be successful long term right i mean it's uh those prizes are sort of in a way pretty arbitrary so um you know really it's about you know continuing to work on the problem right and then i think kind of um afterwards i don't know if this is necessarily true or not but um i i know you obviously you kept coming back to these events and you know i think i saw you in boston and a couple other events um so were you sort of iterating iterating on sort of the one-inch idea at events still and sort of like how did you know to carry on this idea um rather than some of the other things you've worked on so um actually yeah we continue to continue to participate on the hackathons and uh because we had also other ideas so in south africa we have built a decentralized uh streaming uh platform with uh micro payments uh with rated networks so you had to pay for each kilobyte and the best quality you pay a lot so um and we had some other things um like jidai and some other but uh this was like something what we just wanted to build we had the idea and it was like funny and it was cool um and in parallel uh we had one inch and two like um we had normal jobs yeah until uh early this year uh or summer this year and we we were working in the nights on one inch just to improve that because we have seen we got feedback from the community from and i love the ethereum community because uh it's next near to you you know like it's almost everywhere and we got direct feedback that oh it's cool thing yeah um some of the users started to use that we saw some traffic and we started to improve that because all the users started to use it yeah and it was great awesome um and then yeah i would love to kind of talk about sort of the user starting to use it right like you know there was definitely a period where all of a sudden um i think you know one of the nice things about uh your experience also has been that you know i think it's kind of been like a very gradual sort of approach but then it got kind of crazy for a while right um you know i'd love to kind of know like uh you know as you were going through the crazy part and then you know hundreds of millions of dollars been going through kind of the one-inch protocol like um what was that like was that you know exciting was it terrifying was it like were you building new things as fast as you could you know like what was what was that period of time like um and i mean you're really much still in that period of time but i guess kind of very curious about what it's like to to work on a protocol that's been so successful so quickly yeah that's uh the direction from my side and anton was like we wake up and have seen uh a lot of volume and and it was yeah it was uh uh crazy yeah like overnight we we we got much more volume and then next next next day and much more more and more every week uh we doubled our volume every month we doubled with our volume and um it feels it feels um it's it's like it's unbelievable uh in the first uh first hours first days but then you um you recognize that uh it's it's cool it's there and uh i i wish to to keep it and i wish to improve that uh what we do and uh also um deliver best user experience and yeah this is yeah it's a good feeling it's good feeling cool um awesome and then i kind of want to talk about one last hackathon related thing which was uh what you guys built um at at hack money right the the cheat token right in in may of this year um i guess you know at that point uh one inch had still been uh you know doing really really well like doubling volume all the time like it was crazy at that point already right and yet you still decided to attend the hackathon and build something uh like for the event i mean uh maybe just kind of would love to know a little bit about why you love doing these hackathons so much right i mean it seems like i think you and anton in particular are probably our like biggest building supporters um what what's sort of like what's your big draw for these events like why is it so important to you that you you attend and create something cool every time yeah this is the the feeling which you get uh when you not sleep uh like two days at one piece and uh you deliver a mvp yeah in the best case and you pitch that and you present your idea and um in a in a traditional like world in different software companies even if you have an idea you you have like months maybe maybe like almost a year to implement a almost uh working solution and here you you uh you deliver very fast you have to be very efficient yeah and uh the competition feeling yeah that there are also other people who compete with you uh for for those sponsor prizes and uh all the main prize our actually our main goal was to get at least one experience global main stage prize we were really working very hard together so we we needed like eight months to to just get the first uh ethereum uh normal main price um and uh yeah just most most of the reasons uh the feeling yeah the the competition feeling and we we keep it we keep it here and what we do right now um so we are well funded and uh but still um i don't sleep like uh also it happens that i don't sleep days uh here and have to deliver also with my guys together and um yeah almost all our guys also hackathon guys also if you're global winners and so on we love to to to be hackers and builders awesome yeah i know um you did eventually win as a finalist and i was very excited for you um and and that was just a great thing and um yeah i guess uh i think one question that comes to mind is i love to kind of get your take on how important user experience is in in d5 especially um and within crypto i mean um i remember i think joking with you at one of the events um that you're the only app that ever goes uh like has ever presented that has a dark mode switch on it right like that that is like one of the most important pieces that you put into it every time just to make sure dark mode is available i'd love to kind of talk about sort of um what your thoughts are on user experience and then how important that is and you know maybe some of the decisions that one inch makes in that regard that that you think is is helpful towards its success yeah um my first steps in ethereum they were really terrible uh based on the user experience i didn't understood what the is made in one scan what should i do with that should it work so um i had to like that um i had my i had had anton uh also in a development so i'm i'm a software engineer of the architect since uh 15 years like 15 years professional experience i i didn't see never such an approach with this web 3 and so on but it was really interesting and um yeah and uh it's it's it was like okay i see here here's really no user experience i almost no so and we want also to improve that so i was also our uis improved by the time and first it was really terrible and then we improved that and proved that and this dark mode so no one used this dark mode and i i like this dark mode thing and i introduced it in one inch and i use it everywhere on every hackathon just because it's yeah it looks better and uh um yeah we tried all the chimp ui and yeah and you see there there are a lot of a lot of projects now have really great ui and also improve the space yeah and um and we hope we hope to to to get more users on board awesome uh yeah and i mean i think you know i agree like the ui aspect in particular i think is very important and i feel like one inch was like one of the like you've always been very focused on on making sure that the the use of the product makes sense that things just make sense from the get-go and that are well communicated and i think that's you know really important and just want to highlight that about kind of all the projects i've ever seen you build uh no matter if it was built in 24 hours or one inch over over now many months like uh it's always been sort of you know very well uid and then it's like really great process so uh yeah just want to highlight that um okay it looks like there was a question from the audience from valleva on youtube um she has a sergey um any words of wisdom for people wanting to build um i assume that means on eath or in the ethereum space what helped you figure out which direction to go with one inch [Music] yeah which uh so what uh how we came to to to all the ideas is actually we uh um initially every we we started to build one inch for example uh for us yeah like anton said multiple times it's really terrible i have here like uh one one on ether to swap and um it's really terrible to find a place um where i get the best rate and we actually bullied for us and at the end it was like for everyone so and um the first part of the question i didn't get it um animals beatstown for ppl yeah i think it's i think it's similar to what you just described which is you know build something that uh that that you want to build that you want to use that's right that would would yeah yeah that's exactly that what what you would use yeah so if you build something if your friend or like if you've uh worked together with with a co-founder for example like like i if antoine so give your co-founder to to test it to to to use that and you will get a lot of feedback yeah exactly yeah get get your friends get your co-founder get everybody to give it a try um exactly cool looks like there's another question which is are you participating in the current hackathon as a sponsor yeah exactly um and uh have you seen any of the current projects already and if so like what are your impression so i have seen only one uh project but i didn't dive deep into it uh i had really last time but i i will take time uh very soon to to discover everything what was built um i hope there are a lot of projects who who use our apis or smart contracts uh um so uh we would love to see uh more people uh building on on top of money lagos what we what we produce are is uh not the ecosystem that lost thing we actually produce money legos and feel free to use it and benefits from that definitely what about maybe a flip to that question um if you were able to participate as a hacker what do you think you would be building for this event yeah that's a good question uh um this that's difficult to answer right now um um so i had the idea also already on singapore uh here in singapore to write a decentralized chat uh so um based on oh okay of course the status there yeah but it feels like closed system yeah i would love to love to build uh really um similar to money lego uh also like a component which can be used everywhere and this is like decentralized chat system just just yeah that's an idea for sure um okay cool another question from youtube um did you meet your co-founder anton at a hackathon or i guess how did you meet before um i i was introduced to antoine from come friend he uh um a good friend of phantom they moved to germany where i'm from and to the city and i met him through my wife and his wife uh had contact and we met some days and i um i was trying to talk with him about crypto about ethereum and some other uh kinds and they said i am not really interested by but i have a friend he he talks to me uh similar like you do and they are they talk all the time about crypto so i will introduce you and um we didn't speak with anton uh a lot just wrote a little bit and uh like a half year later they joined joined my youtube stream about the audit i actually started by myself to just discover and try to decompile some smart contracts and uh she joined and after that we uh didn't leave youtube for like half a year uh every almost every day a security audit so we did more more than 100 security artists live streams over two three hours wow yeah it was uh that that video is uh or those that channel was uh very prolific and i remember you guys recording like during all of our different events as well um i have some videos from new york so you may can use this for a documentary movie someday yeah yeah that would be awesome um okay cool um and then let me see i guess uh maybe one last question from from my end and then we'll see if anybody else has any last questions but um you know thursday is going to be the deadline for this event so i guess this will be typically when you start your project but for everybody who's going to be kind of finishing their projects on thursday what advice would you have for kind of people that are looking to continue right you know basically you know should they continue who should they talk to like what what advice would you give to basically somebody who's in your position who you know built a some kind of one-inch thing of their own um and are thinking about you know whether or not they should keep building it so i can say keep keep working yeah keep going and uh improve uh what you have built and try to get in touch with the community yeah um it's not about to uh bring someone to shield your project project it's it's more about to to present it show it pitch it and um and keep working on that and of course it's i know how difficult it is yeah in the last 15 years what i did i had my normal job and i had my my own uh company where i was like it was like a sandbox uh like after 9 9 pm until 12 i was i was working on something i was trying something yeah and uh yeah and the last last last 12 months was uh really hard for us uh really less sleep i had to perform a normal job i had also to perform in my side project but if you keep working you will have success for sure awesome great and congrats on you know being able to take that side project and make it the full-time thing i mean that's that's the dream right that's that's the goal that's really the dream yeah it's uh it's still unbelievable for us to choose to live the dream yeah and now we're really excited for you over at over on the global side so uh congrats so that's really awesome yes thank you guys for for super uh organized and uh very helpful events not just for networking also for personal grow like also skills and development and everything uh every every event around the globe was really great organized and well done with great people and the communities awesome yeah i appreciate that i think it really comes down to the community and being able to have smart people anywhere and people who want to build so can't do it without everybody else on this call so um awesome maybe we'll wrap it up here uh it was it was great chatting again good to see you again um and of course a big thank you uh to one inch uh both for sergey for coming here for the conversation and of course as a sponsor um it is uh there is a very small club of companies who have started at eighth global event and then have been sponsored an event so uh you know we're really really like i said you know excited for you guys to be able to be able to do that and um and look forward to seeing you know continued success for for everything that you're working on thanks awesome all right thanks everybody and catch you on discord thanks thanks bye
