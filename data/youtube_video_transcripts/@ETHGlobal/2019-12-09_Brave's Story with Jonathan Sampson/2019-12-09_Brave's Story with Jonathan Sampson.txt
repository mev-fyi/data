so this is pretty exciting to eat water with my first one I think we have some people who have this is their second time around or so my name is Samson I work with brave so today I'm going to briefly tell you the brave story what it is how we developed I think there's already quite a few people that are familiar with brave that are in this room we just having a nice friendly chat beforehand so quickly I guess a little bit about me I started programming like 23 years ago which is getting like more frightening each year and so I started with this game Jedi Knight dark forces - it was really cool because in the 90s software was not as complicated it was actually quite a bit more open it wasn't open source necessarily all the time but there are components of it that you could view and so this game had these things that were called cog files they were written in this cog scripting language and you could see object references and stuff in there you'd see like door dot 3do and you could see events like open or you know player initiate and so I was not a programmer at the time but I was able to read these English plain text files and start to pick out patterns things like doorto 3do and there was a character in the game called max there was a max 3do which is a little rabbit and so I realized if you changed the reference from door 3do - max 3do saved a file or refresh the game whenever you like shoot your no no it was a bullet if you change the bullet reference to the max video you shoot your gun a rabbit would pop out the end it was this weird stuff that you could do but I loved it because it was so simple it was easy enough that anyone could hack on if they wanted to and so this is kind of the entire way that the web itself in the early 90s was this is NCSA mosaic from the National Center for supercomputing applications at the University of Illinois champaign-urbana this was probably the most popular browser to ever exist I mean when you look thinking about global market share wise this was the work of people like Marc Andreessen and his fellow teammates he was making minimum wage at the University of Illinois champaign-urbana when I think it was Jim Clark came over and pitched the idea of starting Netscape Navigator and then overnight Marc Andreessen was worth six hundred million dollars so it's a nice little pay bump right there but I'm curious has anyone in this room I don't know people's ages and stuff has anyone ever used like a browser in the early 90s or mid 90s it's like one person two people so I don't know how many of you have ever got to enjoy like this wonderful serenade this is that that dial-up tone what I love about this though I never knew what this was beforehand this was just some like crazy ritualistic music that played like some early 90s like EDM or something and it's actually the negotiation between the device and the server over what protocols are supported I'm gonna stop that right now and you can actually hear the device is negotiating what protocols are supported and then figure out how they can communicate going forward and pretty god no one picks up the phone receiver downstairs and disconnects you and so that was around 1992 and the next few years the web got really exciting because of some unrelated innovations from a few people that all came from the University of Illinois champaign-urbana coincidentally in 1993 Marc Andreessen who we talked about he was again a student there working in the NCSA he wanted to put images inline on web pages so as we saw with that first web browser in the mosaic you had text you had hyperlinks you could click those you could open up a second window and you could show a picture in the window but they wanted to put the pictures in the pages themselves and so what Mark did is he actually went ahead and just did this work and then after it was basically done he pitched the idea to a forum or a talk group and said hey we should do this I mean he already did it but he was trying to I guess somewhat be fairly formal but the way he did it was that images could be loaded from any third-party server so if I had my server with images on it and you wanted to show the images on your website you could just load them directly from it you didn't have to have this file redundancy where your multiplicate in these files all across the servers it's really cool they developed this 20 this term called hot linking because the idea was if too many people tried to pull images or files from your server it would heat it up and melt it but it was really neat that they avoided that redundancy at that time the very next year Lamont Julie who is a colleague of Mark injury 'sons at Netscape Navigator Lou was working with a guy named Vint Cerf Vint Cerf as the pioneer of tcp/ip vent is unbelievable and he's still working to this day at Google I believe and so what Vince did is he told Lou he's like we need to find some way to put just a little bit of data on the user's device send that data out with every request allow the receiving servers to modify that data and when it comes back stored on the user's device again this would give us the ability to log into websites to persist sessions over a browser you know sessions so if you close your browser open to backup you don't have to relock into a site or you could remember what's in your shopping cart these types of things completely unrelated to images Lou did this work he was inspired by the HTTP there actually was he was inspired by the magic cookie on UNIX boxes so he created the HTTP cookie the the paten he found a patent for this the patent is so cool it's an arrow pointing to the right and then it says like server modifies data and then an arrow pointing to the left and a site machine receives modified cookie and that's the patent itself it's it's the craziest thing in the world and then a 1995 this is when the world was set on fire by young hacker named Brendan Eich this is our CEO he would go on to co-found Mozilla as well and create a brave and so Brendan was tasked with creating a like a baby brother scripting language for Java hence the name JavaScript and of course this just really changed things for the rest of history 1985 was an exciting year in 1995 a company by the name of double-click was formed later on a company by the name of net gravity was formed I think actually net gravity might have come before double-click it's tough to tell but what they started doing is they saw the potential between what Marc Andreessen had done and what lumen Julie had done and they realized that if I had a popular image on my server and everyone was loading that image for my server then everyone was sending cookies to me and I can start to monitor people as they move between sites that load my images and so in 1995 double-click was created and that gravity was created this was the work of John Danner and Tom shields and they had boasted that ad server can dynamically target ads based on the following criteria browser type computer platform the domain the time of location proxy server search terms keywords cookies certificates more information and even user registration databases so they realize there's a lot of meta information that comes across with every request so when your computer tries to load a picture it sends an HTTP request that tells some information about you along with a cookie when it tries to load a script file when it tries to load a page all that stuff contains meta information that is necessary for making the web work this was their website back in like 1996 it's beautiful as well and been so in 1996 we also started seeing journalists and tech minded people realize the the potential for harm here and so this was published here on Thursday June 13th 1996 this paragraph in particular double-click boasts for about the precision of its methods for example the company says with double-click you can target females who work in the aerospace component manufacturers in the Los Angeles area where at least 100 million dollars in operating revenue who use pcs windows 95 in like sports so in 1995 1996 this was already incredibly granular and this was still just getting started so we also had heroes back at that time the Netscape Navigator browser they introduced the Netscape plug-in API in 1995 as well and people quickly co-opted this technology to start to build some type of defense against this this monster that was developing that was just harvesting people's information so these fellas right here led by James Howard they created a company called private and a product called the internet fast forward and the whole goal was to identify images based on their dimensions so if it's you know 7 20 by 60 or whatever common ad sizes were they could stop those from loading they could prevent cookies from loading that give the users the ability to filter this all was happening in 1996 but their motivations for this their motivations were quite simple they said we just didn't like the time it took to download advertisements while we were paying for our time online I don't know if many people have ever paid for their time online they pay for access but when I was online in the 90s I got 15 minutes a day because we had to pay for the minutes and so I got 15 minutes a day on the internet so I would have been with these guys are here I definitely don't want to spend that time you know loading advertisements and stuff like that we'll come back to this over here too this is kind of coincidentally they had this projection here for what advertising in cyberspace would be in the future and so we'll come back to that it's pretty interesting so we talked about the you know time is money type of aspect into 2015 the New York Times did a research a little bit of study on the top 50 websites that Americans visit and how much of that data goes towards content they actually want to consume versus how much of that data goes to ads and trackers and other tertiary scripts that are set up just to monitor and surveil them and the vast majority you can see was examiner you know you're paying almost ten cents for trackers and only like two cents for actual content some of the really egregious cases here more than thirty cents of your data has spent loading trackers and ads on Boston calm as opposed to like eight cents to load the actual content and so there's massive massive waste in this space in fact I think they concluded that Americans like myself would spend on average twenty three dollars a month to be tracked and so that's not just for the access to the content I'm paying to be tracked so what are we getting for this we go to a web page here and there's an ad slot this empty region right here and once that ad slot is parsed and processed by the rendering engine and so forth it sends out this communication to ad exchanges who then in turn communicate with demand-side platforms who then in turn communicate with data management platforms this entire process is emanating private data about me out into this sea of faceless third parties information like my gender my income where I live religious affiliations marital status all this type of stuff all that information gets sent out and an oxygen is taking place where I am being put out in front of a bunch of advertisers to see who will pay the most for me and of course this all happens within a hundred milliseconds and once they find the highest bidder an ad is shown that they think will target me and I mean it might and so that's what we get for this entire exchange that information is not temporal either it is persisted by these third parties they can hold on to it build up little dossiers and build up these profiles moving forward Facebook did this many years ago that I'm assuming they still do when they build up shadow profiles so they'll collect information about people before they ever become a member on Facebook and then once they become a member they can add join them to all that other data they've already been collecting over the years so in December 2018 the New Economics foundation had said that bid requests on UK users are being sent at a rate of almost 110 billion per day or 164 per person per day and they're seen by hundreds if not thousands of advertisers and again it includes information like my health I might be looking up a rash or something like that online religion my age all this type of stuff ten billion per day that was in the UK alone 2017 we started realizing that we're not just getting ads either and these aren't just pictures that are annoying it's not that like jiggly belly fat animation or something or some type of weird parasite in a fish's mouth like these are really harmful sometimes but they didn't always manifest themselves as being harmful so we saw with coin hive in 2017 that people started finding out ways to get these minors javascript-based miners into iframes on web pages and so the showtime web sites were secretly mining using the user CPU for cryptocurrency those from the verge October 2017 hackers have turned PolitiFact's the political websites into a trap for your PC to mine cryptocurrencies Manero in particular and then they adjusted their threat a little bit and they started going after Chrome extensions and so chrome extensions were being hacked particularly mine cryptocurrencies because obviously it's it's a whole nother area for these people to spread in fact we saw last year I think it was meta masks had an impostor extension in the Chrome Web Store and I was talking to Dan Finley about this I was like hey there's a fake meta mask in the Chrome Web Store and so Dan reached out I believe him and his team reached out to Google Google deleted the actual meta mask and left the fake one there and so it is unbelievable how risky even extensions can be these days and of course there are many extensions that people use that are no longer maintained that if I were to come up to the owner of the extension say hey I'll give you $1,000 a hand over the the control of the repo control of the extension itself they'll be more than happy to do so and then of course the next time I ship an update that update goes out to all of the existing users and you have something like coin bit coin hive in your browser government websites as well 20:18 we're hit by cryptocurrency mining malware several other cross-site scripting attacks and stuff as well in January 29th 2018 this was the creme de la creme this was these hackers were able to get it into YouTube ads so we think that it's only the shady little advertising networks out there on the the the external you know the outsides of things but YouTube itself or compromised by by these cryptic actors so how does the how people responded by and large we've responded by blocking things more than 600 million devices had ad in tracker blocking on them back in 2016 mobile started around 2015 and of course it is just completely eclipsed a desktop and it continues to be that way today but if we're blocking all of that stuff let's see actually no this is really interesting so in response to the the increased blocking from users these advertisers and companies that profit off of this capitalistic surveillance they've had to maneuver themselves in different ways to continue making money so Google and MasterCard cut a secret ad deal to track retail sells this is insane this is what they had said is Google had access to approximately 70% of Us credit and debit cards through partners 70% of credit debit cards for people like me Americans that are down there since 2014 Google has flagged for advertisers when someone who clicked an ad visited a physical store using a location history featuring Google Maps so now it's not even in the browser it's like this phone that I'm carrying around but as Google Maps on it is tracking my location actively and when it sees that I'm near a location that was affiliated with an ad that was displayed to me Google is able to correlate those two events and then inform the advertiser that they need to pay a little bit more because Google is so awesome or something and of course it's they're not stopping there either they said quote here we go Google has continued to push deeper into offline measurements the company like Facebook and Twitter incorporated has explored the use of beacons or Bluetooth devices that track when shoppers enter stores so the actual devices are tracking our location as we move about physically from store to store in fact I mean you can see this the other about a month ago or so my wife and I went to the bank to talk to her banker about some issue and we spent about 30 minutes there we stepped outside I opened up Twitter and the first ad I got was for a loan from a competing bank because geographically my latitude/longitude said I was in a bank for 30 minutes so that means I'm probably looking to get loan or do something bank related and of course when that was sent out to these had parties these third parties they decided that I would be a good candidate to show an ad to so as a result Brendan Eich the guy that created JavaScript back in 1995 1994 he got this idea for brave figures something needs to be done we have to figure out some way to make a private yet sustainable internet because we even have 600 million devices blocking ads and trackers that's wonderful from a security perspective but it doesn't do much for the sustainability perspective because we still have these websites that are losing massive amounts of revenue and so Brendan had caught on his buddy Brian Bondi who was also at the Mozilla back in the day was at Khan Academy whenever they got the the idea to do brave together and on January 20th 2016 we had our inaugural tweets joined brave and make it our Internet this is when the excitement really began so what is brave brave is a privacy oriented web browser the focus is again not on just user security and privacy but on the sustainability of the web so as you browse the web we have baked into it this logic this panel actually here is called the brave shield panel but it actually blocks third party trackers by default it looks to preemptively upgrade unsecure connections to use HTTPS when possible it blocks third-party cookies and a blocks third-party device recognition that type of stuff they'll use the canvas API to figure out some type of way to generate a unique token for your device for you so they can monitor you as you browse the web without having to use cookies or something like that so brave blocks all that right out of the box okay so when we're blocking this stuff we have to think again about the the revenue aspect of this so this comes into the sustainability model you can't just block for a better web you have to also think about how do we take care of the people who are writing the solidity you know tutorials on medium or people who are contributing to open source and that type of stuff how do we take care of these individuals and so what Brendan had the idea was to create the basic attention token he had visited the etherium offices in London I think in 2015 he already had the idea for some type of brave Queen at that point and then realized that you know what the ERC 20 tokens probably the rounds ago and of course we initially launched using a a prototype built on Bitcoin I think we're talking with this little bit before we started the broadcast and that was working fairly well for awhile until about 2017 hit and then Bitcoin congestion and Bitcoin fees became insurmountable and people who wanted to buy a $5 in Bitcoin might have to pay like 750 and fees to do so and so that simply didn't work so we jumped laterally over to the over to the etherium blockchain which has been fantastic so now as you browse the web you come across a verified publisher like the Washington Post you can expand your rewards panel I can see they're brave verified so I can send them a tip if I want to I can choose between 1 5 and 10 batte these are the default values the publishers have some Liberty they can also make it 5 25 and 50 I think or something like that and I'm able to send that using the etherion blockchain which is pretty magical but we realized that it's not just traditional markets not just journalists that are producing some of the information that we find valuable on the web as well as sometimes it's someone on Twitter it's someone on reddit it's someone on github who just has a really awesome commit so brave is actually looking to create sustainability accross us-a array of different platforms including twitter github reddit as we mentioned before so we come back to these guys the advertised in cyberspace I thought this was interesting it's kind of just a side note but we can see what they projected at the time and what we actually saw in retrospect there we go so they got it right for the most part but then the actual you know explosion happened there between 98 99 and and things really start to be they are over poor overperformed far beyond the expectations of people in the industry at the time today I think we're spending we're seeing more than a hundred billion dollars in revenue Digital advertisement and like 20 billion of that is going to fraud each year it's unbelievable so what do we see this is the comparison between the incumbent digital advertising system of what brave is suggesting modern digital advertising you are not asked to participate your data is captured recorded shared and sold multiple times per page load each within 100 milliseconds your auctioned off before a panel of faceless third parties the highest bidder gets to show you an ad middlemen and fraud capture most of that revenue what Brendon has conjured up here and which has been working extremely well so far is the bride the braves private ads alternative you decide whether you would participate to what degree you can say i want to see up to five ads per hour or as little as one AD per hour your data never leaves your device this is what I love about it he's come up with a model where you completely invert the the incumbent system so previously what we have is your data gets sent out to this C of third parties who saw earlier all of that collection allows them to make very fine targeted advertisements but at the cost of you losing control of your data if you invert that and all of your data stays on your device and instead all of those creatives from those advertisers are sent to your device your device can leverage local machine learning to figure out which of these ads if any is relevant to you and your data never leaves your device so you get better targeting without that leakiness of the incumbent system so we use machine learning and of course if any ads are shown to you if you ever see a notification 70% of the revenue so 70% of what was you know gone in to show that ad to you goes directly into your wallet that's the magical bit right there and of course we had I think it's like 14% conversion or click-through rates was the most recent number which is 7 times more than the industry average sure what so what doesn't go to the user goes to the other parties involved so it's actually the lion's share 70 percent goes to the ad slot owner and 70 percent is pretty close to being like an industry average if you look at the iTunes Store and that type of stuff it's all around 70 percent though it goes to the actual publisher of the creator and so in this case we figured okay we'll follow that would do 70% to the ad slot owner which in the case of desktop private ads is you the user and the case of an emerging ad network which uses the or an emerging model which uses publisher pages that type of stuff where we actually show ads on pages the 70% would go to the publisher in that case and then you the user would get 15% brave we get to final 15% so I think the 70% there was precedent already in the industry for that being a pretty solid number if you come in anywhere below that I don't know that you're being very competitive so I hope that kind of answers the question sure yeah so 70% of that goes into your wallet inside the brave browser again this is using the basically digit oak in the ERC 20 token you can then take that out if you want to through uphold calm you can convert it into some type of fiat you can exchange it for a Bitcoin or aetherium or something else if you want to it's yours it's just a token on the network and so on the desktop if I'm browsing the web I'm looking at the East Waterloo website and in the background of course I'm trying to figure out like you can't really tell but I'm looking for ways to convert ERC 20 tokens into burritos and so if I'm doing that I might get an ad the browser itself churning on that ad catalog that it downloads the machine learning module will actually figure out okay this guys looking for ways to use utility tokens blockchain assets in such a way that he can purchase reward goods burritos in particular and so the Tourneo block card is advertising and they let me know that I can actually get a debit card or credit card type of thing that lets me spend my utility tokens anywhere visa is accepted so if I click on that I get a full page pop-up so they get the entire window and this is actually really interesting because if you look back in it's like 1994 we didn't cover this earlier but 1994 is when pop-up ads started to exist and there are some people that are young enough today they've probably never seen a pop-up ad but they became a rather big nuisance but they were created for a good reason there was a there was a company whose tripod actually at the time tripod calm but there were some websites there was a car dealer website that started having adult ads placed on his page and he was like that's not cool that's contrary to our business model I don't want that here and so what they did is they one of the engineers at tripod realized that we could just pop the ad out in its own window and you can't associate it to any other content and so you have brand safety and of course pop-ups became co-opted they were really bad at that time you could use JavaScript to move the window around the page and so you could make some really annoying pop-up ads and so we got rid of popups ads went back into pages and of course we see the value in having this brand safety in fact a couple years back we were at it was at Mobile World Congress and one of the main issues I think it's actually a year ago one of the main issues advertisers there we're looking for was brand safety because it's it's become increasingly difficult to deliver on the web today so brave does that by just giving the advertiser their entire window they get the entire tab themselves they can do whatever they want with the exception of loading third-party trackers and that type of stuff there's no special privileges within the brave' system and so today we have over nine million monthly active users just a few of the properties that have verified publishers on 16,000 twitch streamers 32,000 Twitter users 35,000 websites the YouTube number continues to blow my mind nearly a quarter of a million YouTube channels are verified terrific receive basic attention token reddit is fun if you want to vote someone for their awesome memes you can give them bat now as well and that's pretty much it there is a few things that would love to ask people to do if they're watching or if they're here in the room download brave opt into the brave rewards program participate in brave ads contribute if you're an engineer through github.com sauce brave if you're a hacker which there are quite a few at this event today if you find a vulnerability or something
