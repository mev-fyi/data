[Music] I think the Cyclones can be awesome the really cool thing about aetherium to me is like building really interesting solutions to cool problems that we haven't been able to solve before and I'm really excited to see this huge space of people who are excited about solving those problems have really cool ideas and things they want to accomplish and I think we're gonna build out a lot of cool stuff this weekend even if there's not too much that you can do within 36 hours you still very often finds that there's some team that comes together during a hackathon and build something interesting sometimes wouldn't win a prize sometimes they don't and then they decide no hey this is actually an interesting idea and they just keep working on it we knew that there was a lot of demand for people to be learning about this new technology and so just wanted to see how we could put together an event that helped push forward aetherium the ultimate goal really was just to figure out how we could really contribute to etherium by bringing many more developers into the ecosystem well I'm judging it beep Waterloo we wanted to be here because all the cool people are here I mean this is an amazingly exciting event the amount of stuff that got done here in 36 hours it was just unbelievable yes I mean the reason I came to eat Waterloo is there's a ton of developers here of building awesome applications on top of this area and so I wanted to like check that out firsthand each Waterloo is far and away the largest Xperia Makaton that we've seen today in space and also has attracted probably the most talented crop of technologists this event and so on we're happy to be involved regarding true bet you know we came down here to meet the brightest minds in the space and get them pumped up about our project talk to them about how we're trying to solve the hardest problems in the space using really innovative game theory there are many exciting projects that are human that oh yeah we will use wall chains and you know in your daily life but for us to get there we actually have to solve a lot of deep technical problems and you know it'll take us a while you know no doubt about this but I'm so excited to see all the smart people working on this stuff collaborate it's so much easier to be able to ask the person next to you to get a quick answer compared to looking up for hours searching the internet so gonna test at events having everyone in the same room being able to quickly move forward of questions I think it's a great great starting point the presenters were really great they we had a lot of probably the smartest minds in in etherium basically walking around and mentoring groups so when people had questions but the technology they didn't just have to ask someone who was smart they asked someone who's smart and actually built the thing since people aren't trying to start necessarily something that will lead to making them money that leaves them free to experiment a lot of new technologies things like decentralized storage decentralized encrypted messaging in new ways that haven't really been thought of before so we're starting to see I think at hackathons is where we'll see projects that utilize the network effect of something like experience the best I think I'm hearing more for supporting other hackers we have we have a peer-to-peer video streaming this platform that some people are interested in using to film video based decentralized tax we called it a initial bounty offering platform basically it's a small contract that lets you create bounties and and lets people claim bounties and lets the bounty administrator approve bounties and it works with any other situation so I think it's hard to get developers not to be excited about this technology it I think it really represents the the next wave of development in the IT world were like a sea change in how information technology systems are being built and gonna be built so what was interesting today is to find all these wonderful teams of young people some of them are dropping out of uni in fact to go and build real application real technology willed apps on the etherium platform something that will form essentially web 3 and one of these guys could be the next Google you don't know it's really exciting stuff um I think most of all the most important thing is just that we've kind of proven here that there is an intense demand to build a centralized applications this building right now is about 350 to 375 hackers in it and that could easily have been over a thousand we have people from across the world that terms like sent applications they really want to be here the most fun is always just shooting the about cool crypto economic designs talking about like consensus algorithms and validator economics and and all this cool fun stuff and just catching up with old friends that I haven't seen in a while and I got in and I was like I've been up all day like I'm probably gonna bed at 10 p.m. and then I just like somewhere around 9 p.m. I started having conversations upstairs like I ate a doughnut and looks at my watch and it was like 1:30 I was like what what happened like weird it weird at the time and it's it's it's just remarkable how many amazing people there are here and how like easy the conversations flow hackathons like eath Waterloo are really important for the community because it allows people that are interested in aetherium but maybe not deep in the community to get a chance to meet everyone that's you know been part of the community for a long time get to meet all the people here and kind of feel welcome and yeah to kind of get started [Music]
