welcome all of you to eat new york [Applause] all right let's get this started so this is of course our in-person event but there's a lot of ul's that are also watching a lot of this online so i want to welcome all of you to the live stream as well and with that let's kick this off so eat new york is an event by eath global a lot of you've been here for the past few days for other events and other things going on this week a lot of you been part of our events but for those of you who are joining us for the first time i want to bring this up again this is not a conference there's one person that's excited these are hackathons all of our events are put out by ethiopia and our goal is to bring on as many developers as we can into the weaponry ecosystem and we do this by running a lot of hackathons and educational events the reason these are not conferences is because our focus is on builders we care about learning being able to mentor and get mentorship and growing as developers and we believe showing is more important than telling so everything you're going to see this week is going to be about building things and not just talking about it and we've done this for the past four and a half years in all continents across the world whether it be south america india the us canada new york a few years ago london europe amsterdam a past month ago all of this happens in person and online and over the past few years this is some of the things we've been able to accomplish with over 42 events across the world we've done over a thousand plus hours of educational content over 4 000 projects have come out of youth global over 50 000 people have been on board in this community and we've given away three and a half million dollars in prizes to so many individuals that have helped bootstrap their passions and all together the companies that have come out of some of these projects have raised over 500 million dollars even though that's never been the goal and this brings us to eat new york this is an amazing crowd here we have 1500 people from 56 different countries all in this building 37 of them are new to web3 they're all developers on top of that we have a hundred mentors 24 educational workshops and because this is not a conference only six talks so we're gonna make sure they're good and you get to see all of them tomorrow this officially is our biggest event with over five hundred thousand dollars in prizes and the best and the biggest we've gone in the past four and a half years so congratulations to everybody that's been here and can't wait to get all of you on board it on top of that we have 48 incredible partners that are here this weekend you get to talk to some of the best companies and protocols in this space i want to quickly give them a big round of applause we'll just kind of keep clapping i'm going to say all the names as i can i want to thank all of them that made this possible so starting off with open c optimism ipfs fall coin polygon wallet connect one inch boba dydx scale tatum dallas world coin unit swap grants program bitdown connects covalent chronos notices safe live pier mina protocol pocket network skynet super fluid swivel finance taxol the graph uma ape works chain link unlock nft port epns lens protocol reservoir protocol privy element finance ens tenderly gnosis chain xmtp lab storage spherex blockchain space and i'm totally blanking on this thing it's radical threshold nomad elastic swap core tracker thank you to all of these amazing companies and you get to be part of this now all right i know there's going to be a lot of things coming on here so we're going to make sure the first 10 minutes are all about logistics and nobody's confused for the next two days we're going to talk about what's happening in the venue there's clearly two venues here with different things going on we're going to talk about how you can get help all the prizes judging submissions team formation all that stuff so let's start off with the venue this is where most of the things are happening if anything this is where everything is happening this is multiple floors the main floor is for hacking space to stage food and the sponsor area the second floor fourth floor and fifth floor are also hacking spaces but we also have workshops going on on second and fourth floor so if you think something is full here in terms of tables for you wanting to work you can go up on three other floors and find more spots there should be more than enough room for all of you to work on a table comfortably and there's another space on the other side where registration was and you can use that as an overflow room as well on top of that we have some really cool activities and things going on here it's a mini nft exhibition carried by brow house and whim that's also near where the registration was uh there's a digital photo booth here so you can take your selfies right at the edge where you came into the other building uh we have a mini arcade set up on the fourth floor you can play some classic arcade games and uh we're going to do some fun activities like being able to do latte art tomorrow on the fourth floor at eight five from five to eight pm so check out all these things going on all these things are also on the schedule in case you forget or you don't know how to look uh where they are you are able to go to the website or your hacker dashboard everything about this event will be communicated officially through discord which means that is the best way we have to reach all of you all of you should be already there that includes all of our partners speakers as well as all of our hackers on discord you will see all the channels about eaton new york and if you don't see them find anybody on the global team so we can make sure you have the right permissions the discord url is etherglobal.com discord and these are private channels which are only open to the attendees in this building we also have dedicated channels to get help about specific protocols or overall things that you are blocked on and there's also mentor desks at the at the end over there and you can physically go up and talk to people and get help and get unblocked or talk about anything that you need help with remember even though things are on discord you are here in person it feels weird i know but you can talk to people and get things answered live it's revolutionary on top of that you should also have some calendar invites especially for sunday on how everything is coordinated whether it's submission deadlines or judging or when food's not going to be served at so you can use that to coordinate a lot of the things with you and your team everything again is on the website and let's go into all the hackathon stuff hackathon officially begins now which means you can start working on your project you can work on your projects as an individual or up to five people on your team you have until 9am on sunday to hack with it which is actually a little bit more than 36 hours but you can start working on your projects as of right now in terms of how a project is qualified everything that you're going to be doing should be done from scratch which means you cannot continue building what you have been already working on in the past for this weekend so everything that you're going to do should be done and should begin as a piece of code today only rsvp hackers are eligible to win prizes which means that if you do not see your name on the list of a team member while you are submitting you are not an eligible hacker at that point so if you do end up winning any prizes we will not be delivering them to you there's also some match cases there of course some of you joined last minute so if you are in one of those groups please make sure that it says on your dashboard that you were indeed confirmed and on top of that there's a lot of workshops and talks going on there's 24 workshops happening right after this and some of them have already started and right after this thing ends you can go up on the second and the fourth floor to see a lot of talks that all of our amazing partners are hosting and that includes introductory talks as well everything is also on the info center so if you're not sure where to find all these things you will have a link handy from your dashboard and your calendar invites and of course if you missed something because some of these things are happening in parallel everything is recorded and also live streams you can immediately catch up by just heading over to eve global.tv that covers a lot of the logistics for those of you who are trying to find what the website is it's just nyc.edu.com and you can see everything from prizes to the schedule to everything else there directly let's talk about submissions and judging submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on the sunday this means that your dashboard will stop accepting submissions and everything we have at that time will be the final set of projects that will be getting judged and because this is a time sensitive thing for us because we have to coordinate a lot of people returning and being able to go back home on on time this is going to be the deadline in terms of how judging works we'll keep this simple as well 30 minutes after submission judging officially begins which means you will be assigned a room to go to to present your projects to the judges if you are going for the main judging route you get to walk up to the judges if you are trying to win some prizes from our partners you get to walk up to their booth and present your projects to them so there's two sets of judging going on and these are happening in parallel which means if you are trying to win a prize for three projects and protocols you will have to present to all three of them by going over to their booth and then also to the main judging for the main eve global prizes you will be given four minutes to demo and and three minutes for q a so that's seven minutes in total we do recommend that you do a video submission in case something goes wrong with the wi-fi or something goes wrong with your demo if it's on localhost so this way you get to play the video and your demo without actually breaking anything from what you worked on for the last two days please don't do this thing last minute there is a lot of things that go into the submission piece because you do have to verify and specify which projects you are or prices you're trying to go for and uh give at least 30 minutes for all these things and all this will happen on your dashboard and we'll be giving a lot of prompts on discord and email also you do have to specify which projects and prizes you're going for if you are going for any sponsor prizes they do not magically get to know that you are applying for their prizes so if you do not click this on your submission process they have no way of knowing who to expect so don't miss out this important section and they'll be at the booth so you can just go find them after you've been assigned a judging appointment all right code of conduct this is an in-person event and there's a lot of people here and the rules for this event and the code of conduct is on eighth global.com rules you can see all the details around how we think about anywhere from photography to intellectual property which is you own everything that you built nobody else has a claim for this and how to behave in this community the short of it is please be respectful and harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated if you feel like somebody is harassing you please come find anybody on the global team and we'll take prompt and immediate action even if none of this is about the code of conduct you just have general questions there's going to be a help desk 24 7 for from us and we'll also be monitoring discord so just ask any questions on discord or on or just come to the table all right this is majority of the logistics hopefully most of you still got this this is also being recorded so don't worry you can also watch this later if you want to go to a specific slide but before we go into our amazing panel for today i want to bring on some amazing partners that are here to talk about how they're supporting the web3 ecosystem and some of the prices you can win from them so i'm going to kick this off by inviting lucas to stage from ipfs of allcoin please give rukis a big round of applause hi everyone my name is lucas i run the builders program for ipfs and falcoin which means that my job is to make it as easy as possible for you to you know build with us and ultimately hopefully build a company and that succeeds in our ecosystem ipfs for those who don't know is um the kind of making the web work peer-to-peer it's a content addressing and routing protocol and and many of you use it and know it filecoin is the decentralized storage network that builds on top of ipfs 18 million terabytes of capacity to fill so i'm excited to see what you guys will build with those technologies come find us at our booth we're right at the entrance and at 9 30 tonight on the fourth floor we'll have a workshop to answer all your questions quick glance at the ecosystem we have over 4 000 storage providers in the network and they collectively provide 18 million terabytes in storage capacity which makes us the largest decentralized storage network on the planet and and on the other side we're seeing increasing demand right from an explosively growing ecosystem there's over 330 startups in our ecosystem many of which started in a hackathon and i hope that um some of you will you know be that next generation of um starters that we see there's over 9000 developers working with um far coin which makes it one of the most actively developed blockchain protocols um filecoin is a lot more than just storage the five coin virtual machine is coming up falcon is turning into a net negative um carbon footprint we have retrieval markets so it's really turning to the foundation of web three and i encourage you to like learn more about it and engage with us and four things that i'd like you to do one is hack and win right so we have 20 000 prizes up for grabs with an intentionally broad challenge statement just use ipfs or filecoin you can also use you know technology that builds on top of them nft dot storage web 3 dot storage text style other tooling just go as long as it uses ipfs or far coin you're eligible second join our workshop 930 fourth floor and then find us at our booth and our team we have recruiters we have myself we have developer advocates here to answer a question and if you want you can join our leaderboard challenge so and collect points by doing activities throughout this hackathon on discord and by joining the workshop by tweeting about it by submitting a project and um if you lead that leaderboard you're eligible to win some um swag boxes at the end thanks so much and i'm looking forward to seeing all your submissions on sunday you're tall thanks lucas next up we have miguel from worldcoin please welcome miguel on stage so gm everyone i'm michael from goldcoin we are here as part of our initiative to be more open and more transparent we're open sourcing everyone everything we see in the community we also participate in as many hackathons as we want to get more people to build on it and discover the protocol that we're building and so we're aiming to solve civil attacks if you have done anything related to nft projects or air drops you know what i'm talking about civil attacks are when users of your application are just bots or people trying to manipulate activity to manipulate incentives or make it seem like they get more of a reward for it or any of these things and so worldcoin aims to be able to anonymously tell whether someone has ever done any of these things without revealing any information with them we are we call this wall id and what it enables you to do is to anonymously verify that someone is a real person a real human that is performing an action only once without revealing anything else about them so again they they have never voted in a governance proposal they have minted nft redeemed an airdrop joining a discord channel all of these things uh we use this little guy i mean the orb to make sure that you're real looking at using an iris scans and biometrics we do everything on device so it is completely private and your iris obviously never leaves the device and then we use serial proofs to make sure that no one can use this to track you or learn anything about you including wallcoin and so the user verifies their entity with the welcoming orb they only need to do this once afterwards applications can use the protocol our sdks to solicit verification for the users which they approve you through the app and then deploy just like verifies on or off chain requesting verification is as simple as three lines of codes and then you can verify this with a captcha that then gets validated either through an api or on chain it looks like this really really sweet this has a really wide variety of use cases from boating air drops quadratic funding and a bunch of other stuff and yeah we have a big amount of resources we have a developer portal all of the documentation example starter kit that we can wait for you guys to use we have a discord channel we also have a booth up there and we have a channel on the 8th global discord so yeah let's build together [Applause] thank you miguel next up we have kartik from open c please welcome carter on stage hey everyone my name is kartik i lead protocol at openc protocol openc is a relatively new team and we kind of came out of nowhere however we're working on a lot of cool stuff and we're just getting started the first of which you may have seen we announced seaport a few weeks ago seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling nfps uh what does that mean so what does safe being we had a lot of of your favorite auditing firms kind of take a look at the code but more importantly we opened it up for the entire community to take a look at we had almost like 70 contributors outside of openc who came in ripped apart the code improved it and alongside that we ran a million dollar code arena competition that i'm sure some of you may have participated in um and then what does efficient mean uh somewhat maybe criticized seaport has been heavily written in assembly um that makes it kind of hard for a lot of people to understand but we really think it we use a lot of clever tricks to help shave off gas and make it cheaper for our users so yeah that's seaport and i'm really excited to see what people can build with it it's kind of just getting started and we want to work together with the community to take it forward from now on thanks [Applause] amazing all right next up we have wallet connect please welcome sebastian hi everyone uh so many as you know while it connects a secure remote signing protocol you probably know us as the qr code that shows up when you click connect wallet we have any wallet any app in each chain and for this hackathon we have two tracks we have the d5 track and the social track the default track is anything that is more money related well the social track can be either nfts dals social recovery we will pick and choose please come to our booth it's very important that you have a full integration with wallop connect like we want to see the full signing from connection to signing on the wallet to a confirmation on the dap that's really the bare minimum criteria for winning one of our prizes so thank you very much thank you sebastian next up alec from ballast please welcome alice on stage all right hello everyone i'm alec from vallast super stoked to be here we're building web3 native software distribution i'm going to tell you real quick what that's all about but basically right now web3 is putting massive amounts of energy into decentralization and then we'll recentralize everything at the distribution level by publishing web3 software over web 2 platforms so what is web3 native software distribution well things like publishing fetching secure updates that come from your typical web 2 platforms but now we can do some awesome things like dows can coordinate software together so you can imagine adele publishing a new version of geth together as well as the ability to create software licensed nfts to monetize your software directly instead of having to ask apple or google or anyone else for permission just create a wallet and start monetizing and why do we need this well i got some amazing protocols up here some are not listed because we're working with them to get them on web through native distribution but geth is built on microsoft azure blob store polygon is on micros on github releases ultimately still microsoft and it all goes to the end user for things like mobile apps games and especially things like docker images for our infrastructure so the issues with this risk of compromise censorship availability all the things we know and tout for web3 uh and then the centralized payment infrastructure from web 2 platforms is permissioned and they take 30 plus percent whereas valus is a set of tools that coordinate protocols together to make publishing software and web3 easy and you could use the web front end cli github action typescript and go sdks there's the web app there's the cli super simple github action just paste that at the end of your workflow if you're already using github and then the sdk if you wanted to get in the nitty-gritty and you can find it valus.io go to the docs join our discord we're super excited to help out and check out our github and twitter and i'm just going to take a moment to reflect on some of these amazingly unique opportunities that these events provide so this screenshot here is actually a picture of valas from hackafest 2020 our original hackathon submission and now we're here we've raised money we built the company and actually we're growing pretty great so you never know what's going to come out of these events so just keep packing away you're going to meet some amazing friends you're going to build amazing things and it's going to be very memorable and we have a very awesome prize pool um anyone that publishes on the platform can qualify and then we're picking five finales and it's using ipfs and filecoin already so the filecoin ipfs team already said that other tools work so by publishing on this platform you can also qualify for those prizes so thank you so much everyone best of luck hope you have an amazing time have a go on cheers it is uh always incredible to see hackathon projects become companies and give back to the community all right next up we have arno from tatum please welcome arnold on stage hey good evening everyone my name is arno i am the head of growth at tatum we're super excited to be here tatum is the leading blockchain development platform in the world we have over 60 000 projects and companies that are building amazing blockchain application right now using tatum so we have built an entire framework that allows you to build anything you want across 40 different blockchain protocols both layer 1 and layer 2s the good news is you don't need to learn each of those blockchain their complexities in a different language you don't need to run nodes and you don't need to learn how to code smart contracts we have everything covered if you're using tatum you use our api and unifi sdk and you can build anything you want so the question is not what can you build on tatum but how easy and simple is going to be for you to build your application and for those of you who don't know solidity or rust don't worry we have an entire javascript sdk that abstract you from the complexity of a blockchain so really you can build anything you want now we're super excited to be here in new york we were in amsterdam back in april we have some fantastic projects that build we're using with tatum and for this weekend we're offering over 20 thousand dollars of price for people who are building ontario on top of that we'll give away five hundred dollars for every acting team that's using datum over the weekend the only thing you have to do you go to tatum.io and you get your free api key and this weekend we want to build together some amazing blockchain application together thank you very much [Applause] thank you next up we have jack from scale please welcome jack on stage hey everybody how's it going all right who is hacking this weekend see you all right all right awesome okay so uh happy to be here my name is jack o'haller and i'm the ceo and co-founder of skill labs uh we're the core team behind the scale network the scale network is an open decentralized modular multi-chain blockchain network one of the coolest parts of scale is that it's actually built on ethereum and integrated with ethereum so scale cannot run without ethereum right now there are 28 unique modular block chains running live in the scale in the scale network all of these are anchored into the ethereum network with stake and different security operations that support scales so we we end up bringing value back to ethereum and supporting ethereum and um and uh anyways uh there are some other key features i want to talk about one zero gas fees okay so there's a there's a unique economic model where chains are paid for in advance with scale tokens and end users do not need to pay gas and so we've been we've been working on this for a long time we started in 2017 this is our fourth year of doing eth hackathons it's probably one of our favorite things to do we love being here we love supporting the builders just wanna the main update for this slide is that there now v2 is now live and with that we have over 200 projects building on scale over a thousand developers building and you know a lot of momentum especially in gaming there's a huge gaming flow coming into scale from other chains as well as new projects launching and gaming d5 is also now live on scale so you can go to ruby.exchange and have less than two second block times with instant finality and zero gas fees um now i've got some technical slides we have uh i definitely don't have time to go through all these so what i would say is i welcome all of you if you want to understand how the modularity of the scale network functions how the security functions um how the uh how this ethereum main net helps orchestrate chains and provide security and collusion resistance to the network and how the chains and validator nodes actually support each other by pulling security across the different chains so come by and talk to us okay we have twenty thousand in awards five thousand dollar grand prize there's a five thousand dollar pool prize so every single team that submits a hack on scale will share that so if there's 10 teams it gets divided up by 10 20 etc so we're here to help you we'll be here all weekend and last thing if you want to mint an nft right now live on the scale mainnet zero gas fees it's not lazy minting uh give it a shot this is an uh uh eth new york nft uh courtesy of our partner ivycat ivyivy.cash um a wallet will be created instantly on your iphone or android phone without any native wallet okay uh if you didn't get a chance to click that come by later and we've got some cards at the booth okay thanks everybody [Applause] thanks shaq next up we have kelvin from optimism please welcome kelvin on stage what up what up i'm kelvin uh i work on optimism i don't have slides because you don't need slides to understand optimism it's super simple it's just like ethereum but it's cheaper um i don't have slides because i did not sufficiently prepare for this now uh optimism is a layer two scaling solution it's really easy to use you just go to optimism dot io and everything you need to know is right there optimism is trying to solve two main problems we're trying to solve problem number one ethereum does not scale or it doesn't scale when gas prices are high and problem number two ethereum's social layer does not scale and we're trying to fix that too so if you want to build on a cool blockchain that is both cheap fast and trying to solve the public goods funding problem in this space come talk to me i will be over there at the optimism booth it'll be a lot of fun we got uh like 20 thousand dollars worth of prizes and you don't even have to build on optimism to win them but you should cause it's cool and each of the prizes are designed to incentivize you to go learn something fun and do something interesting and go build something ridiculous on ethereum to flex your muscles learn some solidity and enjoy your time at this hackathon have fun and uh you know go build on the coolest scaling solution and come talk to us if you're interested about governance in the ethereum ecosystem thank you and goodbye thank you kelvin next up we have jordan from one inch please welcome jordan on stage everyone i'm jordan i do uh community and governance at one inch um so if you don't know what one inch is we're a decentralized exchange aggregator we actually were launched at ethereum new york 2019 sorry um so we solved the problem of fractional liquidity across d5 so sorry about that so the aggregation protocol was v1 we've actually grown to be v4 now i'm sorry i can't sorry about that i just found out i'm doing this like an hour ago so uh just bear with me we have sixteen thousand dollars worth of uh bounties so come by the one inch um booth back there um everything ranging from nft aggregation to uh margin orders so yeah thank you [Applause] we'll edit this later don't worry all right next up we have james from boba and then one more to go after that please welcome james on stage bye everybody hello hello uh we do not have slides because this is not a conference i just want to make sure that's clear um so i'm james uh i'm on the ecosystem uh growth team at bobo network uh boba is a multi-chain layer two scaling solution um we're extremely excited to be here by the way with all you guys this is great to see uh the turnout um so very quickly in two minutes i want to give you the four reasons uh why you should build on boba this weekend um reason number one is our mission um and i think we share a similar vision as a lot of folks in this space where we want to create a accessible environment for all people regardless of borders to reap the benefits of blockchain technology however our approach and our contribution to that is how we are unique um which brings me to um really the second reason which is how are we unique and like all other layer twos our goal is to scale blockchains make them faster make them cheaper but bobo we're also focused on making blockchain networks smarter and how do we make it smarter we make it smarter with hybrid compute so natively on boba we enable your smart contracts to call any external web 2 api so things like complex computations or machine learning algorithms that are happening off-chain you can make those calls in your smart contracts natively on boba and bring them in on-chain reason number three is our multi-chain approach um as we think about this multi-chain future and it becomes more clear we are thinking about ways to create a multi-chain future um for users builders developers and our layer one partners um so we've already deployed on test net other instances of layer 2 boba outside of ethereum so we're really excited to create a multi-chain future as the unified l2 for the l1s and lastly the fourth reason which you all are probably most excited about is we are also giving away twenty thousand dollars uh worth of prizes so come by our booth and speak to myself uh or greg who's my marketing partner here um and learn about how you can win a prize for deploying on boba this weekend thank you and last but not least rahat from polygon please welcome him on stage gm new york what is up come on let's go what's up all right they said it's a bear market but i don't see that here right we're all here to build we're all here to take the next step into building the future on web3 here to tell you a little bit about polygon first off my names are hot i'm a developer advocate over at polygon which is the leading platform from ethereum scaling and infrastructure development we've got a whole bunch of different solutions for you to build on whether it's our proof of stake blockchain a z zk evm solution that was announced today available to start playing around with one month from now and a whole suite of other solutions for building on top of ethereum it's easy for developers because if you've already been developing in the evm space you already know solidity you already know how to use things like hard hat uh remix you already know javascript things like that all of that maps one to one over to polygon you don't need to learn anything new but if you do need to learn some new stuff we do have steph who's going to do an awesome workshop 10 30 second floor we have prizes worth over 20 thousand dollars here are some of our tracks we're looking for the best impact social goods uh public goods that are built on polygon two thousand five hundred dollars nft track most innovative use of nfcs two thousand five hundred dollars ux track i wanna see some really good user experiences built on top of polygon two thousand five hundred dollars a d5 track best d5 use case on polygon another two thousand five hundred dollars if you win in any of these um tracks there is something else very special for you as well we also have a pool prize of 10 000 that will be split amongst the 10 runner-ups to any of these categories so thank you really awesome to see all of y'all hacking and have a good weekend here all right those were all of our partners so we have two amazing speakers we want to bring on and before we do that i'm gonna just spend five minutes going through all the other prizes we have available so all of you know here and then you can find all the details on how to win that on your dashboard so first though we have ipfs and falcoin so there are there's a first place prize for six thousand dollars and three two thousand a three thousand dollar second price price and there's also a five thousand dollar category for a pool price which means uh each team will get five hundred uh dollars each for a best use of ipfs or coin integration then as we just heard uh there are multiple tracks for 2500 each which is best impact best nft best ux and best d5 project on top of polygon and 10 runner ups were a thousand dollars each for being a polygon user and deploying it on polygon next up we have wallet connects we have a d5 track where the first place is going to get five thousand dollars second place is going to get 2 500 and third place is going to get 12.50 and then a social track with the same numbers and an additional 2500 for a pool price which means that anybody building in that category will split the amount equally next up we have one inch so there are three uh first second third place price from one inch eight thousand dollars for the first place in one inch tokens second place will receive five thousand dollars the third place will receive three thousand and this is for being able to use the one inch protocols and sdk in your project next up we have boba so first second third place we'll get ten thousand six thousand four ten dollar each for the best integration of the global network next up we have dydx first place we'll get 5000 seconds we'll get 3000 and third place we'll get 2 000 in dydx tokens for the best integration of dydx protocol then we have open c so the best seaport contribution will receive four thousand dollars for the first place 1750 for the second place and 750 for the third place and then the best ecosystem or community integration with openc sdk will receive two thousand dollars for the first place one thousand for the second and five 500 for the third place the fun one is optimism there are a lot of prizes here specifically designed to make you be aware of different eips so that to use crypto as a tool to change the world as a category 4844 will be given as a prize amount the most public goodie is public good we'll get 36.75 a hack that shouldn't be built on a blockchain but it's anyway as a category is 36.68 the most absurd hack as determined by the optimism team will be receiving three thousand and seventy four dollars and just using optimism in your hack and deploying it will be receiving 47.39 and these are all eips that you should check out then we have scale the best use of the scale integration will be receiving five thousand dollars for the first place in skl tokens then there are metaverse gaming nft categories for prices which will be receiving eight thousand dollars in scale tokens the partner integration is going to be receiving 2 000 and a pool price category of 5000 receiving 5000 scale tokens then we have tatum so the best overall project will be receiving five thousand dollars the best project specifically for nfts will be getting four and three outstanding projects will be getting three thousand dollars and they also have a pool prize for ten teams then we have ballast five teams will get a thousand dollars each for the best dallas integration and a five thousand dollar placeholder or a pool prize that'll be split equally then we have world coin so first second and third we'll get seven thousand five thousand and three thousand in that order and a five thousand dollar category for anybody using world id in their hack and then we have the grav pocket uma superfluid connects mina live pierre chronos and nososafe each offering ten thousand dollars in prizes on their side then covalent taxa bitdow unit swap grants program ape works and skynet offering from eight to ten thousand dollars each then we have privy reservoir epns no system nfc port swivel ten early storage and lens offering five thousand dollars in prizes and then chain link xmtp labs element unlock ens blockchain space spherex and radical offering two to five thousand dollars in prizes so overall we have half a million dollars in prizes being given away this weekend and we can't wait to have all of you check this out on nyc.ethglobal.com prizes all right now for the fun part i want to invite two special guests on stage to share some fun stories and the past present and the future of web3 so without further ado please welcome hayden adams the ceo of uniswap labs and carl florsch cto of op labs on stage we're gonna do some questions hey hey hey hello all right so this is a really interesting time people are somewhat talking about the markets but we don't see any of that in this room this is more than we've ever had in any room or any place in the world in terms of developers and you two have been a unique part of that history so wanna talk about how some of these things happen and what to look forward to so let's start off by some intros but let's make that interesting so carl tell us about how you got into this space and how you know hayden oh right so i am carl i work on optimism and i have known hayden for we calculated it literally over there nine years nine years that's that's a while and we first met each other in college i knew his roommate he's a mechanical engineering major i knew his roommate because he was a compsci major and so i chilled with his roommate because i'm a compsci major because i'm yeah yeah and then i met him and then i was like yo you should live in my suite because my suite's way better than yours and so he came over to mine and then i kind of got deep into ethereum in about 2015 absolutely deep and i uh hayden was my uh my loki rock you know he was kind of my my dude um and i just could not stop talking about ethereum every single day to hayden i am so sorry in fact it's a massive understatement this this is true i was like oh yeah i i feel like hayden may have just from our hangs like gotten more than like a deep like just absurd crash course like what are we that's all we talked about for a very long time yeah i'd say there was like two things carl said to me every day was one i should stop being a mechanical engineer and i should start coding and two i should be more into ethereum um this was all the way back in starting in 2015 but it persisted for several years um that was good advice yeah uh persisted until about 2017 um i was at that point we had both graduated uh he was working at he had just moved from consent he had gone to consensus and then he had gone to the ethereum foundation afterwards and he was now working on writing the casper ffg smart contract um and i was working at siemens doing you know boring heat flow analysis and um i got laid off uh you know one year into working there i don't think i was very good at my job um and carl was very happy um you know the first thing that carl said to me was like this is the best thing that has ever happened to you um because now you can work in ethereum and you have no excuse not to um and i kind of took it and ran with it um you know for what it's worth um i at that point i think he had actually converted me over um took years of wearing me down but you know the idea of building uh you know smart contracts and you know applications that were unstoppable that you know people could use and interact with each other and didn't need to trust each other um but could engage in complex interactions was like pretty cool um and so i'd say i was pretty won over um uh yeah i mean so maybe just gonna walk us through how did that lead to unit swap um so the way that that led to unit swap and i think we can probably go back and forth to get through both of our stories but i'd say that you know the way that that led to uniswap is about three months in to learning solidity and uh for what it's worth the the developer resources at the time were very very sparse uh i initially learned solidity basically through like a small blog post that carl had written and like so did i yeah carl had written a blog post that was like the very basics of using remix uh connecting it to metamask deploying a smart contract um and then like maybe one or two youtube videos but it was really sparse at the time uh and i felt like i needed something a little bit more to like learn i felt like i was stalling in my progress i actually shouldn't even take credit carl was like the way that you stop selling any progress is you have a side project that like focuses you and so you know i was looking for a side project and uh maybe carl can come to like how it got recommended to me but essentially carl pointed me to a blog post from vitalik talking about like a new way to do exchange on ethereum um and so i you know decided to start implementing it uh and eventually that became uniswap i don't know if you have oh yeah i've been contact's there i could give some extra extra deets um so i was working at the ethereum foundation traveling around the world with vitalik now vitalik knows how to travel he is a a beast i mean seriously so anyway i was just barely keeping up with him but we were like giving talks and in between giving these conference talks vitalik was saying hey no one has built the most dead simple like the most obvious like this of all of the designs of a decentralized exchange there is this one design and it is called the constant product market maker and it is the best design by far and no one's made it you need to find someone or you should build this like someone should build this like we need to fund this and by the way this is a public good right he was saying that even back then and so i found someone to build it david not actually the first implementation was david knott shout out to david knott coinbase respect i usually don't say that one second person to implement this no actually the first person to implement it was a vitalik actually wrote a quick prototype in viper which of course was a language that he also built himself literally just savage savage individual um but then hayden was the most clear-cut you know obvious choice right there like waiting hungry to actually take a project and run with it and so i was like hey yeah cool um so carl convinced me to build unit swap um and i basically spent uh the next few months uh building out like a prototype uh actually he you know he told me that if i built a demo in a month he would talk about it on stage at devcon 2. um so i built the first i basically wrote the first version of the smart smart contracts and my first website which was like a simple create react app i didn't even know how to use components so it was just one long uh file um one long like app.js file and uh i created like a dead simple interface for the for uh and he talked about on stage um at devcon 2 and then from there a few people reached out to carl to be connected to me and then i started going to ethereum conferences uh you know east global events and other events shout out each global and you know started to become more ingrained in the ethereum community and i eventually met vitalik got an ethereum foundation grant eventually finished building unispot and launched it but no it's just incredible what we're going to try to do is the timeline intersection here a bunch of times so maybe in parallel carl had it working from casper to optimism or plasma to optimism how did that happen oh wow all right well started out building casper this is the early ethereum proof of stake protocol learning all about consensus algorithms learning all about decentralization and implemented this alpha casper test net so you know implementing fork choice with proof of stake verify validators all this kind of stuff but after having implemented that it was pretty clear that ethereum itself the core protocol could not scale and i like i like using things i like interacting with things and i got a little disillusioned because casper is more about security it's like hypothetical stuff it's you know this application but it doesn't make the your your average dap a huge amount better right the average depth is still going to be expensive if ethereum cannot scale and so i was like okay let me get into scalability so it was eth2 consensus protocol i mean eth2 sharding protocols with justin drake he came in and he just described all this amazing stuff and i was like wow this is amazing but i am extremely impatient and i do not want to wait for sharding and hard forks and governance and like oh my god i'm just so bored by governance so what i wanted to do was build in layer two you don't have to wait you don't have to this is permissionless innovation so with the help of uh ben jones jinglan wang like a uh uh kelvin fisture we started plasma group and plasma group was this layer two scalability company but guess what happened hayden adams comes again he strikes again because we built plasma or we we created a a plasma test net and then we showed our plasma test net to hayden and you know what hayden said he said that's nice but but can it run uniswap and we're like oh you know we can like kinda like you know and it couldn't really so we went back to the drawing board and we came up with this generalized version of plasma and it had all these things and you know it was really cool it was like programmable you could like deploy plasma contracts and then we went up to hayden again we're like check this out and hayden was like huh cool can it run uniswap and our our spirits were we're at the the bottom we nearly gave up on scalability no i actually we didn't give up yet but we came back we were like and boom this is what led us to optimistic roll-ups this is why we were like yo we should call them optimistic because we're pretty optimistic people so we called them optimistic roll-ups because hashtag branding and we showed it to hayden and we're like can it run eunice and then he asked of course can it run uniform and we're like heck yeah i can run unit swap so we're like let's call it optimistic roll ups and let's create a company called optimism and let's inject some vibes in this this place and here we are here we are yeah okay so so there's an interesting point that you brought up and and obviously i asked this with benefit of hindsight but as you both were doing this was the intention to ever create a company out of this like implementing a working prototype from a blog post to getting uniswap to run on a scalability solution i don't think for either of us the intention was ever to work at companies or create companies i think for both of us we were at the time like pretty obsessed with ethereum in in our respective ways um i was you know i had this grant funding i thought maybe uniswap would always be funded by grant i wasn't really sure um um and i was just most interested in like you know trying to make something work and thought maybe after i proved that it would work maybe someone would hire me at their crypto project um i it was more for me like a proof of concept um to learn and broaden yeah i think that like the backdrop was that there were like three or four other decentralized exchanges at the time that had raised between 40 and 153 million dollars and i sort of assumed one of them would like win and that uniswap was kind of more of a proof of concept for something that was built on top of ethereum but was as decentralized as ethereum itself uh and it was less about like efficiency or or even like um just like availability of it yeah i wasn't like trying to build a business i was just saying like can we build something that says decentralized ethereum that is on top of ethereum um and then can answer carl's for him a little bit um which was that you know originally they formed like the plasma foundation or something plasma group which was a non-profit foundation and that's how they originally set out to build it um but i think what we both learned is and i think uh carl has a lot of opinions on on public goods funding um but i think what we both learned is you know when i went back to apply for another grant it wasn't going to be big enough to fund development of unit swap v2 uh or all the things that i wanted to build um and when carl was at you know plasma group and they were looking for funding it wasn't going to be enough to fund what they were working on um and so you know that is what led to the initial seed round where i formed a company and the time there was no business model in mind or anything but it was like hey like this idea is really cool people are building on top of it when unit swap launched there was this immediate like developer community because i was only developer on it and i didn't really wasn't really a developer and i when there was a bug there was no one to fix it and when there was no analytics and so someone had to build analytics and so there was this like natural grassroots thing and that's an interesting point too because obviously the world was entirely different a few years ago from a developer tooling standpoint resources available other opportunities if you could kind of come back or go back in time and kind of give yourself a piece of advice on what would you have done differently for your own progress about either optimism or plasma or unit swap what would you would you tell yourself you want to go first you can go first if you have an idea advice i i don't know it's a little bit hard to give i feel like it's worked out pretty well and i'd say that like maybe yeah i think i think i think that i would probably tell myself to get less distracted by really short-term things um you know things that were like short-term incentives or short-term ideas or narratives or or you know one person getting mad at me on twitter and then getting roped into it i think i wasted a lot of time arguing with people on twitter over random that ended up not mattering at all welcome to the internet okay yes so yes no short term thinking long term steady build sustainability that is one thing for sure the other thing is the simpler the protocol the simpler the expression of the protocol the better ah so i would go back and i would tell my old self the cohens that the wise sage geohot told me geohop being a hacker uh oh great great and great dude anyway his cohens were there are two of them one the fool goes and okay the wise person i don't really know the whole saying but basically the wise person spends to cut down a tree spends seven hours sharpening the blade and one hour chopping down the tree the dumb person you know spends like 24 hours chopping down the tree with a dull blade okay what does that mean that means that you need to be planning and thinking about what you're going to execute on for way longer than you expect like iteration and experimentation you do need to absolutely do that but thinking really clearly about a simple and elegant solution to a problem is a way to have way more impact with way fewer lines of code so the second cohen is every line of code is worth a hundred dollars so think about it that way like when you are thinking about a solution you spend seven hours sharpening the blade and then you write very few lines of code to actually solve the root of the problem and that like those in those ingredients allow you to solve mega mega mega problems um that that otherwise would not be possible that's a really really good answer that's much better than mine i'm jealous it doesn't actually work at a hackathon yes uh no i agree i think simple solutions always always the best so this creates an interesting conundrum because obviously we have the benefit of hindsight but in that world when you're trying to figure out anywhere from elegant solutions to just waiting for certain things to happen for you to kind of get the prerequisites you need how do you think about staying motivated or not losing track or falsely kind of making a short term decision like do you have any frameworks or just overall like how are you gonna think about making that type of decision it's a very open-ended question and a hard one how do you stay motivated when yeah um that is a good question i think for me the thing that kept me motivated was i was really excited and interested in what i was working on and so i think that like whatever you're working on i think that like i don't think it's good to be like lukewarm on it or like but like i think that to like put in like the time and the energy you have to be like interested and excited by it um because if you're interested and excited about it it'll feel a lot more natural i don't know that's my thing nice my how i stay motivated is i stay optimistic okay no here's the framework that i use wink the framework that i use really is there are two options right you can either be optimistic and think that you can have an impact and think that you can do things and you know actually make a change or you can be pessimistic and not think that the world can be made better and the thing about being optimistic is that how are you going to make the world a better place how are you going to actually have an impact if you don't believe in yourself to make that impact turns out the word optimized is actually to act as an optimist you make something better because you see a path to a better future so the thing that keeps me optimistic is not necessarily that we are going to survive the next year as a species i have no idea but what keeps me optimistic is i definitely know that if we do not survive as a species in a year from now but we were working to make the world better then i feel pretty happy about the journey that i was on throughout that whole process because it's it's fun i mean i want to help like this this ship is sinking right and i want to like plug holes as we go down with the ship like i'm ready i mean we might make it to shore but like at least we'll be plugging holes it'd be crazy it'll be fun we can chant and stuff he's always been like this i i think we should think about it from counting lines and hundred dollars as a diff well speaking of exciting things um unit swap recently acquired genie tell us about uh how that decision happened and uh what do you plan on doing with this acquisition yeah so for people who don't know uh jeannie is an nft marketplace aggregator and so you know you have a bunch of different nft marketplaces like openc and that's where and wearable and coinbase nft and all that and uh genie is a website you go and unless you trade across all of all of them at once um so the reason that it was so exciting for me uh and for our team uh is is one that we you know shared shared a vision um and what that was is really you know the reason that i'm excited i'm not excited about your c20 tokens in the abstract you know i'm not excited about any of this stuff in the abstract i'm excited about you know what uh what web3 and this technology enables and uh so you know one of the things i'm really excited about is uh you know the same way that like the internet democratized access to information um you know to me web 3 is about democratizing access to ownership and value creation um and so to me erc20 tokens are interesting because they are a means of digital ownership and a means of you know uh expressing value and creating value um and making uh ownership and value you know more accessible to more people and to me nfts represent basically the exact same thing um and when you know i think about what we do at unifop labs it's not just about building efficient protocols to back web3 it's about you know explicitly with the intention of making like it's not you know there's protocols there's interfaces there's you know developer things in between um and what we're most interested in is the impact that we have and the you know the ability to make web3 more accessible and so uh you know uniform protocol has pretty high market share like it's definitely possible to make more efficient trading protocols uh but to us uh what we've started to feel is that the barrier to entry uh the the the thing that's holding back you know web3 is not necessarily efficiency at the trading protocol level uh but you know how accessible it is um access on its own is is the barrier yeah and and so i think that like you know web three or nfts erc20 tokens there are two different you know ways to represent value and ownership both really valuable and you know we're really excited about you know over this next year uh transitioning from just building protocols to you know building protocols but also building the interfaces the developer facing interfaces the user-facing interfaces um and more to make it more accessible to more people so so maybe i guess beyond nft marketplace integration what else is uh is cooking i i think you know i can't there's only so much alpha i can look at at once but what i'll say is that like um you know we do want to just continue to press on uh well one thing cool about nfts is that i think that there's a lot of room for like right now they're viewed as erc20 tokens and fts are like two very different ecosystems people view it there's like we are having like right now this is more of like a defy thing and you know earlier this week we had the nft thing um but i think that it's all building towards like a shared future and a shared internet of ownership and so i think that's something we're really excited about is starting to try to bring the two things together uh as well as like implement more of a i think the same way that the internet is that a protocol and a product argument or just a product side of it a protocol product all of it but um i think that you know uh just like the internet like web 3 is going to be very social it's going to be very community based uh it's not the lines aren't going to be erc20 and nft it's going to be you know it's the communities are going to need both um and so you know figuring out the ways to make it both of them more accessible in unified experiences is something that's really exciting to us can't wait to uh try this out this is going to be fun for a a world that's ready for this how do you kind of think about the future of scalability carl wait for a world that's ready for just a lot more social behaviors and a unification and just access how do we think about l2 is evolving oh i mean how is he gonna transact you need the base layer to scale okay we okay i mean i'll just go i'll just say okay future here here without question ethereum layer twos we will scale in fact we will scale to a point where we can support as much demand as we can support with literal hardware right so horizontal scalability making sure that like the cost of a transaction is not proportional to the you know this massive amount of demand for this single you know the the single chain but instead the cost of a transaction at least for cheap transactions that are not related to like you know arbitraging a really volatile asset right that's always going to be expensive but for your average you know game for your average you know even just a social interaction that needs to be dirt cheap that needs to cost essentially the the cost of the bare metal and so we are building out that experience but that does not mean that we need to fracture our you know ecosystem into a lot of different separate chains and networks and all that kind of stuff as hayden was saying we need to have a consistent experience a unified experience an intuitive experience and that unified intuitive experience needs to be supported on the back end and the infrastructure just like we have front ends that are unified we also need our back ends to be expressible enough expressive enough so that it can support it and so that you know that's what we're building we're building this it's going to be crazy the amount of transactions that are going to go on in life on optimism that is absolutely great thank you not chilling if i do it for him and he does it for me oh yeah the test really is it must always be able to run unit swap in any form because the test becomes can he run unit swap in any form in any shape in any size yes and and then you have passed the l2 bottleneck tell us more about bedrock oh oh yeah okay so bedrock what does it invoke it evokes a foundation what is bedrock bedrock is the foundational roll-up client for literally all l2s and by the way i'm not just talking about like optimistic rollups i'm talking it'll be in the future zk robs all the kinds of roll-ups as long as they are evm equivalent bedrock is that foundation so what is bedrock really okay death is what runs the evm again gonna get to get a little technical here to make geth run in layer two we were able to get the lines of code down to 400 lines of code that means that you can look at the diff and you can say okay i know geth runs in production this is these are the changes that need to be made to get geth running in layer two boom i understand what layer 2 is doing i understand the protocol making it simple and approachable why did we do this you might ask why great question [Laughter] because geo came up and he was like yo your code is way too complicated there are way too many lines you need to cut this down by 10x for it to be even remotely ready for a full production life-changing world-changing protocol and so what we did is we spent the next seven hours sharpening our axes and we chopped those lines of code down to that 400 number and it has been a goliath task but it will now serve as the basis the bedrock of an enormous amount of innovation in the layer 2 space you can now understand what layer 2 is really doing and hack on it so take a look read the code it's one commit it's crazy that is crazy and and i've read that and it blows my mind that you can do that and it sparks such a massive change it's shocking that like when you look at a very small line like diff how much more work that took like it's like you want every line of code to take hours addition by subtraction addition through subtraction wow my god we're making the iphone of death clients well is there is there something both of you disagree on either of you do you disagree on anything amongst each other whether it's a principle or approach or a direction very open-ended yeah i'd say carl i don't want to say he's more optimistic than me i think i'm like reasonably optimistic and i am a big believer i think he wins that game by default being optimistic but i think um sometimes it's kind of abstract and opaque i think we agree on a lot of things but um i think sometimes we disagree about like the inevitability of things i think sometimes carl is like well it's inevitable that all these huge forces will move together to like this end result um they're sort of like past independence of like societal forces um and i'd say that like for me i feel like things are a little bit more path dependent um like you know like individual kind of not saying that like yeah but um uh i don't know that's kind of a weird abstract answer no we we do we disagree but agree you know like we're like you know yeah but i will say that i am obsessed and i am obsessed with thinking from first principles thinking about like math using that to inform my decisions and that is why i you know i feel like over confidence sometimes but nah i'm not over i'm just in the right amount but i feel overconfident in like making insane bets like i'm like retroactive public goods funding vitalik said retroactive public goods funding to me and like explained it and i was like that is it and i am like in insane i'm mad everything is retroactive public goods funny it's just like a pursuit tell us more about what that is how and why is that set up and uh and your role in that great question well retroactive public goods funding it's really the it's in the the name the idea is that you retroactively reward public goods but what does that do right you're retroactively rewarding public goods well what it does is in the long term it means that people who are building public goods know that they can get retroactively rewarded why do we want this well we want impact to equal profit right now there's a big problem in in in and this is actually what hayden was alluding to earlier with the formation of uniswap and the formation of uh from the transformation from plasma group to optimism is that ethereum back in the day did not have sufficient public goods funding sources if you wanted to make ethereum better that would not that impact would not result in profit and that's a problem in ethereum but it's also a huge problem in our society generally when you think of profit you think of exploitation you think of extractive behavior that is bad news that is going to lead us down these pessimistic paths so we need to make sure that positive impact results in profit and so retroactive public goods funding is the long-term way that we can actually make it so that people know if i have that positive impact i will be able to get rewarded through these mechanisms through public goods funding channels and make that thing pop and uh there's been a couple attempts by the optimism side tell us more about what's happened and and how it was structured yes indeed so we have done our retroactive public goods funding round one that was a million dollars it was a few quite a few months ago we are now going to do the second iteration of retroactive public goods funding and it is going to be way more legit we are improving the quadratic voting mechanism we are making the interfaces really really quite nice and we are going to be using it as the launching of the citizens house in a very small form so what is the citizens house optimism the optimism collective the you know governance system for optimism the layer two has two houses one tokens two citizens we need identity solutions so we are allowing the citizens those are the people who will be directing these retroactive public goods funding because we don't want our public goods we don't want those to be judged by token holders that's that's like a plutocracy we don't want the people who have the money to say where the public what the public goods are right that doesn't make sense we want the human beings the individuals to direct those funds so retroactive public goods funding and the citizens house is coming soon so for what it's worth we have seen some of these like retroactive public goods funding um forces in action um no an example is that like a lot of d5 protocols are seen as you know uh public good infrastructure um and you know what happened with the uni token launch was that airdrops is a variation of that yeah yeah everyone who had ever used the protocol in the early days who added a huge amount of value and helped you know get the thing off the ground um you know was rewarded when that when the token launched and it was you know and then since then what has happened people have started more people have started using d5 protocols earlier speculating that they'll be rewarded and so that's essentially you know uh kind of a hint of what retroactive public good funding looks like but then what they're talking about is like making it more explicit and having actual funds that that go out and find whoever is doing the most public good and just paying them money for for nothing i know this opens up a slightly bigger can of worms but how do you sort of subjectively assess the impact because a lot of things are in that category that is the ultimate question is it is incredibly hard if we can assess the impact in some well we can't do it objectively that is just fundamentally in like an impossibility result because impact is fundamentally subjective based on your goals your preferences however what we can do is we can start equipping every human being with stronger forms of identity so their voices can be heard the big problem right now with assessing impact is determining who actually is what people's preferences are what individuals preferences are and we have this horrible problem where we don't even know who is a human on the internet so how are we going to there's no way we have no hope of assessing impact until we give people a voice and so that is step one so does that mean you have to solve civil resistance before we get to solve retroactive funding yeah civil resistance is something that is not going to be so it's not like we rather improve than yes we need to create civil resistant mechanisms before we can start to judge impact and hayden you have a thing about that what's that you have a solution for the problem for civil resistance or potentially with civil.org oh that that um yeah i'd say that that's very loosely at solution it is correct it's more of a way to people to link twitter identity to ethereum addresses so i don't know if i want to show that as as a true solve um for what it's worth i don't know if you need to fully solve civil resistance like you know two things you disagree on yeah there you go um i mean i think that like again it's like not all that it's not extremes in one way or the other like you know like you could also just have some funding you know you could have protocols vote on them you can tear up the yeah the the amount i guess yeah or you could do your best you could yolo your best right like you you know you know the uniswap initial feat here point three percent it was a yolo it worked well enough for unison v1 and i think you could kind of yolo out a a public good fund that would improve things versus not having it um and maybe it doesn't go all the way to the like we've solved all of society's problems but it's like you know a step and to be clear we are not going to solve civil resistance before retroactive public goods funding round number two so we had a few weeks yeah exactly 36 hours to hack yeah not happening but the more as the interesting thing is that this is actually something that kind of solves itself it is an emergent property of everyone using systems building better identity systems every single little impact counts and by the way we cannot solve civil resistance until we solve privacy preserving civil resistance because we are not trying to create some surveillance state carl talks about retroactive public goods funding the way he used to talk about ethereum in 2015. and that's the alpha now um unit swap also has a grants program tell us more more about the units swap grants program um yeah the uniswap grants program is awesome and there are there are multiple people here who are working on it um so you know i i'd say that like decentralized governance is pretty hard um that's that's a general you know thing that the theorem community understands at this point um and you know there's different like levels of speed and cadence um and i think that one you know fairly effective thing is having a more slow system that like allocates out to faster systems and so you know unit swap governance has like infrequent governance proposals um but you know you can have infrequent high-impact governance proposals and then you could have those governance proposals fund other things that fund other things that are much faster and higher impact and the uniswap grants program is you know in my mind one of the most successful uh you know governance proposals in all of ethereum today uh because it's funded 122 different projects um and multiple teams that have been probably on par with the foundation now i think yeah wild yeah um you know uh it's it's pretty wild and you know unit swap started out as a grand t of the ethereum foundation um and you know ken who runs unisoft grants uh was on the along with you was on the grant committee at the ethereum foundation uh that got us off his initial grant um but yeah i mean ken and other people working at the the um at utah grand have really you know funded uh tons of projects all around the world that you know have led to other companies and and events and hackathons and you know there was even like the unicode was a hackathon fund by um grants and then there was like three or four that you were involved with uh then there were like three or four other projects that were uh created there that are now you know real companies that have raised rounds that's incredible i don't think i knew this either yeah so it's like it's you kind of you can underestimate the impact but this was one governance vote one proposal and it's impacted you know probably tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people around the world careers measurable impact just income and just more things that are also intangible that just kind of came from that that one decision so yeah you're right yeah exactly um so yeah i don't know i i think that like uh hard to underestimate how important um right the ethereum foundation grant you know spawning units like it's hard to you know understand how important uh public goods grants are and i'll add to that we as heath global also received a grant that started everything youth global started off with uh with 80 000 dollars from the ethereum foundation and then here we are 80 000 well spent exactly thank you all right i want to close off with that with one last question um there's a lot of i mean there's over a thousand developers here that are looking to get into what three and start their careers uh some are looking to get better at just what their development some are looking to start companies some are looking to understand what's going on so they can think about moving over if you were to start now as a developer what would you recommend or advice you would give or resources you recommend or what would you tell them to kind of stay involved in the space and either can you go first and uh and yeah there you go it's a tough one it is a tough one and i'm not gonna lie i gave some of my advice already i mean i was thinking when i was stay optimistic right of course of course but i'll say a different thing i'll just say a couple one do what you love that's what that's what hayden said right this is it's really the amount of energy that you can get from doing something that you really want and you really want to see it happen is incredible and also make sure that you are doing things for the right reasons i do think i have i am an optimist i do think that in the long term if you work on just slow incremental progress trying to get to something that is actually valuable focusing on impact what goes around comes around people will start to notice your friends will start to notice you can bring your friends up also spread the love because everything is a community effort we need to work together and support each other because this is i mean we're all in it we're all in this experience together um yeah i guess what i would say is you know one like you never know what's gonna happen i think me and carl we were over there talking right before this and like we were kind of like holy these past few years have been really insane um and i don't think either of us really expected it to play out the way it did or for us to be in the positions that we're in um and i think that it was like a combination of just like interest and passion but also like luck and serendipity and like things kind of like you know unexpected don't forget their hard work hard work for sure um but i guess like again you know it maybe it speaks to the the being optimistic thing but like you know like you don't really know how things are going to play out and so i think that the most important thing is like coming in with like genuine intentions and and like working you know to working towards something that that is genuine that you believe in and you know maybe maybe we'll you know you never really know what's going to happen i think experimentation over anything else probably leads to more creative outcomes with that aiden carl thank you so much for being here and we really appreciate you joining us [Applause] and with that the last set of notes are please pace yourself and enjoy the rest of this hackathon happy hacking everybody we'll see you on sunday so [Music] [Music] [Music] you
