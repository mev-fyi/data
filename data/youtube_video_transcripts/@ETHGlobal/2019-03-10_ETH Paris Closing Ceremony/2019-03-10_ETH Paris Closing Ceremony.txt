third century 10 minutes very good that's right oh yeah I said um there's one wow later is it okay okay really good afternoon okay right now okay William is not here next to me thank you we will try for sure okay that's it um right now doing it but we can plug it in there yeah oh yeah where's oh it's flickers there yeah okay I like it no I like it I like it um it's mirrored sir everyone hands up if Paris hands up hands up awesome so bonjour come on how's everyone so I don't know if you noticed but my um Co MC is different he's changing Paris changes you it really does that's for sure um so power um not Paris Boris um is on his way to Canada uh to go spend some Canadian dollars and so um he's basically um so we have Denison here hello everyone today there he is Boris version 2.0 Boris 2.0 that's right so uh Denison is a developer Advocate at Zeppelin and he's going to be you know my co-master of Ceremonies for uh for today um so let's get started first of all has everybody had a wonderful time yes best one of the year so far okay excellent so just going through um a few stats um what we did with uh Boris dense Focus um so what we did with Boris is we read one bit e one bit you you know keep it Dynamic yeah all right cool so do you want to start y'all start so Eve Paris this year we want to announce that we had 350 plus attendees which is a great stat right that is really pretty fantastic I think we should be excited pumped about this all of you here very cool and um we're still at 42 our new two at the ethereum space which again is is my favorite stat in this uh in the stack if anyone out there is new to ethereum can you raise your hand for a second just so we can see you yes and did you like this was this helpful for you let's get you started feeling ethereum oh yeah oh yeah awesome so following on that we had 29 workshops and talks late into the night I saw a lot of you there as well that club mate really yeah that's what you need it right yeah it worked its magic uh and we had 44 hacks submitted yes that is me that's you guys made possible by very very well done very well done um and so here are our four finalists can we do a drum roll I mean so we have TX flow Zippo cleaned up and Pyromania okay cool I'm looking forward to that one if you guys can line up or sort of over here right so get ready to basically present what we're gonna do is um go through the demos um in this order so be ready once you see um the team go off then be ready to to come on but we'll we'll announce it but we also must mention the awesome runners-up there have been so many um great great projects that we we had to um mention these guys you've been amazing so we're just gonna go through them real quick uh GPU snarks 40x Improvement on snark proof generation using gpus which is pretty amazing round Applause Fiat friends accepting crypto payments from Friends using popular P2P cash apps ZK Dao Anonymous voting and a dow using Aztec zero knowledge proofs I just saw that one on Twitter too very cool [Applause] averaging CK snarks yes I was like QR token cryptographically protected QR code powered token airdrops everyone loves airdrops free money free money that was that was a uh tongue twister right there yeah uh d4rm decentralized forms for decentralized projects pretty cool very cool awesome so uh what we will do now is call uh TX flow the stage [Applause] well done what is happening oh no it's fine it's fine we're good okay okay no there were or oh okay got it all right foreign one two one two can you guys hear me did you have a good hackathon [Music] okay so basically we made something called transaction flow or as we call it TX flow and what this gives is ethereum developers an ability to trace a whole execution path of a particular transaction and this is really important because we're building more and more complex contracts both logic wise and both state wise and if I'm developing a contract I want to see if I handle all the edge cases if the stage transitions are good and everything else but better than telling you let me show you how this works so on the left I have a local node running and on the right I can do make setup and this will just do a normal truffle migrate which will deploy three contracts to my local node and do a test transaction now I'm going to copy the transaction hash and while truffle is finishing up and just give it a sec it's almost there it's almost there yeah I'm gonna do it okay so basically let's say there was a transaction that went wrong but it didn't revert there wasn't the required that broke there's was nothing just the stages was incorrect how can I take back this so basically I just start the app go to localhost paste the hash wait for it to load and we can see the full call stack of the whole transaction and we can see it instantly mapped to the code and now I can actually see what happened here so I can see this was the entry point for example but I can also see input variables so if you can see here we can see I actually incrementing between calls and even more important if we go down here we can see cross-contract calls if you see it when I move so we have here controller store and it's called bank and underneath we can see that there was actually a two one address so I can actually debug the whole transaction itself so that's basically what we built you can try it out both on devpost and on GitHub there's also a video of me doing this so thank you guys [Applause] yes okay we need Zippo up here Zippo thank you TX flow hi everyone so essentially what we try to do with Zippo is bring the usual experience that we have while doing a web development uh to solidity development and in order to do that we had to take care of the State uh and we had a couple of uh ideas on how to do that the first one was trying to inject the state directly on level DB uh basically by looking at how Gat interacts with level dbn trying to in a similar way uh just interact with it but then we thought why don't we build something that is actually not only gonna fix our problem it's also going to allow everyone in the future to build better development tools so we actually introduced a new opcode for development that would be also available just of while the development flag is available and then we could basically just backlink the state of a new contract that is deployed to the old one and one case of that would be if I had a big gap and I have a mistake in one of the contracts oh yeah sorry uh basically I had a mistake in one of the contracts if I wanted to change just a couple of lines of that contract I would have to redeploy everything every contract that is in my project which is very bad especially when we have doubts right now that that are growing in size and uh that development experience is just not there for for us so what we did actually is we just replaced this uh state of that contract because again I want to continue working on it I want to be able just to change the line and keep working on the same state I don't want to have the state reset and have to go uh to the initial flow and do everything backwards I want to just be able to continue working on it as I have that experience in right those are like radics and and so on so basically we built a hotter [Music] foreign or for solidity instead of uh yeah and he is showing you here that yeah please yeah so what I basically did here is I created a factory contract that's uh using Create two method but uh once I compile it I change the FB byte that is a byte code of create two to uh one of my to a new uh byte to a new OP code that I put on F6 which is basically uh taking uh removing salt from create two and taking in an address so what we're doing is we're just replacing the byte code uh so we have the same state but with the new bytecode and that that is really helpful for debugging and stuff like that also what we can do from the from here is uh take uh some contract that's on public test net or even on mainnet and just inject it in our local environment so yeah if you want to do a custom integration and with some contract that's on testnet and you need a state from a test net you can just inject it really easily yeah so so basically just to wrap up basically you download the CLI uh you just set up the project path we look at the changes of your file and we just speak with our server that then speaks with get and then do all the rest you basically just run the CLI with the project band and everything else is done for you this is just a nice way of the what he showed before is just a nice way of showing that to you right now but you don't have to use our UI there it's just a still I use Python and you have the states are replaced in the background thanks sort of clean nap can come on up come on down thank you that is our first time on I got owns yes that was really nice thank you to all of us for the perfect time it was pretty really and we can start what is it batteries it's crypto it's crypto in so yeah I think how much hours do you sleep this night 0.0 okay minus three it's uh you didn't sleep for this night and the night before yes no we expect to spend some time in Paris you're ready okay Mike jokes around it okay I hope the demo works with that laptop okay so uh this looks better um okay so we're cleans app because we are cleaning the blockchain and cleaning the blockchain industry uh the idea is that probably many of you have the problem that you have a lot of tokens that you don't really need like maybe you had a lot of air drops or maybe you participate in some icos but now all these tokens are really nothing yeah who yeah so there are there are some people here and so what do you do with them so one of the things is a kind of radical solution that you can just burn them you know and kind of let them go with a bang so the idea here is that um on this app you can burn tokens and make some statements like publish statements so here's some people like tweeted things uh it's it's you know it's early oh there you go that was another tweet so he doesn't know what he's doing but anyway uh but uh ultimately this is a crypto economic mechanic where to back a statement on this platform you actually have to burn the token so basically you're attaching to some text that you post here a claim that this token is worthless basically and there are a few use cases for that for one is is so let's say that you participated in a scam like you you were scammed so you can burn it and you can write here it was a scam and like screw them or maybe it was something else you know like you can write something like I liked it but it didn't fly or maybe something like the regulator came for us now we have to burn all of it yeah and these are cases for like when you have very few tokens but in other use cases maybe if you're a founder or you're you're part of the team and you actually have a lot of the tokens so what you can do is is burn let's say 80 of the tokens or all of the tokens because you're shutting down the project and in the system it will give you a longer text that you can attach to that mask to to that act uh and you can basically write a you know full-fledged postmortem so we did this this kind of business model it didn't work because of this the regulator came for us so now I'm burning out all the tokens and like this is the final statement that we're attaching to this token that is non-existent so the idea is that this kind of like semantic like composing of information can really help the industry and you know if we if we really have some kind of you know website or depth in this case where we have a list of everything that we try to do and why it didn't work that could be helpful but you can also just burn talking because you just want to burn talk um yeah you can you can basically Express Yourself um what I want to say next yeah all right so I guess I'm gonna give them my tool okay uh thanks uh yeah uh so uh as you might have seen uh there uh the solution is completely decentralized like we have all the logic on the blockchain ethereum smart contract uh these all things are the event logs uh and so we just cache them and show it here so uh the front end is is a static web page since we want to keep that application decentralized and uh but that means that you can almost store your front end anywhere you can carry you can store it anywhere for example uh right now it is swarm uh it can be scale it can be if you like the centralization of the speed uh you can host your own website on the Amazon even though you know but I'm not fond of it but if you are then go for it so yeah and uh actually we you know uh we did I didn't know that we would win so I haven't prepared the speech for that okay yeah okay I'll try to help a bit yeah I'm not sure if it's right here but these tokens they should be sorted by the percentage of all tokens burned like top one should be like ten percent five percent three percent zero nothing percent and so on so if these imagine and the comments here could be some comments but they will load later and it's warm so it's okay by the way uh so yeah so for example if imagine it become popular for some reason and I just want to be on top and then I just go create new completely new empty erc20 contract added to the system and just burn all the tokens so I'm On Top to prevent this we are using Oracle to actually check if there are enough transactions on this smart contract we have set the limit of one one thousand so at least you need to create one one thousand transactions and we've tried both chain link and The Rock lights and they both um kinda difficult to use and quite expensive I'll call that yep so that's why we use Hercules too yeah and nice thing about this project is that actually like this percentage percentage we can just count it like balance of these smart contract divided by total Supply and if there is like community of people who hate this project and they burn their tokens like it's large amount you can actually use it like a decentralized Oracle that this token is kinda don't like it so it becomes some sort of Oracle I'm sorry okay I don't know thank you and I want to say thanks to our partners to Peter from the next team who uh maybe you yeah so just a quick thing our friends for buyer talking are actually giving you a solution on how to burn tokens so imagine that when you press the burn you're actually going to what they will tell you about right now and on that note pyromania are you ready for some kind of Fire magic I don't hear you [Applause] as I say the previous uh speaker we also have a project about burning something yeah thank you guys okay so now let's uh the gaming is end now we start to burn on mainnet the real tokens so on yeah so we start with these guys from one idea that like idea from era of Romanticism is end like Ico blah blah blah unicorns that now we get realistic and we realize is in with the fear we expected of a time of s2o yeah okay so uh we built a big crypto economic uh value to that token that still uh uh trading on some the XX and so on and we get your ability to like buy some tokens and burn them all right now on mainnet that's what we do now on demo and then that's uh very interesting from uh site that we clean up ethereum and clean up the storage so we can buy all these tokens and burn them and make get sync quite easy and faster for the future so it's really value and we get the Pyro tokens that has a value we and you can send it for example for a charity or somewhere and they get liquidity and moon math under the hood that eager uh put to their smart contracts so now we will burn uh all the cat tokens now and here's the slots how many slots we released in the main net so ethereum make cleaner let's burn them all okay at Laos let's go and some magic will happens as soon in transaction minus so wait a bit and we will see what happens now so I get these pyro tokens that has volume I will can send it to uh giveth or everywhere would accept this coins and eager how long does it takes did you get the gas price for I spent fast faster okay 10 seconds yeah about some details about our project uh if you haven't any uh tokens to burn you can buy it on an integrated exchange we choose to one is a zero X and bancor also we hosted our project in two ways one ways is a centralized uh the first way is you can find our project already the internet is uh by paramaniac.io and also you can find static files of our uh of our application in scale shared storage yeah so now let's go to the Moon math eager can you just brief explain what this happens why it's worth something uh we have no orgos here uh we uh uh determine uh talking price by pre-market and economy uh so um the price of turkey depends from square square root of golden grade of Tolkien so if somebody wants to build talking more uh the the bond will be cheaper that's why uh um we reach balance for each pairs of our pyro token and vulnerable token that's all so only you can kill it with the fire come and burn them all always thank you do any details feel free to find us and we will ask you and provide more details thank you thank you with Apple watch features okay okay I got my Clicker okay so thank you all the fine lists can we give them another round of uh Applause that was amazing great Showmanship as well great showman I was impressed I was impressed so what we're going to do now is go through the winners of the main sponsors so I would like to call up first new Cipher McLean who is your winner everybody uh news Cipher's winner is claim it um they basically built an identity management and claim tool so basically their idea is to use new Cipher potentially to share uh identity information claim information that is private with other people so I don't know if they are somewhere here but they are our winners whoo Thank you new Cipher thank you up next the scale prize giving it on over to Chadwick Chadwick strange skill Labs uh we have five uh five winners for our 500 euro award so they are collective ethique Pyromania cleaned up and nanti all right our grand prize for a thousand Euros goes to IO [Applause] have zero X and Remco all right um so I saw wonderful entries first prize goes to go mummy for doing an ens Market on Xerox second prize goes to 12 months for doing a loan collateralize with Estonian cars wow [Applause] thank you that's pretty amazing that is amazing straight up amazing okay next we have Ave and stani from Ave stani hey stani here from Ave uh our prize goes to collateralized it's 25 eater so basically it's a interest rate swaps between maker dollar cdps and Atlant The decentralized Landing platform so basically cdps has race in their War make a raised uh the interest rate to three and a half percent so basically in Netherland we have fixed uh interest rate and and basically collateralize allows to programmatically refinance the loan which is good for maker because then there's less cdps and there's the pick and good for us because there's liquidity so thank you for collateralized thank you oven next up Finance Tech thank you so the finance trust wallet prize goes to project uh called universally upgradable identity proxy right so it's a proxy contract that there's a delegate contract on top of on-chain multi-sake wallets awesome thank you thank you very cool thank you next up is chain link Rory hi guys I'm Rory from chain link uh we had a lot of great teams participate we ended up giving two prizes first prize was 1 000 USD worth of Link tokens and the second prize was 500 worth of Link tokens first place is uh nanti who created a Dap allowing someone to issue corporate Bonds in this case on Quorum uh and to use them as collateral for instant payment channels all right so about a trillion dollar industry next we have uh Second Place who is cleaned up and they did the of course uh proof of burn Twitter which you saw up here and also utilized chain link for their Oracle solution so thank you again to all those teams that built on us hope to see you guys next year thank you Rory next stop doubstack Natalia so we had three winners uh one was the French Dao and they created a they basically built a liquid democracy framework on Dao stack to empower French citizens and then we also had Firestarter and they were Community Driven crowdsourcing platform and also like very similar to daiko and then we have also OG which generators generates a Marco roof of having used a certain address in a certain block hash that can then be used as you know the proof for probably Dao voters moving forward um so that's it thank you Natalia next up we have ethereum Foundation Alex and Kim hi everybody uh we had announced some prizes for scaling blockchains since your knowledge proofs and the price of one thousand dollars goes to X rollup for their work on layer 2 solution for scaling and also for they work on the tutorial which everybody can use to understand better how it works and to build their own zero knowledge applications and the price of 500 goes to GPU snarks for the work on fundamental infrastructure and we're looking forward to these projects and uh we'll be following the development oh GPS GPU snarks is an implementation of uh part of the snark prover on gpus which makes it much faster than in doing on CPUs and potentially also much cheaper thanks thank you Alex next up we have ens and Brantley there he is thank you we had uh five prizes of 200 each they went to go Mommy which uh created a registrar which would wrap your domain in an nft um for a Marketplace was really great Universal login which reduced gas for 80 percent for that ens identity solution was great Fiat friends that was mentioned earlier they have a fully working venmo to ethereum bridge which I thought was really cool working on mainnet they sent me a dollar so I was bribed a little bit to choose them it was very smart and then Pyromania and cleaned up Pyromania used it for upgradeability uh of their contracts and cleaned app uh made it so you could uh accessible on Swarm with an ens domain that was all great thank you very much oh and uh to claim your prize you have to have an ens domain all those uh projects uh so that's how we're gonna send it to you so get that ready [Applause] thank you Brantley next up finally we have our weave thanks hi yeah so our winner was claim it who used uh the awwwee's Perma web to store the web application that goes with the DAP that they built it's really nice clean use of always Perma whip yeah thanks oh awesome awesome so now obviously we all know that none of this none of it would be possible without our amazing sponsors so yeah I want you to get your palms ready because there's going to be a hell of a lot of clapping we need to do right okay so first off we have scale and new Cipher thank you very much thank you guys next up we have addicts Quorum and binance whoo we have Ave Dao stack chain link near ens CRX polka dot airweave oh my God brace yourself okay you're gonna have to do my one uh provable 1kx infuro parody bounties Network UNICEF pleasure fluence ethereum Foundation asset 42. yes good clapping good clapping everyone and because we're chatting about 42 I think we can all agree this is an amazing venue um we've had some wonderful times it's a great space they've got great art on the walls yeah I've taken so many photos right who is Instagram stuff for your and up there you go Jacob everyone so many people yeah this location guys has been amazing we really want to thank thank the location for hosting us hosting everyone here uh it just wouldn't be possible without it also allowing us to eat and drink outside of the auditorium thank you 42. Jazz together for 42. I wish I went to school here by the way I know I now regret regret all of the school oh well so next stop we're gonna get cardiac up here who's gonna tell you a few things about uh the prices of a little bit about East Global and without further Ado put your hands together thank you everybody uh this is kartik from youth Global I wanted to take a few minutes and just kind of talk about sort of all that effort and work that put it got put into this uh to kind of make this event happen um and I kind of wanted to start off by making a quick comment on sort of judging and sort of our judges um that we had 20 judges um this morning that kind of looked at about 44 projects and they did all the hard work and I'm glad that they did it because I saw them struggle on what what should be kind of the top team or the top two of the finalists and we saw a lot of back and forth on sort of how do we think about sort of what that looks like so I'll kind of quickly comment on on sort of that process and then but before that I want to actually thank everybody from the judges side that to me at this happen so Sunny afrey Danielle uh Jack Scott Ashley Martin Patrick Peter Dean Griff Simona t-ball Sean Simon Evan Austin Jack and uh and lastly please I want to thank you for all the time and work you put into judging and really appreciate you kind of giving feedback I'm encouraging the projects to work more um from from the judging side the way we do judging for all these events is we kind of paralyze uh the the groups and we randomly shuffle all the submissions and they go to our projects um and when we kind of do that format um it kind of is for two reasons the first one is uh we don't want to structure this as a competition where there's like objective scoring mechanism to kind of determine who's like the best team or the best project and as a and also the secondary reason is this is how we can actually get people to um just kind of get encouraged to build more um the the downside in some cases is that you obviously see a lot of Trends in different uh uh different kind of venues and events because a lot of this is based on kind of what's interesting at a given time so we kind of see some kind of interesting themes and today we kind of saw about anything from Burn to a lot of debugging in-depth tools it was a really common thing on top of kind of zero knowledge proofs being super important so um kind of we wanted to just kind of say like this is from that process standpoint like something we're gonna actually think more about and kind of see how we can actually Shuffle that and add more rounds in the future but I'm super happy to kind of see all these amazing projects like I submitted over the period of the last 36 hours it's actually really impressive that all these things kind of were just done and just started on Friday night so I'm really happy to see that so once again thanks all the judges and the teams that made this possible um on top of that um a lot of people that I want to thank in the process of making the whole weekend possible starting with Scott patina Jerome Megan Ben Claire Emmanuel Lewis Ling Eric and Ariel um they were our kind of volunteers as well as uh the the people relied on for a lot of the logistics and and making sure that event happens uh in Paris before the global team came in and they put in so much work and an effort and I really want to show our appreciation to all of them for making this possible and of course our amazing MCS Simona Boris and Denison that kind of kept all of us entertained and and I know a lot of us are tired including myself but it's really great to hear the loud collapse and all your excitement um today so thanks again to our amazing MCs and lastly the East Global team uh there's six of us on the global side and um and only for uh there's I'm not including myself I didn't do a lot of work to be honest um but um you might have seen a lot of us running around making sure things happen on time anywhere from uh kind of panicking about some last minute scheduling changes to ordering 40 pizzas on a 30 minute notice let's say on on Saturday night hypothetically speaking but um so I really want to thank Andrew and Heather from our team that kind of had a lot of the the logistical and sort of the the day-to-day venue stuff for all of our events and then Jacob from from our sponsorship team and Josh Liam uh from the kind of all the other operational style we do anywhere from sponsorship to to making sure judging happens on time to our marketing and social media um and and it's the team that kind of puts all their time in an effort to make these events possible for everybody um they they deserve that recognition I want to make sure that we kind of point that out it's a really big hand of Applause for for these Global team so lastly we saw four projects come in um and kind of present on on stage um and essentially I want to talk about what that actually means uh you might have said seen me kind of talk about this thing before which is these Global events are not uh competitive from the nature of we don't want them to be a competition the way we kind of structure this is that they are sort of a way for us to surface interesting and kind of cool projects that are done over the weekend um and as a result there's no notion of first second third we kind of call our finalists the winners themselves uh and this this weekend we have four winners um and uh sort of what the prizes that we're actually going to give uh twelve hundred dollars per team uh in eighth uh to all the four finalists uh and and this is kind of on on top from all the sponsor prize that have kind of been given out um and and as a result like the four projects that did come on stage are our winners for for this weekend so this is what you guys win and we'll kind of follow up um with how we distribute the prizes uh after after this weekend oh and and lastly um this is uh just like every other Global Closing Ceremony this would not be a good closing unless we kind of talk about what's coming next uh so I wanted to take 30 more seconds to talk about sort of the next events we're doing the first one is actually going to be eat Cape Town which is on April 19th to the 21st uh we've kind of talked about this thing for the past few months so if you're interested in attending Cape Town you can still go to eatcaptetown.com and kind of check out and look at the applications and then lastly the one after that is going to be one of our biggest events of the year which is East New York uh happening in May so this will be right in the middle of the consensus week where we will ideally going to promote the build um assertive mindset here again and uh if you're interested in learning more about eat New York uh we're actually announcing all the stuff uh soon so go to eat global.co and kind of sign up on the mailing list and when we do open up applications as well as sort of more information about the events in the venue we'll kind of send an email to everybody who signed up so New York is the next one after Cape Town and hopefully we'll see a lot of you uh in in these two events and then kind of finally I want to basically uh call up rmc's again for some closing remarks and I'm really looking forward to seeing all of you for uh in the future events and I really want to thank everybody for spending your weekend with us working on kind of stuff that excites you um and and kind of helping build this community thank you so much thank you Curtis thank you cardig everybody so I think this is it I think I think we're we're gonna part way soon which is awesome and finally no hold on what is this oh yeah um let's celebrate time to party so everything is happening in the food and beverage room that you are all accustomed to by now there are free drinks and snacks that you can eat and drink um if you have a song to play Drop suggestions in music on Discord so go back to Discord you're all stomping ground yeah and that's it guys thank you so much thank you everyone until the sponsors locations the hackers everyone everyone thank you it's been Eve Ferris try to be Boris you know I don't know it's very tough so that one there is no description [Music] as well okay no worries oh it looks like a photo yeah that's what I did in the beginning because I knew yeah so now I should send that to us whoa thank you for a great congratulations yeah thank you all right so I would like to talk about you about the global organization yes so I did one year ago in Moscow so I'm from Russia we did the biggest and I believe it's one of the best yes okay um [Music] so I would like to say that I am pretty excited yes so I ordered a bunch of hackathons like only five like two Denver hackathons [Music] when I came to like like in Moscow in Kazan in Russia give us our first black price
