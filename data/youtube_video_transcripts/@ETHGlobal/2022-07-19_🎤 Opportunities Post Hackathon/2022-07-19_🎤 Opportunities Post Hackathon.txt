[Applause] [Music] cool um jacob if you don't mind i'll just kind of dive right into the next session and and talk a little bit about um the builders program and of ipfs and filecoin which we kind of implicitly and talked about um for you know the last bit um where you know alec and karen already shared their journey through an accelerator and so let me just and you know share my screen here and and talk about some of those post-hackathon opportunities not in the context of a you know casual conversation but a little bit more structured and so once again i kind of and luke was kind of talking about it already and the ecosystem and that's growing around ipfs and tricoin is is growing and it's our strongest asset in um you know growing this five-point network and and web3 in general we have and with the figure network and on the one side a rapidly expanding um site of storage capacity of the network so and today we have over 4 000 storage providers all across the globe and they're providing um 18 million terabytes of um storage capacity which is an insane amount and you know and widely exceeds our expectations from when we john launched the mainnet about a year and a half ago and it's also 18 million terabytes is about one percent of total cloud storage capacity so that's that's really cool to see and it's still them growing at a very fast rate and then on the other hand and we have this increasing demand for all of that storage capacity and from an explosively growing ecosystem and there are now over it's actually over 450 i think startups and elastic this summer so i gotta update the slide and startups that are in this ecosystem and you just heard from three of them and that are operating in the space and are and building great um products and services and and there's a combined total of over 9 000 developers and who are contributing to 500 ipfs and various other technologies that are kind of adjacent or built on top of it um on github and outlier ventures in you see it in the tweet and found that you know as with that firecoin while not as large as ethereum as luke already pointed out and is still one of the most actively developed blockchain protocols and we're not seeing that slowdown um despite kind of the macro trend in the market and so with these 330 startups and 9000 developers like what how how do we ensure and and that is my role right so i co-lead the bidders program and for ipfs and firecoin and where our mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of builders and really help them make the internet more decentralized robust and secure with the types of services that they build and there's a couple of things and that we do to kind of make that happen one of them is hackathons right and you're at um one of our you know major events of the year and there will be lots of people watching what you're building and we do now around or we're part of um you know around five hackathons per month and and just in the first half of this year we've touched over 30 000 people via our events and and we've received since last year in april over 2300 submissions to um to you know all the various hackathons and and that represents around you know 7 000 builders since the inception of the program and we're aiming to keep growing that number and i hope that many of you will submit a project at the end of this hackathon and but then you know once again that's not the end of it right so hackathons is really just the first step and we want to celebrate the builders that submit project and and we we are here to support the next steps right so um yes i try to kind of put this on the slide here how how that journey might look like for some of you and so you might join the hack fs and project then we have a grants program and i'll double click into that in a second and then you heard from um karen and alec and about the accelerator program one of which is the tachyon one and and then after that you may go on to you know secure some seed investments from venture capital funds um across the globe and just like two stories you heard from two of them um on the panel or three with books and filming and there's many others right so i know there's in our current acceleration cohort we have over 20 teams and that started in a hackathon and and here's just like two anecdotes on the slide so secured finance which raised four million dollars in in the summer of last year actually started at heck fs in summer 2020 so similar to alex story um and then we have another um team that just joined the in the first quarter of this year the accelerator program with tech stars and and they you know they started in a hackathon in november and then applied for a grant in december and and kind of took it from there and even if company building is not for you right and we talked about some of those big challenges that come along with it and there's a lot of opportunities for folks who want to drop out of building their own company maybe temporarily would put it on halt and to you know explore in the ecosystem for jobs and and other career opportunities and if at some point you want to come back in that's totally impossible so all the programs are obviously open to projects that are coming from an eq are have been incubated elsewhere and let me maybe double click into the grants program just for a second and so this is really designed for all sorts of people i'll highlight a few so one is you know foundations that want to move this space forward maybe a company that's looking to accelerate the development of some features um and um or a developer team that's that's itching to hack on on firecoin tools and ipfs tools and after a hackathon maybe and we have two types of programs that we do there we have what's called the next step grand and that's um pretty much open for all and hackathon um you know submissions and and winners in in particular and that just gives them a little bit of additional funding and resources with no expectations and apart from you know keep building and and you know building out your project and then we have an open grants and category with with different other kinds of formats where you get once again financial support but then also technical and expertise um to that can flank your development and really help you and just in the first or in the last quarters the second quarter of 2022 we approved over 150 grand applications and about 50 of those are stemming from hackathons so and i was super happy to see that because it really shows that this you know idea that we can help people progress and with their projects through the different stages and and and kind of tailor the kind of support that we provide and by seeing that that much attraction for the program and then the other thing that i want to highlight is that acceleration program and we actually have several running um every year and and they're you know these programs are designed for dedicated founders that are looking for that mentorship and that from people all around the space and you had gabriel's name mentioned and but there's a few other people and and here's just a few on on the slide here but juan bene who started protocol labs and um you know originally and conceived of ipfs and firecoin and and molly who does um product at protocollabs and andrew who and is the co-founder of textile and tablelands which is um one of the projects that ruke mentioned so lots of great people here to learn from and and that can support you and we're doing these um with uh these acceleration programs with different partners and the one that's opening for applications soon is actually an outlier ventures um and um yeah but the others are also here right so long hash we have one with the india blockchain accelerator um alliance faber and you know the one that we talked about a lot during the conversation earlier with tachyon that's that will also likely renew and so lots of opportunities here and if you want to learn more about them reach out to myself and directly or go and to our website and hackathon.5.0 and there's a section on post technical opportunities where you can double click into some of these um and learn more about kind of the things that are open to you with that um i'll i'll stop talking and hand the mic and back over to jacob to introduce the next speaker thanks so much
