okay it looks like we are good livestreams Oh awesome awesome cool alright great so let's kick this off so first of all thanks everybody for coming out to this we're doing an AMA with one of the founders of one of our sponsors unstoppable domains you know obviously unstoppable is supporting us in an hack of us and you know we're really excited to be working with them and to have a site at the event so you know we're gonna dive into probably a bunch of topics here and just for everybody else the structure is gonna be you know we'll start off I'll start up some kind of early questions and after that we'll open it up to everybody so you know feel free to at that point just raise your hand or otherwise just indicate in the chat I do have a question we can just do direct questions so so let it be cool so so yes so maybe you maybe will just start this off you know Brad thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us excited to have you here you know maybe I think a great place to start with just each having a little bit about you know maybe you know where you started kind of maybe from like an educational point of view and then you know kind of like what you studied and what why that interested you and then maybe some of the first things or early things that you worked on in your career before unstoppable sure sure and thanks for having me uh so I'm from Atlanta I went to college very very near my house I went to Emory actually spent very little time on my campus I spent most of my time hanging out at Georgia Tech because that's where all the founders were people at Emory would just go to medical school or go get a law degree or something like that whereas all my all my friends including Matt who's who's our CEO at unstoppable he and I our high school friends knew he was Georgia Tech so I wound up hanging out with more much more over there for that reason I studied I may be sort of an unusual background for startups in general but I studied international politics and corruption particularly like authoritarian regimes around the world and political conflict and problems associated one of the kind of key themes I guess in that arena was you know issues with resource resource rich countries so there's this idea called rentier state thesis which basically says that if you have a bunch of valuable stuff on the ground randomly in your country then it means your country is less likely to have democracy because the government doesn't need the people's will in order to have control so there's a bunch of oil on the ground a bunch of diamonds in the ground a bunch of cocaine to grow whatever it is that like leads you away from democracy so I studied politics even went to DC for a few months for grad school dropped out determined that that was kind of the wrong path and that I should you know there's really no change happening there and that I should I should I should go and focus on startups so I did real estate related companies first before before moving to San Francisco and working on a marketing software company called talkable which is like enterprise software company that's all that's all pre crypto although I was spending a lot of time playing around crypto at night well awesome yeah and I think you mentioned it but it you know you've been friends with with Matt who's the CTO for you know since high school I mean could you maybe speak to a kind of I know you guys have worked on many many things together over the years I'm just kind of like I think you just mentioned maybe talkable maybe I've been do a little bit of hope you know what are you working on there and then maybe you know it's a good segue kind of leading into how you both sort of started getting into crypto and kind of where your thoughts went on there yeah yeah so so mad night both moved out to San Francisco to work on our cable which is a company that another one of our friends from from Georgia Tech founded and Azamat wasn't a product i was the head of sales and then eventually I became CEO so we were you know uprising in similar similar similar roles here where you know I'm kind of running the business side of things and Matt's running the product side of things so we've done that sort of done that sort of mode together previously which is pretty cool in terms of crypto so I don't I I mean that's gonna have to tell his crypto discovery story I don't know exactly where it was that he first read about it although he is the one who got me into it and this was early 2013 we were living both we were living in the Michigan actually in this this hacker house in San Francisco called xx mission where I believe the second Bitcoin exchange in the US was launched out of our basement Tradehill and Vitalik was coming and giving talks in our courtyard before etherium launched so there's this was sort of a hub matt was going to a lot of the early Bitcoin meetups and so we were just kind of hanging out with talking to enthusiasts you know starting I guess back in early 2013 and we're just kind of following along in the background playing around at night and then Matt decided to kind of go go full-time crypto in 2016 and started started going down the road that eventually eventually led to estoppel awesome I feel like all good stories start with a mission hacker has at some point it's definitely a popular theme I think this is a big one too it was 40 people 40 people at one time so a lot of a lot of crypto folks have cycled through there at some point or another either gone to parties there I live there or whatever awesome very cool and yeah I mean like when we first started kind of thinking about unstoppable or maybe otherwise like you know thinking about products in the crypto space like did you have kind of any ideas before you end up settling on unstoppable like what were you thinking about what was kind of like the main bits that excited you about it yes I think the the kind of the the there was a couple of pieces to it I mean one piece was you know I guess you know our group we were not you know protocol developers you know we were you know following along with what aetherium was doing but definitely were focused on trying to make stuff easy to use really focused on the user experience piece and that's kind of how we you know eventually it came to - domain names was that you know there were these networks that existed and functioned and were amazing cerium ipfs others and yet there was really no very limited usage of them at least for you know you know really you know really important use cases we're really not happening yet and you know we saw the problem there as the user experience problem and then the solution ultimately was naming but the solution wasn't you know immediately apparent the first the first thing that we kind of focused in on or I should say that Matt and and Braden are our co-founder or focused in on was hey these networks are super hard do you use what do we do about that and that was the that was kind of the germ and so Brighton and Matt were hiking on some ideas and then and then came to hey naming would solve this absolutely yeah do you want to maybe talk a little bit about you know it specifically like what that core functionality that naming functionally kind of like enables and you know why it was such a kind of like such a great way to start unstoppable as a company basically yeah well so there's a couple things I mean one is is just that it's very hard I mean just like you know what DNS did for IP addresses you know it was very hard for the web to take off if there wasn't some you know easy mapping to something that humans could remember and understand and so you know prior to DNS you know it would have been pretty difficult for websites to get popular you to copy and paste a random string of numbers and hope that people would you know somehow have something to do with that that seems pretty difficult and then I think in the in the on the crypto side of things you have this extra complexity because you're trying to tie in all these different networks to you know so the domain name can tie you know 50 different block chains together in a sense where you can be pointing your domain name to addresses across you know any number of block chains that people might be using for for payments on top of that also all these decentralized storage networks so you have this problem of all these different protocols that are all being used right now and no easy way to tie them together and domain names solve this problem another thing the domain names do is that they are financialized so it's not just about them being this identifier it's about them also being this asset and this concept has been you know well built in Internet you know one point you know with DNS where domain names are this you know prized asset fifty billion dollar plus asset class digital asset already so it's kind of like you know perfect for a blockchain if you think about a giant digital asset a giant digital asset class that's sitting around on centralized servers you know queue crypto to step into this market so it also seemed inevitable and because this domain name form factor was already understood by the world it actually is easier than maybe some other crypto products to talk about you know like even if you don't really understand block chains or you don't really understand crypto yet you probably do understand domain names so it like it doesn't require the initial germ of understanding doesn't require the crypto background in the same way that so I found personally when I was first reading and learning about crypto like I actually needed to study money and I didn't understand money before crypto you know in a deeper sense I didn't understand you know how do you know things like you know broad money calculations that tell you like how like how valuable is the US dollar what's the market cap of the US dollar never thought about a question like that before crypto so I actually had to do this gigantic deep study into the nature and history of money before I could even get my head around crypto I don't think the same is true for decentralized domain name yes you need to understand decentralization but in some way is the the parallels are actually simpler super long answer but that's good I think it's definitely true that it's interesting when you're building I think software for crypto you know you're essentially building software inside of an economy that pre-exists so you kind of need to be able to think deeply about you know what are what are the different considerations are on price and like how people could utilize whatever you're creating you know even if something as simple as an EV T could be used as collateral for a loan at some point someday right and you don't really get control over that so it's good to know these things and then I think also maybe another kind of longer form question but I think any found we could talk about um what were some of like the early day decisions that you know you've looked back on now that has been I think almost about 2 years or so that were you know either you know really good early decisions you made I know you know a lot of people on this call and watching this later are likely going to be kind of starting their first companies out of hack FS and in what they build here so I think it's always good to know you know what were some of those early decisions that ended up being paying dividends down the road and and what were some of those that may have been mistakes or otherwise just like not the right prioritization so I guess the one thing you know one thing that we decided early on that I think was really important was we decided to build our own registries as kind of the core part of our you know the core part of our stack the reason why that was so important is because it enabled us to control and build all these different pieces on top in just the way that we saw fit so it was the thing that kind of unlocked the broader market tools and so when we first started we talked about how you know we were building a domain registry and this was going to simplify your crypto payments that was a very narrow focus and I guess you could say there was something that was a little bit off there that we were focused narrowly on crypto payments whereas we realized later that it's really more about the decentralized web holistically and the decentralized web has payments in it but that's just got a one feature of the decentralized web not kind of the core feature of our product what we were trying to do but so building these registries wound up being this core this core piece because it got you know it allowed us to build a community around what we were doing so we have the registries we have a community that supports the registries that's excited about them that wants to build on top of them and that kind of allowed us to go and build a user base on top we have a whole bunch of different tools that we're building you know there's we have a registrar like our own version of GoDaddy that's a big piece and then we also have web tools that allow you to build like you know build a blog on ipfs and launch on ipfs without being technical things like that so those pieces registry registrar and web tools all three together are what the company is building but we needed this registry piece and that was an early decision that was maybe not not immediately not immediately obvious so that was that's that's probably the biggest one to call out I guess I should still say like very specifically what things what things were we're not as good I think this narrow focus on payments early on was not as good and also just kind of led people to nod to kind of maybe miss the bigger picture point the bigger picture point is a decentralized internet a decentralized internet requires you know on the regular internet you can you know you can pay you can view content and you can communicate and the decentralized web will have all those components to just self sovereign not one of those you need all you need all of them in order to have a decentralized internet so that's that was a later realization got to and and I guess you know kind of really nice segue I think to some of the new stuff that you've just kind of recently announced and obviously it's also a hackathon prize for people that are building on top of it you know so you mentioned that you know you've built up this user base around the registry and and just recently you announced a decentralized chat which you know I think makes a very good use of that of that community that you've built up so far maybe chat a little bit about about the kind of unstoppable chat and what you guys have been working on and maybe what led to to building up this piece of software and and what excites you of it yeah and so you know communication is a core part of the Internet we launched decentralized chat protocol called D chat it's the first of many decentralized chat protocols you know we think there probably will be and should be many and that's good the core principles of a decentralized chat protocol we believe should be the user controls their messages they're encrypted they're stored on peer-to-peer storage the domain name is the user name so that it's easy for us to communicate and find people but also so that the user name is self sovereign and this is super important right now if you use signal or whatever they use your phone number for identity messages are stored on their servers so if they were to get hacked if they were to get shut down if they were to ban you you would have no more access to your chats and they're not portable if you move chat to a protocol you get the opportunity for users to have shared inboxes so we launched unstoppable chat is the first app on top of that protocol but other apps are going to be launched as well on it and each time I go to one of these apps I get a shared inbox my messages are the same my contacts are the same and it's all encrypted stored by the user it's a completely different structure right how messaging should work this seems super timely given what's going on in the world the earn IT Act being proposed in the States essentially would force companies to monitor the communications on their platform and therefore they might need to put a backdoor to their encryption in order to follow the small if the user controls the chats this is not this is not relevant anymore so this is actually a protection against some of the encroachment that is happening by governments around the world on to tech platforms and basically what's happening is is the structures wrong companies control the data because companies control the data governments want to regulate the companies for what they're doing with the data want to get access to the data etc if the user controls the data all of this goes away and so it's it's it's critical at this moment in history that we make this shift to decentralized systems otherwise I don't think it's going to be super good for us us I mean humans I don't think I don't think that the outlook for the world is rosy if we continue to allow this type of corporate control over us and I think it's it's getting worse quite quickly so that's why that's why we thought it was important in terms of the hackathon so we have a hackathon prize for building out a decentralized chat protocol on ipfs so for those of you who are interested please check out our channels please participate this is a huge opportunity the ipfs community will I think go wild when we have a great functioning chat protocol I think there's just you know thousands tens of thousands of users ready to play around with your technology so it's a great opportunity to get something out there oh cool yeah and I'm gonna start filtering some of the questions from the chat and then open it up afterwards but you know I guess the question is you know for the future of unstoppable chat like are you guys interested in kind of this is a question from Josh like you know pointing to include like audio or videos or images and that sort of stuff and then maybe back our hitchhiking on that is also like what does the planet look like for unstoppable in the next five years in the next 10 years you know what are you guys excited to bring the market you know how are you thinking about this yeah so I think you know we definitely want all aspects of communication should be should should be able to function on ipfs in the decentralized web so all of the above yes I don't think we're gonna be the ones to build all of it unstoppable chat is sort of a an example app for the market yes our users are using it but you know we think there's gonna be you know dozens of apps you know we think wallets are gonna start supporting things like chat taps are gonna start supporting things like chat these features browsers like these are gonna be tools that it's just a plugin so it's going to be you know something that apps of all different types are going to start using so I don't think it's gonna rely so much you know on just what we're building in terms of what we're building generally though and we want to be the easiest way for people to on board to the decentralized what so right now you know the decentralized web has you know 20,000 50,000 users maybe tops something like that and that number needs to be you know 5 billion and so that is the process that we're going through which is make it easy provide more tools like right now if you want to go and build a website on the decentralized web your tooling is very limited so we're we're trying to be over the course of five years is that that's not the case you know Shopify has thousands of tools tens of thousands of tools for you to use in order to build out great applications on the Internet that's what we're missing and that's that's what we're trying to go okay and then maybe one last question from from me and then from the YouTube audience and then we'll move on to questions directly here you know specifically related to that you know we chatted about the early days you know the kind of idea came from improving the user experience of using crypto and then you tied it up kind of having you full fledge of tools like how does unstoppable balance between you know decentralization and like having everything be fully in the hands of the user versus like user experience and adoption and onboarding that sort of thing really relevant question for anybody who's really billing any any tap they want mainstream user sees yeah well I think you need to make sure that your security model is really sound that's kind of the first thing so you know I think all of this stuff only works because the technology is self capacity because the domain names are ear see 721 tokens stored by the user because all updates are made only by the user you know by signing a message with your private key the whole reason why any of this stuff works is because we're relying on the security of the etherion blockchain and so I think you need to make sure that that security model is central to whatever you're building first after that you're just trying to figure out as many ways as possible to make it to make the clunkiness that is now inevitable because of what I because of point number one as not clunky as possible and so one of the things that we did early on is we have a transaction processor that enables you to that allows us to pay fees for users transactions so and the reason this is important is is that if not you need to have five cents in your wall at every single time you want to do something and if that's the case then you're not gonna do a lot of stuff and you're gonna have a whole bunch of users they're gonna be like oh crap I don't hear him in my wallet okay now I need to go transfer okay now now I need to wait five minutes now imma do something else so that's not the way to get users to use the tech so that's a that's a solution it doesn't compromise on security but it does improve the user experience so that's that's one that's that's one example of a strategy I think this is really the good maybe one more so one other one is we have a pool of users who were not familiar with common etherium wallets I know this seems crazy to this audience and we've all been using meta masks and others for four years probably but that's actually not the majority of crypto users the majority of crypto users have not used meta masks have not used aetherium products the majority of crypto users are not you know core aetherium folks the community is way bigger than that and so you know we want people to be using to be sending any crypto you know using domain names we want people from any community crypto or non crypto to be using the decentralized web now it's mostly a crypto first but all of that has all of that has led us to do things like we created a option for you to have email accounts so if you're not ready to claim your domain name you can create an email account and get a domain and then you can claim it later seems like a small thing that helped conversion a lot because some people aren't ready to learn how to handle their aetherium private key yet and so they have they have they have other options now you should always claim your domain as soon as possible you want to take custody of your assets as it as possible that's the safest thing but that can be two steps now so those are a couple of examples I would say this is probably the most important thing to think about if you're gonna be launching a crypto project how do you reduce as many points of friction and this isn't even crypto specific it's just the crypto is hard to use so there's a lot of a lot of opportunities but like this is your job constantly finding more ways to get the product into the hands or mouths or whatever of your customers and you really want to just like shove it in there you don't want to say to your customer hey go figure this out you want to say how do I make it incrementally easier every single day to make it so more and more people can adopt because your first thousand your first hundred people they'll probably deal with whatever whatever kind of your friends they're true believers whatever they'll deal with anything so the first hundred thousand users are going to be very very different than the next 10,000 years the next thousand users every single time you want to get one of these further away circles to onboard to your product it's gonna need to be even easier so it's a it's a constant journey towards a user experience that's actually ready for you know the whole world yeah completely agree and like you mentioned it's the same thing you know whether you're building a choice piece of software and traditional web to order even what to be world Brite so yeah I always be thinking about how you can iterate and maybe test and invalidate and everything right so awesome very helpful advice cool I think what we'll do here is I'll turn it over to some of the people in the chat I'm just going through questions in order here you know Josh I think you're up here first with a few of your questions you know if you'd like you can unmute and show you a video as well just ask these questions directly that works for you can you be fine yes yep so add a few questions so is in stoppable domains the sole admin for Wednesday top-level domains so admin is maybe a term we would need to define the the idea behind a blockchain domain registry is that you wouldn't need an admin so you know you meant domains and then the user controls them forever you don't need to rely on what the registry does ever again these are here C 721 tokens that are just in your control we don't have any subscriptions so there's no policy to be set longer-term so I think the best way to sort of sidestep the issue of admin is to remove any needed ongoing relationship between the registry provider in the end-user so are there any other top-level domains planned for the future that are gonna be similar uh not at this time we're really focused on the web tools we think that you know we have two registries we think the biggest problem right now is the ecosystem of tools to use so that's really where you know the next few years that's really where we need to be focused so no no no immediate plans it's all web tools what if so we have top-level domains in web 2 and they're managed by you know the IAEA I can or whatever those organizations are what would happen or are you worried about if they approved at dot crypto or a dot Zil we're not worried we've had a lot of conversations with you know with with folks and those organizations and you know broadly speaking they don't see their role as this the very activist activist type role they're really trying to be kind of like a community good preventing collisions and so previously the way to prevent collisions was to ensure this like bidding process around you know around the main name so you wouldn't have multiple browsers and other parties wouldn't have to decide who the resolve which is the right one now what's happening is it's possible to launch on alternative technology and get support from browsers like for example we have a browser that resolves that crypto natively and so they now will have an interest in not having people collide with us because we're the system this will alive with browsers so it's actually bad now for browsers and for the internet community to have those those those those things happen so being in being a sort of you know conservative organization that is trying to protect internet users is I think makes us pretty aligned so no I don't see any issue but I think that in general with the decentralized web the gatekeepers here really are the the browsers and the web tools they decide and I think they're gonna continue to expand their editorial power in this way over time in that it's not about any one central servers that say like this is the official DNS record it's about what the community believes should be supported it should be resolved so it really comes down to the to the browser's it's kind of a you know it's it's a different way to look at this at this at this market but I think we're already seeing we're already seeing this this develop in general I think we're seeing a lot of interest from the traditional web world in the decentralized web I think maybe the crypto community would be a little surprised by how philosophically aligned they actually are they thought this was the Internet they were building in the first place they thought they were building a peer-to-peer Internet in the 90s and they thought that they were building a you know a system that was gonna be controlled by the world and not controlled by corporates and it kind of slipped away from everybody and so the problem when you're talking to the traditional web community is not you know is is a decentralized web good its are you guys really gonna make it this time people have been promising us this for like 20 years like there was this alternate there was this alternate system there was tor there was this there was that there were so many different people that have come to us with this story and so we're a little jaded that's the response you get not this is bad and so now we're just having to prove hey like you know like aetherium and ipfs like these tools are they're up to the task and this is the conversation that we were having so we just we launched the chat protocol out of Mozilla's mozilla has this incubator called fix the internet and they're not very ideological about which that works are going to do it but they're basically like the Internet's broken we heard that some of you decentralized web people might be about to fix it so we want to amplify so we're seeing all these really good signals it's really just skepticism about whether or not these networks are actually ready for primetime and that's what we're trying to do and I think that's what this you know this activist community is trying to do more generally is make the decentralized web ready for primetime in which case I think we're going to see a lot of support from the traditional web community once we once we can achieve that cool thanks thanks so yeah I mean that's you know part of the reason why we're running this event honestly is this that you know we think it's a really good time there's a lot of great technologies that are kind of you know finally ready for for market launch and really you know can be critical pieces of the infrastructure at four dozen new decentralized web also Thomas you you had a really good push from the chat I'm not sure if you're able to unmute and show your video there it goes yeah so I so interesting you were talking about people 25 years ago thinking we were gonna change the world though it's definitely one of those people definitely got burned very good I'm just interested like I totally understand and agree with user encrypt you know user owned user encrypted data but it seems to me the way that the Internet is broken today is that these companies own this data and then they're selling that data so what exactly are we going to be selling if it's not the users data this is a great question and I actually think this is the biggest question to answer for decentralized web tech more generally than the technical solutions now this may not be as fun of a conversation for folks to be having but this is proper the harder thing to solve for and I give you a few I don't have all the answers for sure but I can give you a few that we've already seen one is breakthrough browser brave browser browser pays you to watch ads that and and you don't they're not selling your data in the same way so we have already seen you know one of the you know first you know successful decentralized web companies brave building a browser already figure out a way to start to start monetizing their and using advertisers to do it so it doesn't mean that advertisers need to disappear in this new web model where users control the data it just means that the structure at the power the power power structure changes and the user presumably makes you know makes makes money there rather than just getting a free product so that's one thing we sell domains so we have a business model that is directly related to building out the decentralized web there's also web tools the Shopify model I think is really powerful so you know Shopify does get a cut of your revenue Shopify doesn't control your customers but they do sell you tools for you to build you know for you to build out web applications so that's another really big area where I think the biggest thing that I think people are gonna be the biggest thing that I think people believe about the traditional web that I don't think is true is that users won't pay for stuff and there's been this thesis going around in Silicon Valley that users need everything to be free ads and whatever and that's the that's the only way users are going to engage with products I don't think that's true I think that users are gonna pay for stuff I think they're gonna be happy to pay for stuff it's gonna it's gonna mean that those products are gonna need to be higher quality but that's good like a lot of the stuff that we've been using that are a lot of the tools that we've been using that our ad supporters they don't change that much you know as great as Facebook and Twitter and reddit and these other tools maybe like they're not evolving at a particularly fast rate they're not providing new YouTube they're not providing new and interesting user experiences at the rate that they should be and the reason why is because they're monopolies their data monopolies they don't have to be if there were 50 YouTube's they were all competing to the death trying to make the most awesome video app for users and we controlled our video and it was stored on ipfs and we permission these networks to be able to have access to show it then we're gonna get far better apps and maybe users are gonna pay for that maybe users are gonna pay the content creators directly and applications that drive that traffic will get a fee I think there's just so much money that's gonna flow around the world when you have a more digital economy then there's going to be no shortage of business opportunities so I think ads are a cancerous business model the way that they're structured not the best business model and they've led three companies essentially to take although to take all all of the revenue take a little cut on top off the top of the Internet and that's gonna go away and that's gonna expand the market I don't think it's going to shrink it thank you throw you back to I'm sort of kidding a little bit but three back to 1990 that's exactly what everyone was saying back then I know and that's the and that's the whole point is that this is that it didn't work out this this last time but now we now we have these tools like cryptography that might help I hope and I think that when you can provide decent experiences like you may not be able to provide Facebook level experiences but we need to provide decent experiences that are self sovereign that's gonna be a competitor that's going to change the landscape it's not gonna allow these data monopolies to be able to steamroll the entire the entire world and forced them to use an app where they control everything because you'll have a slightly more awkward maybe self sovereign version over here and that's going to create the competitive the competitive drive that's going to make it possible for those to be the mainstream platforms in the future so I think once you have self sovereign options that are decent it's going to be way harder for these centralized options to be able to fight longer term and this is like a 20 year fight like it's gonna take a long time to knock YouTube and Facebook off of their data monopolies but I think it's important I think it's actually critical that we do this you know as humans I don't know if you all have been seeing this lately but YouTube is now showing me the taluk eath giveaway scam ads I don't know I don't know how they're not gonna wind up being legally responsible for people losing that losing money I mean it's it's it's disgusting that this is happening so I think the system is just so so broken you know that there's gonna be an army of people trying to take the market away from them because we need it we need to very good luck things Thanks that was a great discussion I love that and any other questions from the from the crowd we actually just recently our videos from you know content that we owned started being played in these giveaways scams leading to massive confusion so you know 100% agree that you know ownership of data is such a big deal here you just don't have control also you know maybe maybe we'll wrap up on I'm a nice kind of wrap up question you know kind of any advice that you have to you know this crowd of people that are listening kind of you know very likely at some point to be first-time founders if they're taking part in this event kind of any any kind of advice or feedback you have for you know somebody who's done this before in crypto especially I'm just put the audience yeah I'm gonna sound you know maybe I'm gonna sound a little unpopular here but you really got to think about your business model it's the thing that drives the direction of your product and the reason why this is important is because if you want to make real change you need to create a flywheel you need to build a product distribute a product and have the distribution of that product make it make it easier for you to build more product and that loop needs to be there and it needs to be there basically basically all along like that's what you're discovering during that first year or two out there in the wilderness where your friends are telling you how crazy you are and your family is embarrassed whenever and you and ask them what you're up to when you're in that phase so startup building and this totally happens and you should ignore all those people by the way as they're telling you that but during that phase what you're trying to figure out is how to build your flywheel and if you leave that part out and you just build awesome tech it's not gonna matter unfortunately because you don't have a way to sustain it you don't have a way because whatever you built it's not gonna be awesome enough next year you're gonna need to build more you're gonna have to keep building for years in order to actually make any kind of real change so you really need to figure out how is that going to work in such a way where when I when I build this awesome product it enables me to build more awesome product so I would solve that problem I would consider that your most urgent problem awesome great advice cool well you know I think I speak for everyone here thanks so much Brad for taking the time to chat with us and we're really excited like I mentioned the beginning have them stoppable as part of this event excited to see what people build on top of unstoppable chat and otherwise kind of what kind of funky crypto domains they come
