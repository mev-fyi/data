foreign [Music] to share what they've been working on with their new recent launch of how we can make account instructions a lot easier so please welcome Mama down stage [Applause] all right hello everyone how's everyone doing awesome awesome good to be here um thanks so much to the global team as well for for making this really amazing event um uh yeah hey everyone my name is Ahmed I'm one of the co-founders of by economy I'd love to quickly just talk to you guys a bit about what we're doing but also um just uh um a launch that that we would love to to share and announce with everyone um so I I can't reject the slides after vitalik sort of um gave a really interesting uh presentation about the history of account extraction um a couple of days ago and um I thought it was just really important just to sort of like reshare some of the things um that he talked about and what's really interesting is you know one of the the clear things was that we have seen some forms of account distraction before um in the past couple of years um and that's what you know by economy was essentially built on we um essentially built relays to enable gases transactions um and this essentially powered you know over 200 projects to enable a better experience for their users which essentially helped many applications and Enterprises that we worked with um and essentially this was our first form of account abstraction however um ethereum and L2 ux is still the nightmare right like gases transactions are great but it's still not there yet um and so more needs to be done and of course this is why um EIP or yes or erc437 um has you know come to the picture to essentially you know rethink how the ux should look like you know um just within like at the beginning of the transaction the onboarding life cycle of the user and so 437 is now you know something that is becoming a standard everyone knows about this um and I I don't really need to go into the details here um for us up by economy we've been working on account abstraction for I would say since 20 well yeah q1 of 2022 um so early um early last year and since April when we launched our SDK we've been sort of just trying to really bring as much adoption to to account obstruction as much as we can partnering with applications or wallets um and this is sort of you know some of the the stats on polygon where we sort of focus our initial efforts on um but account extraction you know has promised a lot more there's still so much more that can be done um the user Ops that we're seeing is not in the the millions or the tens of millions that we'd like to see and uh we want to see more programmability um and sort of when we sort of look at these um and I think in the last panel Eli discussed it very briefly about eoas and smart accounts um we are living in this evm world where all the users are right that's what all that we're seeing a lot of l2s people are using this and so when we look at this of course intersection and sort of the difference between how users could move over from EOS to small accounts we'd like to think of it as the move from you know a telephone to a natural smartphone right because for us it's it's sort of the clearest way we could sort of visualize it and see why people would want to move because you could program so many cool things and so for us the question is imagine if you could really you know add programmable plugins to your accounts like what are the new use cases you could enable what could you know what what could we see and essentially um you know every plugin that could be added to an account could be a new capability they could customize um they could be customized for any use case and it could be built really by by anyone in the community um and so for us the way we like to think about it is to simplify ethereum's ux um smart the smart account framework is like an iOS plugins and modules are like apps um and they essentially you know provide a great and Slick ux um so this is sort of in a way a form of a promised land that we'd like to that we are working towards um and this is why you know I'd like to announce our you know um V2 our truly modular smart accounts um which is live um right now and it'll be live in isdk in the next couple weeks and it's really built on these course on these three core pillars um it's modular from from the get-go it's as stateless as possible from the actual contract itself and it's programmable um and so developers could actually customize the user journey in any way they want and so this is we feel really important for the next wave of adoption I like to show like a quick demo um and this is with one type of plugin which which is session keys and that's the idea of essentially um not having the user to always you know sign every transaction they could give some authority to that so here's you know um what a gaming application would look like before account abstraction or before the by economy SDK so here the user is you know essentially choosing um the play in the game um selecting the race track selecting the car but for every interaction they have to keep signing and we actually support this we actually support adapt that works like this um on polygon they are using meta transactions essentially but literally all these transactions are um you always have to sign them and so this is definitely not not a ux that that um you know that that is um we feel this Prime for for what to adoption um and over here if we look at what the ux would look like with session Keys um the the user has to approve just once to enable the session um and sign only once and then when they start the game and go through the game for any on-chain interaction it's as simple as you know just moving through the app right these are this is what we're used to this is what web 2 users are used to as well um so it's just a very you know simple demonstration of what a plug-in which we just talked a bit about before how that could you know um Empower smart accounts even more and four and four users I don't want to spend too much time on this slide but this is essentially sort of um what our modular SDK looks like it's essentially bringing um what we like to call truly modular smart accounts um to ethereum and to to the broader L2 ecosystem um and for us the reason why we wanted to start with modularity and enable modularities because for the SDK itself we work with the ranger partners that maybe just want to use a Smart accounts layer and that's totally fine there are folks that just want to use their infra layer and that's totally fine as well and so modularity is really built into into the core um to to Really enable to to Really enable dapps and wallets to easily um have account abstraction capabilities right and and for us literally the goal is to increase the adoption of smart accounts because otherwise if there are no smart accounts how will we get to user Ops and this infra being built uh high level sort of you know use cases on what plugins and modules could look like these are some of the plugins that in a way we are launching with the launch of with our with the launch of our smart accounts so we're having pass keys and session Keys um live in the next couple weeks account recovery will is is still being built but we also know that the community will build different types of plugins they will essentially enable different ways that users could actually program the small accounts even more as well and so we will see you know module Marketplace a registry um and of course we've seen um we've seen the community also moving to a standard of the ip6900 to enable composability between different modules and different smart accounts as well so moving forward these are sort of the the buckets that we're really going to be focused on when it comes to the small accounts layer standardization is really important especially when it comes to these eips that we're seeing um I was just speaking to someone here about hooks they're a very powerful concept and it will enable way more features as well and security is really important as we all know when it comes to any form of smart account for users um security is always the of that most important um intense this is a sexy topic it's been in the past couple months um but we are seeing more use cases for how smart accounts could um be intent Centric which is um which is really cool um and right now our SDK actually supports a couple of mobile apps and we're seeing mobile app more mobile apps actually coming to Market and so really just enhancing that experience as well so we like to welcome all to the aerosmile accounts and we really feel that we're here to supercharge ethereums go X um thanks a lot for listening foreign
