it's been an incredible experience really unlike any conference I've ever been to I have worked on the institutional side of things for a while but this is not a conference this is a hackathon and really getting to meet the community is pretty special how do I feel about hackathons I like the spirit it's a little bit exhausting but uh it's fun we're always scared like I don't know enough I still think I don't know enough on the ecosystem so I would say come and just try it and don't be scared because you would probably know way more than you believe [Music] the energy here in Lisbon seems like people have a lot more blockchain knowledge and have a little more experience and so we have people coming in and asking us questions that seem like they're starting from like a higher level of learning which is also really cool to see as well Lisbon is interesting because there's a strong Community especially Builders and and people who are actually contributing actively into the space so I'm super excited to actually be here around everyone I moved here actually a couple months ago because everyone in crypto seemed to be either in Williamsburg or in Lisbon and the energy here is amazing especially at the event here everyone is working on something exciting [Music] best thing for first-time hackers is drink from the fire hose there's so much good information at hackathons be all in on learning be around people go see the sponsors go read the docs go to all the things because hackathons are one of the best ways you can possibly learn unfortunately in the last years we had so many projects without the bases without the ground walk needed and if they had just that little support just that little knowledge that they were missing I know every three ecosystems would be much much better than it is nowadays the most important thing is to build something for you to learn as much as possible you don't have to build the most amazing product of all time like do something crazy my favorite part is the building part for sure working with developers one-on-one getting them to think of new possibilities and new ideas you're a ux designer or a UI designer web free space needs a lot of your skills be confident on your team and try to make the best you can get something working submit it early refine it after that and then again you're here to have fun so just enjoy it sleep before you get here because you're probably not going to do a lot of that try to interact with as many of the teams at the booth whoever's present get familiar with people and just be ready to have three days of incredible fun foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I think ethereum is the only L1 platform that can basically onboard the whole world through l2s right and be like resilient enough and have enough research brain power to really carry like the whole world on blockchain so many people have been hacking for two days right or almost three days if that isn't a testament to like uh the excitement in web 3 so there's only more to do and I think it's only getting better and better [Music] I thought today was fantastic obviously I have nothing to compare it against but I just thought the quality of projects today were really really high they were solving some like really big problems just basically a clear presentation when you're doing the the demo and obviously showing what you build because that's the most interesting thing and explaining how the users can actually use it and what is the user flow as well my we're here this weekend with us and out of that 650 were hackers from 51 different countries and 30 of them were new to web3 trying something for the very first time in the space this is amazing congratulations to all of you you made it [Music] I really like the experience when you're sitting at a table at like 2 A.M everyone's trying to get something to work and then you just hear High ties going around that's really exciting just to be around that energy of people like yes we did it yeah at this hackathon I would say um like towards the end of last night like eight or nine PM I was starting to feel a little bit tired and I was running up against some walls and then around 1am everything was kind of falling into place I felt great you know I felt like super energized and I just kept pushing forward through the night and it all came together in the end [Applause] thank you [Music]
