foreign [Music] I have little before coming to this session just to Showcase like all of these features and only and you can like go and be going through one by one pool showcase like how you can use each one of them online so what's that it's just so paste that says what we have I'll not be doing a recording here but I'll be showcasing all of the ports that is important for you to understand and how you can like use that for your own Dev session so this is a quick nfcumentary where you can pass on your image and upload it to person and they'll pass on the name description and then make it on fpvm which is the EPL compatible chain and yeah you can use it and see it in the little box Explorer so yeah let's get into the code let's let's dive in like there's a couple of steps before I even go into the code let me take the boxes where you can check out like we have two type of SDK one is for node GX or node yet was a environment and another person browser one so I'll be showing you the browser mode where you can directly upload from your front and airpod and you can do it on the SDK the browser SDK has openlock steps that you have to follow which requires you to have in your server that will create temporary token with Towers I'll show you how you connect with data set on token and you can use that token to create a temporary token that will send to the frontal to test upload started and why we did that is basically to give it flexibility to upload the data type from the front end without exposing your tokens as soon as you can it also have like all the multi-chunking and uploads to make sure that your data are getting faster like the uploads are getting faster so for that I'll show you in like a quick a small exposure that this is just when you can find Richard can you can you zoom in some more on the on the on the text here because it's very small kind of large is it visible now we get another one one or two more yeah right yeah I think that's that's better thank you yeah that's great yeah that's great all right cool thanks for finding out yeah as I was saying we have like a small sap make the cellular single endpoint whatever you say from your print in as a bucket day will take there and then it will take that as a bucket name and you can like pass on this protocol I am using so we can just client which creates which creates using the token the Spokane is I have it in my environment variable as you can see we have an environment variable here which will provide me this run token and whenever you deploy this to any server you can actually dice the pause on using your requirement variables uh once you create the spline with the token and yeah before even I get into this let me show you how you gonna create be yes good for you to get started yeah let me okay so to create of your first token you have to come to your dashboard uh that is just run dashboard and in the dashboard you have this user setting and there is this token tag or token tab in this tab you as this create token where you can pass on like the name of the token say s we we um and then select web app type the scope can be any of your organization so I select this and the launched infects parasite so the scope is uh wherever whichever you organize it select will be the slope and whenever you upload anything it will be added as the usage in yours in that organization so once it is done you can click on Create and it will give you this token which will be soon for it to you for the first time and once you copy it in so it is the you have to save it somewhere in your local to make sure that it doesn't forgotten or something but you can delete them if you want to that's one thing once it is done let's get Flash to the code again we have the token now next thing is so create this upload token which is like a temporary token for your content and we created using this specific person create single upload token where we pass like the name and the protocol and it will create a specific token for you which you can send by the response here this is maintain it so we checks we will make a call the first call to the server and then we get this Json and then we get the Json download and then pause this upload upload function and this uploads functional requires it it is here like this is the browser upload package even or I actually from here let's see your answer on this slides that takes ideal class and also the topic to depth up let's type it and once upload is done you will get a series of series of responses with upload IDs and also Link ipfs Link the dynamic links and the deal details as well once the tea gets done and once that's it so what the NFP what we are doing is we are uploading the asset first that is the file say it will see this thing so once you click on this it will upload a file and just get uploaded using this link we create the metadata okay so we create this metadata as a cheats on and then we upload this again to our to our server for the start of this and once we get this we have this Json now we actually start the which is actually happening on fpvm and I'm kind of using this let me drag me sh so pretty good tool to interact with the contracts so I'm using that here so that's the right and mentor nft so that's the simple way I'll do a demo here test it and give it some description okay so let's open the console tab or you can see the network that's right by the way is that speakable I think it is right so when you I click on mint the First Column goes through and then get it so this is the First Column that we send to the API once the up against it okay yeah record this I'll get back to that so once this is done and you get the response with upload token we didn't start with the multi-chunk upload so how the upload is done it's finished and it gives me all this details like a site preview and all this images once it is done we upload the this thing or our metadata and when it is turned I got this thing and we are going to start interesting so with this I think we'll be getting here this it is happening on calibration so like since we know the hyperspace is going to be sensitive pretty small it would try to deploy calibration net and it's pretty it's getting pretty icy so we'll wait for it to turn and in the meantime I'll show you the next thing that is how you can deploy your so as well as the printing on set on so let's just do deployment server what's that let me look at this okay so our for you to deploy your server you need one thing that is going to talk outside so this is a standard Docker file that I swapped with chantubility and edit it here and after that you can just create a link let me do so I create a test build which will be this one so 1.1.2 build it like this and then what go my filter hub so let me open the doctor here it's a Public Image and we have like all in the backseat then load that's one and then once it is close to the balcony up we'll start the deployment so it starts with the climate let me start from here so I'll start with the new plaster well in select Docker Hub and then I'll name it in nft enter next is I need to apply the image just walk the discs instead and the tag here once I click on next I'll be asked to like select which where you want to choose and I'll change this one the small instance next I have replies on this load policy we can be selecting a random Port so this port will be assigned a random Port which you can get to access this server as well local environment variable copy paste my environment that's not basically me because next year's value make it a six bit rather it's gonna be exposed and just step by so once I click on this deploy it will start a deployment process or else and it will be deployed and like the links will be given to us so in this in the meantime we can start our deployment for the website like the printing so that also get started so I have this yeah this is my data and this guitar is also yes something so let's say it on the chat language so we need to be applying it as expecting I'll select turn again as a directory next is already prefilled this is this we need to prepare details our e and B tab which tells the API URL is this once it is done playing yeah so I'll start the deployment here in the meantime I'll show you our deployment on the server side is standard as well we have our requirement here expect some notes that's on low and also okay okay somehow I missed this step which is required for our uploading this so let me do this so and as it is happening I mean how it works and when you will so just to again show you what's happening is since I'm on a this Mac environment I need to make sure my open default platform is because most of the WhatsApp does providers systems are on Linux and it will not actually take one arm then PSN so that's going to give what's the errors so next meters it could be this documents in okay did it get deployed and meet down let me then walk this domain so we'll be attaching a domain on top of this deployment and let's show you how we are using that to me so that's it that deployed yeah that will see here we are getting some locks which is regarding like the babes the provider and they call this extra tanks that required so we get this connection URLs which is like the where you can actually hit and use the user server on top of that will be adding a domain yes so you need to add these values in your DNS configuration before but I have already done that so I'll just play it by and nowadays up and running so this is done and we have this is still building so I'll show you the older version which we already have that is this okay so this is our it is also on plankind so you can see it is all right access that we have the snake as well and in this you can actually make a head to the API which is so let's show you load on into and as you can see it is making a head to our demo API rector.cream which is this one so this is no yeah I get this one again do this we have it deployed here it's getting moment is happening so with this I think we we have I have shown you all of the from SDK where you can upload to filecoin ipfs then the compute value then that new deploy your service and then attach your domains sub domains and the next thing was your front-end deployment so since you have a printing we deployed it and we are using that to fit our front end and also impact fpvm dominant directly yeah I think if if you have any question you can join our Discord if you're facing each loan regarding any kind of like infrastructure or some kind of downtime of damage then fingers as well as you can check out our talks unique uh any kind of guidance regarding the SDK we have all the concern methods written here so you can check out the domain archival as well as like usage and token and we also have ipnx as well so if you want to use ipns with ipfs you can use that on our SDK so it's natively support appearance so I think that's it from inside I have any questions have to answer that as well fantastic thanks thanks a lot
