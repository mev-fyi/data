foreign [Music] hello everyone and welcome to the hack Fest Workshop Universal connectivity with lib P2P joining us today is David usby and prithi Shahi who will be taking us through this session and with that I'll pass it over to them to get the session started hello everybody Welcome to the workshop for learning how to use libpdp this is associated with the East Global hackerfest um hackathon so before I dive into this um I wanted to say something about the purpose of this workshop and in this presentation I'm here really just to try to excite you about using the P2P in your projects for the hackathon and Beyond and so what you'll see here is actually just a brief walkthrough of the current state of things for lib P2P and um give you the tools to get started quickly in your hackathon projects and then beyond the hackathon have a great starting point for um all of your your future work in and around Liberty to be um and I also want to extend a very warm invitation to all of you to join the lip P2P broader open source Community um after you're done with this hackathon um because we're always looking for more people who have other perspectives and interests in furthering lip P2P and making it better so with that welcome and thank you for showing up and giving us your attention so let's talk about what lib P2P is Right lit P2P as most of you already know is a peer-to-peer networking Library it's based around a single specification and has multiple implementations in different languages so why all the different languages there are two main reasons for this one of them is that we want to have lib P2P implementations in whichever language you are most comfortable working in we want to be present in every working environment including browsers servers workstations in applications written in go and JavaScript rust Nim C plus plus there's even a Java implementation right um and I think as of like a month ago there's even a zig implementation now so um the idea here is regardless of your language regardless of your execution environment we want to have a presence there for doing all of your lib PDP needs um the other reason is that with all of these different implementations we avoid sort of the single uh source of failure problem if there's a bug that arises in one implementation it is likely not present in the other implementations and this allows easily building heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks that are more resilient in nature simply because a single bug can't take down the entire network so also inside of live P2P there are a lot of low-level features like encryption authentication um pretty famous for having good hole punching getting through gnats and things like that all of this is in service of being able to build peer-to-peer networks that are immune largely immune to the chaos of the internet it doesn't matter where your peer node is or how it's connected to the internet it should be able to communicate effectively to all the other peers in the network in in your network um so in addition to all of that we also add high level features like dhts and gossiping mostly for peer Discovery and for doing Global State synchronization basically everything is in there in lib P2P that you need right uh I threw this slide in here because this is how lip P2P has always demonstrated what you know what options we have for connecting and all that kind of stuff um this is a very boring slide so we're not going to use that anymore um what we are going to do instead is demo connecting everything everywhere all at once I think some of you get the reference to this movie um very popular last year lib P2P we joke uh allows you to connect everything everywhere all at once so to demonstrate that the team at protocol labs and in the greater protocol Labs Network built this simple chat app because you know we all need another chat app there's just not enough of them out there but this is a very good and easy way to demonstrate uh the basic functionality of the P2P and to demonstrate it working on multiple languages in multiple execution environments as you'll see this demo includes browsers and non-browsers public or private and all using lip P2P my current situation right now I'm actually behind a Nat so I'm presenting this from the NAT and I'm in the clients I'm running locally here are all going to be netted um we are going to be talking to a server that has a publicly routable IP address is that it's a bootstrap node um but you'll see that this all works regardless of that network connection status um we're going to start off with a rust Pier it's currently running and uh it has a really pronounceable name I just call it lugum the this name here is actually derived from the the keys that are used um and so when you'll see it in the demo it'll be it'll come up as that right that's the name of that note um so to start off we have this node running this is our bootstrap node and I'm going to now run a go lip P2P CLE tool of the universal connectivity so I'm going to bounce over to my console here and you can see here that I'm telling it I'm going to run the GOP here and I'm telling it to connect to lugum right here's legumes name right here at the end and what we're going to see hopefully failed to connect to peer excellent live demo Gods please please spare me prithvi do you have any idea why I can't connect illusion is it running yes let me make sure it's running so go ahead and try again okay there yes we're up Okay cool so you can see over here in the peer list we're talking to mkwj lugum right and my note is listening on it on several different uh transports and you can see here that I'm actually netted right so this is my local um my local IP on my home network this really doesn't matter because we have ways of getting around it oh and look we're hacked already hello okay so this here is a go uh CLE tool of the universal connectivity app there's also a rust version of this as well um and I think maybe even a node.js but I'm not entirely sure I know that we have a rust one and a go one okay so this is all working so let's get back to the slides and to further build this network to show how versatile this is we're going to load up a browser application version of the universal connectivity app and it's written using Json PDP so I'm going to skip over to Chrome and I'm using Chrome because we tested this earlier on Firefox I think there's still a outstanding bug in Firefox but we did confirm that it works in in Chrome so let me load this up this is actually running on a local web server here on my on my system and it's trying to connect uh behind the screen behind the scenes and you can see here it did connect to lugum and let's see what else does it have several others so ayjsffr that is our go live P2P client that I was just running and it looks like we've got several others already jumping into the network so if we go over to chat all right everybody in the network say hello hello if you're hacking our Network go ahead and say hello well that's from the main recipe here nobody else huh there you go by 9N says hello that's cool as if we jump over to the go client see we've got more hellos welcome everybody welcome welcome okay so this allows me to skip ahead a little bit on the slide so I could have started up another browser which we can do right now actually we'll just do that start up another browser instance um and this should connect to illusion right which it did and then it should also establish connections to all the other nodes that it can see in the network including the browser one the other browser then if we go over to the other browser we can see it's connect it's uh this R5 AC so if we get back to the second one here go back to the second one uh there it is r5ac so now we have browser to browser connectivity um using the p2b so if we go into chat here yay browser browser all right back to the slides so what we've demonstrated so far is our rust the p2b server blue gym right and then I started the go client in the command line and I've established two browser instances that are also connected and they are all connected to each other um what we're doing now as I'm seeing everybody jumping in is I'm going to challenge you to go ahead and start playing with the browser one to see if we can get a bunch of them in there so how are we going to do that um everybody jump onto this URL Universal connectivity.versell.app okay I'm gonna dump it in the chat here that should get you a version of the universal connectivity app in your browser so let's see if we can do that over here yep and this one should also join as well there it is connected Deluge them great now if everybody else is doing it we should start seeing a whole bunch of peers jump in here then we are look at these all these P2P circuits over webrtc Direct and if we go over to the golden PP one we can see our list appears here excellent because it's growing this is our stress test cool oh yeah okay so the live demo gods have shined favorably upon us look at everybody cool welcome everybody all right that's basically it for the demo just wanted to demo that we can do this in all different environments different languages and um here is the link to the universal connectivity app that you can get from GitHub now if you don't know where to start and you're fairly new to lib P2P in this hackathon I highly recommend you clone this repo and take a look at it um the it it's just a basic getting it configured in whatever language it's a model repo sorry let me start over it's a model repo so the implementations for rust go and jswp are all in there um and it shows you how to use it in the browser shows you how to use it from rustland and also from go in the command line so this is probably going to be your fastest way to get going on this hackathon and um it's what we're almost familiar with all the the mentors and stuff so if you don't know where to start start here if you already started that doesn't matter you're okay you might still learn something from this and um so it's a good resource the connectivity.lib p2p.io is a great website it talks about all the different um transports and and features and things like that and in many cases there's links to the specification if you have any questions and then if you want to dive deep into the specs um there's a GitHub for specs uh let me get all the way back to the beginning here because I wanted to point out one last thing this was built by a huge team of uh people in the lib PDP Community these are all GitHub handles and some of these people are already mentors in the Discord channel for the hackathon so pretty uh is in there Chad is in there I know Marco's in there um I'm in there I think the discordian might be in there as well um so feel free to reach out to us any of us with questions we're kind of hovering in the Discord so if you get stuck on anything or have questions specifically about this to get going um yeah let us know on the Discord and now I'm going to open it up because we don't let's see how much time do we have just a couple minutes um yeah we got about 15 minutes so I'm gonna open it up to questions um you can ask in the chat and I'll read them or if you're brave enough feel free to I think you can turn your video your audio on and ask the questions if you're in Zoom I know this is being streamed out onto YouTube and being recorded on Zoom just so everybody knows let's see here do we have any questions anything in chat none well I mean if we don't have any questions I've got maybe a question that some people might help or might want to know like uh what are you what are y'all looking for in terms of uh uh project ideas or projects that you'd like to see built on top of Philip P2P that's a fantastic question um we had a couple ideation sessions uh last week and to look at you know to talk about uh ideas and and team formation um I have my ideas and I know that pretty may have some or discordia may have some as well anybody else have any ideas I feel feel free to jump in for me personally I think something that would be really good uh to work on is browser-based tools that work with web3 Technologies I mean this is part of a broader file coin and fvm hackathon so if you can make a browser-based tool that interacts with that that would be amazing there's a lot of work that needs to be done there and be fun to fun to play around with that um I know that there is one project that is by Doug Anderson that is toying around with implementing protocols in wasm and running a wasm VM on top of the PDP so that one might be really cool you could talk to Doug I think he's in the disc in the Discord right now if he needs any help um let me offer anybody else who has a team that's looking for help do they want to speak up and Pitch their idea here that's another thing we can spend the time doing or put it in chat if you don't want to say it out loud um because this is really about making this hackathon as successful as possible and there was a question in the chat as well yeah I had looked into gun before this can you compare and contrast the projects some so I can better grok I'm honestly unfamiliar with gun prithvi do you know anything about gun or anybody else in here uh I can't say I'm familiar with gun I would love to know what it gun DB okay so is it some sort of distributed uh database um you know we normally uh you know what we like to refer to it as like a toolkit that allows you to build the decentralized peer-to-peer networking layer of your application um so without knowing too much about gun you know I can't really contrast it that much um so it looks like Dave is showing the screen yeah it's okay I know nothing about gun but I mean if you read this here it looks like it's a set of tools Community run encrypted applications like open source Firebase or decentralized Dropbox so it must have some P2P stating yeah okay um it sounds to me like you could implement this using lip P2P and ipfs to be honest um I don't know exactly how much they have in way of like hole punching or multiple language implementations or support for different execution environments but um but yeah it looks I I can't compare and contrast I think what prithvi was saying is is very important though like lip P2P is a is a toolbox of lots of peer-to-peer uh capabilities um looks like you could replicate anything that's in here with with uh the P2P this looks like it's all written in JavaScript and typescript so this may actually limit it to node and or in the browser um which would be one of the notable differences between the P2P and gun cool um you know a language agnostic support and multiple implementation languages and basically helping you get the networking part of your application up and running and so what the universal connectivity app that Dave just showed us trying to uh demonstrate is that across languages like rust and go and JavaScript we have a wide variety of support for different transport protocols be they your bread and butter transfer protocols like TCP and quick or you know the browser-based transport verticals that allow you to achieve connectivity from the browser to the server using a webrtc or web transport or even websocket that's been around for so long and so ultimately we want to enable you guys to build a class of applications that whether they be browser-based or you know running just on a server or a laptop or something you know with p2b can help bridge that networking part of the part of the problem for you um so that's that's our ultimate goal is like our vision is that we want to be able to connect the browser world to the server World um in a language agnostic way something that's really uh a good foundation to build on and so like Dave mentioned you know highly recommend you guys to to clone the universal connectivity repo if that's something that you're looking uh to get in uh get get a start on I know like some folks on the Discord like Dr hongo and uh Jose KP have also started using the connectivity app so please jump in there happy to answer your questions something has just occurred to me that I've said in previous meetings and before we had this presentation for some ideas things to do with lip P2P um I highly encourage that you try to do something around you know the file coin virtual machine and filecoin network um or even ipfs but if you have interest self elsewhere one of the things I've wanted to do with P2P is to take some existing popular tools like secure scuttlebutt or Noster and rip out their networking library and replace it with lid PDP so that something like Noster is much more instead of doing its its normal relay store and forward kind of thing it's much more of a real-time peer-to-peer Network um or at least you know you can run a server that can that is easier to connect to for doing the relay um something like secure scuttlebutt could benefit from this as well um because imagine if you had a secure scuttlebutt client and you were sharing files on your feed and those files were stored in ipfs for instance right so you could combine lid P2P and ipfs to recreate it and probably have a better user experience um it would be kind of you know it's probably a harder project maybe not something you could get done in three weeks but some of the smaller tools you know have pretty straightforward networking and would be good candidates to put PDP in it'd be kind of cool to do um I don't know like a version of curl that uses Lipp I don't know something like that so if you if you're short on ideas and you don't have a team here you don't see a team here that's exciting and you want to join and you want to do something on your own you know take an open source browser-based game or take um any one of these social media apps and and try your hand it replacing the networking layer with lit PDP but like I said Focus I think your first bet would be to and the one that'll get you the most uh people available to help you would be anything related to file coin the file coin virtual machine anything with uh ipfs that kind of stuff so um looks like we've got six more minutes any more questions any more suggestions anybody want to pitch their team and ask if anybody can help look it's accordion I want someone to make it so I can use lip P2P to play Diablo 2 games with my friends I think it should be possible absolutely I think it should be possible isn't there an open source implementation of Diablo 2 now and also um the you could probably do Doom as well oh maybe it's a Diablo one implementation yeah sure and doom would be fun peer-to-peer Doom or live PDP that would be fun yeah well Meek are you in the Discord great so feel free to ask questions we have a bunch of mentors hanging out in there um and yeah uh well I guess I'm concerned that you said you barely understand anything so I'd love to get to the heart of that um if things uh could be elaborated on a little bit more Meek um you know do let us know either right now or we're in Discord well we have five minutes left I'm gonna take a poll so how many of you are associated with a project are you doing something individually or are you part of a group solo Meek great what about you Carl you solo Solo solo cool okay so a lot of solo people does everybody know what they're doing it sounds like uh Stefan or Stephanie I guess like it says you have no clue what to do I'm not sure how you pronounce your name is it Stephanie or Stephane Stefan my apologies thank you um like I said if you don't have any ideas on what to do start with the universal connectivity app maybe add in uh the ability to send a file or add features to Universal connectivity uh I just jumped in the chat maybe we can have an Ida ideation session like this hackers up this Workshop doesn't have to be the end-all be-all you know yeah I'd love to stay connected with you folks and it's okay if you don't have any ideas of what to do right now I think that's the good thing is um there's a lot of opportunities uh to do something and maybe it just requires a little bit of poking and prodding so I would say you know somebody asked about office hours uh definitely happy to meet up with uh people in in office hours I can post my availability on Discord but I I would love to you know continue chatting with folks and help people get a better idea of like what they can build um so do do you folks have a link to the Discord I think that would be the best place to connect because this um this meeting is going to be coming to a close yeah I just posted the the main Global uh Discord server well like excellent well thank you everybody for coming to this session on lidp I was hoping to excite you by showing you all the possibilities and it seems to me like we have some interest and let's get together on the Discord and figure this out get everybody a project and get going there that's the link to the channel sometimes I don't know if it's uh in slack or whatever but sometimes linking to a specific channels and Discord doesn't exactly take you there um but that's the link to the partner the P2P Channel um and yeah thanks thanks everybody for for joining and uh thank you thank you Dave and prithi for organizing leading everybody through the session answering questions and hope to see you all in the Discord again don't be afraid to ask questions that's what they're there for us what the measures they're there for to help help help support you off for the next couple of weeks yeah thank you everybody
