streams live yes stream all right all right well hey everyone welcome uh thank you so much for joining us uh here on this uh wonderful thursday morning um i'm shanon i'm from heath global uh and i'm very happy to be joined here by eric from live pier for the video nft workshop um so eric feel free to take the show away and uh guys if you have any questions please reserve them for either put them in the chat or for the end and eric floor is yours thank you um uh hello everybody i am eric from the livesp so the my goal of the talk today is to uh kind of introduce the general concept of uh video nfts to people who are not so familiar and dive in a little deeper into kind of the technology behind what enables video nfps to work uh and then talk a little bit about some of the interesting ideas that has not been built yet in this in this crazy uh uh web3 space but you know some huge opportunities that are that are you know right here right uh for uh for the capture today okay so before we dive into um the video nfps itself uh let me just talk a little bit about life here and then we can we can talk about how how these things are related um for um life here is the platform that decentralizes live streaming right um and what that means is life care provides the necessary infrastructure for any application developer to build a video live streaming app with a small fraction of the cost of today's cloud infrastructure and what that enables is this new wave of live streaming applications that simply was not possible before because of the high cost in this cloud infrastructure space uh we already have over two million minutes of video being processed every week um and these are these are kind of um streams that power musicians power artists power events uh you know researchers doing conferences right all kinds of different use cases uh and and we're really excited to be here talking to you guys about um video nft specifically and how we see how why that is significant um so in order to talk about video nfts it's important for us to also mention the creator economy right because i really think um these two things are closely related um so because when we talk about creator economy we can talk about why we're building the nfts because a lot of times we're building them because we can give creators that control right so let's look at the the creator economy today um one thing to note is that this is a huge industry right forbes estimates that um you know the creator economy is about a hundred billion dollars big um that investors today and it's rapidly growing um and covet has only uh uh made it even grow even faster right um but created the creator economy is not without its problems uh creators constantly are kept hostage by the platform uh the creators don't own their work or their fans uh the platform owns them um you know for example if you upload a piece of video onto youtube youtube owns that content we all know that create the platforms keep uh most of the profit and the re one of the big reasons that we haven't seen um new newer platforms to come up and more competition in this space is because these uh big platforms are very monopolistic and they have built these deep modes around the infrastructure that they have built around the network effect that they have built that is very hard to compete with them um however um having worked in this space for for the past five years you know at the at the intersection of crypto and video uh what we are seeing is that the creators are starting to recognize this right they recognize that the game is rigged against them and they're starting to tinker with new solutions and this is where the the web 3 opportunity comes in people are starting to realize that by moving from these um monopolistic platforms into the web 3 platforms they can actually have a lot of a lot more autonomy and have a lot more control so we're seeing this big shift of migration that's happening which is really exciting so what is this um this is people moving from the web to applications like youtube twitch and instagram that are built on top of the web2 infrastructure right so like the aws the google or facebook amazon um they're moving uh over to the web three applications so um so these are open c zora right like these open nft exchange platforms uh or um applications like glass.xyz or audios that you know use kind of web three nft based mechanisms as a building block but also starting to build other interesting social mechanisms on top of it so what we're seeing is that these these applications that are built on top of the web 3 infrastructure so for example r weave and file coin doing the doing the storage the graph doing the data indexing and live peer doing the video processing and streaming this is emerging to be the new standard and the new um the new platform for the creators so why are why are creators coming coming into this web free space well in this space um the creators own the content right because uh if you meant an ft uh for the work that you have done you own that piece of work because it's associated with your private uh with your public key and no one can take that away from you um you own the audience right because you now can take your content and you can put it onto different platforms uh these platforms start to become more like tools for creators instead of you know platforms that captivate the creators right um and in this space it's very modular which means you can build your audience on one platform and then cross-promote your work from the other platform um and and the platforms have less ability to be able to to keep you there um the payment model in the web free economy is a lot more transparent because all the payment mechanisms are built in the smart contract layer so the applications that are built on top don't have any any ability to go and all of a sudden change the game on everybody these applications are built on web3 infrastructure and that's pretty interesting because in the long term um these applications are going to be a lot more scalable than the web 2 applications just because of this incentive alignment with creators right well um we we expect to see you know in five years uh this new wave of uh web 3 based creator economy platforms are going to be five times ten times bigger than the the platform that exists today and the web 3 infrastructure is the way to scale those applications so that they can handle all of that load so so with all this exciting movement momentum in the web3 creator economy let's look at what people are creating right um it's known it's all known that video content is dominating kind of user engagement on average people people view about six seven hours of video content per week right and this is old data from 2019 kovic has only accelerated that dramatically uh we're here numbers that are you know twice three times bigger than this um this number today and if we look at from an infrastructure perspective about 80 percent of all the content on the internet is video content right and that's why we want to talk about video based nft here because this is a huge opportunity and this is huge shift that's happening from web 2 to web 3. so let's dive into video nfts and talk about you know what they what they look like today and what are some of the interesting mechanisms behind it uh here's an example of a video nft right it's a beeple um people is a is a famous artist uh in the space um this nft was last sold for over six million dollars and if you look at it um it's it's a pretty simple video that just loops right um and it's actually donald trump right uh another example uh saturday saturday night live which is a us-based comedy show made a music video about nfts and they minted an nft using that music video that then sold they sold that on openc right um so these are these are some examples um what are some you know commonalities around these nfts well they're public by default right so that means anybody can watch this music video um even though there's a single address that owns the actual nft uh these are collector items a lot of times um you know you own a people um probably because you like the content but also because um you think the the value of this video this this video clip is going to go up over time because it's a piece of art um and you know people's notoriety is only going to increase over time um some sometimes these uh nfts have unlocked a lot of unlockable content behind them which is pretty interesting i know this is a feature in in openc where you know when you buy an ft as the owner uh when you use your you can use your public key to like unlock some secret message and and finally sometimes these nfts even have real world utility right so of course these are not encoded on chain but these kind of enforced socially so for example the owners of the snl skit nft actually have the um have access to um go go look at the taping of the of the new shows in the new season um so so these are these are really interesting right so let's look at how um how these are built what what what enables these uh video nfts so we all know that erc21 is the nfd standard right and and one of the fields in the erc 21 metadata is this token url right so if you look if we look at with the specification it says you know the token url basically leads you to a json um to a json file that defines the schema of the video and of the nft itself so um let's look at another example uh here is a video nft um created by i think steve aioki which is a which is famous dj so we're in here uh if we can see this uh we'll see that uh here is a ethereum address that's associated with uh this nft so let's look go to the ethereum address we see you know here this is a contract right let's go look at this transaction um you know we see that there's this is some kind of minting operation uh with the token id so with the token id information is probably important so let's copy this and if we go back to the contract um we can actually read the contract from uh ether etherscan right so let's go let's go to that toke um let's go to that token uri field and let's try to get the token uri of this video of this video nft and we see that it's hosted in this url if we go to this url and try to load it we'll see that this is a this is a piece of json right like just following the the spec here so let's go to a json um formatter and take a look at what what this piece of json is saying well it has an image which i'm guessing is the image of the nft itself right so go here yes this is the image of the nft and then there's the animation url so if we go look at this animation url uh we see that it's an mp4 file and if we load this mp4 file of course this is the video of that nft right so so we kind of get the the structure right uh it's um using the animation url you can specify a url of the the video itself you can host that video somewhere right either on a decentralized storage like an ips ipfs or uh on r weave or um you know any any um storage location at all right so um so that's all good um let's dig in a little bit deeper to to look at the animation url itself right we see in the specification here that the animation url supports um you know file extensions and you know all the all of these different formats um you know sometimes sometimes there are video files sometimes they're audio files but we also see in here um the animation url also supports html pages right and and and that allows you to build even richer experiences for example like interactive nfts using javascript and things like that so that's pretty interesting in fact this allows us to take it to another level for example creating live streamed um nfts and there i think um i think live streaming nfts is going to be this new new ground and new territory that i really want to see some interesting hacks out of the out of this youth online hackathon right so in fact this already is a thing it's just not uh yet popularized here we see an ft of a live stream that's happening on twitch right so you can simply embed a video player in this html in this html page and then you can play a live stream um you can play a live stream and create an ft of that live stream so let's talk about some ideas right we're here all to build uh video build hacks what what kind of hacks can we build with this concept of video nfts and especially live streaming nfts right one is you can build a mobile live streaming application for nxt drops right we um what what we see uh in the in the video usage graph uh for on the internet in general is that mobile video has been growing just with the hockey stick growth um so so for the nft space there's a there's a blank space for creating a really really great mobile broadcasting experience that allows anybody to go live with a click of a button on their phone and be able to create an nft of that experience and maybe do a nft drop maybe sell the recording of that live stream as an nft after the stream has ended another interesting idea is kind of building a building a live streaming application with the nft of the live stream acting as royalty so what that what does that mean it means um you can people can create an nft before the live stream starts uh other people can bid and buy the nft and the proceeds of the nft will go into uh the production of the live stream so that live stream can be created and then for for the owners of the nft they could also get a portion of the earnings that are that's created by this live stream right so a good example would be an artist wants to put on a show they need they need some capital in order to produce the show uh they can create an nft using that um doing that um kind of crowdfund the um the show but in the show they can sell tickets they can take tips right and the nft owners can take certain percentage of the proceeds of that and maybe even take proceeds in the selling of the recording afterwards another interesting idea is using nfts as event tickets for a live stream right so if you own the nft for a live stream um you when you go into when you go to the uh the interface uh the interface automatically authenticates you with your ethereum public uh public address and you can see that in the wallet there is an nft that's accepted and it automatically unlocks the screen and you're able to watch the the video stream and if you don't own that nft it does not unlock um another another interesting thing that we want to see is this clip mint experience in live streams uh and and the because the clipping idea is already a thing in live streaming right if you go to twitch you will know that a lot of times people are kind of clipping the really exciting moments in the live streams uh so here this is a natural extension so that after you create that video clip of a really exciting moment in the live stream you can then right there mint and nft with that clip and then maybe even auction it off during the live stream itself from here we have some great prices that we that we put together uh we have there's eight thousand dollars in total uh it's broken down into three different tiers and there's a price pool for of a thousand dollars for anybody who's building um uh who is building applications and hacks using the library api we've put together a really great uh list of resources so we're putting together a tutorial on how to create nfts for video live streams we are building an in-browser broadcaster that will be available later this week so you can just embed that into your application and allow your user to go live directly in the browser by opening up a new tab or something like that and there's also a great list of other example applications there's one for a web-based application and there's one for a mobile-based application built by uh using react native um so they can be um you know android and ios compliant um we have some great guides uh on livegear.com which is the uh which we're dubbing uh calling the lifeguard streaming services and it's a hosted gateway for the live career network and the easiest way to get started building video applications with livegear and of course we are a lot of the team members are in the discord channel for if online and we're there to provide technical support for you or if you just want to talk about your ideas and hash things out a little better we're there to do that as well so feel free to to come in and drop us a note um i think a lot of our team members have the the live peer name next to their handle in discord so you can dm me if you don't feel comfortable um talking in public and all of that is fine so yeah that's the conclusion of the of the presentation uh i want to open it up for for q and a's uh for people who have any questions um yeah and would love to see uh you bring uh bring your creativity to build uh using live skier thanks so much for that presentation eric that was awesome um so there's a question in the chat uh does using web3 infrastructure slash live pier um protect creators from getting banned while doing live stream um or if a song is playing in the background will the stream stop yeah that's a that's a great question so um and and this is really around kind of the mca takedowns right uh and that's a thing that um you know that that's that's been a a problem with bigger platforms like twitch or uh or facebook or or youtube where you know if you have any kind of copyrighted uh soundtrack in the background um your your v your video could be uh automatically stopped and your account could be suspended um the live peer infrastructure itself does not do that right um but at the same time for the applications um who are building using life here um they're you you'll be taking on kind of the responsibility to to follow the dmca rules right so you know if you've got a dmca takedown notice for example uh you would want to make sure to take that content off uh before um because otherwise you would um because the application itself would be liable for um for that um the the thing that we're that we're uh we are working on a research project that kind of provides a tool so that we can automatically so i guess the application builders can choose to automatically detect um copyrighted content and and yeah yeah we're happy to uh we're happy to answer more questions around that and if you're interested to to try out those features um you can ping us so we can get uh help you get started sounds good and uh for everyone that's here uh all of the recordings including this one will be locatable on the eth global youtube channel so definitely go ahead and check that out if you are developing afterwards and you want to refer back to this video uh felipe asks if did you say it was possible to put an entire live stream into an nft and if yes can we can you like detail more about that yeah yeah yeah absolutely and and it's right you can put an entire live stream into nft it sounds kind of uh sounds kind of crazy um but the way it works is is really you um by using this animation url right because the animation url allows you to link to a html page that can that can optionally contain the live stream uh so you can simply link to the link to the live stream uh htm html and after the the live stream has ended um there will be you know if you use live here for example you can um you can choose to automatically record the live stream uh so um so after the stream ends you can kind of swap swap out the live stream content with the recorded content and therefore the nft will kind of outlast it's um it's just it's live duration yeah pretty crazy um that's that's awesome does anyone else have any other questions and if not uh you all can um if you have any further questions down the road as you're developing um please don't hesitate to kind of message the sponsors in the sponsor dash live peer channel um and uh yeah if you all uh if you have no extra questions this has been really great um thanks once again to eric for the amazing presentation and uh thanks everyone for coming we will see you all in the next one thanks everybody
