[Applause] [Music] hey everyone uh weekend's almost here um it's exciting we have our last workshop for today uh we have neo here from artiva doing a workshop on archiva's path to decentralization um hope that you all enjoy this and you thank you for taking the time to do this and with that being said let's get started cool thanks for the interim so ours is pre-recorded and then we're going to do a q a after so i'm just sharing my screen right now and then starting the presentation everyone i'm neo and uh today i'm presenting artifa's path to decentralization so yeah let's just get into it what is artiva currently so artiva is a no code uh platform builder for nfts basically what we help you with is we deploy a site for you and then we bundle in uh nft tools that you want to use such as zora for the marketplace and then you can import any nft contracts from your wallet currently so some of the positive things about artifa is you can exit the product without losing your marketplace functionality or your assets it basically means if you're running an auction through an artifact and suddenly you don't want to use artifa anymore you can basically share that link on zora or on another website that is backed by the zoro protocol and then all of your assets continue to stay in your wallet so there's no worry about us basically rugging your content so another positive it's very easy to get started and get set up pretty much just need a wallet and it takes about five minutes to create a platform and it's super easy to customize and just get started it's kind of a little um shot of our branding and the idea is that you're owning your own nft platform you can customize the way you want to and you don't need any code to get started some issues that we're having right now so the artiva team has full control of the api and database so we control the platform data we could edit platforms if we wanted to be malicious about it you could censor people from the api users cannot fully exit the rtv products so you lose your your platform metadata which is basically like your logo your background images your you the style of your platform and then you also lose the actual uh curation which is what nfts are part of web platform so there's no censorship resistance like i said we could censor someone from the api and all of our network effects are currently building in our database which is not really what you want in what three another issue is the product is closed source because it relies on uh our api currently and that basically just means there's less innovation going on because everything is coming top down from the team and not bottoms up from the community and last issue is users do not own any part of artiva so that's just misaligned incentives this is like a little meme of what's in from office space saying our team is not really decentralized so how can we change that well we can look at what other products are doing see what we can take and see what we can leave from them so taking a look at mir they do some really cool stuff publishing all of their content to r weave so that makes it pretty cheap for mirror to fund anyone that's publishing on their platform uh it means the network effects are building on a more open system so anyone can query the data from our weave find posts from mirror and read it without going through the mirror api any any publication can exit with all their post data still on our weave so you don't need to specifically go through mirror and it's super easy to get started you don't need to spend any uh gas or anything to publish content to mirror some of the downsides though is the publication data is off chain so you don't get that relationship of who is part of what publication and you don't get to know what content is posted under which publication just looking at the r-weave data so that's kind of a bit of a limitation for builders that want to build something on mirror can't exactly recreate the mirror client from scratch um this is this is probably a limitation of using are we even when they launched at the time which was like late 2020 when l2s weren't really production ready so i think we can kind of take some of the stuff that mira has been doing really well and kind of build on top of that as well so we have similar requirements we want users to be able to easily and cheaply add content to a platform you want content to be published on an open system where anyone can query this data but artifa has a stronger need for the platform level data to be open part of this is just like i think that technology is ready for this because l2s are not production ready uh if someone wants to self-host an artifa website they should be able to have their full platform data and not need to hit an archiva api or store on some kind of database or if someone wants to build a whole product around hosting the artiva client for people they should be able to do that it's going to help a lot with client innovation as well and we can do some really cool things with men [Music] so as you can see we are kind of thinking a lot more about how can we transition from being super off-chain but easy to use to being a lot ecosystem of clients builders people building interesting stuff with the open data that we want to be published it means that the content and the metadata of a platform will always be accessible always being sensible like we just talked about it'll make it so we can self-host people can build hosted services we don't have to run the structure of artifa we don't have to be the only post for the client um users can um switch between clients fluidly with all of their data intact that means full platform metadata their content their platform roles pretty much everything you would need to um recreate a platform from scratch uh we can build an open source client with this since we don't rely on any we won't rely on any apis anymore and then we can utilize the data in unique ways and this means that it inherently builds a stronger social graph between nfts not just the ones that they're purchasing and have in their wallet and mincing but things they just think look interesting so curation is a signal for someone saying like they like this nft you might not want to purchase it i just want to show it off and it kind of creates more of a graph between what people think is interesting what kind of platforms the content lives under and i think we can make some really cool social applications and stuff with that and then people can also make clients for different content types um platform discovery and it really just turns the creativity up a notch for what you can do working with the artiva data and then taking publishing on chin really makes um things interesting because basically how the protocol works right now is you can set certain addresses to be able to publish content onto a platform so that opens up the gateway to not just wallets being publishers of a platform but smart contracts publishing to a platform so then with that you can do token gated publishing you can take snapshots of addresses that you want to be able to publish and use a merkle tree you can do interesting experiments um such as one i've been thinking about recently called prop house publishing where a community can submit content they want to be on a platform and token holders can vote on what content makes it into the platform very similar to nouns prop house but using that to publish content to a platform and then it also opens the door to unique clients that'll interface with the publishing protocol such as like nft explorers where you can add in content to your platform directly or platform explorer where you can like retweet content from other platforms and put on yours or just very in-depth designers to update platform metadata to be exactly how you want your platform to look like so now you can see the gears are turning there's some really cool ideas of what could be built with this system um a couple of trade-offs we are experimenting with how many uh gas fees people would need to pay for this and how hosted services could possibly use meta transactions to make the process a lot smoother we are researching how to use the non-economic device keys that mirror's been using where you can update content without actually creating a whole new content digest so i think that will save a lot with gas fees um we're going to be building this on layer 2 which means we won't have the massive gas class on layer one and then the bulk of the data the content will live on our weave and we'll be posting either like continuous or content digest to the protocol making stuff a lot cheaper too what does um actual interaction with the protocol look like so we can pull up a demo of the new client real quick before we pull up that demo before we pull up that demo we can give a quick overview of the new client so all the data is sourced from the smart contract and pulled from our weave it's going to be open source so anyone can remix it um people can self host it or build hosting services and it's very modular so we can have themes that'll change the look and feel of the client without you having to dig in and think with all the source code we're also building adapters so we can support many different entity marketplaces very specific rendering strategies for unique nfts and um basically platform data sources like nft history and things like that so let's dive into the demo this is a new walkthrough of the artiva client so it's basically a complete upgrade to our front end this may look kind of similar to current artifa sites but this is actually a kind of developer preview of uh what we're going to be upgrading to so as you can see it kind of looks similar to a normal artifact it's got a little bit of branding up top here you can connect your wallet there's a list of assets that are curated on the platform kind of like click into these and see what the fastest look like go back but uh the one big change is this is not coming from one code base anymore this is actually a theme that sits on top of the artivo client and tells the site how to uh render out the actual content on here so if we check out some code base here you can see in the theme folder i have these different pages so it's currently what the home page looks like and you get a context with the post and some platform information so you can build the navigation from that you can add in these um platform logo description title cover image and then you can map over the posts to generate something like a post preview and where we can see look at the nft preview specifically we pass them like an nft object and you can tell us exactly how you want your site to be rendered out so it's more from a developer side they can go in and they can change all the little details about their site and create a theme it's exactly how they want but if you're not a developer you can basically um choose from pre-created themes that will be made from either the artillery community or you can hire a developer to build you a theme that you can then use on your own site so you can see if we switch out um let's go we're using things through here so let's fill in views and see what that looks like it's starting up it's closing out there we go once theme two is done building you can see this has an actual cover image see the nfts are a lot bigger here and all this will be customizable um using straight react you'll be able to bundle this together put on create a theme repository the marketplace to be a lot of cool options for themes so now for the actual site data um you can head into the admin panel to check out some uh the new designer so this will allow you to like preview your site change the little metadata settings or custom properties that theme is specified that you can change so you can add like see we're changing those um scripts in here and then from the bottom here it's kind of covered up by the controls but you'll be able to change your theme and um add in one via github link or via a zip folder or something like that so that's pretty much all about themes and then for the actual um content data this looks essentially the same as nfts that have been posted to artiva but there's one major difference all this data is coming from a smart contract uh and all the content is uh uploaded on the smart contract and our weave so you can see on our sub graph we're pulling some content from a platform you can see all of these um different like content ids that we have here and you can just use those ids in our week query and then get back the actual data that's being shown on the platform here so you can see we have this whole list of the different assets that are displaying our platform and anyone will be able to come and use the sub graph and query for uh platform data by other platforms or users or however you want to display that data within your app so we can come to the uh the curation page here so you can see we have all of our currently selected assets let's refresh it just make sure you have the latest so you can see it shows us what's selected so far let's say we want to add in another moonshot but if you want to add in some more generative pieces pepe and sasha all we have to do here is click save so right now it's uploading uh the content to our weave and then after it's done um uploading to our weave we'll get this little transaction pop up here and we can actually place this data on chain you can see since we're using layer 2 it's going to um cost a lot less and confirm the transaction a lot quicker so most of the time when you're going to be using this interface it's going to be a via hosted service which will likely be using meta transactions so you probably won't even see any pop-up or any interaction or any payment to add-on content to the platform that'll all be handled by the hosted service and we'll likely be using the ethereum gas station make it a lot easier if you decide you want to build a hosted so now we can come back to our refresh you can see we added in those new assets here so yeah this is a basic uh overview of the new artifa client so main takeaways are it's going to be extremely flexible from the design point of view it's going to be super easy to build new themes as a developer we're going to give you a lot of great tools so you don't really have to query all the data and do all this crazy stuff you're just going to be able to utilize like con like context and be able to plug in um like easy html and css where you want to and then users will be able to use their team to use those things pretty easily and then all platform data is going to be backed by our weave and smart contracts so you as a developer will be able to build on to either the open source client that we're going to be releasing or build your own client or utilize the artifa data in some kind of app you're building whether you want um curations of nfts or you just want to see relationships between um users platforms and the nfts they think are interesting it'll all be open i'll be public and i'll be accessible to whoever wants to build with you so that demo is looking pretty good i think we have a nice idea of what we want the client to look like still developing exactly how the protocol is going to work and exactly how many transactions you'll have to do to those contents in the network so very much in development but i think we have something pretty interesting and then the last question is how can we uh create sustainable protocol and client development and i think one super interesting idea that we've been touring with recently is auctioning the protocol provenance via nfts um basically how nouns has been doing it where the dow funds proposals that benefit the protocol ecosystem we see this as building new clients some of those publishing modules that we talked about a bit before new themes that you want to be able to use marketing hosted services pay for meta transactions for people to set up a new platform without having to use any gas and we're taking a lot of inspiration from the nouns ecosystem i think they have something really special with what they've built and we want to kind of carry that into a new domain and see if that can be used to build something more product oriented so in summary uh our path to decentralization is going to be a new on-chain publishing protocol a new open source client that anyone can fork remix build on top of and then a noun style dao it's going to fun development of your protocols new clients and essentially propagating the protocol and the brand to more people so thank you so much for uh watching this presentation and we'll now move on to the q a part of the section okay so that was pretty much the uh whoops hey everyone that's pretty much the whole uh presentation there so if we have any questions um yeah we can go ahead and do that if not we can cut it early yeah i think we can actually just end this here for today awesome thank you so much awesome thank you so much neokai for uh doing this workshop that was super interesting to watch um yeah the recording will be available on youtube for hackers to reference and that being said thank you so much once again for taking the time to do this for metabolism you
