share the screen and yeah we should be ready to go as soon as people start coming in here okay um i guess we're ready to go welcome everybody to the hack fs judging session uh sorry we're a couple minutes late but that's okay we got lots of time today to go over everything today we are judging 650 hackers well not exclusively today maybe but the whole hackathon includes uh 650 hackers from 61 countries and a total of 18 time zones so if you are here at a time that's very early or very late for you thanks for coming it's a global event and that's how it is so lots to organize there um the judging format today here's what we'll be doing we'll have four minutes for a demo that's for the videos um three minutes for judges to ask questions and a ten minute break every six to eight teams usually i try and have that somewhere in the middle uh so yeah we'll stop somewhere halfway through the list uh the judging criteria how will your projects be looked at it will be based on technicality originality the practicality of your applications the user interface and user experience and developer experience if necessary and the overall wow factor so shoot for that one this is not strictly a competition gotta remind you all of that we're all here to learn explore what's possible with technology and not every project is aiming to become a business hopefully we're all here to get good feedback from our two wonderful judges and who are those wonderful judges we've got renewal and jack thank you so much for coming they'll be looking at your projects today asking questions and hopefully scrutinizing them with with intense uh you know getting into the minutiae of everything but i have a feeling that they're going to be pretty nice and easy going and so with that we can get on to demos the first team here is the data wallet and byof marketplace if you guys could raise your hands and we will promote you to panelists and get you in here hello here we go alrighty cool thank you you guys may have to share your sound as well because it appears to be muted which means you'll have to reshare pleasure's going first here we go sorry guys don't worry it happens a lot hello hack fs where to's compliment and we've built the data wallet and byof marketplace to show it off the data wallet hosts social graphs of trusted people so that any dap can load data curated by specific communities some context we've had decentralized data for a long time now but creating a civil resistant method for curating indexes of data has proven to be very difficult without re-centralizing those indices the graph has done an incredible job of tackling this complex problem with chain based data which has inspired us to create a user experience for user-owned off-chain data these great projects and many more like them allow people to host their own decentralized data however when using adapt most people only care about a subset of that data though if we put our trust in a single party to define these subsets of data we are re-centralizing that trust and leaving ourselves vulnerable to attackers that can span the data set who can i trust what data should adapt load for me specifically we experimented with these ideas on true review at youth denver and realized a need for curated groups of people who are trusted so that people can pick a trusted group of people and their data for adapt to use enter the data wallet first users upload their data to ipfs and file points then index it in their idx then communities of users define groups of trusted idx identities and finally users can tell adapt to load their preferred subset of this curated data imagine people bringing their own data to each dac saying hey here are the people i trust load all of their data for me to interact with then be able to switch between communities they trust like load my dao or load people i follow on twitter or load this other dow like fwb much like visiting a subreddit that aligns with your interests as a demo application for the data wallet we built the byof marketplace recently several projects have either chosen or been told to take down certain parts of their d apps that are hosted on web2dns stanley tweeted bring your own front end after the uniswap edits reminding people to bring their own ui removing some of the dns burden and risk on core developers so here it is the bring your own front end marketplace a demo that lets users bring their own front end to a smart contract using their curated data wallet the data wallet loads decentralized records from the user's list of trusted people then shows them what front ends per smart contract are being used by each community this allows them to select a front end and load it directly from ipfs in their browser completely bypassing the need for dns the data wallet can be added to any dap you can author your own groups of trusted people using idx dids and make those available to dapps identities can be added manually or imported from existing social graphs like twitter or discord maybe a dow users can create their own groups or delegate to communities that they trust here's a demo of our code in action so first we log in with our ethereum wallet and get an idx instance we can take a look at the records that we can set trusted identities represent a list of dids of other identities we want to pull their data in and byof records are for the marketplace they point a smart contract address at a front end on ipfs through filecoin if you take a look at the marketplace you can see that my personal idx has this byof record and it shows the various websites that can be available if i load another community list of dids let's say the indie dao we can see different versions of that website that users have pointed to along with verifications for how many people have set those records so i can choose to go to the most popular one or an alternative version that maybe less people have pointed at you can imagine how this data wallet could be dropped on any dap to let users choose what data gets pulled in we're super excited to tackle this issue as it's been on our minds for over a year we hope you enjoyed our submission and thanks for having us that's it very cool we got some time for questions yeah i was uh curious so like what um you know what group do you see kind of being the primary one interacting with uh uh this protocol do you think it'll be more like end users actually sort of building up these truss graphs or do you think it'll be more like a uh i don't know like you reference unit swap right like a uniswap front end um uh uh letting you switch between versions of the front end or that kind of thing like just a few examples there i think would help me wrap my head around it better that's a really good question yeah i think that like the byof marketplace piece for the dns bypassing is relevant for any dap especially d5 right now because of the regulators and security scrutiny like scrutiny there uh it allows that person to be more community driven or curated around how the records are decentralized but i think that the social apps games twitter clones things like that will end up using more of the actual data wallet concept where any data developer could just drop that in their dap and say hey you tell us who you want to load data from and just add on to that we talked about probably uh the query use case would be groups of developers who are um like the core development teams for different projects would probably be the ones that are uh you're delegating your trust to them typically um so actually yeah on on that one uh katie sorry i hope i'm not mispronouncing your name uh uh is that does that kind of solve for the centralization issue that you brought up like if you see folks just delegating to the project team to decide what version of the front end they should use yeah exactly so we we see it kind of working like a reddit community subreddit community where you kind of delegate your trust but the higher level concept to this is that there are many different sub-communities within the crypto space and um that you can switch between those different contexts to view the data that would fill in the front ends um so that you're not actually um delegating that trust to a big corporation to decide for you a big company instead it's being delegated to groups of community and people um that are actually incentivized to um provide the right trust to those awesome sorry i don't want to monopolize all the questions um i have a question um i was looking through your showcase and you i don't know if this was mentioned in the video but um you're experimenting with the graph uh to build the off chain data mapping flow um did you talk a bit about that and like whether that's something that you want to pursue after this hackathon um and like challenges your experience uh getting that to work definitely yeah i think this is super important for the community for somebody to take on um and gus did a lot of experimentation here with the graph because most of that is already plugged into it's most of the data mappings are just taking events from blockchain and then making that available through a graphql api that is fully decentralized and how it's hosted and for us we were experimenting mostly with can we like create our own data mapping portion of the the core graph code that would allow us to take other sources of events to trigger those mappings of those indexes and plug stuff like idx or ipfs or something in like imagine like web3 dot storage api firing off an event whenever something is uploaded or pinned or a deal is brokered or something that then goes on to um a pool of indexers on the graph that's then building indexes for file point ipfs data uh and so we once we got into that we realized it was a much bigger problem it would take like probably several weeks or months to build out um but we kind of sketched out how we would solve that as as part of this and feel like that's a pretty important part as well yeah uh oh yeah i really liked the project i think that was good oh i just wanted to like share comments i think that was like a really cool um like a good development experience i'm pretty sure you guys learned a lot there definitely we learned a ton and just thinking through like how would a developer really drop the data wallet onto their dap like what is the real use case like how would they do that and then configure their records and their schemas there's obviously a lot we don't have time to demo but um thinking through those user flows is really interesting because it hasn't really been done a lot most people just bring just their own data there's not a lot of data so you can like say hey bring my community that i care about in this context of d5 or in this context of video games or something alrighty i think we're up to time there but thank you so much for presenting i think this team here is right token and you guys should already be in so if you want to share your screen and get going with your presentation hey there uh i'm max with uh right token so here i'm going to share my screen right now so can everyone see that okay that's great all right so i guess let's get started actually i can't even hear this so uh let's see i'm max andrew and this is right token right token is reimagining the music industry by building a stock market for music currently rights to music are opaquely spread across complex contracts using paperwork that has to be expensively parsed to distribute royalties from a number of mediums and sharing services instead of this right token tokenizes song recording rights into a right token nft this allows rights to be machine readable royalties distributed automatically via smart contract artists to monetize their work on their terms and enables everyday investors to easily build a portfolio of songs here we have the right token mentor tool this tool is really powerful for a couple of reasons first it allows artists to convert their song recording copyrights into right tokens which are legally enforceable and can be bought and sold on a market it also allows artists to do this on their own terms which we'll see below by constructing their own right token legal agreement another reason this is super powerful is because all of this right token metadata like the legal agreement and the sound recording are all stored on ipfs which gives it a level of persistence that a lot of nfts don't have so now we'll go ahead and upload a song i did you can see here the artist is given the option to set resale royalty rates so this means that even if they sell now and their song explodes in popularity later the artist is still partly covered because they'll be entitled to a percent of each resale and then here you can see where the artist can customize their terms for their own legal agreement so here we're just given an example of enabling a social recovery mechanism so that means that if the right token is ever lost or the wallet is inaccessible the right token organization will be able to step in and help out but this is just an option so the user is free to enable this or disable this this is a really important element because the user's choices here will decide what terms are included in the right token and what terms the token holder has to agree to so you can see here a lot of other legal agreement and legal documentation defining rights and explaining [Music] what is included so now we'll go ahead and sign down below and it's as easy as that so the right token is sent straight to our wallet and then we can check it out on the marketplace we can go to the ready token we just minted because right tokens are actually extension of zora nfts or znfts they can be listed and bid on on zora auction houses so this interoperability is super important because it allows artists a much wider pool of potential investors and brings in a lot more potential investors into the right token community right token is a community first project built collaboratively by developers artists and music investors around the world we'd love to have you join our community we have a reddit a twitter and a discord and we can't wait to see you there sweet um so yeah any questions i also have some slides if that would be helpful but um any questions i have a lot of questions for sure yeah no i know actually uh i was glad to see i got you yeah i was trying to include audios yeah well i gotta say your little subtitles at the bottom of each page were very very funny and i enjoyed that um uh my main question really is how does like the real world off chain legal copyright map to the representation on chain and then what rights do you get from that right like if someone if you buy the copyright for a track and then put that track on on spotify or one of those centralized dsps does like that money somehow flow back to the chain or something yeah absolutely so in terms of just uh i guess kind of answering your questions backwards so in terms of distributing royalties that's still future work but given that right now it is already possible for you to launch this and be entitled to that those royalties i actually talked to a former law professor and she kind of assured me i also thought it maybe sounded like i may be missing a step here or something like that um but no she assured me that just the act of signing the digital signature is what enables the copyright transfer so just having that in the right token with all of that legal documentation on there on ipfs and we can go on the ipfs explorer and see all of this and the other great thing that i mentioned was this is all machine readable so this enables kind of a modularity that uh current legal structures don't have which is something i'm really excited to explore more but no so just having the right token and uh understanding that you are the owner and you're transferring the rights to the holder of this right token is legally binding and legally enforceable and then what you're what you're entitled to specifically is at least in the us there's kind of two different ways of looking at song rights and copyright around music so one side is the composition and that's the uh the notes in the song the lyrics to the song what we're talking about here is actually the song recording itself so that is just the wav file or the mp3 exactly yeah yeah so you're freely enable you're freely entitled to upload this to audios you know spotify all of these things the radio everywhere you get royalties from these they theoretically will flow into a smart contract that then distributes it to whatever while it's holding the right token but as of right now this is all completely enforceable and completely ready to go cool yeah jack you should you should go for it i i can keep asking more if i get time but i i would love to yeah keep talking to you actually yeah um all right well yeah jackie if you don't have any uh any other questions yeah the the other one i i was curious about so like um you know if you're kind of primarily relying on the legal system to enforce you know the ownership rights around this um uh how do you think about like the securities side of this or or have you thought about that at all yet i have actually so that was actually part of the conversation i had with my professor uh she said that so securities basically the the i guess nuance to be careful about is um when it's just an nft when it's one thing as itself it's not a security until you shard the nft which was something that i was thinking about doing so that would enable kind of fractional ownership over the nft so that a lot of people can buy into each and each original song and then there can be kind of a community around each song so you don't have to be able to buy all of africa or something like that by like you can buy just one percent of it or something like that and participate in that market so once you start doing that that's where you get into the legal area of maybe the security um so as of right now it's absolutely a concern and something i think about um but when it's just an nft i've heard from i guess my legal counsel uh that it's not a concern yet cool yeah and then i guess to maybe for jack is at optimism right now it's working on polygon but i'm super excited about roll-ups um so i think that would definitely be something i'm exploring right now as well um nice uh i actually had one quick question on the music side so i actually have literally effective like some experience uh with music and like dived into we went down the rabbit hole um yeah so i really like this project uh one question i have is um how are you accounting for the other um stakeholders in uh the creation of a song like you know you have like this pipeline of collaborators that actually you know work together to produce the final track so how do you account for um like publishers getting like like how do you account for like acknowledging the publishers um yeah yeah uh like contributions to a song yeah no it's a great question so i think that uh for right now the way that i'm addressing this is by um focusing on independent artists so i think that the kind of core user i'm really seeing would be like a soundcloud rapper or something like that for right now uh i mean once you start getting into songs that are already established i think there's a lot to kind of untangle from the existing music industry so there's a lot of kind of hands in the pot um i think that that would absolutely get complicated but on the bright side the kind of machine readability i think also makes it really easy to move forward with this once we're able to kind of build out this infrastructure more because you can see okay i sampled this song here and then based on the agreement that we got with the original artist from that song we know that we pay them two percent of everything everything's a lot more transparent and a lot more automated than it is right now so actually untangling this will be its own kind of opportunity in itself because even though we're starting small and it won't immediately be a problem it'll actually be easier to work on this framework than the existing framework once you have to kind of account for what the producer owns and everything that'll all be included as part of a parcel kind of json object or something like that yeah totally all right we got to move things along here but thank you so much for presenting thanks everyone yeah i really hope to i guess kind of keep the conversation going or anything like that if you guys have any other questions the next team we've got here is the meme lord game which is built with jvm metaverse it's a it's a big long title so if you could yeah raise your hands and we will promote you here great you guys can share your screen start whenever you're ready challenges you can start the video meta wars is expanding more and more people and brands are joining metawars every day but the current tools for metaverse creators and users are too fragmented not easy to use creators and users need a platform which seamlessly integrates blockchain gaming and metaverse content monetization is another important element of the metaverse jvm is a metaverse platform which combines three worlds blockchain and gaming we started building building this during hack fs jvm aims to provide seamless experience to users and creators by integrating blockchain metaverse and gaming some of the capabilities that we are building a jvm platform are virtual and asset modeling asset and whenever whatever is building also we aim to build ideal platform and dark guild platforms for gamers and also lockable content and paywall for the game subscription and the server platform for multiplayer games and decentralized render farm now we introduce you to the first game we built during hack fs using jvm metalworks platform which is called memeblog adventure and we walk you through the game we built this is the first part of lord new adventure presentation game what new adventure game is a game about the blockchain and if ecosystem we wanted to come up with something meaningful and for the community we wanted to merge all crypto space figures in one place fighting against model the idea of the game is simple with simple graphics it's cyberpunk fantasy game about us people who make history the player will be rewarded with digit coin which could be exchanged on for different nfts like buying keys and open chests or relics and some handmade new weapons which you can add to the character profile in the game the player will start with basic gear to go through these not easy times when you start to level up more things will open to you like skills like other things like prank name skills so you can do more we were thinking to add skill tree so people can choose their fate [Music] the technologies that we're using one of them is polygon and that's for our game asset nfts and the erc20 token which is dejan [Music] we're also using web3 storage with ips for game assets um and nfts superfluid for our game pass and then a subscription within the game equivalent and thus for our token balance and then unlock protocol which is for lockable content that you can find within the game render throughout the game so we have used the nfc erc 721 token standard to create nfts use polygon to deploy using truthful web3 storage for the nft content storage and for the file storage uh superfluid we have used to create the game pass subscription and uh the we've used this sdk to build it and covalent to get the token balance for the game players and unlock protocol for the meme large lockable asset files and the accordion is mentioned here and this is how you can get involved welcome to share feedback all right i think it's question time press play to win with oreo press play to get front row press oh yeah super cool guys uh uh thank you for for uh sharing yeah my um uh uh you know main main question i guess is sort of uh uh you see this being kind of like an sdk or tool chain of sorts right like um could you could you talk through um uh uh you know how kind of how this compares to the way that folks would would develop a uh uh kind of like play to earn game today yes maybe ed you want to take a stab at it or should i explain a little bit you go george um okay so yeah so uh ronald and jack hi so uh essentially uh we consider this like a kind of a metaphors platform as a service so yes we're building this tool chain and and the idea we have is to to provide a whole range of tools and a full ecosystem to the to the game creators and players to kind of uh kind of use this this uh this meta hours to to host and run their games and monetize the content and then the game activities yeah so and we just wanted to demonstrate the first example so this is this is the game which which we built which had been explained a little bit more but essentially that is one manifestation of this platform but ed maybe you want if you want to explain the game a little bit quickly yeah yeah the idea born itself and i thought like meme lord adventure would be more like a coordination game uh coordination game through the like blockchain and for the people who involved or wants to involve with the blockchain it is a game like especially developed i think for to make a blockchain ethereum ecosystem more mainstream because they will be heroes which is presented now on crypto twitter we can we can have a bankless dial maps we're burning banks so it's a it's a meme for the people for the community and we wanted to make it like community driven game so people can add their own contribution changing the game grow it because these are so many games and we wanted to people to have fun with the vitalik vuterian characters or elon musk like it was an example it's just a meme and we wanted to connect maybe other meta verses and make it's like coordination game with a quest to make people learn and maybe earn in the future to yeah that's this was the idea because i was looking on a whole thing of gaming and it's developing and there is no games who had which will educate and like these kind of games where like it could be a meme game where you know yeah meme game a prank game basically maybe with that it's without their future goal but for the community it could be a hub for the community where people can meet and you know like a little dao space basically yeah and uh how much of that game is built the um the the meme lord game and we we started uh and it's we built a room maybe two rooms but we couldn't present like a whole walk through because it was the time was so limited basically we used the engine uh unreal uh one of our designers so we we try to yeah we yeah like couple rooms but not even level because it will take probably us more time and probably like maybe a couple months to actually build a level so we tried our best but the idea born there and we think it would be it could like bring people like more people to the crypto space because it's fun cool yeah on the technology sorry jack please go ahead oh you you can go ahead no i i'm just trying to bring in a other colleague like uh nick in the in the conversation so from technology perspective if you want to comment anything for the judges to understand that what we used here well yeah we we've used uh react on the front end um and then um to build it off the site on the front end and then we have um web3 storage we have um we're using alchemy and hard hat um some of the technologies that we have involved um i don't know if any other questions yeah i had one question uh were you guys inspired by engine at all have you guys heard of engine they have uh a game platform that reminded me of uh your project that's built on ethereum yeah i heard of engine and but i'm not uh closely kind of uh or not on a deep dive understanding of that platform i know it's a very popular platform uh but we'll be we'll be learning about it yes yeah i think there's a a lot of similarities with your projects i think you could learn a lot from uh like looking at their code base and how how they launch projects um yeah um but i i think it's we definitely need more we need more projects doing that like engine can't be the only project that's what uh you know like ethereum can't be the only blockchain engine can't be the only gaming platform out there you thank you thank you thank you jack thank you i think we have to move on to the next project thanks for presenting uh the next group here is innova tract i hope i got your name correct uh and yeah we will promote you guys and you can present whenever you're ready all right great yeah anova track is the proper pronunciation thank you and let me get my screen shared and we'll we'll do this we all enter into contracts with other people and other entities employers financial institutions on a regular basis and hardly think anything of it but in doing so we help others often people we've never met accomplish their goals and their desires what if there was a way that you could enter into a contract with yourself in order to accomplish your dreams and your goals as fast as you accomplish the desires and dreams and hopes of others that you enter into contracts with now you can with anova track anova track allows any user to enter into a binding contract with themselves on the blockchain by entering a name of a goal establishing an end date and staking a certain amount of funds the user determines how fast they will accomplish their goals under the threat of losing those funds forever by enforcing serious immutable consequences inovitrek helps individuals accomplish their goals far faster than they ever would on their own without such a personal agreement that is binding and unchanging the novatrax's front-end user interface allows any user to easily enter into a contract on their own a user simply enters the name of their goal a deadline date and stakes an amount of way and then submits the contract currently this feature is only available through github but it will very soon be uploaded to aws using ec2 through remix a user is able to create a contract mark that contract as having been fulfilled and accept the fulfillment or mark the contract as being unachieved the inoa track smart contract has been deployed on the polygon matic blockchain and burns a small amount of gas for every transaction that it handles in the future my team and i would like to deploy the contract with a front-end user interface using aw as as previously mentioned and expand on the features of the nova contract with check-ins that will check in with the user every seven days to check on the progress of their goal we would also like to create a doa with a governing body that can verify that goals were achieved currently a novatrak is on the honor system and we would like to see a little more accountability innovatrek is the future of single entity contracts helping dreamers rapidly achieve their goals as they have never done before cool we got time for questions i'll go first uh i think the i've seen this idea before but i think it's really i haven't seen it deployed to polygon so i think it has a lot of potential to be on polygon because the transaction are so darn cheap that you can enter into a contract with yourself like multiple times a day um and yeah like that i could see myself using it on polygon uh if i was on mainnet uh less likely because the gas fees are high um yeah what what features do you see adding in the near future yeah the check-in intervals is something that we wanted to add in here we were looking at doing that off the blockchain to reduce the amount of data that we'd be actually writing to the box and we were hoping to do that with fluence but just our unfamiliar unfamiliarity with aquamarine and rust that prevented that from happening in in this time period but that's definitely the next thing that we want to do add in those uh checkpoints get the front end deployed on aws so it's easy for a user to interact with and then in the future like the next step would be to begin creating that doa and thinking of that process or d-way nice it's exciting to see yeah we really enjoyed this prog uh project and then as you mentioned like the gas fees being so cheap on polygon it's is next to nothing uh we actually couldn't believe how how cheap it was to deploy the contract on polygon versus like the ethereum main net and how much ether we needed for that and then it was like it was nothing it was less than a dollar to deploy to a polygon so using that i'd always thought of this as longer term goals but given the affordability on polygon this could absolutely be for near-term and short-term goals as well to help people who tend to procrastinate really get that done yeah i really like it yeah thanks um i i uh yeah i love the idea and concept like it's yeah the commitment device kind of structure is a great way to hold yourself accountable um i was curious like why you all um you know if if you yourself are the one that's attesting that you know the commitment's been met or whatever um why do you all feel like this should be uh decentralized right now yeah so i think it should be decentralized right now because that's the easiest way for a person to enter into a binding contract with themselves we make deals with ourselves like i'm going to get up at four in the morning and then we sleep in it's so easy but if you have money on the line you know if you put 500 on the line uh you know whatever is a significant amount of money for you then you're gonna you're going to get up because you don't want to lose that five hundred dollars right and so no i i get that i guess i i'm confused about like you know if i'm putting up the money and then i am also the one that says that i like met the conditions is that different from i don't know like me putting an envelope on my full of money on my nightstand and saying okay when i get up in the morning you know i get this otherwise i need to light it on fire or something yeah this is definitely a weakness of the dap in its current phase and that's why we we feel like it needs a dao in order to really have weight have a governing body of of peers that will ask for proof some kind of a product or something tangible to see that this this thing was done cool interesting stuff i think we are about up for time here so we're gonna have to move along thank you for the next group but thank you for presenting absolutely the next group here is ether blacklist hi you can present whenever you're ready hello i will present you ether blacklist which enables to blacklist scams addresses using nfgs so everyone knows that the ecosystem is full of hacks and scams and people but even protocols can be targeted as we saw this week with the polynetwork arc i think everyone is also aware of all these bots which come in all the social networks to ensure you to double your cryptocurrencies the problem is that blockchains are trustless environments and funds can easily be lost or stolen so i will take back the example of the polynetwork hack we can see that etherscan has targeted this address using several keywords and linking some information related to the app you can also see that polynetwork asked on their twitter to each exchanges and protocols to blacklist the address of the hackers so these approaches are mostly centralized and there's a lack of accessibility to the data and transparency so we want to provide a way to improve it using energies and drop printing to the bad actors so how does edit blacklist works first we have to identify the characters it can be done in a community in a community collaborative process using a dio or any dispute resolution platform after we have to drop them some energies which will be untransferable and unbelievable and then any protocols and that will be able to easily check for the existence and to implement automatical checks so what either blacklist brings to the ecosystem the blacklist will be stored on chain so anyone can access why how and who smart contracts can also implement some restrict some restrictions using such nsgs and they can also warn the user if they are trying to interact with a bad actor for example now it's time for the demo okay so we are on the ether blacklist page so we can enter another room address to check if it has been blacklisted so first i will connect with my meta mask and enter my address we can see that i don't hold any blacklist marks so you can enter it safely with me if you want to send a transaction everything will be good now i will check for this address which was involved in the network exploit few days ago you can see that it is notified as a hacker so if you want to still send a transaction to him you will have a warning asking if you are sure to continue now i will check for this address which holds two other marks identified as a scammer and extortionist and if i go on his wallet so this is the same address and we can see that it holds the two marks inside that nfte so what's coming next we will establish a sustainable business model then we will focus on the dio to provide a community a community created the list of bad actors and also to be able to fix and to burn marks if the community raised that they are not valid we will also provide an user-friendly interface to assist in the mark definition and airport process thank you feel free to contact us great question time i really liked the idea uh mostly because i thought of something similar like two days ago when i was in the shower i was like somebody needs to make a blacklist for hackers and scammers uh so i love this idea i think it's really great that you just drop the hacker like an nft and then you're able to mark them that way um one one potential issue i see there is like if they transfer that nfc once they receive that um like do you have a way to prevent them from being able to like get rid of the nft once they receive it actually uh it's untransferable and unburnable so you have to stay with us mark awesome uh yeah i think that's really great um because then apps can easily the way i'm seeing this like the nft airdrop is like this like utility because then you if someone has the nft then you you can just restrict a whole bunch of features from uh an app so i think there's a lot of potential in this uh in regards to like integrating with other apps um yeah i think you'd easily partner with a bunch of apps that would be happy to accept something like this yeah sure actually we have developed several functions in the contract allowing to check for a dedicated mark in order to have a boolean way to check for the existence of the user in a specific blacklist and also we have the the function that we we use in the enable in order to list every single mark that the dedicated address are currently on yeah i i like the idea a lot too i think it's uh uh there needs to be a better way of of tracking this two things i was curious about so um uh uh like one you know how i guess is there have you thought about like disputing this like if i'm like oh jack's my friend i'm i'm gonna mess with him so i'm gonna like blacklist his address and and uh see what happens like how would you handle that um is sort of question one and then question two is um uh uh you know like um i guess what uh um what keeps someone from like transferring you know the assets at the blacklisted address to you know another address is there some way you could like potentially have you know anything that address sends to get like tainted also or something yes so i will answer the first question sorry i have a really bad connection so if it's lacking uh joffrey will come back so for the selecting the bad actor so we want of course we want not uh to to be the centralized the centralized entity which will decide how who is uh backlisted so we want to use a io vote or even cleros or any dispute resolution platform but during the hackathon we just focus on providing the functional use case and we voluntarily make make this part off but we do not want to to be centralized because this can really uh bring a lot of a lot of uh central centralization blockchain so we don't want it and also there is several lists which can coexist for example if a coinbase wallet or anything any wallet wants to issue its own list of bad actors they can issue their own and the community can also create another to be used for one who wants whoever wants and for the question too i will let the joffrey answer yes so as we mentioned for now the token cannot be transferred and it's complicated to to know if it's a good thing to identify people that has already interacted with a market address because in the case of schemer the victims have not to be finger-pointed because they have been scammed so it's a case-by-case there is no generic answer to this question i guess yeah i guess uh more it's like if i if my address gets blacklisted and i just make a new wallet address and transfer my assets there or something like that is there anything you could do to prevent that type of behavior no we cannot cover or use cases that's why we are focusing on warning user for the scams but of course we the the director can always open a new wallet it's just the same issue with um email address if you're you're the dress you're using to scam people with blacklisted you can create a new one and do the same thing again makes sense yeah um but yeah at least uh uh you know getting getting that first one marked would you know would be good so i understood thank you thank you for presenting thank you i can find the next team uh and the next team is royalty free nft so if you guys uh i'm not sure if you're cool yes hello i'll share and after this one we're gonna have a 10-minute break introducing royalty-free nft we're a group of five developers and creatives who want to make it easy to license artistic work and sell it for use all without using any intermediaries currently the only options are centralized big license houses who siphon billions of dollars a year away from creatives our mission is to change this we aim to bring the control back to the creators in an open and transparent way do this by leaving you in control when you go to the token factory you will get your own nft contract this contract controls intellectual property as well as generates income from the license sales your files will always be decentralized because they're stored on ipfs that's using textile buckets the licensee can be rest assured that they're not infringing on your copyright as long as they have possession of the nft that you sold them it's structured in such a way that the first nft on the contract is actually the owner of the contract as well this master token works just like any other nfc all subsequent tokens after it are the license tokens when you first come to a platform you can see images videos and music that other people are licensing for use when you're ready to license your work you'll be presented with this page that will upload your work to ipfs you will then be presented with metamask transaction this transaction is creating your smart contract you have full control on access over this and this is where you sell your license any contract that you have ownership over will show up here in the ownership portal from here you can do administrative tasks such as change the license price or turn off minting to maintain our mission to be fully decentralized the next step is to create it down a percentage of the sales will go to the dow treasury this will be used by community members whose grants have been funded by the members of the dao we hope that you come join the discord so you can get involved with the dow thanks for your time yes so this was a presentation [Music] yeah i think uh just my my uh question off the bat would be like how does this um kind of compare to the uh sort of other nft market places um um you know and and you know the others that are that are also sort of uh you know fee free on the network like zora are you in uh two other decentralized networks yeah uh yes so this uh i'm you know so this was more to like to be competitor of more centralized services so other than centralized services which are similar to this would be a kind of competitor in our case so yes that's currently it's just similar features but more like centralized services are more like direct competitors for now so compared to the uh decentralized um uh kind of markets for nfts do you do you see this kind of being comparable uh yes so this is uh for um for contents like uh audio or image or video content so this kind of things can be done on our platform in in the mvp cool okay i think nicolas wants to say something he's on mute also yeah in addition to what church just said um the underlying contracts are not uh dealing with ownership but mostly with the the permission to use the content in in some way in some way uh creative uh because we we are very concerned about the ownership of the assets and for that reason like we are we're not trying to create like new ways of enforcing law or treat these nfts in a way that that regular artworks never have like we don't see we don't see that as a problem to solve in the creative economy uh we consider the problem is that first artists are not are underpaid due to the existence of like a myriad of mirrorless and that's why we we're just bringing the tools for them to to to use it and also that's why the dao it's in there because we we want to we want them to just not transfer not not be the competition of marketplaces but better be a new way for the artists to to put their artworks and let others um use it uh with some with certain terms that makes that makes it like a sustainable a business instead of just the wild west as it seems as it is seen now yeah i have a quick question on you deploying to polygon um uh is uh i i guess i'm like wondering why you would deploy to polygon if you wanted to have this be a market that's more for it's supposed to be a competitor to centralize providers that currently exist so you intend to kind of like evolve the platform into being a decentralized platform in the future um after you kind of like i guess like build a presence in the centralized marketplace world uh yes so this is this is already decentralized what we're building this is not centralized i just mentioned centralized because it's uh alternative to that uh so for now it's already decentralized it's um uploading files on ipfs and uh i have deployed contracts on polygon also and and adding to that um i think everything boils down to um to the to the scalability and i think polygon will make it easier to have like multiple transactions mostly because our technology if you um see it technically we are we are we are just creating factories like contract factories for the users so so there's gonna be like uh several kinds of transactions that need to be taken and so polygon is seems like a good fit to have uh like kind of batches of transactions that are gonna be piling up uh yeah it's cost effective mostly all right i think that is all the time that we have thank you for presenting uh we're going to go to a quick 10-minute break which means we'll be back at 1 50 eastern time and for every other time zone it's whatever 10 minutes is from now the next team that will go after that is googly.eth googly.f it's one of those um if you could please raise your hands so that we're all ready to resume when we come back that would be excellent and for everyone else i'll see you in 10 minutes alrighty i think we're about ready to get back to it just wait for our judges and get on with googly dot s or ath which one is it we're going to find out googly e both of them were wrong all right but close enough um i hope we're here for renewal sweet you can get going with the video whenever you're ready [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] great question time um could you guys describe um i didn't quite get exactly what the main purpose of the project was uh i saw the tagline at the ends that it's a blockchain based notary service um but in your showcase description you describe it as a place to backup data so is it solely for notaries or is it like bigger than just being able to get documents signed and verified and store it on ipfs bigger than just that like people it basically you upload documents and if you want you can add other users to it but the documents get composed to a single page that's stored as a hash which is the document so the url is the actual website it's not actually hosted anywhere and then or if they want it'll have verification to check identity and then people can sign documents make sure they're all looking at the same piece i'll sign it and then get an nft showing that everyone signed it all the hashes of the signatures the documents so that it's and then on the blockchain got it uh the nft is pretty cool um yeah i think there's a lot of interesting things you can do with just bringing document signing on chain just because you can have um you have the programmability of smart contracts so um can you can go to all kinds of incentives um that would be better than like using something like docusign um or other other centralized services that exist yeah we want to build in a bunch of like kyc verification services that are optional but where one if someone does all of them it's definitely that person like voice analyst live face detection so that it's like it's them do a fingerprints print scan with the phone so it's and then can clearly identify it's that person but still keep it anonymous whereas they can have the verification that it's them in the name but they don't have to disclose any of their other details but through the platform people know that it's verified right you want to kind of have some like contract side to it where we want to create an open source repository for people to upload contracts and then if they're used have a reward system based on the content that was used if they were the original person if not the person that they got some of the content from kind of have everything scanned in and a proper reward system so everyone that was on the chain of people along that implemented that document gets a little bit of their piece because they inspired that person which inspired that person etc that sounds pretty cool kind and build up that side as well and then if someone needs a contract there's a whole repository of them for them yeah that sounds really interesting if you could i do a quick live showing of it please yeah that would be great i i was looking at the website and uh or the you know the live download link and it looks pretty sweet so basically this is the main page people can put an email address add another signer witness i can go to upload a document document submit it takes a couple seconds and then uploads okay guess the web3 store is checked and then you can click here to approve another user and then the unlock will pop up so that you can check the user and then just for uh time so you can get the uh hatch of everything with the document all the signers on it and then has the um the ipfs link and then sorry that was just hidden by that um you can do the documents i can click on an nda pick the dates and then it kind of inputs the user one user two where they need to go in the document and then can get that as a hash back as well after everyone's signed through and then that can be converted into a qr code so that it can be backed up that way the qr code has password protection on it so and it kind of does it into a short url so basically in the nft you would have the full uncompressed hash as kind of like the master or the private key of the file and then the short one with the password could be like a public one that they send around and share if someone gets it it's password protected and they don't have access to anything does that make sense yeah i think i think there's a lot of potential i can easily see this taking over docusign in the near future awesome yeah i love this idea too like dating back to uh i don't know if you all ever came across this project stampery a long long time ago and a number of others like you know six or seven years ago um i think uh uh this is this is clearly like a great use case for decentralization at least clearly to to me but no one cracked the nut around making it usable enough um i one quick question i guess if we have the time on the password protected access is there some like encryption set up or or something that protects that or or uh is it basically kind of um you know like not h the ui won't let you view it if you don't have that password yeah it just won't open up the file so like if i went to the ipfs could i still get it or um um on i if you had the icid from ipfs yes but you wouldn't have the completed thing with signatures and the website with the signatures is just generated from the url hash so technically if someone didn't give you that hash if someone just typed that they would come up with the same documents so there's unless it actually came from them there's no way to prove that it's the right one so even if someone typed it randomly and found something it could just be that they randomly type something that coded that yeah no it makes it makes sense yeah just to add something the the short answer is the the website the the html page you saw is not stored in pfs the the base 64 of the page is stored in the url itself so that's the security part and the the url sharpener basically it's just password protecting the the long url so the basics before your own oh yeah that makes sense so you're effectively like centralizing that um kind of password protection mechanism but the kind of yeah okay that makes sense yeah it could be cool to uh you know like as an extension explorer like you know if you could have trustless password protection that would be some you know some encryption mechanism or something potentially but um yeah you're looking at including new cypher some people can give documents and people can give private keys a unique private key to someone to access it so then it'll be uh oh that would be super cool that's like next level right where no one has the uh the decrypted content it's like the keys charted across yeah yeah everyone has their own decryption key that's pretty neat cool and then all the components are stored in docker containers on ipfs as well so everything is completely decentralized all right well that looks like a cool project thank you so much for presenting it the next team up is cordify so you guys should be promoted if you could share your screen and we can get going uh your view appears to be muted sorry you will need to reshare on zoom again with audio codeify is a decentralized record-keeping service for codes which uses ipfs for evidence collection it uses polygon network in the blockchain site and uses the api of inferior for the ipfs the bollywood contract is verified as you can see here basically it has four tabs right now once the home then the create this is for creating a keys this is for uploading the evidence for each cases and the interview case detail so let's go back home and click create it asks for a few details like the date the state the district the code the petitioner id the name and the type so we can fill in the details like the date can be today's state let's say state one district of zero as well as a particular number if the person is already in the system then he can add the petition id as the corresponding id address id number else he can just put it as zero and in the place of name he can add his name with each name and the type of the case let's say it's two that's a random number based on the type of case and we can click create it's waiting for confirmation the case is created and as you can see the case study is 2 and we can view the transaction it's successful let's go back now we can either upload an evidence or go back let's first go back and check the case details and you can see the view of the records case number the dates the state district variation and type and let's now upload in evidence case number is to choose file let's open it blockchain.jpg upload and upload into ipfs it's uploaded to ipvs and now it's writing to the blockchain let's screw the gas confirm upload is complete let's go back just view the details case number is two new details as you can see that is the image we try to upload so that's a basic overview of codify and how this works there is a lot of possibilities on how we can improve this and how the smart contract is written on the smart front end and the back end integration is done so there is a lot of room for improvements and we are looking forward to it thank you it's cool that uh uh googly and you all went back-to-back cause there's a lot of similarity uh uh so yeah i think it it seems super cool i'm curious uh uh where kind of you all see decentralization um kind of being most helpful here so the thing is like um we have we are from india so we have a very old system of keeping records so it's mainly paper based so if there becomes some problem in the paper so there are incidents like fire and all those things so if that document is missed or though those argument is misplaced that is uh gone forever so this is something which we are trying to solve with this uh solution and this is just a basic version so starting with like uh we can have this as an initial pilot program in a small uh district court or something like that and to prove that yeah this is a working proof of concept and it can be uh scaled to a very high level even for a big country like india and then we can move on uh with more uh things included in that so uh first of all we wanted to leave this as a proof of concept but then we can also add like um this might sound weird when we just fast for after googly. but uh this is something which we also think like to provide the judges or the people who are going to uh give the results on these cases can have write those data or those results into these uh cases along with alongside these things so that will also be a record keeping so it will be tapper proof it will be always in the blockchain so it will be accessible by anyone so these are some things which we see as an improvement to the system cool yeah i i think this is a really uh for my like short experience of like uh seeing the kind of work that's done at court um i think this is a major improvement and so like well at least from from what i've seen in the us it's a major improvement um like it's all it's all done with uh paperwork and like old um both computer systems uh where what features do you think of adding next to what you currently have in this project so we started with the file system so that these are mainly saved in the blockchain and the ibfs but also uh we were thinking like to provide the verdicts and the judgment of or each cases to these things like as bubbly roti said like not rising with it with each advocates and each uh judges details so these will be always be tamper proof and will not be editable or is easily accessible by anyone so we can see that there are many cases where other cases are referred back and these can be easily accessible by each time whenever these kind of things happens so this is something which we see as an improvement to the current system yeah that's really cool all right with that i think we're on to our next team thank you so much for presenting i think your next group here to go is disco rock repo that's a very exciting name um if you guys could raise your hands and we can get you in here and there we go uh yeah present whenever you're ready okay awesome hmm sure hi everyone disco rock repo is a storage and retrieval app for audio and video files you have to use the textile hub to store the files on ipfs for short-term storage where an ipns link is generated for quick and easy file retrieval the longer term storage of music or video playlists files are archived on filecoin where plans for future iterations would be to build a large data store of music and videos covering the time periods and music genres let's see a quick demo details on how to generate this key are in the readme so using the unique key from my textile hub account i'm able to access the the six buckets that i have in uh in this particular in this particular repo let's take a look inside of one so i use this app to store to store all of these files in these individual buckets the one we're looking at is disco music from the 1970s you see we have files in there uh donna summer uh video files these are pretty much video files some some are uh but let's say that you wanted to go and you wanted to want to listen to one of the files do you want to watch one of the videos associated with if you click on this this very cool ipfs link and there you go so you you can watch your videos you could you can listen to your music very very cool so once you're done building your playlist you can store it on right so here you can choose the minor that you want to deal with uh how many let's say that you want to do it with four different miners and just let the program choose who the miners are your your time periods this is six months and your maximum price if you click on this it would send it off to text.hub making deals with different miners based on the parameters that you chose here which is very very cool okay the app was deployed to ipfs using fleek and a url to it can be found in the readme okay in addition to to expanding the music library and improving functionality of the app i plan on adding pay for building a playlist feature where users can pay to build a playlist using file coin or polygon as we see there is a metamask hookup see you can hook up our metamask account there uh on this upper upper right toolbar thanks for watching yeah just off the bat i love the idea of um kind of you know creating these music repositories uh you know and and giving people the the freedom around that um with respect to like the 60s and 70s music how does uh the licensing for that work or like is that content uh licensed right now uh some is licensed some has gone off license uh i guess it's it depends on what you pick and uh and i chose that period of time because we're starting to see a lot of people are really concerned about um having a youtube account and their personal information being tapped into a lot of people are migrating over to rumble because they they kind of they trust that more so so the idea of decentralizing something like this would be i think would be a layup for them and it would it would be a good solution for that that problem of keeping their personal information uh private that's cool so there's i guess a uh there's a kind of an easy way to find this like royalty free or no license needed uh music from that time period um that's that's awesome um and yeah i could totally see you know other you know we come across this use case like in our our work at um audience often like there are a lot of folks who want to kind of archive uh historical content in a way that's like you know permanent right and that doesn't really exist so yeah super cool awesome what are you thinking for smart contract features i know you have like metamask there on on the app so what do you think in there um well i'm thinking that that would be like the hookup of giving um the users an option to make their own playlists and a way for them to to pay for it so you would think as you as you mentioned for one of the other presentations that polygon is so cheap that you could you know you users could could go nuts make a lot of playlists download a lot of a lot of songs and make a lot of files using using polygon um although you know filecoin is is a bit is a bit more expensive i kind of really haven't figured figured out that that particular part of it but uh but that would be i guess like a payment mechanism and that's how i would introduce the smart contracts into it to make playlists how does uh discoverability of the repos work like how to uh like if i'm if i just stumble on this the website like what is my browser going to to find what repos exist um okay if if you uh if you take a if you take a look back at the video um the the link that you have is is wrong so i'm gonna update that uh because i was tinkering around this morning and i and i actually knocked it offline but um so trying to create like just a big data store of many many many samples you know we've only been working on this for two weeks so it's kind of you know it's very labor-intensive so if you look at this say three to six months from now i mean you're going to see a much bigger library of of offerings and they're they're all in you know the different types of genres different recording artists would be in in textile buckets so you could get an ipf best address and you could go straight into it and take what you need from it yeah i i actually um i i more meant from the kind of technical perspective so like when i guess like you know if there's there's sort of many of these repos is there some registry of of them that like my browser can go pull that list from or or how does that work i see okay so so now that that would be another feature where we kind of have like like a database where you could search you know donna summer or or led zeppelin or or whatever and it would access the database and then it would point you to downloading that i mean that would be have to be something that would be added okay oh that that's all good yeah i was just curious is it looked like it was able to list uh quite a few there of like the top level things um cool yeah what you're seeing are are the actual buckets themselves so you could have you could have clicked on one of those offerings and you could have seen the contents inside of those buckets so if i make a new bucket does it get added to that list somehow um right now so now that's let's say you're you're opening your your own account or you have your own textile hub account oh i see i see so it's coming from textile okay that makes sense sorry i didn't mean to like go way down i was just trying to wrap my head around it that makes sense that's a okay all right very cool i think with that we are on to our last team here thank you for presenting thank you so much for the opportunity uh the last team to go here but certainly not at least is puma hey folks you know i work at puma because i have a puma sticker all right stop the video yeah present whenever you're ready [Music] hi folks my name is yuri i'm with puma and as part of the second one we thought we'd ship a few features or at least start on the few features that we always wanted puma to have um and so even though puma is kind of gonna go ongoing project that we're building uh all the demos and all the things i'll be talking about today are were built as part of the hackathon and this weekend and it's also super early so a lot of things are pretty hard voted but the three big things that we are building and hoping ship live in in the coming months are the ethereum wallet support uh the unlock protocol support and the web3 storage support and so for uh for the ethereum wallet uh what you'll see today you'll just be able to uh we just can't load and hard code it a couple of wallets that we have for lock uh owner and uh lock user um kind of key holder and then uh the unlocked protocol uh is able to so we're able to detect if a page has a lock on it um there's a first step and then you can also buy the or get the lock uh sort of key yeah if you want to and then the third one is the last sort of the least progress we've made uh on the weekend but we're hoping to ship uh somewhere soon is on the web 3 storage uh where you'll be able to set your api key for your storage uh and be able to save pages i think it's really awesome to be able to archive pages whether you want to read them later or for posterity or for public data set reasons and we're really excited for you to be able to do that through puma and without further ado let's jump into some demos let's try the screen [Music] hope you can see it um all right yeah so uh here's tomorrow we'll get you the links to test flight hopefully uh soon and so the first part is the ethereum wallet if you go to settings and ethereum account um right now we're kind of hardcoded a couple of um accounts one for the lock user uh but this is his or her ethereum wallet and again don't worry about the private key being shown right now it's on testnet uh it says hackathon so move fast and record private keys for everybody to see on youtube um but you can see the address in the private key here and then um depending on the log so we likely also had like manually one of the demo locks that we created for for the demo and you can see that the user i think we need to re-link them yeah so you can see for this particular lock the user has the key and then as a lock owner you also have a key and slightly different balance and then the get key button is the one that will be able to buy the keys with right now both of the users already have the key so get kit does nothing but that's how we got them in the first place and then if you go to a page that has a lock on it for example this one um you can see that right now we'll just demo you like hey found a log on this page again in the future you'll be able to buy a key or actually access it if your account has the particular key and then the last thing is the web3 storage settings um again still will work on it so it can like work in progress but you'll be able to paste your api key here save it and then go and save whichever page uh you want into your storage uh and maybe share the link with public in the future cool uh hope you like it and we're gonna continue working on it uh later this year and hopefully ship it soon thank you so much cool so you you built a browser from scratch right so to clarify pokemon is my ongoing project is my company uh but i love i love participating in hackathons and shipping um shipping new real features that will eventually go into production and we did that uh in the past actually at the d5 hydrophone before the lockdown but uh some of the things didn't get shipped but a big fan of kind of making sure that the work that this started on a hackathon is um not in vain and and then sees the light eventually but again everything is pretty like hardcoded in rudimentary and i didn't demo at the last part but if you paste like right now you can't uh what we want to do is we want to when you're on a particular page similar i don't know if you use pocket or any other like read it later um type of web so we want you to be able to just like you know store something for offline user pin it to your browser in a cache where you'll be able to read it on a subway or other places but right now if you paste an api key we just load all the files in the list in the settings as a way for you to um to just you know click on them and see that which again like hackathon so it's you know pretty fast but actually kind of working uh and then uh narrator kind of like alert is that the test flight is still being approved by apple so we're still waiting for the build to be approved by apple so but as soon as as soon as we have a tesla link i'll share it with you um nice yeah i i uh it definitely wowed me because i wasn't expecting a browser mobile browser very cool especially with like the built-in um ft feature with like being able to detect if there's a lock on the page yeah we like we started with you know privacy focus and micro payments and a lot of fun stuff we result in shakiness and a bunch of things but we kind of snoozed on having a human wallet we thought that that thing would be figured out by now but still wide open market and definitely excited to to bring a fully uh fully proper ethereum wallet and then unlock protocol i've known julian for many years and it's like nice dude to finally partner up and officially uh collaborate and then work through storage again like we've been i've known ipfs folks before they were cool and so uh we've had like ipvs preview support in a while and kind of quiet beta we want to make sure that it's very very good once once we ship but uh it's been there for a while thanks well yuri is good to see you it's been a month or two i think since uh uh miami um and yeah obviously you know i'm a i'm a big fan of puma and everything you all do um i i was uh wondering is is the code for uh this going to be open sourced i i saw when i clicked through the repo it um it shows the repository is empty yeah we um we're trying to figure out so we'd love to be open source and if we uh go the direction of a network and a token then definitely everything's going to be open source right now we're you know still a private company with venture back so it's like we're being very mindful with uh promising the open source of the of the browser because it's really easy to open sources it's really impossible to take it back so uh for now always no i i guess i guess just like the hackathon stuff or maybe it doesn't make you can't really do that right that's not maybe that doesn't really make sense another reminder to be like hey let's figure out a way for people to be able to contribute and have more things in the open um so we're trying to figure that out we'll at least have some sort of like road map feature set um other ways to for the community to see what's going on inside um but uh i think in an ideal world we'd love everything to be open source um and
