welcome everybody to hack money I am Karthik one of the cofounders of beat global and today is day four of our defy hackathon judging so for those of you who don't know on the livestream hack money is a hackathon organized by youth global and for the past four weeks we've had over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones work on projects in the divided space we have people from all these amazing countries we've had over 40 mentors who put in time and helped out our hackers from anything to technical and product and marketing use cases and of course a whole set of amazing sponsors from the defy ecosystem that have made it possible for our hackers to integrate their SDKs and really extend the vision of composability so as I mentioned before we've had over 350 hackers and the last four weeks working on projects in the Defy space and has a Sunday night I'm proud to announce that we've had a hundred eighteen BFI projects that were submitted for this hackathon I can comfortably say that this alone has easily doubled the number of dfi projects in our entire ecosystem and we're spending this entire week showcasing a lot of these projects and going through our judging in a live manner to everybody else also see the cool things that have been built by our amazing developers so when I quickly walk through the logistics of how the next two hours are going to work we have 13 teams presenting today and each team will have four minutes to demo what they've built in and talk about their project and their motivations after that they'll have three minutes for additional questions and feedback from our judges and to kind of save any a view related issues we've also asked everybody to record a demo of thier hack and we'll be playing those videos instead of doing a lot of things love this gives seven minutes to each team and this will keep us properly on schedule and is a quick overview of how the logistics of the event were set up the rules and criterias for this were simple a team could have a maximum of five members and they could also work individually if they chose to the only condition we added was that their hack must incorporate 85 primitive whether that be stable coins or or any of our protocols in from the sponsor side or just in general to defy arena and all code that was submitted must have been written during the course of the hackathons everything you will be seeing today was started in and finished over a course of four weeks and the way we're gonna go about judging these projects today is is going to be filtered down to these five categories we're going to be looking at these projects from a technicality and the originality of of their project and the idea and sort of how practical it is and in addition how easy it is to use by anybody else or the audience or design the tools for whether that be a developer or a array consumer and then a general catch-all that we like to call a factor that lets us all set and sort of highlight any projects that may not fit in any of these categories and just to kind of reiterate that this is not a competition the hackers are here to learn and they're here to share their excitement and really tell you and show off what they've built over the period of last month and the judges here are to give us and give them feedback on their projects not everybody's trying to become a business nor is that the intention for this event we really want to make sure that we cannot keep experimenting and and taking a lot of our ideas and inspirations to the next level by telling others what could be possible so with that I want to quickly go over the schedule we have 13 teams that are going to be presenting today and these are our teams for the day and the doing the hard work are going to be three of our judges Jesse Walden who is an angel investor and exit part and listen partner in recent Horowitz Victor Bonin who is at bison trails and Dennison Bertrand was a co-founder tap hero these three will be our judges for the next two hours and doing all the hard work that were extremely thankful for so with that I'd like to actually kick off this judging today and invite the zapper team so please welcome our first demo hey moon or ear muted everyone I think that was like a video supposed to be played for us because you know you submitting for it yeah just give me one second I am making sure that is being set up awesome hi everyone one i'm nora from zapper and together with sahil's de paris turnip or we've built pool pipes so the last year once we've actually spent refining liquidity provisioning experiences across the by in general and today we feel like we're introducing something that will help reduce the quiddity fragmentation across defy so pool pipes they'll help you rebalance liquidity between different pools in one transaction so how does it work liquidity is first removed from a pool which are currently part of and this is done in a way to help you rebalance your required assets for the new pool and you were the least slippage and finally liquidities added to the new pool there's available pipes between the same platform such as you nice walk to you swap or within different underlying platforms so a really good example to take a look would be a curve to you swap pool so what happens here is first liquidity is removal curve it's been rebalanced for the underlying of proportions for the pool on units WAP and of course then added to pool and eunice watt finally to help you mentos LP tokens a really like specific use case would be transfer and liquidity from the set pool to the SSD critical some of the incentives were transferred over recently to this new poland curve from the synthetic steam turn credits the quiddity there so a lot of liquidity providers have been taken advantage of this so i'm sure you have quick demo of how this actually works you would first of course connect your wallet and under invest ab you'll see all the pools which are currently part of you can click rebalance them the ones that you actually want to transfer a degree from so how much you want to rebalance where you'd like to rebalance this new liquidity - and finally just click confirm you'll see if this is your first time using it - notifications come up of course first to improve fugly token transfer and then after to actually make the topic transfer of the of your LP tokens now once your transaction has in the process you will see something like this of an ether stamp I did you see here first liquidity is removed from this pool on you swap its then rebalanced in to die and US DC and finally is then added to the curve ball and as an eye result you end up receiving these curve pool tokens back to your wallet and that is it for our demo the way we made these pipes is very modular so there's a pipe between the two underlying platforms allowing you to then as you know transfer liquidity between any pools within those on the line platforms in the future we're planning to build a robot polar which will help you rebalance this liquidity automatically to optimize the best you and finally we want to of course add support for more and more pooling opportunities as they become available so things like creature swap shell and others are really exciting opportunities for us so we're gonna happy then they're coming online so yeah that's a that's it for our presentation and you know again we hope to defragment liquidity across defy with pool pipes thank you I love defragment liquidity that's a really good mean and and it's really cool it's a really cool idea super useful thanks yes something we're thinking to improve like I said all the time yeah this is Viktor I think it's really cool as well I'm something I'm curious about is oftentimes with the decision to defragment is like profit-driven depending on like what kind of yields and stuff is our available in these different pools how much of that information is able to be made available to folks that are making these choices yes so we have that general invest tab that has explore investment opportunities which basically lists all the pools in one table so it's you swap P 1 V 2 curve and soon balance or pools and you're able to view things like total liquidity volume and we're adding ROI to most of them got it very cool and then my other question is like if you're doing like dollar equivalents for like tokens and I'm like rebalancing those is there the ability to switch out of like synthetic she was deed to another asset like another ARS u-20 as part of this yeah of course that's that would basically be called zapping out like you wanna switch like auger or some other like token like that within the pool you're talking about like yeah girl group oh yeah of course yeah you could do that as well yes that's what makes this kind of kind of like a playground for builders there could be lots of different reasons for you to kind of shift your liquidity it could be anything from like a general market shift to a shifts in liquidity provisioning incentives kind of like what synthetics has done from unis water curve or it could be just general shifts and trading activity within the liquidity pools so there could be another liquidity pool that becomes really popular you know the volume is really high compared to total liquidity provided so you might be better off providing liquidity there for the time being very home yeah and if I can add on there quickly especially like for the ROI the goal is to like the user user can come in with like a defined goal can be accumulating if your ether and based on that we can adjust how we rebalance automatically and also like present the important the irrelevant information for him to kind of know when or when not to rebalance mm-hmm yeah cool not actually answer the question I had about to what the wedge might be for automatic rebalancing but yeah if you're gonna ask users what that looks like I think that's a good idea cool also well thank you so much for our very first amazing demo and what that we'll move on to our next team which I'll steep beach hackers with nifty Phi thank you guys on stage you antonio and you know how to and andre i know you guys are on panelist would you mind starting your screen share if everything is I think Antonio Rodriguez not connected yet and they will perform the presentation there the other room hello guys do you hear me yes okay great I'm going to present the video sounds perfect it is a little bit fast so we hope you understand it okay should we start yes please go for it okay hello my name is antonio confort I'm going to present you beautify our team BH hackers is composed by Luna follow an electrical engineer and the Assad is a lawyer myself a loofah hater and listen justice both developers what is securitisation it is a highly regulated process that ensures that the value of a security equals the value of a real essence what is fungibility it's the concept that ensures that two things have identical value and if these non fungible tokens they always different from one another so they cannot be traded by one another without loss of value they cannot be divided they are usually used on games collectibles unique reports arts we have a theoretical problem he quitted constraints prevent enough piece to reach its full potential in terms of price and transact ability what is the best way for another unique luckily a unique digital works for sale to monetize these or her assets the mainstream role is to put the NFP only auction house or traditional printer exchange and try to sell fair enough the nevertheless all these solutions they create economic efficiencies and why the main intrinsic characteristic of a nfe is its uniqueness different from what happens with eligible tokens such as Bitcoin that has been trading for years and have market exposure and if these most likely have never been traded so it has no price formation this means that any completed transaction probably configured another priced cell so what is this er securitization well remember traditionally a regulator is required to guarantee the equivalence of value between the security and the NFT marketability could benefit from a set of corporate governance principles it could be written in a smart confer that's how 55 provides a decentralized collateral mechanism without any special record fully guarantee my coat without the need for compliance or regulators and it enforces that the value of the share is now is equivalent to the percentage of this full of civil shareholders women's it is possible to redeem then if the afterwards this nifty file that provides easily securitisation often if these and by creating punchable shares that can be negotiated it allows they collectible to receive price formation their owner stakes their ft on the mystify protocol and generates a set of shares the buyer buys those shares in acquired or top 10 ft whenever whenever their shares are commuted the owner can do whatever he wants with them he can sell it on the teacher mortgage or goods dam on a traditional exchange whoever it acquired or shares become ordinary holders off net in a super shareholders agreement has an exit price in a drag along flows the exit price is the maximum price that anyone can pay 10 ft in whenever anyone pays the price at the exit or even if 5 what is example my create an NFC contact god or keys first the urging are a psychotic Jesus and Ernestine indeed away they percent ultra shares after they start to pile in this case is the same that the original by the token paid with shares and either at the valuation of the usage price so he receives the AFT the other ordinary holders can claim that started either it didn't I couldn't even make the shares do you okay guys oh very very cool I'm awesome for you guys which is what so beyond sounds like a financial you know unlock of a fractional ownership of an NF t what what do you where do you think this could go in terms of like real utility so if you have like a whole community of people Co owning an NF t where you know what what do you think is interesting about that beyond financial speculation well I think one application could be on terms of decentralized organizations because we are building governance rules [Music] into a NFT security secret securitizing mechanism and this this allows people to share us a set of property and and sell that order for token but I think that the main application is by four to divide a NFT to have a mechanism for price formation to to have more liquidity but I think other applications could be on this area of corporate governance that's how I see it cool thanks I had a question like for for insecure icing like NF T's what do you see as like this allows you to take existing entities could you imagine using this something in the beginning and sort of like the creation of entities as well where people sort of like securitize something that they create at the beginning yeah of course it could be done we didn't think for any any of any kind of creative mode or for an FPS but let's imagine a machine learning algorithm that creates digital art and you have this unique piece of digital art and you don't know the price of it right so if you sell it as a whole in a one-time transaction probably you you you you didn't get the best price you could so the best way to put this on the market to have its price evaluated is to tokenize it and securitize it and then you have this piece of art that can be that can have a maturation time on the markets and have its price formation instead of just giving the NFT in a one-time transaction so yes the the answer for this question is if you create a new NFT you could use the the nifty fight protocol to securitize it and sell it in a more efficient way fascinating I never was running out of time oh never mind okay thank you guys this is really cool thank you very much yeah very cool perfect thank you so much it's if I ain't with that is welcome and F wallets to present their demo Halley the one my name is eijah my wallet my contribution to the global intact so well it tries to be the best way for you to old asset exchange and to defy and most importantly move a position and effect relation for monochrome color so here you can see that a few and if that's away but you can to create a new one just gives a new button button here I'm not dealing with parties and this is my party status I and receives a min button to Peyton you want you can see that this is the usual its introduction this is yes and later transaction so this application in V is maintained adjacent to by default this means that we want to pay for the gas and you have a simple smooth transition to a smooth transaction a few moments later so the transaction was successful and you can see other than you are with you obviously if I want I can disable the Jets entertainment that for now let's have a look at this wallet this wallet he is already holding a bunch of assets at ETH habit a few ERC train is already seven seven seven I could also hold a certain ones and I have position loss on alien compound additionally also known that is octopi part of this deposit has an address and this is obviously being so this is a token ID if you want to try all your sheep on the sides so this way it is holding assets obviously you can send the assets to order pizza matters but you can also use yunusov v2 to scrap possibly children or you can access your other income compliance as I stated previously here we can see that on Ally and with a deposit of almost six hundred died and I which one is in exchange so that is B so let's we pay part of this of this of this board to the repay tab and we pay let's say we pay - it's so I'm being at my position okay no this is a usual portage transaction which I disabled Jason twelve seconds later because it restricts it so as you can see here my room is a bit smaller and I've lost a few as it was I had to repay my loan the addition to having compound I can also manipulate it on a token right so you can deposit bit wrong to this non front wallet so pay with news about its connection to it here iam using this and a non-fun cheaper wallet from it so oh this is nice but not review what's very interesting is that this position that includes assets deposits on having component I'm alone I can transfer it all at once charity so let's say I want to send that alright don't worry about it to make metal equipment I can put my anything here and click the transfer button yes a few moments later nice accessibility the transfer button is disabled and this is also true of the send mechanism and tracking mechanism as well as this is because I'm no longer the owner of this order so let's switch icon to see what it goes just disconnected and I can reconnect using NS loading if you want to more or less early check out TRC 2525 this just checked out that is compoun so it has been to login with me thanks obviously it was written as import is even if you don't have this reenactment okay and here we can see that buttons are enabled obviously I am logged in with the owner of this wallet so if you try it out maybe you can include project to manage vendor of assets or to move question in d5 so different account and user so thank you for paying attention and feel free to contact me on social media if you got any question then so so just so I understand correctly you have a wallet sort of like an identity contract wallet that holds your positions and sort of represents you and now rather than sort of like sending each position you have or moving your money specifically with the wallet you actually just send the whole wallet to someone else exactly and you may have multiple wallets like that so you may have a wallet - all I said you want to own like UNF teeth and have a different one for a position or you can create one to collect specific entities like baseball cards and just have a wallet contain an entire collection and then you can send this collection without sending the rest of your assets and what's important and that's not been put out in the video is that ownership of the wallet abide by ERC 7:21 rules so you can take a position with deposits and loan and put this position on open sea let's go any other questions um not a question but I do think that that like this is really cool and really special I would like to know like what inspired you to think about it and this way or like what I sparked you to build it so there are few things to say first I mean I'm very much involving smart contractor i things are amazing and it's an ecosystem that is moving more and more we've seen argent become live doing this hackathon and I wanted to take the other direction not like one smart contract on it where you all or your asset with social recovery and that kind of features but see like how can we be creative with small like this portable transferable I count and so it's just a very simple smart contract there is no recovery mechanism or anything like so smart contract could be owned by a smart contract relate that as recovery and see how creative you can be and it was also like a styling the size of saying hey I may need if I project can I include in that can I make sure that the UX is simple so GSN like make sure that everything 25 is compatible with smart contracts wallets interesting a question that I have would be like what is an ideal long-term usage of this like something that comes to mind for me for example is it would be like in the GFI space if you like fascinating if somebody like a trader was like known for building certain positions and then selling that wallet with all those positions saying like hey I've constructed this essentially portfolio of bets like what do you think would be like really I seen 100 bullets as building block for older people to be creative I'm just like the guy proposing so taxing Hey just imagine identities as transferrable and my first view was like let's take a nice bunch of NF T's and be able to transfer them all at once or let's transfer position but I'm sure like using this technology you can envision much more complex use cases so the idea is not to develop a front end that is the access to all of d5 because other people are doing that better than I am doing the idea is providing this blog so that people can be creative and I'm sure that there is a usage for that in the context of photo projects amazing thank you awesome well thank you so much and with that we'll move on to our next team and that is project T CDP who have tokenized CDP's so I'll let them kick off with their demo hi do you hear me loud and clear I do hear me yes okay so um let's go on you hey ping we don't have value here would you mind confirming that you're sharing audio on zoom' as well excuse me we can see we're not getting audio for the video we only just see a video so I think the audio settings are oh well I find that that's the Box again yes ization issue when you hi I'm here to present our project of the hackathon T CDP a fungible collateralised that position in brief it's a shirt and tokenized position the problem we would like to solve is the over cauterization issue when using the efi landing platform such as maker dao compound and ave take maker dao as example the average collateralization ratio is over 300 percent and is driven by the fear of liquidation penalty people have their eat locked up tomorrow died below liquidity of CDP is not so good as the liquidity of eat itself also maintaining collateralization ratio is a tough issue cdb holders are constantly fear of liquidation the solution is quite simple we create a share token I see DP or in short TC VP which will automatically rebalance so you don't need to worry about liquidation and it's fungible it's an ER C 20 token that can be traded directly on the central axis changes here's how it works for example if a user enters 1/8 to the system it would be deposited to either compound or evade depends on who has a better founding rate then the system grows some die out depends on the value of each eventually user will receive 80 died in 1 TC DP which represents partial ownership of the position there's an auto rebalance mechanism which will automatically leverage or they'll average to maintain the positions ratio between a predefined range as you can see if you consider TC DB as a pool consists of eath as collateral and die as that then TC DP is a portion of the CDP which is in fact a bond of asset and debt you can trade it on exchanges like Khyber swap or Yunus wall TC DB token is tradable and it brings back the liquidity of CDP and at the same time act like a lavish token that's walked through the interface first there's a dashboard you can see how much t CDEP is mended and which platform LS using currently then if you're willing to open the CDP the Ender how much eat you will like to deposit and you can see how much t CDP and die you are going to receive press the deposit button same transaction confirm the transaction after the wall you may see that you receive some die and corresponding TC DP there are two functions that will be used too often the first one is to rebalance it will be used only when the pools collateralization ratio is 25% away from the target the second one is flash migration which will swap the whole position from compound to Ave if there's a batting found and rate and vice versa we are using liquidity front dydx for the migration the last part if you want to settle your TC DP position there's two options first you can repay that and die burn your TC DP token and receive the underlying asset eat proportionally enter the amount of TC DP you like to burn this is the first time you'll need to approve the I to the poor beforehand then you may send the transaction as a result you are repaid die burn TC DP token and get it back if you don't want to or don't have enough die to repay that there's a second wait for settlement you can directly solve your TC DP token on exchanges and you're done that's simple that's it feel free to browse our github repository and try to our D app TC DP super cool because can you know help me this is vector can you help me understand how this solves the terrible Eric over collateralization I challenge Lee mentioned up front it's still over collector eyes because it's required by the lending platform but when you are using that kind of platform you cannot directly trade your whole position that you need to repay that before you withdraw the underlying and trade it to others but when using T CDP you can trade the whole bundle the untaught with asset and depth together do you have them do you have any sense of like who the the buyer for this type of asset might be or you know like what the dynamics of the marketplace would look like yeah so you may consider TC DP as leverage talkin like is east but 40% of that would sound quite beautiful and the second wise for a B charger - like by your procedure and repay that for you right that's really cool awesome this is super cool thanks again pinging team and with that we'll move on to our next demo so please welcome Paul and Aria from uni Lou okay hey my name is Paul and I'm gonna be telling you about our hack money hack euni-unni is the easiest way for groups to receive and spend money uni is good for early-stage businesses shared interest groups and movements and causes with that a little bit of context let me show you how it works let's hop into a clickable figma demo I've downloaded the Uni app and I'm ready to create my first unique group let's go ahead and click create give the group a name I can quickly see basically what to expect about how the app works click Next and as simply as that I have a link that I can share in whoever I have an existing group that has a group chat maybe on telegram or whatsapp or iMessage so I can click here to copy the link and now imagine your user that got that link in a group chat and your being on boarded into the app you can see what you can do with the app join a group manage money together and get stuff done and then to create your account just enter your mobile number prove you control that number choose from a randomly selected avatar or upload your own photo enter your name and with that you've created your user account and you can see that you have an invite to our hack money team which is the example we're using here so let's click join I see that our hack money team is controlling fifteen hundred dollars we already have some members on our team and there's something to be decided on the group needs to know decide whether to upgrade our notion account so that we can have more lines of text there I see that something people have already weighed in on this decision and with just one click I can approve that that should go through depositing money into our union group is quite simple as well you can do that with Apple pay or a debit card if you don't have a place it up already you can go through that flow quickly and decide to add ten dollars to the group confirm and adding money to the group is as simple as that in order to spend some of the group's money you can select the amount say what the expenditure is for and provide an optional link and there's a randomly assigned emoji for that choice and like the flow we showed before the group can decide whether or not to approve that transaction but since I created it I already approved it so now that you've seen the designs let's check out yet in action so here we're an iOS simulator we're running a react native Expo app behind the scenes it's using the gnosis safe and that s a toasty K so we can enter a mobile number I'll use a fake one for now this is where I would prove I control that number and now when the user goes to upload the photo if you check out the terminal over here behind the scenes we're hitting the gnosis safe relay service API and that is setting the signers that will be used for that gnosis safe and the threshold for a transaction to go through and down in the log statements down here you can see that there is a using create - there's a gnosis safe address that's generated and if we were to send funds to that it would actually D be deployed on aetherium hopping back over to our slides I gave you a bit of info on how that works behind the scenes but so for both the users to be able to do account recovery that uses the gnosis safe multi and also too for the group that uses no safe contracts as well creating the account for the users and interacting with the no save contracts is done with the test at SDK and while we haven't yet incorporated these yet we want the app to use ENS and the graph as well with that I'll just say thank you feel free to check out our website to get you need app feel free to reach out if you have any questions and thanks very much for your time right so it's kind of like a simplified version of Dow decision-making but using gnosis safe as sort of like the multi signature device yep we think multi SIG's have become really popular in the crypto native community and so it's a more natural place to start although adding more Dow like features in the future could be interesting to explore yeah I'd actually be curious how you think about the like design space for auction allottee of using a gnosis eight versus a doubt like feature so for example like you know assigning different weights or having bigger say in different things or you know how people associated adding money yeah our thinking was that for something that sees itself as a project the gnosis safe has all the functionality you need which is mostly just around receiving holding capital and spending it the benefits you get from something like Moloch or Eragon would be explicitly handling the state if someone wants to rage quit so that they would get their share of it that's more important for like serious for-profit use cases but not really required for something that's more like a hack money project for instance and then also yeah using tokens to hold different amounts of claims towards that in that case kind of the main other feature there we think that design space is super interesting but it hasn't yet like there hasn't been one that dau instance that has really taken off yet so whereas multi SIG's have so yeah I actually I really like the constraints that you guys have placed around it just to keep it really simple and I guess try to validate the you know these case of the people trying to collaborate economically on decisions I think that's a good sharp focus try to zero in on thanks awesome well thank you so much Paul and our ent this has been a great sort of progress to see how you can use developed over the past a few weeks and with that we'll move on to our next demo that is project candy shop who have made an efficient first dex aggregator No Hey hey guys hi I guess I so I was hoping that I could quickly do two or three slides and then we could do the live demo so that I can walk it to it more easily that works that sounds perfect I hope you can see Matt see my screen everything is good so I am I'm here presenting candy shop which is just a text aggregator with a twist so candy shop shop is like a light proxy on all the existing decks is what we really in in envision is that all the deck swaps will go through go Wyatt any shop and if there is a arbitrage opportunity created by us work the contact itself will flash flash loan from Venus or b2 and do arbitrage and return 80% profits back to the user and use a 20% to buy a lottery tickets with a lottery built in into the proxy so I could quickly walk through how it works so let's say a person wants to exchange 0.18 for 0.1 died so it hits the candy shop in interface currently onion is a v1 the price for each to die is 1 to 200 so user gives 0.1 0.1 eat and has 18.3 died whereas he should have about 20 but he lost some in slippage then we borrow 10 by for 0.05 eat and now as you can basically see that because of the last transaction the price in the genus of v1 has slipped so now when I exchange 10 died for eat on me some v1 I'll I will get I will get 0.07 ether I can repay 0.05 feet back to uni softly - and I'll have 0.02 each words of profits and I give 80 percent of profits back to the person so instead of earlier he getting 18.3 died he now gets 19 points to die along with lottery tickets by which he can positively win a huge grand prize so we have observed of the slippage amounts to be a lot lower than the original janeshia and we did some simulations and as you can see as as the trade size of the as the trade size increases the profit size increases and the genius of slippage is really really low and as you go towards like forty percent of the original pull the each profit turns out to be really really huge because it basically creates a huge arbitrage opportunity so with this I'll be moving on to the demo is the voice audible we you know we can hear you but if you're playing a video we don't have the audio there so looks like you forgot to click the checkbox on zoom yeah because I do speak yeah let me just stop sharing and I'll reshape quickly oh this is the UI to interact with the candy shop now I show you how a user can earn profits by slapping on the candy shop this is his laptop for swapping you can select the input token here now for the demo I'd be using input token as it here you can select the output token and for the demonstration we're using a test token now for the swab let's do a swab of 0.38 as you can see the expected output token is 46 now the balance of this user is zero and the user provides a exchange rate of 1 e equals to 150 3.49 test tokens these are the additional parameters you can say like this is the slippage and this is the optional to bite and is or not this is the deadline from which the transaction will divert now let's do this the transaction got transformed as the price of the candy is 0.01 died the user has brought this much amount of candies from the 20% profit the arbitrage has generated and the 80% profit is 0.029 heed it's sent back to the user in the in the output token he has selected as you can see the candy shop exchange rate is 1 e equals to 160 necklace tokens as you can see the candy shop provides a better exchange rate than you newspaper after the swap transaction we caught 50 test tokens instead of 46 which was the expected output tokens next I'll show you the lottery part this is the lottery tab we can see the lottery over here the lottery system on the candy shop is similar to pool together apart from that we have multiple winners in the lotteries the prize pool is the lending interest and they profit from the arbitrage as you can see these are the number of candies owned by this user and this is the price of thick single candy so you can say that approximately a $1 of profit has been went to the candy lottery system to buy candies this is the current pool size and this is the price for that is committer for the interest now in Lewisham can also boost the lottery prize pool by depositing into the lottery pool and the lending interest from it is used as a prize pool and the principal amount is written back to the user now I'll deposit hundred I to show you a demonstration of how this monster can deposit as you can see the transaction and hundred die has been added to the lottery pool now the lottery food has increased by a hundred in the lottery we have used our way and compound has a landing protocols and we use changing we RF to select multiple winners this is the demonstration of the condition thank you guys yeah great I have a quick question about about sort of efficiency in market pricing how big of an concern is is gas here so if you're like making a very small trade for example you know does the efficiency gain get eliminated by the gas cost yeah for sure so so only trades with which move the price by a threshold amount are efficient enough to be sent to a candy shop and others they they just don't produce enough arbitrage profit to like cover the gas goes okay very cool my question is why do the lottery to basically incentive wise people do like send as as as many transaction as possible why are candy shop so that we can advatage the transaction if the user does not say so and basically we have like a mechanism where people can come in and sponsor specific lottery foods so let's say there is eat and make a lottery food maker now can come and put up die and that I will buy a lottery tickets for people and that will sort of incentivize people to do more trades so that they can get the lottery okay so it's only like if you make a foundation wanted more people or like yeah right like we form a group yeah so so it's towards making a candy shop like it like most you stock sealer so that we can arbitrage and we basically know what's going to happen before it happens so and there are a lot of things that could be played God so decentralized market maker you know well yeah well oh yeah yeah the the great thing thing about a journey swap and other haunting EMM is that you can know the future just by seeing that incoming transaction and you can profit off of that and give a lot of profit back to the user so instead of a random arbitrage boat making profit from your transaction you actually get the 80% of the arbitrage profit cool thank you awesome it's a really cool concept thank you so much candy shop it we'll move on to our next demo and that is a team kitty fight who have made a mortal kombat game for crypto kitties so uh I'll let them kick off their demo you you hello panelists can you hear me loud and clear okay I'm gonna quickly talk really quick before I play a demo I just want to include before I play the video that this was at least no loss no loss lottery game that the highest risk is a one-week lockup and also getting the original capital back that is the highest risk and I'm just gonna proceed play D play the video now because that was an inclusion in video okay all right so so it looks like you also forgot to check off the audio box we can't hear the audio so please make sure that every other participant who's gonna go in the demo definitely checks off that box for the next it's at the very bottom of the screen chair since she he Lander can then burn the Athenian we throw back the principal want to come on their interest this is what I think have been listed on open tonight tonight anything Valley committed into the CDP thank you I think you fullscreen it before so you just shared the wrong screen and if it uh I think might be easier if I can just share that on your behalf from my side so let me just do that and I'll make sure that you can play it from our side and then you get to uh talk over it and ask answer questions from the judges okay so just cut off hello we're the K PI team and we built a lending compounding interest system into our already existing kit if I click the goodies Mortal Kombat and logging we can visit the lending system at T Phi that is lash deepening and it's live on the rinkeby test network how does it work lenders can deposit Ethernet system and mints NFC CDP is called ethnic then the lenders have two options of what to do with the ethnic either a lender can list the fe for sale on obviously and possibly sell it for future value points or the lender can put on three a thief or at least entire week to accumulate interest interest occupied charge me down user to collect the funds from all lenders in the games throughout the week and each game throughout the week must return back to the Treasury ten percent of at least ten times of the initial amount community each game lenders then can then burn at the end of CCTV the rest day to redeem the compounded interest and interpeter of principal here's the visual water processor planks in step one the lender blocks ether and generate two Fe and throughout the day two weeks the fontelle unison games and generate interest and return back to the Treasury on the 15 I mean on the sixth process she the lender can then burn the Athenian we draw back the principal and they combine their interests this is what I act in listing on open sea that's like in the city value committed into the CDP and you can see how much is paid for that CDP which puts into consideration the the future value are based on the interest that's generally from the CDP our demo we'll go over the locket and generation of a tea they're more party game works to them or any athlete and we're just gonna speak of this as you guys are viewing on basically this screen is showing the process of locking ether and it's showing the generation space palaka ether it's limited and there are seven generations zero to six and now once you lock it eat your eater you generate something called I think which you can then what you get in a cell and open thing I didn't wish to play through all the the rest of this video I just wanted to present to the rest of it because I know it's very long and I don't want to take up much time okay we can do whatever you want to do here okay I'll just show my screening for my start so you can make a quick okay great sorry about that guys i i'm i don't use zoom you know no worries we uh we've all had our fair share of trying to figure this out ourselves to you okay all right so i was just gonna talk really quick why don't you get to that stage if you wanted to sell your fe on on open sea you can just click on the generated from marketplace which still has a your ether that's generated and that just basically um give you a CD p of ether acids it has your ether lab dinner and you can sell it for the future price because you know that you're gonna get future interest based on the amount of interest you're going to get on a weekly basis now the weekly the interests are generated from the games on a weekly basis each each day generate some amount of interest that compounded it and grows over to the next day and onto the sixth day and then it's collected and pro-rata be shared amongst the collectively pool either in the in the treasury cool or if you wanted to burn your e you're either you would approve your athlete to be burned and basically go to the transaction and then finally press the buttons apparently i don't want to go to this cuz it's gonna take a long time on the bottom the bottom panel shows the periods in which these these investments scheme can operate the operation a six-day period the first starting points you know reps and first day and and and then the sixth day and in between is the rest day where you get to at least where you where you get to redeem your ether or keep it rolling into the system um there are six funding just us six funding levels representing six generations the first is limited to 500 ether and then it gradually grows as as we remove that limit as a group or the doubt through the doubt that controls its organization um this just shows you know how much is how much is ether is in the Treasury and how much is left that you can um i can actually participate in one in points to reach their limits know able to participate anymore this is what the game looks like this is what the game looks like he will bet your groups of people betting on each side it's basically a formal game sound versus sign and they're better than ether to see who can win the initial jaffa it works on the product on the principle based on the fact that the initial money appetite is less than the total amount this country - in terms of ticket sales also bets that happens throughout the game so that's it and now we just turn it over to you guys because I know time is running all right okay so my first question is the game what is happening in the game that looks really fun like what what is all that about should I show my screen again cuz I know you what time runs out you got will give will just give her a few extra seconds for just that demo but we do have to our sort of if you want to share this for while you're talking and answering that question that'll be fun all right so what's going on is you have two groups of players right you have to let me all right so you have two players betting ether right to win the initial jacket that's committed to the game right but the game before the ends it actually has to be 10x the initial amount that's committed to the game right so the group that wins the game there's a ranking on how much you win from that from the total amount that is accumulated from the losing side right so the players that win the game they get their share and the rest that's the excess profit is as what you call it it's diverted back to the lenders their link to the system initially right and this this works on a cumulative ADA's basis throughout the week and this is how properties generated okay and this these are crypto kitties are characters that are generated as avatars in our game and used to battle each other and players in math support each each side to battle each other using either and based on the excess amounts profit is generated and profit goes to the winners and also to to the lenders of the system basically you should start with this yeah super cool yeah this is very cool more like angry's start leat with the game and then how and then the mechanics of it to fall but the mechanics seem mechanics seem really cool as well and thought three yeah awesome well thank you so much hello this is an amazing demo hopefully we can send out a link to uh for others to check this game out it's already Kitty fide that IO so with that we're gonna actually move on to our break so we'll return in five minutes and we'll resume the remaining six demos that we have for today so thanks again and with that I'd like to a kickoff if I'm in a break thank you guys thank you are you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you all right we are ready to resume the second half of our judging so with that I'd like to call up team Umbra Ben's here here so please take it away right before I share my screen one quick note the audio gets a little quiet about halfway through the video so you might want to turn your volume up a little louder than you think or at least be ready to do so we're team Umbra and this is our hack money 2020 submission my co-conspirator is Matt Solomon who built the front-end and the JavaScript library my name is Ben DeFrancesco and I worked on the architecture and wrote the smart contracts we built a protocol for privacy preserving stealth payments on the etherion blockchain inspired by this March 31st tweet from the talaq be turin at a high-level Umbra enables transactions where the receivers identity is known only to the sender and the receiver so how does it work users publish a numb Republic key in an e NS text record payers generate a stealth address from a random number and the receivers public key pairs encrypt the random number with the receivers public key and announce it in a smart contract that also holds their payment receivers can then scan announcements find payments to stealth addresses they control decrypt the random number and use it to generate the addresses private key receivers then withdrawal tokens via gas station network avoiding the need to fund stealth addresses with ether gas can be paid for directly with tokens ba unis WAP I'll demo the front end for you now I have two browsers open on the right is the user who will receive a payment on the left is the user who will send the payment before they can receive their first payment our receiver has to configure Umbra this is a one-time setup step the receiving user owns amber demo eath if the user didn't own an e NS name they'd see instructions on how to register on the user sets a password this is used to encrypt the private key that is generated and store it locally in the next step the user is prompted to back up their encrypted key final finally in the last step the user signs a message with their new public/private key pair and publishes that message as an ENS text record payment centers will use this to derive their public key and generate new stealth addresses so our receiver is all set up now let's hop over to the sender the sender will navigate to the send section and then enter the receivers ENS name umbra validates that the expected ENS record is present for the receiver behind the scenes it generates a new stealth address using the receivers public key and a randomly chosen number now our UI shows eath and die but since these are just simple transfers between normal aetherium accounts we can support any ERC 20 token out of the box I'm sending 12 die here I approve the transaction in Portus and that's it for the sender it's that simple let's hop back to our receiver now we're going to navigate to the withdrawal section and enter our password number will scan the blockchain for payment announcement events encrypted with our public key when it does it's going to find the die transfer that we just sent and give us the opportunity to withdraw it remember the stealth address which received these funds currently holds no ether we can calculate the private key needed and using gas station Network withdraw the tokens to the address of our choice it's important we choose one that is not tied to our identity I've got one prepared here with proper Jia Yoona swap integration in GSM v2 we can allow the user to pay for gas with tokens they've received and optionally swap to another token upon withdrawal I confirm the transaction and when I navigate to the extraction address in my wall I can see I've received the dye withdrawal that's been a quick demo of Umbra privacy-preserving stealth payments on the etherion blockchain our immediate short-term plan is to finalize the MVP and get it to main net then help other developers integrate and build with Umbra down the road we'd like to explore other ways to make amador more useful and more efficient if you'd like to try our Umbra visit robson I'm rokosz and check out our github for more information about the protocol thanks for a great hack money experience yeah really cool one question I have is when the sender so sorry I'm when the receiver puts their information into the text record doesn't that sort of like you know now everyone knows that they are potentially recipient here and others could be searching for for transactions address to them is there any risk of like metadata around that leaking like I guess what are the what if the concerns about metadata leakage yeah so metadata is something to consider like with any privacy solution like if you're using tornado tornado cache but you know you're accessing it with the same ip between submission and then withdrawal then like you're gonna leak metadata and so concerns like that exists as well specifically the raid related to ENS like there is a kind of anonymity set issue where the possible receivers is limited to everyone who has published DNS records although actually to get around that what we did was we made it possible to also send send a payment directly to the private key held by an address so you don't technically have to use e NS it just greatly improves the user experience because you don't have to export an importer private key by implementing the protocol that way though we make it so that there's kind of a deniability plausible deniability because any any aetherium address that has done at least one transaction could be the receiver of any sent transaction mat did you have anything to add to that no you pretty much know that in the demo we show sending it to and yes in s domains just because that's the simplest but you could put in anyone's address or a transaction hash there and it will recover the public key and everything will function the same and then like Ben was saying you withdrawal process has been a little bit different since you'll have to you know copy and paste your private key or something in order to do that withdrawal for like a business use case where do you intend to go with this like it doesn't it tend to be a protocol that sort of like capture some sort of profit like charging users fee or is this intended to be sort of like an open-source format it's it seems like now that the idea is out anyone could do it yeah it's a good question so we definitely look at it as kind of like an open protocol that anybody could implement and use and we want developers to kind of integrate with it at the same time we think there's an opportunity to capture at least a little bit of value through the protocol so there is a toll or a fee that's charged with each send that you that you you know initiate on the platform and there's actually two reasons for this one is to capture value but also it's to prevent spam attacks on the system so every user has to decrypt check if they can decrypt every send that occurs so if someone just you know sent a bunch of very very low value transactions then that's a drain on everybody else's resources as they have to kind of process those to make sure one of their send isn't in there so right now we have it set by default to like point 0:01 eath just as a kind of spam prevention mechanism but also something that could potentially generate a little bit of value for the protocol itself to help fund for development and that sort of thing I may be to follow up on that then and not to push back on the idea of charging for for it because that's totally reasonable um you know if you were you know I think that saying it seems like that relies mostly on the fact that a few events aren't super scalable but if you were to remove that sort of like scalability - difficulty for example using with something like the graph then it would seem almost that the cost of transactions themselves would be the sort of like impediment to spamming the network because if you look at the cost of sending a transaction right now there's only so many $4 sends that somebody's gonna be willing to do just to just do spam yeah absolutely so a couple things to unpack there one is that the oh it looks like maybe we're each time if I'll follow up later myself I think it's really fascinating okay perfect sorry about that you quickly finished that answer if you'd like and then we can move on to our next one okay perfect yeah I mean so obviously we can't scale greater than the etherium chain itself can and there are limitations on events and in terms of the you know there is a limitation there and that every user has to process every event and that is something where down the road in a future version of this protocol we'd like to look into ways of solving that and to make it more scalable but there are definitely some challenges with that and that's like a much bigger kind of a research problem to tackle oh very good Ben math team thank you so much and thank you next demo and that is a project Atlas I'll let them take it away hi guys I was gonna share my screen make sure I check after Aria box the steam Atlas Library System hello everyone I'm mark a Vijay Kumar a first-year computer science undergraduate from Bangalore India I worked on front-end back-end as well as mark on track development for this project what I've built it is the Atlas library system a hassle-free library system to help users rent books easily and directly support authors it is built around the concept of eásá to eat opens how it works a deterministic ECM address is generated upon sign up users can purchase alt that is Atlas library tokens through a simple payment gateway thereafter users can rent books for any time duration using these same tokens all that I shall jump straight into the demo now the welcome screen for the app the login system is built using auth0 passport strategy users can log in directly using the Google account I'm signing up for the pub as a first-time user this is a dashboard and if we head over to the account screen the deterministic medium address generator is displayed along with few other details upon signing up for the very first time the user gets 0.1 TLT token we can purchase more tokens using this form over here this has been designed for the Indian subcontinent therefore supports purchase in Indian rupees currently the demo version does not have a payment gateway but the production version will have a payment way to be integrated if we go ahead and purchase tokens 400 rupees which will need 1lt token we get the screen the success message and we click on the link it redirects us to the ether scan page and upon successful confirmation of the transaction we will be redirected back to the account page and as you can see here the token balance has updated to 1.1 alt now being such directly from the smart contract itself if I go ahead and open the network clause and refresh this page we can see the API call that's being made it says 11,000 and since alt token has 4 decimals we get 1 point 1 alt tokens now if we head over to the browser screen there are a number of books that score and rent one of them we get some details regarding the book itself as soon as we enter the number of days if we do our suction balance the rented option becomes available however if we do not have sufficient balance let's see for 10,000 days when the rented option becomes unavailable this is to make the user experience better as well as the form here itself is read-only so that if here my dress product ID the number of T is none of those are messed around with let us go ahead and enter 10 days and rent the book for 10 days the ones again get the success message oh the rented book has appeared over here and it says active as well along with a few other details like when it was rented on and for how many days we click on this media is being rendered this is just a placeholder that is hosted on CEO Network skynet portal as you can see it says you have a book title educated this is being previewed using PDF J's library alt admin login now through this portal currently you can upload the books to the main server itself I'll just quickly fill up this form and upload a book I am trying to upload a book called the red clocks if I submit the form now here's a book Alice access will be uploaded and refresh it we can see that the red clocks book has appeared over here on the dashboard the status for all the rentals is being obtained directly from a smart contract if I go over and open up the network log and refresh the page we can see the API call that's being made if I open the new tab the boolean is false which is why this book here says it's expired the application reads and writes so smart contracts using block Brazil's API all the ebook PDFs are stored on sea Skynet portal future plans include building an author's dashboard allowing publishing of scientific research papers as well as adding a recommendation system this was my very first blockchain defy app and I had a lot of fun building it thank you very much a time this I just quickly want to add another thing so the purpose of this application itself is to popularize deeper applications and the way this aims to do that is by abstracting away all the complexities of a blockchain or anything else and just providing the simple and clean user experience though this is also not a replacement for the traditional publishing system but just as an alternative and an additional digital publishing platform that directly empowers authors this also aims to curb Bristol piracy by making books for affordable and easily accessible cool I'm sorry Jessica okay I think it's very cool congratulations you did a really great job so may I be curious about is like you know as with deeper applications all the times people say like hey we're gonna fork it and take any fees out you know what recourse does an author have if somebody you know takes one of their books and especially like takes out two peas and reuploads it exactly which is why it's kind of using the PDF just lightly to make it read only and this is once again the way this comes our aims to like kind of do away with intellectual property theft is by making it really affordable right now it's rent for a book but anything go for subscription order that is not more affordable I think people would just be alright with you I know accessing it for the extremely small fees itself and apart from that I think Netflix has successfully done it with their you know content being provided for just a fixed subscription fee with all the movies available that has kind of I know put down the piracy and intellectual property theft with the movies and other things like that so this is a model good work and it hopes that people use it out of goodwill and it's very cool thank you well beyond books are there any other use cases are excited about for the same sort of yeah definitely I think I mentioned scientific research papers being used for this because that could also make a lot of sense for this i renting it out for three or four days when you were researching on a school project maybe and kind of like helps a lot with students especially do you think there's a like a specific advantage to building on on this stack where you know versus like I don't know whatever Amazon or whatever local you know cured correct I think your advantage is the fact that there's going to be very authors get almost 90% to 95% of the company's revenue at the same time since it's based on blockchain there's 100% transparency it's just automated and in the future the production version and I'm sure that you'll just work on its own and they'll not be any issues as such right I think that's good yeah and also I think it's cool your your client is only one and anyone can sort of build a curated experience around then you know benefiting the hug the author's directly yeah just a quick shot up to the enemy and swoop over that block vigil they are the ones who encouraged me to participate in this I'm just starting out as a web developer as well as blockchain developer and I have a lot of point to in this project awesome we'll other Ted thank you so much for uh kind of making this your first sub-blocks you knocketh on and this was amazing and i hope you keep on building on top of this thing and as you are working on this thing feel free to send us updates and we'd love to share this on our end perfect so um thanks again and what that we'll move on to our next mo and that is project atomic ninja it's all welcome Fabio to ticket from here hey hello folks sharing the video now hello everyone hi we are the Tim basa and for this hacker Tom you are developing an application that will make the money leggo string actually true it's a basically interface that uses the Google Buckley to make atomic transactions with multiple protocols yeah so this is the help screen we included a brief tutorial here please read it I'm gonna skip it so here to the left we have over to box with all the blocks we can use to perform a transaction so build a quick transaction here because we don't have a lot of time so basically I'm singing tiny I'm flesh loaning 108th and then let's say I want to do another flash loan here then inside this flash luenell same ten way to the italic below here - then I'll swap one if when he for die and then st. and I to italic and maybe borrow an additional 100 die so 10 die sorry so basically once we have your transaction beaut here you can move it freely like this and then this is the simulation button so it is reaffirming a call to a real note actually - in Fuhrer and it's executing the atomic transaction and returning if it's gonna work if it's signed and sent and basically once you're happy with your transaction just press play here and then this will log in to your port is while it and send the code well but we're actually blocking that right now because of course there's a lot of risking performing this right now if you have any doubts about the blocks Rover the blocks here and you'll see a tooltip saying what what it is yeah and why was already right very cool right now there's a few things you're still planning to do the first one is like a little make-up in the user interface because we can calculate the values better if you like for example if you need to borrow Tendai we can already set the amount of you need to send first there's also two challenges that we one is like we would like to be able to put a return of one function into the input of another so we can link transactions better as well put some kind of conditional execution so for example say do D swap if that transactions fail before or something like that but that's a pretty challenging but we are pretty happy with the result we got right now and hope you guys like it yeah and it's live on it's great live on atomic dot ninja so please try it out too and it served with love from my PFS this is supercool I'm really into anything sort of like no code around transactions and piping them and building them so I'm a big fan of the the Google blocks I like to get more than node-red so it's really fantastic to see someone building on it because that looks great so I guess you have to predefine all these components yourself and what do you see is the the future for this yeah we've been the way we envisioned this we actually built this on top of Google's blockly and we made it in a way that it's really easy to extend so each block is one J's file so the way we envisioned this in the future is companies themselves contributing their blocks to the platform so basically they open up tiara with their blocks and then we feel that the by having the developer of the platform's creating blocks this can improve a lot too you know the I mean the limit is their creativity I guess something that I would be curious about is this makes it simpler or like I guess more visible for people but at the same time like unless somebody has like all the knowledge of how these things actually work would be like hard for them to understand like what they're really building is there a wave is there a way to create you know either a digital die mutation or additional simulations that would make it like more enjoyable of exactly like what's gonna be happening like what the outcome will be for a Newser that's just coming to us for the first time yes I mean not now we only check if the transaction will be mined you know so it's it doesn't revert basically there are ways of providing better feedback we already know how to you know point which block is fairly for example and but the way we try this we do a nice call to a node so it's very hard to check for example the end result of the transaction you know are there tokens there are there any flashed in the atomic contract from the user those are hard and we're thinking about those there are a number of ways to improve this and the way we see this is like a tool for maybe the financial hackers there that can't code you know so they'd be able to perform a flash loan for example without having to dive into solidity and JavaScript and so on yeah but you definitely need some kind of knowledge of the systems themselves before using it otherwise you you cannot make sense of any of it yeah it's it's a really cool concept and I think you know it's it's everything within the etherium world I wonder like if there's an opportunity to sort of also be a bridge for non-technical folks to the legacy financial world because you can imagine you know with this kind of interface you can unify a lot of different types of applications not only within the theory umeko system but essentially stuff outside of it that's a whole different stack but I think it makes this much more interesting too because you can you can set up strategies that are sort of holistic in nature what what is the feature for the project um would like to keep developing it we might actually need some help in the front end because neither of us are front-end developers and so we can move faster but generally I think we try to keep doing more pieces and improving overall experience cool I love it hey thank you so much this is a really cool demo and I'm also excited to hear this is life and keeping the money Lego vision going so with that when we went to our next demo and that is our defy all letting our team are defy kick off with their video hello yep I'm sharing my screen welcome to artifice crypto at work sent one of the interesting news case in the branching environment crypto a desirable to produce on their own crypto arts and purpose online and you return take at any piece for further sales with the lot is actually quite different from other entities and it has two unique properties for support the creation of the enemies itself is actually originated from the individual users over the world rather than a centralized party secondly the income stream all record on chain other than option for both primary and secondary markets with these properties I'll divide aims to evaluate the artists credit scores based on this and at the same time is that I prefer learning pool with customized collateral ratio for these individual artists based on their credit scores with that why don't we move to the demo so here is the artifice interface once you have met mas connected you are able to still see the main screen the main screen on the left hand side you can see the artwork statistics something about myself like how much income I get from the primary sales and how much royalty I get came from the passive income so we talked about the landing pool soul and including information in the middle for now I don't have any deposits and gnomes but I'm going to make one so for example I'm going to make on 500 type deposit as a collateral it's a start so the mathematic information cool and I get a bit of yes limit so that use can't get through in the meantime um let me show you additional screen right you can see the unchanging that we have collected including all the artwork that this artist has produced all the sales that has come through people etc etc from - or others different headphone you can see the defensive has come through and now you can see my scoring 300 knowing what that means is actually lowering my arm collateralization ratio so you can see i'm able to borrow 82% out of my collateral which is slightly higher than what have you had offered now I can make a longer maximum you want for 1/3 die for example so I'm basically that's it um going back to the Ming's presentations light so this on diagram summarize what has happened we have relied on the graph and effectively chingling Colette or this online on the information from different decentralized on Crito ad flat form crypto artists are able to make collateralization and know together with other depositors a device must contract and also wheat I read all the loans and and borrows to to rv3 enhance their lending booms for the future work um in the future we are able to extreme extend to other entities with similar properties at the same time we can allowed more the out sea chantey combination unit lending boost and also we can think about more on the prophecy of the artist so that's why like if I were somebody that you know essentially bought enough cheese for myself in order to increase our price would that allow me to like essentially cheat the protocol or like borrow against like value technically that's possible but I guess the problem I guess the the crypto art community would well make that not happen by the in the sense that because cryptology some very tough type well in the sense very self organized you know community if you you know publish a crypt a lot and try and try to pump up the price and you know you'll stop like others artists would you know you seen on BP soft on to fight in the sense that you know the others would probably know that thank you i Jesse you muted sorry yeah I think I think it's a it's a really cool idea I guess I'm curious of like from the artists perspective you know what what problem are you solving for them you know is it just that they need they need liquidity to fund more work well you know what's the core problem solved and that might that might be good to address to them can think through you know this the solution versus others sure so if you imagine decrepit art is what they are trying to do is really you know proper shortest artwork most likely they are doing it for life so now you will fill out all your finance your the income is actually coming from cryptos anyways so at the same time you have a platform where they can do all this you know reverse financing meaning that you know soft-landing money or depositing money in a salt you know similar platform that are tied it with their crypto artwork so that would you know come through the whole cycle where they can gain their money from the crypto um not entirely you know finance their you know um usage of that you know in the same world okay cool thank you awesome thank you so much and with that we have two more projects to develop afore L we're done for the day and I'd like to call magic bet who have made it no loss ending system to a show after demo hello it's me Andrew let's just wait for my other two there's Brennan okay I'm just gonna stop playing the video now let me just change the audio source alright I'm gonna stop playing now welcome to this video demo for magic net magic bet is a no loss battle platform the idea is simple you stake dye on the outcome you think it's gonna win if you choose the right outcome you wanna share interested but everyone gets their money back whether or not they've bet on the right outcome magic right let's see how it works at the moment we've only deployed a factory contract and this battery contract will itself deploy individual market to each event so let's create a market right now so this has been pre-populated with an event who's gonna win the upcoming election Trump or Biden I'm not gonna explain the details there isn't any time all I will mention is that this transaction is actually gonna create three contracts it's gonna create the market contract it's also gonna create an e rc 20 token contract for each outcome the idea is if a user bets say ten die on Trump to win the election they will receive ten Trump PLC 20s which must be burnt in order to receive their die back at the end of the event excellent so the market contra has been created we can start betting let's say I think Trump is gonna win the election and I want to bet Tendai that he's gonna win so what I'm gonna do is I'm a section 10 guy press enter I'm now going to switch account and make a bet on Biden from a different address right I've now changed account and I'm gonna make a bet on Biden but before I do that I want to point out we can see here interest has already started accumulating on the Tendai bet that was just made on Trump so let's say I think Brian's gonna win and I wanna bet six diet now I want to show you the ether scam page of those transactions we just made and something a dimension is that we have full unit of integration and those bets actually maybe dying they were made with ether and that is what was going on here it is the ether be converted to die but units rot and down here is the actual bed itself we can see that 6 Biden ERT 22 a minute for the user and of course this is the ethers contraction of the use of the bit on by them then 6 die was sent from the user to the contract and the contract Center 6 dice chair over to our way where it starts accumulating interest and of course it is easy to track using the front-end what's going on with each market so if you practice this did I here we can see all the relevant details of this market and here on the markets tab we can see the irrelevant details of all of the deployed markets so now let's conclude the market so that we can withdraw our winnings now in order to do that the contract needs to know who won we have a full decentralized oracle solution for this however there isn't time to get into that in this video so we're going to skip to the end so here is the resolved Oracle apparently Donald Trump on the election now the contract is in a withdraw state this means that the contract has spoken to Oracle and figured out who won the event and as you can see a withdraw button has appeared I'm currently in the account that bet Tendai on Donald Trump so we're gonna withdraw that I'm now gonna switch the account that bet six down on Biden and withdraw that so I've now changed account and I will be draw the sixth eye that was bet on Biden here is the ether scam page for the user that that six died on Biden this is their withdraw transaction and now let's remember that according to the Oracle dollar Trump won the election so what's going on here is that the user is burning their six Biden EEOC 20s and they are receiving exactly six dieback which was their bed and not receiving anything else was they bet on the losing outcome now here is the transaction for the user that bet on Donna trauma now as before the users trunk Oct 2007 burn they received their tender back and in addition they received the total accumulated interest or the contract because there was only one person that late on that winning outcome in reality of course the total interest will be shared among everyone a bit on the right outcome in proportion to how long it bet and that is the end of a demo thank you very much indeed right outside of it do you have any questions for the three of us so what was the thinking so for example you know pooled together does the no loss lottery what was the thinking about building something with pooled together versus building something separate this yeah this project was very much inspired by pulled together in fact the original name was bet together and we were just really spitballing ways of making saving money fun so that was it really it was like pull together really a successful because there's a fun way of saving you money I mean thought that this is in a very very similar vein instead of just putting in a lottery where you can really do anything it's not very active instead you like well actually I'm gonna take a bit a little bit of a gamble but it's not much of a gamble because you'll still get your money back but that was really the inspiration do you think maybe this actually gets around gambling laws because you don't have any money the correct answer is yes we do sort of thought about this it's a different kind of legalization sorry legislation price linked savings so yeah gambling licenses are not required for this which is kind of nice fascinating I would also love to learn how you solve the Oracle problem it uses reality oh if you've heard of that as a first Oracle and so basically anyone can choose who the winner is and then there's a set period of time before someone else can then dispute it but if there are continued disputes we're using something called klaris which is a decentralized court basically they have quite a sophisticated system when there's I think it's something like 500 jurors who among them will look for wealth among them they will decide they'll become the final arbiter but the idea is that it would never get that far because you actually have to pay 60 to eath to you call that court and which means someone has to pay submit a bond with the wrong answer of above that amount of value before it would make any sense to call that court therefore it'll kind of never happen and it just relies on no one is willing to lose 60 to eath by posting the wrong answer if that makes some sense fascinating well this sounds fun let's go to New Jersey and open up a betting company what what um what are the thoughts around sort of like no loss impacting the way people actually bet you know because like the skin in the game dynamic kind of changes a bit yeah so we did think about this and it's it's likely that we can't really use this product as a prediction market because people weren't really care so much which is fine because we're not interested in positioning it as a prediction market so yeah it may you probably won't be able to get necessarily accurate odds in the same way something like Olga would give you a Creole odds but that's fine that's not what we're going for as long as people think as a fun way to save the money that's fine with us it doesn't really matter if the odds represented on the accurate but if they aren't that accurate then in theory someone who does take this kind of thing seriously you can come along an arbitrage in theory we'll just have to see but to answer question we don't see that it matters if people don't have skin in the game because it's not a prediction market it is a fun way of saving money oh very cool awesome thank you so much magic that and with that we are on our last demo for this session so I want to thank everybody on this call in the live stream for making it through to the end and with that I'd like to call up team blazer for their last and their amazing demo hello guys hi everyone okay so just before we we show you the video really quick introduction this is actually a follow-on hack from something that we did at East London blazar is a fixed-rate lending protocol with an automated market maker which makes it frictionless so essentially what we what we're doing is trying to do the same thing as Dharma v1 or if lend but without the pain of having to match in the your lenders with individual borrowers and the way that we do that is that we piggyback on the money market so your are days or you're compounds to to do that and then do the asynchronous matching so it's Eve London we've done the depositing side and for this hackathon we've actually hooked up the the borrowing side which in in in some ways has been much more difficult so I will launch video now and then answer any questions alright so this is how it works this is on the blazer site I can check here on my meta mask show you that I have one eath zero die what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use my eath as collateral to borrow die at a fixed term and a fixed rate and I'll show you later how it's connected to our they so here I with this slider I can choose how much die I want to borrow and I have an automatic calculation which is 3 X the the amount in terms of value dollar value of eath that I need to put in as collateral it's that doesn't change based on the amount of time because it's always the same ratio so let's say I want to borrow 20 die for three months I automatically sets the collateral I need to put in and I'm gonna click on borrow here the normal meta mask transaction happens all right once that's minted it goes directly to the dashboard and I can see that I haven't learned for 20 day that I need to repay in August of this year in 3 months time and let me quickly show you here what's happened on Metin ass we can see how things have changed then I no longer have one Etha cause that's been locked up as collateral and I now see that I have 20 died this is on Kovan and everything now let me show you what happens under the hood you can see that this is the transaction what has happen and you can see that essentially I connected first with the with the blazar smart contract which took my collateral transferred it to our way of a sent back the a eath in exchange for the collateral and then sent 20 die to the user so there we go and this is the UI that we put together for the posting side that will already build you define a deposit the asset and you see the api APY for this asset and the maturity date you see how much interest you gain beginning up thrown class 4000 future die which you can retrieve on the maturity date and for the borrowing side which we built for this hack you define your loan the asset and you see the APR and then the repayment dates and the total amount that you have to pay back including of course the interest so on each one of those when you click on deposit you can see each of the assets that you've earned interest on and then the F ty that you've got which you can send by putting the recipients address to anyone and of course you can adjust the date moving forward and earning more intercept front or moving backwards and paying a difference to be able to do that and on the boring side each asset you've borrowed again you see exactly how much you borrowed and what's the interest you have to pay on the dates you can see the APR on the data you made the loan tip took the loan and then we can adjust the majority date and see the difference that you have to pay again in dye based on the given APR on that date fascinating is the APR determined by you guys or is it adjusting based on market conditions cool bad you want to take that one yeah pretty good oh we need to with the external condition that I deliver and by the third possible when we use the liquidity and with the expected interest rate that going to be in the future in going model and we also try to balance as much as much as possible so when he see that in our protocol there is more deficit we obviously and going to the critical lending full mechanics and decrease the interest rate will attract more loan pretty complex algorithm to set up the right we have basically if you think of a compound on are in are they the rate is gonna be determined by the utilization rate basically in Blazer there's gonna be a kind of a utilization rate / maturity date because we want to see how many deposits are gonna be due to be paid back on that date versus how many loans have been borrowed for that date so we want to match those and an additional parameter is to actually look at what the variable rate is right now and then the protocol comes up with the the fixed rate so what is I I remember the project from eath London I thought it was really cool I still think it's really cool what do you need to do to make this live like right well actually so very good question thank you for asking that and thanks for remembering us Deb here is also unforgettable but so basically in London we did the deposits now we've done the borrowing side we've been working on the stable rate mechanism in parallel it was just too big a job for the for the hackathon and we that's something that we're working on right now so we expect that this is going to be live in somewhere between three and six months depending on on how much help we can get basically you know any any investors who are interested in this though hesitate to send them our way do you need anything else besides money yeah well I mean though we've been doing I think actually errata you could talk a little bit about this but one of the biggest things that we've done during this hackathon is just do a lot of market research so we've talked to a lot of traders a lot of crypto workers to figure out you know what they would whether what they would prefer putting in money depositing money on a fixed rate or a variable rate seeing how people would use these future tokens and we're doing alpha test right now so if anybody wants to test this out and give us their feedback and tell us how they use it then they'll be they'll be awesome I'll post our our website you guys in the chat so you can send people our way but yeah basically I would love to get your feedback on that alpha tester and to test our product of the UI etc and yeah we need commitments because commitments for example from the para files of this board the train deaths of megiddo individual depositors and we need developers were at least three developers to be able to launch this in the next four to six months so awesome very cool cool great well that concludes our judging demos for this session I want to thank everybody who watched us on the live stream and and stay with us throughout the whole time and all the teams that put in all this time and all of their hard work for the last four weeks to make this possible so with that we'd like to congratulate on everybody congratulate everybody on demoing today and we'll keep an eye out for everybody when we do our final demos on the closing ceremonies on June 2nd where all the top projects will be presenting to our final set of judges on the second and that'll be our finale for eath Global's hack money so thanks again to all of our judges and all the teams and we'll resume with our remaining sessions later today and throughout the rest of this week
