foreign [Music] thing that we want to do is obviously talk about all the other prizes that are here I'm going to definitely spend a few minutes covering all of that but before we get into the prizes we want to really take this opportunity where we have a thousand plus of you here in this room to get to know about what this ecosystem means to us and what it means to everybody else that's been in the space for some time I want to focus a lot more on the culture of ethereum and how we think about the future moving forward and how we think about web3 ecosystem and how we would like it to uh the direction we like it to be in and that's all under the theme of the infinite garden and to talk about the culture of ethereum I want to bring on a very special guest ayamiyaguchi who is the executive director of the ethereum foundation to share more about the culture and what this ecosystem means to all of us so please give a big round of applause to Ayah hello everyone well it's it's already late I know you're tired and I'm going to give a Japanese lesson next 20 minutes just kidding um I'm thrilled to be here at the first season of hackathon In Tokyo at this scale it is it is very big for Japanese um today I'd like to talk about the power of open learning in the infinite Garden I want to share with you how a term is revolutionizing the way we learn and grow and how you can be part of the Revolution by becoming infinite teacher and how many of you have heard of this infinite Garden oh okay impressive thank you um so this is a vision we used at the term foundation and we're hoping everyone to be part of this infinite garden and I'm going to explain again a little bit about this infinite I came up with the idea inspired by the book by James cross the word infinite is from infinite games as in his book fine and infinite games in a finite game the games ends when someone wins as in normal like sports games and others while in infinite game we play the game to continue the game with changing rules and players the vision of the infinite Garden has the word infinite from this inspiration as I believe it describes the beautiful culture of ethereum at the merge last year for example do you know do you remember the merge do you still remember the merch well I guess we had another big milestone yesterday that kind of finish the the clueful steak work um where ethereum finally shifted from proof of work to clip of State last year there were more researchers in developers outside of the Italian Foundation that were involved in the execution of this annulments and modern work all the debts from different client teams work together ethereum understands the importance of client diversity and do you understand that it's more important than having only one big team succeeding that is the perfect example of an infinite game and those who participated were all infinite players are all infinite players so how can you play in an infinite game at this hackathon I understand there are places here supported by great sponsors just who just presented and I think that is great to motivate people to build but I would like to suggest something new today let me ask you questions please raise your hand if you identify yourself as web3 developer and okay thank you please raise your hand if you see yourself as brother a beginner 2x3 thanks for being honest please raise your hand if you think you are new to web3 but have expertise in some specific domains other domains some programming languages security privacy ux okay okay you're very humble please you raise your hand if you are here to learn all right I see almost always yes so we there are many who are here to run I'm also here to learn each Global told me that a lot of skilled web 2 developers come here to get into web3 a hackathon is a great place to learn I believe there is something unique about hackathon the museum that makes your learning experience more special because this is also a game um that is happening in the infinite Garden I know you will be divided into teams and their prizes but it will be and it would enrich the quality of the game if each player improves their skill by learning there will also be mentors and speakers who will teach you new things but wouldn't be also be fun if Packers here teach each other wouldn't it be fun if teaching Learning Happens regardless of which team you are in that is an example of an infinite game too so can you be an infinite teacher in this Garden I bet this has been already happening at the eastern hackathons and that is because I believe is him has the culture of open learning ethereum as a platform is an open source product so it is naturally more open being open source makes the project more inclusive and transparent from the learning standpoint anyone can look at the code and learn many different things but I want to talk about today is about how the culture of learning has evolved in the ethereum also how the culture of openness is making learning more effective I like to call this open learning and I strongly believe this is an important part of the infinite Garden for example there are multiple Dev tools that have been built by community members and are widely used and some of them are built for learners scaffolded how many of you know this couple days a while a lot of them awesome Yes um it gives you instructions on how to build an ethereum step by step or a dear friend Austin Griffiths are you here is there yes I've got this originally for himself to onboard apps that are new to web3 and he started offering speedland which is he he provides a class where he goes to read step by step together with a new learner now there are many Debs to learn with this tutorial what is interesting is those who learned through it became more interested in building learning tools for others to learn so Austin and his people study build Guild a community of Builders who are building learning tutorials there are a lot of Stories on how ethereum learns but I would like to use this community as an example so it is easier for you to see the open learning culture the first story from this community is about an open learner and infinite teacher so I also heard he is here I hope he's here somewhere um he learned um he learned with stuff all these like one of those people who learned through it and now he is building the scaffold these two how amazing is this yay it's okay I think it's people are a little bit tired are you sick oh yes he's here okay he's here so you can hear uh the story from him I'd love to actually also hear the story from YouTube awesome and another great story from this build community is where a builder from that Community learned from another open learning community Calvin from Bill Guild went to the Xerox Park Community a community facilitated by the Xerox Park Foundation now that is not only supporting different applied GK project but also helping people to learn about CK he then came back to build and built a three-part cities just to teach the next Builders how to use a DK circuit with that smart contract and what is crazy is Austin the original teacher said almost 90 of what he knows about ziki apps are from him using these tutorials made by Calvin I used to be a high school teacher and I have seen maximized learning experiences when a teacher lets the student become a mini teacher but the power of open learning in the same Community is even more than that one teacher does not teach everyone that they they teach their students how to teach and they become the teachers and good teachers also learn from their students by keeping learning tools open we can have all different types of learning tools and you are more likely to find something that that fits your level and learning style going back to open learning hypothons I believe hackathon represent the open learning culture of vegetarian Community why because you are here to learn and teach you're not here to make a perfectly complete project within three days the project might be your start of something important in the future but the most important part of these three days is that you get to learn something you did not know before and to share what you already know with others the knowledge that you gain and give volleyball outwards into the future and might help others on a similar Journey so let's think about how you actually learn then here first by making mistakes I believe true running can only come from having experience you can read a book and stuff online to gain knowledge but you do not leave a return until you try it yourself and the best way to learn is by making mistakes I know this is a very tough one for Japanese people as fishery I also have suffered myself um by being trained to be perfect if you're a developers you probably have experienced the importance of making mistakes ethereum's protocol design also had this experience many times initial shouting and proof of stake designs were attempted to be implemented within smart contracts only when the researchers got into the architecture they discovered that limitations in efficiency and expressivity of those system level contracts when Dany Ryan shared this story with me he said that throwing away 6 to 12 months of work is always coupled with immense learning it informs not only the immediate next item but research and design on project for years to come the beauty of a hackathon is that you will not be punished by making mistakes so make lots of mistakes and believe that is only helping your learning next you learn by working in a team all this week and building something by yourself and building something in the team a very different experiences here some of you will work with people you've met for the first time each person I believe offers very different values to the team decisions are not easy to make when working in a team but that is why the learning is stronger you learn more when you need to balance multiple perspectives you see from all the dowels up there and how hard it is to have a good decision making system even with the additional support with technology the law will be more than 200 teams made out of all hackers here so if East Grove all combined all the earnings from teams that all the hackathon they will have probably a great data set for that research thank you soon yes yeah okay and lastly you will definitely learn from the experience mentors experts there are many amazing experts here you know depending on your interest like some uh sponsors also presented their expertise uh from yeah for example Peter Marius and some others from the guest themer here you'll have an obstruction team is here Austin I just said he is out there but he also his people from build community are here too so you should definitely talk to them they are expert in in being a teacher and as well as as other mentors that are here to support you do not forget though that you as a hacker can be a teacher because everyone has unique expertise skills and even personality that may Inspire others and with the spirit of open learning with him allow me try add to to try and experiment through this hackathon this is this is like a new thing we're trying we want to ask you to let us know about your learning experiences here and let us know who was your best teacher they can be mentors and speakers here other Hackers from your team or other teams working toward the same classes I would like to call them infinite teachers in the infinite Garden the ethereum foundation will try to share the outcome in some way to recognize infinite teachers the learning does not have to be technical learning you could receive some amazing wisdom to cope with the pressure or stress of this happen or how to maximize your focus even if you're new to the community you can already be an infinite teacher too as well as we all come with the wealth of experience and knowledge that influences how we collaborate to solve problems here's how you can help please save this on your phone uh and answer the survey that asks who is your infinite teacher submitted by Linda bhagdon end of Sunday by participating in this survey you will receive and I learned from an infinite teacher nft that's designed by our designers and um and then we also have the EF booth so you can if you have questions you can ask questions there too as another message from me this is the last one I also would like to encourage you to challenge yourself try something a little bit out of outside of your comfort zone there are many Japanese hackers here today who are locals here okay okay uh yeah I heard like 40 of hackers here are more clouds which is uh the size of hackathons already there in Japan so 40 is pretty impressive um how many then okay like how many people here knowing Japanese feel have a connection to Japan do you like anything of a trip about Japan U raised hand most quickly what do you like about Japan yes culture language foreign yes I actually I'm always impressed how many people actually uh are interested in learning Japanese because I don't know how useful um and then even within the ethereum foundation we actually have a quite a number of people who can speak Japanese which is surprising I always wonder where do you use it but anyway um do you know some people might like food ninja Nintendo anime um so there are things that Japan can be part of it seems like but I know one thing that Japanese people tend not to be good at they are not good at telling you what they're good at we Japanese are trained not to do that from the very early time of our childhood Japanese people hear me not call themselves expert forever however if you find Japanese hackers tonight I encourage you to invite one or two of them to your team if you find someone who has a background very different from viewers I encourage you to invite them like whether you're Japanese or Not Here reason why I think it's a that's a good idea first in the case of Japanese you might discover some subtle talents something that others do not have for example by being born and raised in the country I was trained to drop intuition you know the English expression read between the lines in Japan reading between the lines are is is very very basic we have an expression called read the air you have to read something when there are not even lines or words and that is considered as a common sense so gradually you become very good at reading people's mind and things around them this is also the reason why they can be good team players next uh whether they're Japanese or not there are many studies that discovered that more diversity leads to more creativity one study tested college students creativity at the beginning and the end of the semester they found that students who had dated someone from another country um become more creative have you experienced this people who are raising their hand you said no did you fall okay so um you can help like if you have experienced this you can't help but reflect on different circumstances that have helped shape the other person's views and by looking from different perspectives you end up developing creativity you also take things less personally with other blockers or due to different backloads so of course I'm not only talking about Japanese as they're more diverse set of pipelines here I would love to see mixed diverse teams during this hackathon if you have not teamed up yet it will be great if you find new fans and build a team with people with different backgrounds that is it uh to summarize my two key points today open learning opportunity uh find your infinite teacher please scan this ql and save it and let us know if it was your infinite teacher and diversity in your team for creativity thank you very much and hope you have a great learning time happy hacking everyone no marigato and look
