from live pier super cool guys super great team super excited to have them here for nft hack uh eric floor is yours i'll let you take it away thank you thank you luke uh appreciate it and thank you for for having life here here um really excited to be sponsoring this event uh and today um you know we have about 30 minutes in on the agenda and i'd love to talk to everyone about video nfts and web 3. and how these things all fit together and uh and what are what are some of some of the interesting trends and opportunities uh that we're seeing in the space uh to just get your um your creative juices flowing to think about your hacks for the weekend um cool so let's just dive in um for the agenda and i'm going to give a brief introduction to to life here for for those who aren't as familiar with the project and talk a little bit about the underlying technology um i'm going to kind of take a take a step at teasing out what the web3 video stack looks like right so um you know we all know and kind of compare that with um how how that's different from the web 2 video stack we'll get we'll get into talking about some of the emerging trends in web 3 video and also of course talk about the life here developer toolkit and then of course a lot of a lot of nft um kind of uh nfd uh topics would come up in this conversation uh so let's just dive into it um so a little bit about life here life here is the video streaming layer for web3 right um why are we building this uh because about 80 of all the traffic on the internet is in video format a lot of that video now lives in these kind of creator platforms or social social platforms right whether it's you know instagram facebook youtube twitch uh things like that there's about 50 million creators around the world creating content for these platforms and a large number of them are actually just professional creators they that's their livelihood and that's all they do right with all this content being created on this platform um we're starting to see some of the the downsides of the centralized platforms in terms of um you know taking a large chunk of the um kind of the value from these creators uh in terms of um kind of uh being a centralized force to to to like enforce opinions on on people's rights so for example a lot of youtube creators end up creating videos not because that's the best content that they can create but because they need to create a video in a specific format with a specific content type in order to game the youtube recommendation algorithm to to get on top and that's kind of the only way to win in that game right and so um as we as we start to to look uh see some of these um downsides of the centralized platforms and start to look into web 3 into decentralized applications um live pier creates um creates an opportunity and plays a pretty important role in this migration because live peer is decentralizing the video streaming infrastructure layer so that video native web 3 applications can exist on top of this infrastructure and just as a nice side benefit uh because of its decentralized nature it's able to kind of take advantage of a lot of spare capacity laden capacity uh that's already exists um connected to the internet today and it's able to dramatically cut down on the cost of video streaming um so diving a little deeper into just how life here works right um you know like at the core life here is a set of protocols not dissimilar to how you know ethereum or bitcoin is a protocol or how bittorrent is a protocol right um it describes a set of rules uh for for kind of the rules of engagement for participants to make this video streaming network to work so people can provide provide capacity to the network as well as provide kind of economic value to the network by staking or they can use the network for video processing or video streaming um you can think of the the kind of the protocol as a smart set of smart contracts that's deployed on the ethereum blockchain right and a part of that is a global registry of workers or we call them orchestrators and and when someone is building an application and wants to broadcast the video that broadcaster uses a discovery protocol looking at that registry of orchestrators to find out where they are and the broadcaster can start work um using those uh capacities to process their video and of course uh the the network itself is very robust in that if any uh worker stops working it's very easy for the broadcaster to spell back to another one without affecting the the end viewer's experience here we're seeing kind of a schematic diagram of a gpu right it's interesting to point out that uh one of the one of the reasons life here is able to cut the cost down by so much is because it's utilizing the spare capacity that's sitting in all the cryptocurrency mining rigs are using gpus uh because when you're mining crypto you're only using kind of these cuda cores at the bottom which is our or the kind of the compute processing course and you're not using the encoding and decoding chips that's on the top so by running the lifehear software you can actually tap into kind of both of these resources and take more full advantage of the card and as a result the the library network has been growing really nicely in the last year now processing around um over two million minutes of video per week so let's um take a look let's take a dive into web3 the web3 video stack and what that looks like right so before we do that let's take a look at the web 2 video stack this is kind of a high level block diagram of a web 2 video application right so on the left here we have our our front end uh we have our or we have our live video source right so you know in in the case of live streaming the live video source would broadcast the video into a hosted media server this media server would use a transcoding engine to transport the video right and then that media server maybe record the video into an object storage something like s3 or any kind of cloud storage but at the same time also cache that video in a content delivery network a cdn and then the cdn will be used to kind of distribute that video into the front end of a that's a video player that's embedded in a web page so lots of people can watch that video at the same time right so a lot of this is kind of running on you know cloud infrastructure you know owned by you know google or amazon and whatnot um and um and if you are um working on a kind of a video video streaming solution like a youtube instead of a live streaming solution like a twitch right um you know you would upload the video file uh also into a media server that media server still transcodes the video still uploads the video uh the transcoded result into a object storage and then that video still gets cached by cdn and you know gets distributed to the to the video player right so those are all actually quite similar and and of course on the other side you have your server side application logic right that talks to your front end and then that uses a database that's also hosted usually on a centralized provider so let's compare this with the web three video application stack right so of course um at the top we have our um our crypto wallet right uh we all have our crypto wallet and the crypto while it connects with the blockchain and oftentimes a smart contract layer it's submitting uh it's submitting transactions into the smart contract to do certain actions and that's changing the state of the application of the smart contract itself and then there's a decentralized query layer you know for example the graph right and the front end can use that query engine to to get the data out of the blockchain and sometimes combining that with some other data source to form this front-end application right so in a decentralized context the front-end becomes very important and we complete and you know in a completely decentralized form in a completely decentralized context there is no backhand right the back end is the blockchain uh and of course uh for the video streaming portion you would still need an infrastructure to do that right so uh in the decentralized context um the video stream of the video will be broadcasted into this decentralized streaming and transcoding infrastructure uh which you know live here uh it is playing a role here right as that video gets ingested into life your network and gets transcoded it can then be recorded into a decentralized storage solution uh so maybe something like a file coin ipfs or rweave or you know sia skynet and then it gets streamed to a decentralized cdn right and then there are a few of them that are popping up right now uh and then that gets distributed to the video player um and and same thing if you have a video that file that you want to stream right you upload it into the decentralized streaming network that network kind of takes care of the the integration to the rest of the stack and that gets uh played in the in the video player so so if we have to to summarize right so what we'll see you know there's basically three different layers right at the bottom we have the smart contract layer that you know contains the token standards and contains a way for us to transfer value for example buying and selling nfts um we have market makers that provides liquidity to a lot of these economic transactions and there's also tools that allows us to build kind of decentralized coordination mechanisms that allow things like daos to exist right and and on top of the smart contract layer we have the infrastructure layers right so that's the decentralized storage decentralized data query or decentralized video streaming networks and on top of that we have the actual applications themselves uh whether it's you know social nft metaverse applications with the wallets right so those are kind of consumer-facing experiences um let's take a look at some of the emerging trends in in web3 video right it's quite a it's quite a nascent uh field but just in the past three to four months we're seeing a lot of really interesting applications being built the first category is kind of web 3 social applications and here are some examples for example portal is kind of a decentralized version of twitch um discover here is a decentralized version of reddit um and we even have some um you know decentralized web3 social building blocks or ecosystems right so subsocial or diesel these are kind of almost like layer one um blockchain solutions to build uh social specific um layer one solutions so the these applications have uh a lot of times have to have comments uh some something in common with each other right um so they always they all allow your users to own their data uh they they sometimes allow community ownership via tokens uh sometimes the communities even form daos right so for the example of discover right every subreddit essentially becomes uh becomes a dow in itself there's usually frictionless value transfer right so especially in the video streaming case uh there's often uh crypto native tipping mechanisms uh sometimes there's even staking mechanism towards uh the content creator themselves um when people are really um you know experimenting with those um with those mechanisms a lot of these applications use live video to drive user engagement uh and they use video content to enrich the video uh the the user experience inside the applications um the next category is a web three creator applications right and and the way i think about how this differs from the social applications is that the creator applications oftentimes focus on the creators themselves right so mirror is like a really good example um it's it's a you know urban free native blogging platform um similar to like a medium but it also allows uh the blog creators to do for example uh crowdfund right or to sell their the blog at itself as an nft right so there are all these interesting uh web3 building blocks that makes that make that makes us really unique um so what are some of the commonalities in in these applications well they allow their creators to own the work right and that's the most important thing oftentimes in the format of minting nfts and storing whatever they create in a decentralized storage that's tied to the creator's wallet instead of tying to you know the applications database right they allow the creators to own their audience they allow the creators to monetize uh for example through selling nfts or through kind of a token gated experience uh for exclusive content right so for example you can only access a certain video if you own a specific nft that was sold a month ago something like that um and and of course creators often make video as their main content format in these types of creator applications the next category is metaverses right and this is um i feel like these days you can't read the news without reading about the metaverse um and and you know we all we've all heard of decentraland uh maybe we've heard of sandbox there's a couple other ones cryptovoxels there's a project called universe that's pretty interesting uh and and there are these unique immersive social experiences that um that often are you know in in this case oftentimes in browser game-like experiences right and then they're these like virtual worlds that are being built you are a character walking around the world uh interacting with others um video streaming can play a pretty important role in this uh in in the metaverse um in in two cases one is uh by streaming video from the real world into the metaphors right oftentimes you have needs like that so for example you can have a virtual concert where you have a stage of a dj that's uh doing a live stream but the stage itself is in the metaverse and vice versa you can have you you can stream video from within the metaverse out so that people can kind of consume this content in a passive way right so people people have done things like streaming um popular locations in the metaverse out to other streaming platforms or to people who are just not participating in the metaverse at the moment but they might want to know what's going on in in those popular locations the other category uh is uh video nft marketplaces right so we have the usual suspects here like the uh open seas wearable you know zora is kind of an open version of that um there's a platform called glass that's uh video specific nft a marketplace slash creator platform um and and some of the commonalities there is they're trying to aggregate demand form from the collectors of these nfts right there are marketplaces with pretty strong network effects right the more users the more creators go there the more valuable these these marketplaces become they oftentimes use video as a more engaging content format than jpegs right and video is actually still kind of an emerging content type in the nft world partially because it's not easy to work with video just yet in fact life here is building some tools to make it much easier to mint video based nfts and kind of work with these these assets and finally we're starting to see some pretty innovative economic models in these nft marketplaces that haven't been done before right so for example i know the glass the glass team recently launched a bonding curve based nft where the price of the nf anybody comment uh the nft uh but the price of the mint will go up um the more people mint it and and of course you can sell you can also sell the your the nft back into the smart contract so if you bought early and you sold later and as more people bought it then you would have made it and then you haven't made delta i think that the other interesting thing to think about is as these nft contracts start to become popular they'll start to hold a certain a decent amount of um you know deposits uh inside these smart contracts then that can be uh for example deposited into d5 to earn yields right there's there's some interesting um there's some interesting lego black building uh that can happen uh in in this world let me dive into the live pier developer toolkit a little bit to to show you guys um what you can do with live pr to to tap into some of these opportunities um the the first one i wanna i wanna point out is um this um developer gateway uh product that that's hosted at lifeyard.com so this is think of it as uh the infuria um infiora to ethereum as um lifehere.com to the livestream network right so host a gateway service that allows anybody to easily build a video application in fact you can build a live streaming application within 15 minutes using using this api and this dashboard there's even some there are even some good examples here you can go to the live fear demo app and take a look at take a look at that application it's it's even there's a deployed version so you can go and go play around with the live app um another tool is um is what we call the web rtmp right so this tool allows um allows you allows people to build a broadcasting experience from the browser right so it allows you to kind of open up a browser window uh using this sdk to be able to stream your webcam directly from within the browser into the live peer into the lifetime network and there's also kind of a deployed version that you can play around with just cast it just cast that it um and finally here's a here's a a newer tool that we that we've just created which is a transcoding cli tool right so um if we refer back to this where transcoding fit in uh it's over here right as the users upload a video uh the video needs to be transcoded first before it gets shown to the viewers and that's because uh video files live in all kinds of formats all kinds of resolutions and a lot of times they aren't optimized for video streaming right so while a file is living on your computer and it can be watched with a very smooth playback once it's uploaded to the internet and once once it's being streamed um it should be transcoded first before uh before being being streamed down and that's what this transcoding cli tool does for any video file you can simply evoke a command and transcode that video using the live peer network and get that output you can put that output into for example a decentralized storage solution like an ipfs or an rv so that's a little bit of all i wanted to cover i want to open up the room for for any questions now feel free to uh come off of me go ahead yeah so i have a question about latency of such uh service because as far as i understood there is a intermediate intermediate servers which [Music] deported and caught the data other formats and if you do it in decentralized ways i'm worried about waiting right are you talking about like latency for like a live stream yes yes got it um yeah so um you know you could you can go check out the um the livehere.com hosted gateway service uh to to check out for the latency yourself uh currently uh the the latency is pretty standard uh it's it's similar to any other uh video streaming service that you would find which you know in standard kind of hls format video it's about anywhere between 8 to 16 seconds depending on you know a lot of different conditions lifeguard is working on kind of a lower latency version of this and we're we're planning to deploy that soon and that will bring down the latency to you know anywhere between four to six seconds until end uh eric can you speak to some of the downsides of life here because from your presentation it seems kind of insane like it just seems like there's no reason to use aws video transcoding over live paint so what other kind of caveats we can expect um well i would say life here is just better uh it's it's a much it's a much more affordable uh solution than than something like aws um i would say the um the trade-off that you you really have to think about is um you know for aws it comes with just very like a lot of developers are very familiar with it right because people have been using it for a long time so that's a toolkit that just is kind of um widely accepted and um and for for for life here you know it's a decentralized solution right and a lot of times people um think that it's it might be risky to use a more risky to use a solution like that but i think we've done a pretty good job over time to to prove that the live peer video streaming solution is is just as good cool thank you hi eric um are there any projects uh working on 100 uh or 360 videos uh in the in this area and if not what tips could you provide to you know have in mind to work on a project on this line thank you you're asking whether there's people working on 360 videos like an immersive 360 video exactly yes got it um yeah so that that's a that's a cool topic um i've i only know of people who have built prototypes um of 360 videos um and and i haven't seen like real live production applications yet um it's actually totally um passable to do that right because at the end of the day the way 360 video works is you know it's still kind of a video canvas but it's just distorted in a way that um when you display it in the browser the video player can kind of wrap it around and create kind of the 360 experience right but from an infrastructure and transporting and streaming perspective uh it's actually just compa already compatible with uh with the existing uh um standards and infrastructure so so it would be awesome to see uh it'd be awesome to see some uh 360 video uh ideas coming out of the sacrament thank you yeah i love to work on something related to that but also related to that um i'm not clear on how i could integrate that to you know now the device because of course like i could develop something you know to show in a browser but then um when you want to see like you know like in a in a device like an oculus uh i don't know how it could be integrated with live yeah so um so usually the way it works is that um for the oculus for example the oculus has its own like video player um and and the way to make it work in the video player is actually not dissimilar to the way you make it work in a browser right so because in a browser you still use a video player it's just a browser-based video player versus you know on a device not like oculus oculus has its own ocular-based oculus based video player and and you know the video format and protocol itself should still be compatible in that case got it thank you if anyone has any last questions feel free to come off and ask away if not highly recommend following up in the discord it is an excellent resource as you're building your hack out over the weekend um get to talk to great people like eric and shannon and um continue the conversation um and others you know what i mean yeah i i will be there and uh and i i've also shared a calendly link um so so hackers can kind of schedule 15 minute time slots uh with me personally to to you know chat about your hacks and talk about you know any any problems that you're facing uh so um yeah i'd love that you should if you definitely take advantage of it love to i'd love to talk to you uh and talk about your hacks we got a pretty interesting question in the chat from ricardo um how would life pierce censorship or how would live peer censor someone broadcasting illegal stuff or how do you handle that yeah yeah that's a really good really good question and something that's really important to answer from from like a video streaming perspective we have we have a few product features that that tries to solve this problem the first is there is a machine learning algorithm based approach on the transcoding side right so as the video is being transcoded the broadcaster can turn on a machine machine learning based class classifier so that when the video is being transcoded uh because it's sitting on the gpu it can also be sent to an ai pipeline to understand kind of what type of content it is right so for example um it's the the kind of the really popular illegal example is people using uh kind of online live streaming platforms to stream like soccer soccer games uh like premier league soccer games that happens all the time right um so um and and you know of course uh if you are run if you're the operator of the platform you need a way to stop that because otherwise you are subjected to to kind of legal actions uh so a lot of people use um you know people who build on top of life here can use this uh this tool to understand like hey is there soccer games going on on my platform right now and if there is life peer can send like a web hook to the to the application developer and they with their with the related information and they can make the decision on on how to deal with that um and and but in general um the the way life here approaches this is by um just providing the right tooling for developers so the developers have a way to deal with the uh deal with the illegal content because at the end of the day uh the kind of the developer app the application developers are the ones who who are like trying to solve this problem for sure i think we have like a follow-up question there and oh luke sorry i think we have a follow-up question and we'll probably end the session right after that but can you have anti-censorship and control of rights at the same time from jordan in the chat yes um yeah again i think a really really worthwhile question to ask um anti-censorship and um and control of rights i think comes down to um like the the way we think about it is um plausible deniability and allowing the operators of our platform to operate within kind of um within the legal the legal cons constructs of their of their context right so everybody's different um so so you know that those are the types of toolings that we that we provide to um to operators um and and we leave the and part of being the decentralized network is that um you know no one no one is calling the shots to say this stream is allowed on this network and this stream is not allowed right so um so so that that is a part of the you know the responsibilities for the application developers that are using these platforms uh one more one interesting question that i think is pretty uh valuable for everyone here are there any specific projects or verticals the live the live peer team is keen to see tackle during the hackathon yeah um we have some prizes that we have um we have announced uh so i think the price prices might have already been announced uh but let me go through uh this so we have you know one price just for the killer web 3 app we want to be wowed and then another for the best application that are in web3 social gaming or metaverse categories uh another we want to see kind of a good um token gated live streaming tool a lot of a lot of creators are asking for this and finally we have a co-sponsored prize with our friends at unlock that will you know that it'll go to kind of anyone who's uses unlock and life here to showcase the power of the combination awesome well thank you so much eric and uh thank you to everyone else for joining us here um really excited to see what the uh the hack projects look like over the weekend and really uh stoked to have everybody in attendance today so we're gonna be closing the room here um as i said before reach out to eric in the discord i continue the conversation there and good luck
