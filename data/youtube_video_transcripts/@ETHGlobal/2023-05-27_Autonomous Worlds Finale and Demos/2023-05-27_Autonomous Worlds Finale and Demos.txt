foreign [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I appreciate all of your patience and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to autonomous Worlds Finale let's see how we're doing so all of you are watching this on Youth global.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is what we're going to be using to stream everything which means that you can talk to us you can talk to all of our demos today and ask any questions we'll be able to look at everything and respond to you but let's quickly get started autonomous worlds is brought to you by eth global and for those of you who are joining us for the first time equals an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and Summits both in person and online but this event is a hackathon and we're excited to tell you all that's happened in the last seven days we've had 435 Hackers from 51 different countries participate in building on autonomous worlds spanning 22 different time zones we kind of looked at where people were coming from and we're super Blown Away to see representation from six different continents across all these amazing cities and countries across the world and on top of that we had 10 incredible mentors who were there to tell everybody what is the most amazing stuff you can do on top of autonomous worlds and mud and six incredible Partners who are going to be announcing all the incredible prizes You've Won through all of them in total they're giving away fifty thousand dollars in prizes and we're going to talk about everything that came out of this event and who won what prizes I want to give a quick shout out to our six partner Xerox Park lattice optimism file coin lead theorem foundation and nft Dot storage you'll be learning about all the prizes very soon now before we go into all these things we just have a quick action item for all of our amazing hackers after you've submitted your project you would have seen this prompt on your dashboard but we really want to understand how we can make all these hackathons even better so there should be a quick feedback form on your hacker dashboards you can also go to this URL directly which is youth global.com events autonomous slash feedback there's about six to seven questions in there a lot of them are simple rate this item one to ten and anything that you kind of tell us there will help us make the next one even better for the next thousand people all right enough of the intro let's go into what the last few days have been about we have 435 of these hackers build a lot of incredible projects and in total 109 things were built on top of mud and autonomous worlds from those 109 submissions we picked 10 finalist teams what we'll be doing today is bringing those teams on and they'll be demoing all of you what they built with a live demo of their project I want to quickly shout out all these 10 incredible teams so our 10 finalists are opcraft 2 coin race autonomous Game of Life netherscape month vrf realm of Pepe Isle of colors Garnet pfp Wars and trade Wars they are going to be the 10 demos we're going to see here in this live stream and I want to congratulate to these 10 teams for their amazing accomplishment now before we go into the first demo I also want to take a quick second here to thank the 99 teams listed here for doing something incredible in a very short amount of time what we can see and do with autonomous worlds is very much of a growing idea in his face being able to play with all these things as they're being developed help improve how we can standardize anywhere from the SDK to the experience to the possibilities it's an incredible thing and just because you were not one of these 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough we want to make sure that you have the recognition and the opportunity to really showcase and be proud of what you built and you there are a lot of you here who have won prizes who are not also our 10 finalists so stay pretty uh well just be patient stay focused on making what you built even better we really hope that a lot of you will continue pushing code to what you submitted uh two days ago and if you need any help with anything from here on whether it's getting connected with some of our mentors or people in this space don't hesitate to Ping us and we'll be happy to help you with anything that we can from the youth Global community and the global Network and all of you can now also head over to youth global.com showcase to see all the 109 projects that came out of this event and that will include all the things from what they built how they built it and some amazing video demos and some screenshots enough of me talking let's go into our very first demo so for our first team that's going to be gaming what they built I'm excited to bring on realmo Pepe to show all of you what they created for this event so without further Ado let's welcome realm of Pepe great thank you hey everyone we are the realm of Pepe team for our hack we built an adventure RPG taking an inspiration from our favorite Classics from Super Nintendo an early MMO era and combined it with our passions for Pepe memes and composable on-chain assets I'm VJ and these are my teammates Joanna Nuno and Mick we all work at SuperFood so game assets are conventionally managed by a single developer and not freely portable by users or composable but even on chain assets have some hard limitations in terms of the scalability of ongoing payments and transfers every change in Balance requires on-chain transactions we wanted to demonstrate that the way game resources are usually represented on chain can be made significantly more power by enabling asset streams of superfluid and this consistent multiplayer World state with mud moving on to the demo the player characters are wizard Pepes summoned to defeat the evil Pepe at the end of the game to beat the area and the except the player has to build five magical soldiers a three-step process involving resource Gathering trading and building the ux here is radically simplified with the use of our use of integrated burner wallets so first up the players have to go and locate some resource nodes skept around the map and receive their resource in ongoing stream these resources act like a faucet and the player starts receiving an ongoing stream after accessing them um after receiving some sapphires the player can head to a Trader to swap crystals for blue potions another interaction which goes on in ongoing stream I think I think we need to switch screens over sorry you can only see the the slides and checking the inventory in the game the player will be able to see a net inflow basically from these resources as they're being received the the second step is basically trading there you go lovely Second Step here now is trading from from those sapphires that have been received to um blue potions which are the kind of second stage in this crafting um you can actually see that uh um Indian players inventory that that the flow rate of sapphire is reduced because you now have an outflow um and there's an inflow now of these blue potions and the final stage is the player heading to a summoning area where they can actually start crafting Soldiers by sending them a stream so if the player heads to the right and there's actually a summoning stage and by clicking on this one button at transactions initiated and that stream is started which which actually meant an nft and this is an evolving nft so you'll be able to see as the player opens up the inventory that there actually are several stages completing these evolving nfts in each Zone will unlock the next Zone there are four zones planned with the final containing the game's final boss an evil Pepe and the game ends with enough resources from the final stage been streamed towards evil Pepe and players collaborate to complete the round in the shortest time and get on a leaderboard and now you can see here the the nft in the bottom left hand corner is evolving to its final state so explaining the game's resources and economy we built three different types of stream enabled contracts to power the streaming game Mechanics for this hackathon a special case of force it for the resource nodes Traders which enable different input and output flow rate for flowing trades and evolving nfts which take a stream to progress over time and heading back to the presentation you'll actually be able to see these animated between several different stages these mechanics are highly scalable enabling infinitely ongoing value transfers without further intervention required which is why we think we qualifies as a core building block of autonomous worlds the surface area for expanding this game is massive with its token mechanics and fully Unchained assets we see these Primitives generating resources trading assets and potentially infinite token syncs as the building blocks of a new game ecosystem built around openness and interoperability massive scale asset flows can be running between a huge number of parties without any additional transactions needed and Merchants could act as the bridges between games the different resources and win conditions ultimately we hope to see players and game developers adding their own story lines by contributing new Loops to the economy and new assets to this Canon thank you very much amazing thank you so much for our first amazing demo this sounds really cool and hopefully you'll get to the latest very soon congrats all right on to our second finalist demo for today I want to bring on team netherscape uh hello everyone uh we are net escape and we are building and launching RPG World Union mod so uh before we dive into the exciting features of the game let's go with our mental model first so we started with the three basic elements in a traditional RPG game then we refrain them under ECS and so that we can map out a list of entity functionality relationship you guys can can go over it later I'm gonna just pass on the other side the seconds of the first slide so then we've done that we realized uh PC uh playable character uh actually sits in the middle of the map and has more functionalities than any other entity types so uh there actually will realize there's actually nothing stopping us from making every non-playable character NPC playable so we call it PC Centric mental model so with that in mind we can we build four features during this hackathon with ease using only uh 13 cables and seven systems so uh so yeah let's let's get started let's take a look at the features uh sure this okay ah maybe this one yeah so yeah okay so you guys can see it so first feature is a chorus shape map I mean there's no boundary on this map the players can literally just crop to everywhere and uh let's scroll over here so the second is uh uh uh uh launch system so under as you can see from this guy he got three uh PC Primal characters and the keys command so he can offer one of them and then which will appear on the loan Market of course he can resign the offer but let's not do it right now so uh third is he can Siege on the map click this so whoever so let's switch to another player okay so let's show this okay so this guy little guy he's walking over here and then if he steps on the Red Zone boom it goes into combat uh okay I switch back to the original so as you can see uh the uh uh she is just Blast Away uh it's a um like block based kind of better mechanism as you can see different um PC they generate energy differently and each attack kind of uh using different amount of energy so if we guess let's do it okay so uh this guy we just uh take a little goal on this guy uh so switch back switching back on the unfortunate player yeah uh remember we we have uh a PC on the loan market right now so that's where that's when magic happens right so these guys will make shots so he can call on to the loan Market except and immediately he got the priority injected into uh his team so so yeah let's blast away this is a reflection is my favorite it has a lot of damage wow that's one shot High crits very nice and then keep cutting open okay okay I don't have enough energy for the cutting open okay no no I did okay so um I wouldn't battle and uh let's see I have here uh PC in my under my team I still have that but the other guy he's the unfortunately loser uh over here he's got wipe out from the map uh I think I can respawn yeah yeah okay I can respond so he right now he has zero on his team okay he has one but uh what he can do is he can terminate this contract remember he loan a PC on the market so the duration is uh 150 blocks so we still need to wait for 90 blocks to give the PC back so while we wait let's go back to the slides okay so let's recap uh where we got what we built so far we realized four functionalities so most important one is the reinforcement right because it's a cross-function concept when we're putting it on chain it becomes a loan market for players PCS commanding rights so what we can learn is I think this kind of thing importance are perspective of what we can build on chain uh we can piggyback on other rights there's tons of them like remember the map uh just like we did with reinforcement or erc20 dealing with ownership rights maybe we can generate something more abstract uh more high levels like friendship story or even love with your PC so our next step is uh we're going to complete this whole chart and then we finish the game and hopefully can you create a single month maybe not but um but more exciting things to come and stay tuned our goal ultimately is to we want to bring something real something true and so let's let us know what you think and which gameplay we should do next uh Battleship spaceships or white boots or maybe both uh so I'm brief Kendall and this is our amazing team um I'm glad we ship something really cool oh I almost forgot we have this guy contract uh right remember this guy he yeah so let me help him to uh get his uh waifu back so Terminator contract boom you got it back nice awesome thank you so much prief Kendall that was a cool way to understand how you can do all these things interactively and uh hopefully all of us also get to play this soon all right thank you all right on to our third finalist demo for today I want to bring on team autonomous Game of Life hi this is a comoribi uh aw maximalist and building aw house in Japan today we are going to share our project autonomous Game of Life what is that is the MMO strategy digital biological simulation game it is based by Conway's Game of Life Class multiplayer lose Plus on chain using the mark wall will be challenges of the aw space is that it's very hard to design cool digital physics because we can create anything from scratch but for beginners like us we should use some format to build that's why we built these products on 10 Sarah automaton template for AWS and we used it for MMO automaton autonomous demo Drive so here's a demo the lures are simple each player can place the 13 cells in the initial States each cells in the game can be either alive or dead and they're just basic for loose and right now the putting a w here as a first player so full basic blues are the first one any live cell with a fewer than two live neighbors will die as if by under population and any live cell with more than three live neighbors will die if by as if by over population and any live cell with two or three live neighbors with lives On to the Next Generation and any any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will become our live cell as if by need production and any new player can join anytime so right now the player 2 is coming and you know praying together I'm gonna let's pray sad one a w here again and if Cell came into the contact with the cell the place by another player the cell of the player that fills many surrounding cells Will Survive so right now uh the blue one is a maybe oh changing so it's automatically interchanging the cell following the loom always like Game of Life foreign so here's a summary of the autonomous Game of Life fully unchang MMO Conway's Game of Life and we used it Matt too we also built ongen Terra automaton template for a w because the game over life is one of the models of the Sera or the model so we hope you use this temperature to build any models of Etc automaton on chain and making new simple potential physics and the simple aw quickly so what's next is a we need to have a unchanged neural Cellar automaton template for a w then we can add Randomness and we can build the more complex autonomous world yep yes pretty much subtle let's keep boosting in the humans autonomous World immigration plan together thank you amazing uh amazing classes and uh congrats on the demo this is great bye bye all right on to our fourth demo for today welcome coin race hello everyone okay uh hello everyone uh we're Team coin race my name is giley I did Art and here with me is Fab he did the development so let's get into it what we have built so during the hackathon we're interested in what we'll be capable in doing with the framework we're particularly interested in real time and multiplayer gameplay so that's what we built it's a real-time mood play um strategy board game uh in this game you can play up to four people you bring your nfts into this game and then you you explore this map you have five minutes to go around the map and claim different Minds once you claim the mine we're gonna start generating coins for you as you can see the green red and blue coins there uh the goal of the game is to get as much coin as you can and then exchange those coins to stablecoin the winner of the game is the one that have more stable coin at the end uh everything you do in the game you burn the stamina so we're interested in seeing how different players will have different stairs strategies to try to win the game by either exploring the map claiming the mines or uh stealing other people's mind uh I know this is attack hackathon but I want to just use one minute to give some tips about how we build the assets that might be helpful for other people building similar prototypes like this uh we wanted to use AI um as a challenge the first issue is it's hard to keep cohesive all uh the visuals for the different images you're creating so we just slap a filter called rat to dealer on top of it it looks retro it looks cool um and makes everything cohesive the second thing is sometimes you have a image as a reference but you don't know exactly what kind of prompt you need to use to generate similar image use describe upload that image on me journey and median will give you the prompts to generate similar images the other thing is Dash Dash style you put at the end of a prompt that's how we build the map it makes the image dialable as you can see very easily to create a map and we just use a spot healing brush tool on Photoshop and that makes the map more organic so you don't see the repetitions there last is remix mode it does generate uh keep the essence of the image but generate different assets that's how we build uh the mines and the exchange houses in the game I hope that was helpful for some folks over there but let's get into the demo cool thanks yeah so for the demo what we have is the Technologies we used were mod 2 with the react template and NFC storage also in this demo we're gonna have two windows for two different contexts in the browser and to simulate two different players here um our as players drawing so let's say like player one here is gonna join the game the client side there is a burner wallet that's already featured from mud and of course in the real application with the link this burner wallet together with metamask where the players would bring in their nfts into the special effects then after this would do but you know since it's a demo we're just using the preset of cryptokitties for the second player you can see almost exactly the same screen as the player one there was no extra Network code to make it all happen which is really cool also meaning anyone can expect it in this world and uh it's permissionless to join so anyone with an FPS would be able to join as long as there are still like players lots available here so let's go ahead and do it for player 2. now the game timer will start as long as the players agree uh to start they're ready so let's go ahead and do that as well now the game started and the players the in this in our game the players have to balance their stamina with their actions since the stamina as noted here regenerates but very slowly um the we want the players to develop their own strategies and at the same time react to the other player strategies so let's see an example here for example our player one comes and they want to claim the mind they have to choose between one of the coins so let's say they think red their red maximalist um but then player 2 comes along and they might choose green so in that sense player one spent 20 stamina together mine but didn't get much benefit out of it because uh third two just came along and started mine so the coins go up and hopefully they Moon it in terms of stable collision and they win the game so sadly that's all the features we have for this demo all the time we have or this demo but to summarize I already had a lot of development experience before on ethereum and this framework did feel uh a lot faster to prototype and create a multiplayer game from scratch for next steps what we see coming is that we want to finish the gameplay mechanics so we want to have challenges we want to have the exchange with the key part to finish the game and then actually a screen for game end we next one is that we want to run an internal gameplay and Deploy on optimize right now we have a bit of an embarrassing hack that every block the players are sending ticks to the server to update their stamina and mines and stuff but we want to experiment with uh optimism taking optimizable layer so pretty excited to try that out and see how a really autonomous world would behave in that way I think it's going to allow for more stuff as well and lastly and that's a bit more future but Gila and I are very excited to try with the case narc so similar mechanics to Dark Forest game and it allows for a lot of cool mechanics like hidden hands and and fog of war and all this kind of stuff uh yeah lastly you guys can follow us at at rugger games on Twitter as well for updates and that's all yeah thank you awesome congrats and those those are great demo all right thank you all right next up is our demo Isle of colors welcome alcar's team feel free to get whenever you start all right thank you so hey guys I'm Sarah and the project I'm very excited to show is I love colors it is a 3D isometric multiplayer game that aims to offer surf a unique blend between social experiment color strategy and color theory so here's a little sneak peek around the game like the the best it looks in the MVP and yeah but before entering into the game let's talk about the so the main code loop of the game so when you enter the game um it will be a blank canvas you will start with nothing so you will sort of in this time wander around in the world to explore other player towns other player buildings and other forests and so after you wander around gather some resources you can start creating your own towns and buildings and but the catch is that none of the buildings or your town buildings will have colors so the game revolves around this concept is that you will have to fight to get the color resources together different unique colors to get color inventory so you can color your own buildings you want the experience system is something like Minecraft and you want to create the attachment to the world so yeah I mean let's enter into the game so when you actually in the game it's a blank canvas so you will sort of like wander around gather the resources but for the sake of this demo that's already things that you can sort of like place around so I think a place to hurt some other building resources you can rotate around then when you click on Save the all these objects will be stored on the month on the on chain using mug and um also for the colors it's already colors in this game in this demo as well so it seems to be a little small bug but it's it's also in like unique interesting that you can plan products you could pay other interesting colors and then you will have to color different parts of the buildings differently so that's real day so that's creates like a real sort of fun experience and then you can also colors on buildings like you can like one of the buildings and then orange there so like as I said you'll color to nothing so you'll have to wander around the world to color your building so you go and end up in places like this so This is called pretty Spirit where if you get close to it you will get some some colors some maybe like unique color maybe a common color so these places create a very interesting point of interest for other players so like fight around together as much colors the resources as they can so we have like bigger color inventory and you just you also see now the it's also the unite cycle in this game so you can see that it turns darker and you'll see that the color of the building is now gone so if here's another interesting Dynamic into this game like you have to get close to the building to see what they are colored so you can scope the colors are Blues buildings which creates like another interesting Dynamic you can hardly under buildings like from other players from other towns so right so Andrea like you can see the on the on chain using mer the building's position rotation has been stored and for the character their positions has been stored so yeah and um from the new around the graveyards in the future usually we usually look like beautiful Graphics if you want to make sure we go to the edge of the graphics on the web so we'll be in the coming months porting this to a new wgpu framework and then add some cool error shaders so it looks way more beautiful we do acknowledge that the current game Loop is kind of like somewhat uninteresting so if you wanna a goal is to make sure to have the attack so players have the attachment to their to their towns that they have created and they have like really fun experience with the other players like steel impellers matching their color resources and using them using the powers of the web 3 we can create some interesting Dynamics in this game like for example some players will have very very unique colors and using ERC lamp 35 and sfts they can sell those fillers like it can create a interesting economy Sam thank you for that my name is syrup I've worked on this front end of this game she will work on this packaging of this game if you want to check out how the game is built all the languages it uses so for the library so you can check out the GitHub and it will blink that's it I hope you hope you enjoyed this experience thanks Sarah this was a really cool demo and uh a really good way to think about a new geometric game congrats all right with this we are halfway at our finalist demos um so up next demo number six pfp War all convincent Eduardo I'm going to present php1 I'm very happy uh just a quick introduction about s we are four four developers we work at comed.io we create blockchain infrastructure tools and web3 games we are French and we are based in Paris is a collaborative game where players um use their layer 1 ethereal mainnet nfts on layer 2 via met framework and storage proof this project is very inspired by Reddit pixel and this project was a huge success let's go for a demo as you can see other players can drop their nfts and take the control of the map in a real time and I want to play so I have to connect my wallet foreign ER wallet generate generated by Matt framework and let's go here this is all my nfts I own on the layer one and I can drop this one here and I can try to replace this ash mask by my ash mask and we have a cooldown so I can drop it again during one minutes and we develop a panel to to test to drop some nfts I don't own and because the storage proof is not valid this transaction will fail on Channel so that's it for the demo let's go back to my presentation why is this project for this hackathon this is our interpretation of an autonomous world it is a trustless collaborative and user generated as you see in real time and our ID is very easy to understand we don't have any graphic designer on our team so we decided to build an existing asset and we are trying to use the network effect by targeting web3 Community who likes to flex their nft and there is a lot of technical motivation uh proving the ownership of that layer one energies on layer 2 is a very powerful we don't need any Bridge or any Oracle this is a big challenge to make this verifier as a pre-comp recompile in opget and the last technical motivation was to discover and stress test the mute framework what have we done precisely we developed we have developed an ethereum Merkel Patricia tree proof of verifier and solidity and we wrote a big article if you want to use a storage proof on your project on layer 2 you can follow this article we also developed web games that use or verifier and finally we develop a pre-compile of this Wi-Fi error and the code is available here and that's it this uh a hackathon was amazing we improved a lot of our understanding of evm pre-combile and all the state of all the ethereum status stored and The Binding features of blood framework is very cool and the organization was cool so that's it thank you awesome cool that's on a really cool demo and uh yeah this is one of those things where we also get to see composability for our Timeless worlds thank you amazing all right next up is trade Wars so without further Ado let's welcome the trade Wars team okay um this is uh trade Wars our project my name is William uh my name is Cameron and uh comma wasn't able to make it today uh so first we're gonna go a little bit over our world uh the world is entirely on chain procedurally generated using purlin noise to do this we've created a two layer system of terrain and objects uh the terrain includes various steps of ocean as well as varying Heights of land so this includes shallow and deep oceans as well as sand grass and mountains objects sit on top of this terrain with applied restrictions for their particular location our two objects currently include reefs Imports where reefs may only spawn in Shallow oceans Imports may only spawn border and water to enable player movement on this auction world since we can't use a fixed update function like in a tradition in traditional game development we need to get creative in uh on how to determine where the player is so uh we made a positioning system based on chunks much like opcraft upon entering and leaving a chunk a transaction is made this world's Unchained quote-unquote physics requires that you take a certain amount of time to sail across a chunk as a function at distance speed and time further restrictions are added to ensure that players could only move on water adhering to the on-chain world this provides both security to prevent players from cheating while playing from the directly through the command line and a seamless experience from the front end so for the economy we've implemented multi-asset balancer pools and the idea is that each Port has continuous generation and consumption of various different Assets Now naturally this opens up the opportunity for Arbitrage as you have one port that maybe has more iron and then another Port that has um you know that needs a bunch of sugar and the resources that we have in the game are iron sugar spices and coins for the gameplay uh we have a few different options so there is attacking which also adheres on chain physics uh these are these require that the players are in certain chunks and they may not be uh in a port so a port is deemed as a safe location for when you are not quote unquote online uh looting once a you've attacked a player and uh they have died um you may loot their uh their goods so this adds a game element of uh danger to the game where the the high seas may experience some robbery uh trading where trading between the different ports so you can either trade what you've just purchased at a different port or what you just looted the death functionality from attacking uh one from these from Trading you may uh earn coins and these uh coins can be purchased they used to purchase upgrades which include your cargo capacity the speed the uh Firepower and fire rate and health regen which is also bound to on-chain physics where you must stay in a porch for your ship to rebuild over time that for our amm um I think this is one of the first at least constant function amm constant product amms in mud uh one of the issues is that there's no erc20s native to Mud um so we have to have a lot of this like wrote logic right over here which makes it a little bit of a pain to build but um we also added the ability to do LPS within this amm and um the amm contract funneling up also manages like the token logic so being able to do transfers approvals um yeah for Tech stack we're using mud and then obviously for a front end we're using beat and then optimism uh we deployed to optimism test it for your quick demo over here there's a quick quick description of uh the game then over here um you can see that uh you can see the trend that's been generated along with some of the Perla noise there's no ports on the map right over here but if we there were to be a port we'd be able to click on the swap button um sell for coins buy for coins um add the lp tokens remove LP tokens and then swap from one asset to the other sent me the iron to um spices put like a random amount um so in terms of next steps I think there's a lot of a lot of really interesting areas for new D5 Primitives so like lending Port ownership um maybe you can even have a tokens reports in the same way that each amm has like a a token that represents maybe the claim to the cash flows um some would all what would also be really interesting is the fact that given that we have an amm and it's integration with broader blockchains if we deployed an optimism for instance we might be able to have like an eth coins pair where people can directly cash out their earnings via the in-game and them without having to rely that was it it was a really fun experience uh building with mod and uh excited to really see uh mud develop out further Lumen cam congrats and hopefully we get to see a lot more of these amen related Primitives be used into a lot of these autonomous games sweet all right three more demos to go and then we'll get to all the amazing prizes our third last demo is garnet hello hello I'm going to present Government consists mainly in two pilots we have a garment that is a vacant that it's taking back-end a transaction indexer a thousand transaction generator it's everything that needs for is going to take care of everything that the client should or it's currently doing in Mal but we are delayed in everything to the back end and then I created a game a simple game a turn-based game called ethernet relations so they must try that the back end is working fine so for this demo we are going to write garnet here is the debugging tool where you can see the change then the chain ID the latest events and the current tables for these words so I make a small script but it's just a generator it's going to create 10 different worlds so we're going to see in real pain that the tables are being updated so it's really nice to have it like this when you are trying to understand what is happening on the evening side of the game so yeah I decided to create this small CLI this government process is also running the game server based on web sockets so we are going to run a cleaning this is the player one here we can see the standard of matches already created this one was the result of the script that I probably previously write but for the sake of it of this demo I'm going to create a new game with player one this one is the it's just a simple CLI game you can see the Google rank card information the game status on the left side and you can see the wire you have Airways and the enemies and here it is on the bottom screen you can see EAD is the ID of the Google match so let's create the a new player player two that's showing this much is a this one so as soon as the player 2 shines we can see that the player one gets all the information updated everything is being processed fast by the way but the drivers are created using matte so for example we can summon the unit if we click video we got someone Sony you can see that the current Manana reduces two two two with the cost of movement so we're going to move squares are signing and then you can move to that square it's based on the movement of each of the cards so I can in turn then this is real because it's not look my return it's a limiter so I can move to the players some a couple of cards you can see here on the UI it's been automatically updated let's enter let's move again and I just going to attack the player so you can see that the health points are we are getting introduced when you attack so the way that I created the attack is you can attack units that are nearby your current selected unit so it's real you can click attack and the help points get reduced and you can do the same here and the unit dies and gets removed from the wall the game ends when the health of any of their bases which is zero Health Point so this is like a quick demo of what I built if you want to learn more about everything that was built well everything worth reading using golang you can check the Ripple you're going to get the information on the indexer database in back in the CLI debugging tool the transaction Builder and the CLI the idea of why I created this project is for the future plans where my intent is to move all the optimistic predictions that currently mad is doing on the client to the awaken and having like a small way to play the games instead of just predicting for the player that is currently sending a transaction we can send the predictions to all the players and maybe reduce the latency instead of one second to maybe 100 milliseconds and is going to smooth all the all the games and it's going to be yeah matches smooth smoother experience then I want to improve the game as in abilities active and passive and then I want to finish refactoring the CLI client and maybe create a Unity client in the future if you have any else or want to try it out feel free to reach out on Twitter or at GitHub and we can chat yeah that's garment thank you this is super thank you people can also try this out right now this is great all right two more demos to go so without further Ado let's welcome John from montvrf for our second last finalist time of the day feel free to get started hey everyone um thanks for inviting me here today I'm going to present on mud vrf which is a secure fast and easy to use RNG for on-chain Games built using mud so today um when you're developing apps with mud it's like pretty hard to access secure Randomness like one short-term solution is to use pseudoranonymous such as the block hash however in the long run this is sort of unsustainable for most applications as it allows malicious parties who aren't even that powerful to predict outcomes of certain transactions which can affect the fairness of the game um the traditional alternative the traditional solution for this is to use sort of a Randomness service and a lot of these random Services exist on other chains such as optimism and arbitrum however because a lot of these mud build games rely on the fact that gas is really cheap on the strains a lot of these random Services don't exist and even if they did it's really hard to simulate uh receiving this Randomness in development today when you're building your mud game so it really needs to be optimized for like the current month development stack it needs to be super easy and quick to install um once you bring your game to production so um first of all I want to give you some context as to what a verifiable random function is so basically a verifiable random function is sort of like a pseudo-random function that provides proof proofs that it's outputs are currently completed correctly and this is a really good way basically to get Randomness on chain and basically if you use it within a smart contract it gives you like three properties one is that it's unpredictable by the user who is requesting for Randomness it's fair as in all the numbers are equally likely um to be used and also it's very random because we use some on-chain Randomness that's very hard to predict so the solution I came up with to solve the problems I mentioned before is to basically build a vrf plugin for mud it's basically a module that automatically installs like certain tables and systems into your mod app so that other systems can query for secure Randomness and the magic of mud modules are that like they can be installed within minutes so I'm hoping to make it as easy to set up as possible and basically to make it super easy to deploy um I and to optimize it for the mud use case I optimize for two properties so one is that it's reasonably secure so in particular I designed it so it requires the Collision of the chain itself or the person who's operating the chain and also the vrf operator and then furthermore I really optimized to make the vrf as low latency as possible like a lot of the vrfs that are in production today take like up to 30 seconds to get Randomness but I really made it so it's super low latency and requests can be often met within a second or within seconds so the design of my system is like quite uh simple so basically let's say you're a developer and you want to build some sort of like card game where you want to deal the cards randomly well whenever you're dealing cards from the deck you need a request for Randomness so basically your system will query my vrs system which is automatically installed by my module for Randomness and then automatically this relayer will be basically be running in the background I'm listening for requests for Randomness from an event and basically it will generate the vrf proof relay it back to the brf system and basically the vrf system will call back into a certain function inside your Blackjack system and present it with some random numbers it can use to deal cards so inside the code it's naturally based on a callback model basically where you'll have a function which is like the entry point where you'll make a request for Randomness to my vrf service and then basically my VR service will call back into a Handler where I'll have a request ID and some random words you can use to deal cards and stuff so now I'll give you a quick demo of how my system works with a simple game of blackjack I built on mud so over here you can see that I have my standard mud client here on the left here I have like a simple game UI and on the right I have my the mod debugger so when I click Start game you can see that it sends a transaction here for start game and you can see here actually that it makes basically this request it adds this request into a mud table basically requesting for some Randomness and basically it happened so fast so maybe it was hard to notice but basically my relayer actually called back into the Handler for start game and you can actually see that the request was handled here because I delete the vrf request record from the database so actually you didn't might have not noticed it but if I press start game here these these cards get re-doubt by my vrf and let's see what happens when I try to play this game at Blackjack so I got to 19 that's a pretty good hand so then I'll Stand and it looks like I won um because the dealer only got 17 points and I have 19 points and yeah so basically as you can see all the numbers here were generated by my verifiable random function and furthermore the requests are met with my relayer within uh within a second so in terms of some future work I plan to improve the security of the protocol so right now it's sort of like a one out of two honesty assumption but we can improve that significantly by relying on sources of some sort of MPC or using vdfs the one trade-off here is that both of these methods have a lot more latency which might ruin the user experience which seems like really important in a lot of these Mud Games and furthermore like right now my vrf plugin makes it really easy to install the contracts but it's not necessarily so easy to deploy like the relayer system so I need to put more work into that in the future I really hope to make this like an open source um open source piece of software that like any mud game can use when they need to access randomness um thank you and yeah I had a super fun time at the hackathon awesome thanks John this was super cool as well being able to actually now leverage off-chain data and making really cool games possible with vrf congrats all right our last and our 10th finalist demo for today without further Ado let's welcome Obi craft 2. Bonnie before we get started all right hey everyone I'm devani from Team Kennett showing what we hacked on the last couple of days opcraft 2 Redstone Edition so all three of us are recent New Order grads and we're interested in unlocking internet native work we think that autonomous worlds are the ideal medium for player creation this is because the simulator verifiably runs forever ensuring Creations never deteriorate and always function as intended also creators have the option to keep the Creations private and it markets organically emerge or register them on chain for Providence we decided to start with block based questions because they allow players to create anything by stacking specific blocks together and leveraging voxel-based physics simulation blocks party low floor start stacking blocks and high ceiling a block physics space World also allows for various game modes to be easily created so for the hackathon we chose to build on top of opcraft which opicraft is by the loudest team and they solve synchronization between a NOAA client which is a voxel-based game engine and smart contracts using mud so for our hack we added a way to let players easily add their own physics with player defined blocks so for our demo we implemented Redstone for the from the popular game Minecraft so for those unfamiliar think of redstone as the components in an electrical circuit like wires energy source Etc and by adding Redstone players can create circuits using redstone blocks and then submit them to specific tests on those circuits so for the live demo we didn't add any Custom Graphics because of time and this enabled creative mode and here's a quick Legend before I go into the demo all the sand blocks are redstone blocks to the energy source the blue and red flowers are the actual wires so Reds on Blue is off and the orange green flowers are the restaurant torches which is an inverted not gate so let's go ahead into our opcraft world and we can go ahead and build an and gate first so let's put some blocks down I'll put some inverted Gates I'll put a wire here or here and so this is our and gate now we have two input signals which are both off and output signal it's also off because it's an and gate when I activate one of the input signals the output signal is still off only when I activate both of them is the output signal turned on as you can see we have built-in and create now and as a user now what I can do is I can actually save this creation as mine and then use it to pass specific test so if I just select the two corners of my creation you can go ahead and register my creation not as registered I can submit for two specific tests so we have an test already built so if I just select my two inputs and then my third output and then over here on the side I have an and press and a nand test if I submit to the end test you'll see we passed the test if I submit to the nand test you see we failed and it's because we haven't built a nandy what what what we allow for is composability right so if another player comes in this world and wants to pass the non-presystem reward for it you can go to a separate part of the world and then spawn the and gate to be able to use it first in building the nand gate because the nand gate is just an and gate um we're still with a not gate so here I've spawn the Iron Gate into the world what I'll do now is extend the and gate by just inverting it at the very bottom over here as you can see I have two inputs that are turned off and my output is on which is the opposite of an and gate and similarly if I activate any of these two signals that output is still on but once both are activated the output is off and so again in the same way the second player can go ahead and register this creation and pass it to specific tests to pass them and you'll see that they passed a non-test but not the and test over here I'll go back to the slides here's a quick diagram if you want something with and in that Gates there's a high level architecture diagram of how we actually implemented the extendable block physics because opcraft itself has no block interaction you know water doesn't flow sand doesn't fall we came up with a general way to allow users to add block interactions interactions so each time an event occurs like a block place or a block break we let users run their own systems and these systems receive the center block that changed and all the neighbors and they can decide which components to update it's a corporate example with redstone is a system that checks every time someone places a mines a block is a rep sounded wire surrounded by a source if it is it should be turned on otherwise if it was previously active and it is no longer a source it should turn off so it's simple as that players can extend the block uh the physics of the World by adding their own systems that get run on these events two interesting future directions we plan on exploring now that we have extendable physics is one private Creations because creators can make their machines private hiding the specific block Arrangement so for example the and gate could have been private but the second player could now verifiably that it works and then purchase the right to use it and build on top of it and second provenance this will allow us to enforce things like retroactively rewarding players who first create Unique Designs which Inspire others so the creator of the and gate could get paid a portion every time a creation that uses it you know a nand gate or more complex circuit like a computer gets used so that's it we'll be continuing to develop this into a fully autonomous world so get in touch if you're interested in being one of the first to play test thank you amazing oh congrats and I think you finally found a way for people to understand bullying algebra that uh that actually sticks so this is super cool thanks for extending op craft the original and uh looking forward to having more things being built on this congrats all right those were our 10 incredible finalists for autonomous worlds to summarize this was Team opiecraft 2 coin

everybody here this officially concludes autonomous worlds but before we sign off this would not be any Global events if we don't tell you what's next so without further Ado this is what the calendar looks like next Friday we'll be starting our online events hack FS so we'll be talking about all the incredible things you can do with storage the Falcon Virtual Machine and also things like autonomous rollstad rely on a large amount of off-chain information to be leveraged and still remain decentralized so if you're still interested in this one check out hack FS by going to hackfs.com and this event starts next Friday then we have 8th Global Waterloo this is the event where youth Global got started and we're doing this thing for the third time this year in Canada for all of you Canadians I saw already a few of them here we'll looking forward to seeing all of you in just about four weeks then we'll be going to Paris at the end of July with youth Global Paris then in September it will be 8th Global New York on 22nd to 24th and we'll conclude the year with a lasting person events in Istanbul from November 17th to 19th all these events are now public and you can head over to any of these events websites to apply get information about signing up as a hacker Mentor volunteer sponsor you name it all that is accessible to all of you so congratulations to everybody this officially concludes autonomous worlds and in the meantime enjoy some Lo-Fi beats and we'll see you next week for hack FS take care everybody goodbye
