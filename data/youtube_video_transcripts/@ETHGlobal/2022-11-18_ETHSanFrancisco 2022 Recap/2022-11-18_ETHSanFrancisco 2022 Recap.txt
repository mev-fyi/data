[Music] GM meets San Francisco what's up eat San Francisco what's up SF the feeling in San Francisco this year is one of recovery and growth I would say after the pandemic so many people who have come from so many places lots of people are here from lots of different parts of the world I guess this one's a lot bigger than that one which is really cool to see one other thing that I love about you robot is like it really brings a lot of newcomers fresh you know my engineer system that come with different questions but oftentimes actually bring New Perspectives this is a hackathon in a big part of the hackathon is actually to have fun and not take yourself too seriously it doesn't matter if it's not a you know a real startup idea that's going to make millions or billions of dollars it has to be a fun thing my favorite part of the youth Global Community is that I could join a hackathon every month if I went into for somebody who was afraid to participate in these kind of events it's really awesome that like I really just go in my emails and I could jump on any hackathon anytime I want don't be shy on day one when you you make most of your friends in University it's the first week of school so when you come into the hackathon you know just start shouting who needs a designer uh you will find your way at first I was a hack solo but I got a team so we ended up doing like a cool project we went through community in general is like something really important just have a support system um build that friendship yeah with everyone I think the whole purpose of web3 and like the tenets of it are that it's open and permissionless and inclusive [Music] what I love about the youth Global Community is how connected everybody is and how open everybody is it's a really warm community and one that wants to really nurture new participants in the space what we need as part of ethereum is for more people to build [Music] do you kind of find in different areas that as a woman you don't always get as received as well as the men do but the East Global Community is not like that at all by any means they're always very welcoming very helpful and the mentorship is top-notch there are so many resources available uh that exist purely to help you get acclimated to get comfortable a lot of safe spaces to ask questions some of the best talks I've seen have actually been at the East Global panels themselves it's where I go to get some of the alpha sometimes you meet with your team you get to put start building things together hear from experts on how to build things better work with really awesome mentors and then present in some of the best VCS in the space and get real feedback and then be hopefully some of the the top winning class will be fill the finalists we have seen projects from out of Youth Global that we have been integrated with immediately um and so it's the wide spectrum of it and just kind of shows uh all that's happening in the ethereum community the different levels of skill uh and how you can kind of have all that here at East Global people just seem like those sleep deprived incredibly happy to be here right and like you know happy to be able to Showcase what they built and even if maybe they weren't able to get it all the way to uh to being deployed it's still a very proud moment for them to be able to show what they built it's an incredible Community like it happened uh you know five years ago and it's reached so many developers it started so many companies um you know I myself actually got into crypto because of the very first Global hackathon and now I have a company um that's you know well funded by great people and so I would not have gone into the space without this community and so it's been really great it's so much fun I feel very lucky to have been going to eat Global hackathons since we all started now five years ago which is crazy it really is a space where if you learn a lot and you put in a lot of hard work you can just build amazing things I can't think of anything more optimistic and invigorating than thousands of people getting together for a weekend because they want to learn they want to meet new people and they want to build something new if you're a developer and you've never been to a three hackathon before you're ready for a treat not only because youth Global is amazing but also because the ethereum community is absolutely incredible [Music]
