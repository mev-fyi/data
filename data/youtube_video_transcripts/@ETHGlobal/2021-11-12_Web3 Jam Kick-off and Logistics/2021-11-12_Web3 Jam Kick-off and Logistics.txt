good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik and one of the co-founders of beef global i want to welcome all of you to web3 jam so you're all watching this on eatglobal.tv and for those of you who are not familiar this is the interface we're using to run this entire event and the rest of the hackathon so you'll be able to log in here and chat and ask any questions that you have and everybody who also logs in and says hi will be receiving a co-op nft token for their participation so come on say hi and uh customize your avatar so this event is organized by eve global and for those of you who don't know eat football's organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and web 3 jam is our last event of the year towards this goal so this is an amazing hackathon here so we have a two-week event where we have over 333 people from 51 different countries participating uh spanning 17 different time zones we put out all the participants on our map from all the cities they're coming in from and this is incredible to see the diversity and the representation we have from all continents in the world and i can't wait to see what everybody builds on top of that we have over 20 ecosystem mentors six technical mentors that are here to give you support and unblock you at any given time of the day um as you work towards your projects and we are also working with 12 amazing partners here who are there to help you succeed but also give out prizes which i'll get into uh very soon and speaking of prizes we have over a hundred thousand dollars in prizes that are going to be given away for this event so uh stay tuned for uh all the details on the prizes so the most common question we've gotten so far from everybody here is what can i build and the answer is a lot of things this event is designed to be as broad as possible on what's happening in web3 so we have so many exciting themes and ideas you can tackle on you can build anything in nfts you can do decentralized gaming um we really want to see really creative things in decentralized media so that's a lot of video hacks and audio related things especially as they leverage design centralized storage and streaming uh of course uh you can do stuff with d5 and analytics and making sense of things that are already on chain and of course it doesn't have to be just a a project that everybody can use you can even create developer tools or abstractions or make utilities for authors to make it easy for them to build cool things or even just contribute to documentation all of that counts and anything you're excited about we're here to support you in making that happen so the next 30 minutes are about the logistics of what the hackathon would look like so i want to go into what the next 10 days are structured as and everything that you uh want to know about uh anywhere from talks to workshops to prizes to judging and submissions and for those of you who are still looking to be on a team uh the process for what does that look like to uh to join a team or find other team members so let's start with some basics so the entire event and communication for this event for all 350 of you is going to be on discord which means that if you are a state confirmed hacker you will have authorized your discord from our dashboard and you would have received all the right permissions to see the channels keep in mind that if you do not see the web3 jam header on your discord sidebar that means the permissions are not there so either you contact us or go back to your dashboard and see if you successfully authorize discord you'll be able to see all these channels these are private and these are only available to the participants so you can anybody's in in those channels is either a mentor or a partner or another hacker so be sure to check that and uh ping us there for any questions next up is toxin workshop so for everything that's happening over the next 10 days we have sent out a calendar invite including this uh live stream itself but also all of the sessions whether it's on 101s or how to use a particular api or sdk um all these things should have been received as a proper calendar invite so if you're interested in attending any of these you can just hop on to uh those live streams uh also the entire event schedule is on the website so if you're not sure what's going on you can just go to the website and see the full schedule of every upcoming talk and deadlines um for the hackathon um we also want this thing to be very asynchronous so uh there are a lot of opportunities for you to catch up if you are not able to make something on live because of a time zone issue and the website is jam.educable.com so if you're ever confused about the details or you want to follow up on what happened and what's going to happen for any given day just head over to jam.google.com to see everything about this event so let's get into logistics um as i'm saying the sentence the hackathon has started which means you can start working on your projects for the submission uh you can work with a team if you are working with a project and a team you can have up to five members on your project and you have the next 10 days to submit so submissions are due the sunday from a week from now in terms of rules and criteria for what qualifies as a a successful submission the criteria is straightforward everything that you're going to be submitting must be done during the course of this account which means that all the submissions should start today the work for all the submissions should start today and end ten days from now on sunday and to qualify for a price and a valid submission you must use ipfs or falcoin in your project uh so if you're leveraging anything with storage uh where you need to host something on your uh for your application um you should leverage ipps for faultcoin uh on top of that uh one other core criteria is that only rsvp hackers are religious to win any prizes which means that if you are working with a team and your team members are not listed on the team page and the team section and they do not show up on that list if you win a prize only the people that are listed at the point of submission will be receiving those prizes so if somebody is not showing up please contact us and make sure that they're there we will not be amending this after submissions have uh been uh the deadline has passed and of course there are some edge cases here and a lot of you have reached out to us already and a lot of you will reach out to us too so as you have any questions that put you either in in a state where you're not sure what what to do or you think that this might be an issue with anywhere from teams to working on something that you've done before please ping us on discord or email the most common question we get is can i use open source software yes you are totally fine and we encourage you to use existing work that's out there but if you've been working on something already and you are going to be using that as a submission for this event uh then we have uh a slight problem so please thank us if you fall into that category another question we've gotten a lot is what if i'm new to all this thing a lot of you are coming in for web 2 and trying out what's possible what three um so we have a few things or i want to help you with so the first one is if you are looking to join a team because you're not sure what you want to build or if you have an idea but you need help from other skills whether it's i need somebody with design or front-end or back-end experience you can head over to find a team channel on discord you can see everybody who's also in a similar position as you and you can chat with them directly or you can request the help that you need and see if somebody's interested in pairing up with you i would also encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the web3 chat channel because there's hundreds of you from so many different parts of the world love we'd love to know who who you are where you're coming from and what you're excited about and also if you're still looking to come up or think about an idea for what you want to work on we are doing another brainstorming session later today uh the details of that are going to be on the website and you can join that call and get some creative conversation started on what you can build if you are not sure about some ideas [Music] so let's talk about talks and workshops there's a lot of stuff happening over the next week and today and we have content from for everybody from beginners to experts and there's a lot of talks and panels um and a lot of workshops we also have a whole summit running today which i'll get into shortly and all this information is also available on the info center and also your calendar and of course we want this thing to be asynchronous so even if you are not able to make a talk or workshop all these sessions are recorded and they will be made available instantly after they end so you can either head over to youtube.com eve global or jam.epool.com and click on the youtube link for a given talk and catch up uh at your own pace so yeah just one more time the website is jm.edu global.com and all the details around talks schedules workshops how to watch that is there and the prices so let's talk about check-ins so we brought up check-ins on the dashboard and what they are are essentially a way for us to know how you're doing and if you can help you with something if you are stuck uh there's going to be a checking next week which is just going to be a simple form that's going to be made available on your dashboard you just have to fill that out and let us know that things are going well or not going well and what we can help you with and also as part of the process uh your stake is also returned if you respond to the checking and submit a project at the end of this and all this happens to the dashboard we'll also be emailing you and pinging you on discord when we enabled this thing so they will they're it's not going to be visible now but it will be early next week and judging so the way judging is structured is that judging will take place on monday november 21st we're going to make the judging times available very soon on the website as well as on your dashboard so you can prepare for that time slot and you will be required to record a four-minute demo of your project this will be a video submission only process and you cannot do live demos and we really encourage and emphasize this but do not do this thing last minute because it is not super easy to condense everything you've been working on for a lot of time to uh to be in four minutes which means that you may have to do a second revision or you may have to edit out things that require some time for example confirming a transaction on mainnet if you're if you're using that for for your project so don't this thing last minute make sure that uh you take out some time to make a really good concise and informative demo and we also have a lot of examples for what a good demo looks like we'll send them your way as soon as judging opens early next week and all these details again are on your dashboard and they'll also be available in the info center notion page in terms of how we want this event to work and how we want the community to behave we have a simple code of conduct which you can read by heading over to eveglobal.com rules but the gist of it is that we want everybody to be respectful and harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated we will take immediate action if somebody is not behaving as they should or disrespecting some other member of the community and if you notice this thing or if you are in that position uh please reach out to us on either discord or email or any member on the global team and we'll be able to act on it immediately and finally before uh before we end this thing i want to make sure that i really emphasize that this is all about learning we want you to pace yourself this is not a competition we don't want this to be exhausting for you so do not go in and not sleep and work on something we want you to have fun there's so much room to explore and so many cool things you can build and so many cool sdks and ap as you can integrate so we really want this to be about experimentation and learning and especially having looked at all these applications that you all submitted and knowing what you all want to build and what you're interested in take the time to really learn about how all these things work in this realm and if you get excited about something then go deep into it and we're here to help you also figure out how something would work whether it's on the technical side or on the abstract how does something work altogether and we want you to just have fun so try this out there's no pressure on doing something that's going to be the best project out there we want this thing to be about you seeing what's possible so that concludes all the logistics so with that i'm going to go into some of the prizes so we have some incredible partners for this event i want to quickly thank ipfs and falcone foundation we also have lipir the ethereum foundation ceramic network fluence nft port unlocked protocol ens covalent uh mcgregorian style and gelato who are here to help you and are also giving out prizes so we're going to go into learning more about that now so first up we asked the protocol labs team members from the falcon foundation ipvs to tell us about why they're excited to be part of this event so they made a short video they want to play uh for you here and we'll go into what uh what they can do and how you can use their technologies so let's get that started hello everyone my name is discordian a community engineer with protocol labs and i'm very excited to welcome you to web3 jam organized by eth global and supported by protocol labs it's been some months since the awesome hack fs in the summer where we saw cool submissions like crypto shooters two's complement and fragment hackathons like web3 jam are an awesome way to learn something new develop something you've always wanted to and meet new people in this hackathon we'll have a track specifically to see how people can impact media in a distributed way hopefully as free from centralization as possible this is very important in today's world for data preservation bypassing censorship and freeing people from algorithms which are tailored not necessarily for the user but for the companies that create and implement them i'm very excited to see what people create in the next 12 days and i hope some of you reach out to me and let me know what you're building we will have mentors available during the hackathon but also many learning resources of note if you're wondering how to get started i highly recommend checking out slash tinyurl.com dash ipfs dash filecoin we've put together many resources for beginners all the way to advanced users to hopefully help you find what you need included on that page are also nft.storage and web3.storage which should provide all your storage needs i singled them out specifically as i truly believe they are a fantastic way to get started out with using ipfs and filecoin especially if you know very little about the tech if you wanted to learn and get pumped up about filecoin at the same time you should check out pickle.art which features a stellar song and video about filecoin i really enjoyed it uh well without further ado happy hacking awesome that was a lovely introduction to what's out there in the world of decentralized storage media of course there's going to be so many things you'll be able to do in leverage and uh we're going to cover all that in prices because all these things are very modular and work together with each other and just the composability benefits are so immense so i can't wait to uh to dig more into all the other prizes we have here so that was the introduction to ipfs and all coin we'll also get into the specific prices they're doing in a second uh and before that we also have one other message from an amazing partner live peer and live people will be talking about why they're excited to be part of this event and what life here is hi i'm eric the cto at lifebear live pier was founded over four years ago with the vision of creating the world's open video infrastructure today we have over a hundred nodes running on our network transcoding video now this decentralized processing power is lowering the cost of video streaming by over 10x and this dramatic cost reduction is opening up completely new opportunities for independent developers all around the world that were simply not imaginable before in the last month we just reached a really exciting milestone of processing over 3.6 million minutes of video on the lifetime network within a single week now in different hackathons so far this year with worked with hackers disrupting the entertainment streaming industry video conferencing social networks and nfts and we look forward to working with you during the web3 jm with live pier one is to build web3 based live streaming applications and the easiest way to do that is through the hosted gateway at lifegear.com and the second is to create machine learning based video applications or video services with the live here network and one of the most exciting things about participating in hackathons like this is seeing all the creative ideas that the hackers bring so to get your creative juices flowing we have some ideas for you one is to create token gated live streaming experiences especially for dows or nft communities these communities are hungry for more exclusive content and more and more engaging and richer content another is creating streaming tools to get video in and out of the metaverse and this can be a crucial bridge that connects the virtual world with the physical world and finally you can add video machine learning capabilities to the live peer network and to do that you can follow our scene classification example on github video is fundamental to how we experience the internet today and it will only get even more crucial for the future of the internet the metaverse and nfts the opportunity to work with live peer in here is limitless we're committed to decentralization the growth of web3 ecosystem and the mission to support growing talent in our community there has been over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars of grants money given out in the last year all funded by the decentralized life peer community loan so please reach out to us at any point at the live peer discord channel and we're excited to be building with you awesome that was eric from live pier talking about how they've really revolutionized live transcoding using decentralized networks the past few years and i can't wait to see all the amazing video streaming hacks that you're all going to build so um you kind of got a preview of both live peer and ipfs and vertical labs but we're going to jump into the good stuff which is all the prizes you can win so um we're gonna invite back uh distorting again and uh have them talk about the prize that they're giving out so without further ado let's go right into the first flight prizes first up for prizes is track one the best use of ipfs or filecoin or any service that builds on top of either for this track we're offering three prizes ten thousand for first place five thousand for second place and three thousand for third place next up is track two the best use of ipfs or filecoin for a media use case your media use case could be social media a video sharing website a news aggregator or anything you can dream of the prizes are the same for this track with ten thousand for first place five thousand for second place and three thousand for third place finally we have the prize pool if you submitted for a prize qualified but didn't make it into the top three you qualify for prize pool which is fourteen thousand dollars split among all other teams who qualified but didn't win a prize amazing so uh just to repeat in case you didn't catch all of the details uh ipfs or follow coin the best used projects will receive ten thousand dollars five thousand dollars and three thousand dollars respectively the best decentralized media hack uh first second third place will win ten thousand dollars five thousand dollars and two thousand dollars again respectively and there's going to be a 14 000 prize pool which means that all teams that make a meaningful use of ipf fast forward allcoin in their projects will get an equal split of fourteen thousand dollars next up let's learn more about the live pier prizes hello everybody this is eric tang i'm the co-founder and cto at lifepier now lifepier is really excited to be sponsoring web3jam this year and we have a list of awesome prizes for all the hackers that totals up to eight thousand dollars first place price is four thousand the second place price is two thousand third place price is a thousand and there's a price pool of a thousand dollars for anyone who uh completes a life peer specific hack uh that's working end to end now the hacks will be judged based on the longevity of the hack which means um you know whether it will continue to exist after the hackathon the quality of the hack the potential impact of the hack and the wow factor now we have some suggested themes for these tags we want to see some token gated live streaming tools for nft communities we also see tools for streaming in and out of the metaverse we want to see video centric decentralized social networks and platforms and tools for streaming web 3 based nft based games and we also really want to see you the hackers to bring your own creative ideas to the hackathon so these are merely just suggestions so good luck come hang out with us in the discord channel where a lot of our engineers will be spending time and we hope to chat with you more about your hack awesome thanks eric uh so you talked and just learned about the library of prizes and i'll repeat them again so the best use of life here in your hack uh for making really cool peace and trust media and streaming applications will receive four thousand dollars two thousand dollars and one thousand dollars respectively for first second and third and then there's going to be a thousand dollar full price which means that all teams that are using live in a meaningful way will split a thousand dollars equally next up we have ceramic so for ceramic the best ceramic in a project will receive 1500 and there's going to be a 2500 pool price which means any kind any project that uses so ceramic protocol and maple way will split this amount evenly then we have fluence uh the best used influence in aqua will get two thousand dollars and then they have another nfd challenge which you can find the details for on the prizes page and the best uh the the best team for the nfv challenge will also receive two thousand dollars uh then we have nft port uh nft port will be offering a four thousand dollar pool price which means that all projects that use nfd port in a meaningful way will split four thousand dollars equally then we have the unlocked protocol prizes and most creative users of

some incredible speakers uh they're going to be talking including quan banay and nutella gluterin so keep an eye out for this summit in 30 minutes right on each global.tv then we'll have julian talk about how you can use the unlocked protocol and integrate that with ethers.js then this coordinate will talk about doing the workshop on ipfs introduction to ibis and balcony now you can get started quickly on storing uh your files and and content on decentralized network uh for those of you who are looking for ideas and also for team members we're going to be doing a session at 4 30 p.m eastern today um the links to this will be on your calendar not on the website because this was going to be only available for the attendees and we'll also be sending a discord message with the link in case you can get the calendar invite and then bernard we'll be talking about how to use fluence and aqua later today at 6pm so with that i want to wish all of you happy hacking if you have any questions you can ask them either on the live chat on the global.tv or on discord or even email us but we can't wait to see what all of you build over the next 10 days and uh super excited to welcome all of you one more time and happy hacking so before we end i want to just remind everybody that we're going to in 25 minutes uh jump into funding the common summit uh it's going to be on this page so just
