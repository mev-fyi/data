name is global and super excited to welcome all of you to our first ever in person events in two years welcome to youth Amsterdam we're at this incredible venue this weekend uh BBB is a historic building this used to be the country's first modern Stock Exchange over a century ago I think it just serves as like a perfect place for us to really shape the future of money so I'm excited for all of you to be in this building and to the thousands of you that couldn't be here in person we're also streaming all this and the whole weekend on YouTube TV so we'll be able to watch any other workshop and talk on on the website and on YouTube so Keith Amsterdam is part of devconnect a lot of you have been here this entire week or you've enjoyed a lot of the other things going on aside from this hackathon and before we kick everything off I want to take a quick second and really thank Skyler and Natalia Adam and the rest of the deaf connect team at the American Foundation really putting this group together it's been an incredible just amazing thing that's been put on with so much attention to detail and all the hard work please give them a big round of applause and I want to thank as youth Global to the whole definite team for making this we can happen for us as well so let's go right into it first things first this is not a conference and we'll get into a lot of that in the next few minutes we're 8th Global and we have a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the weather ecosystem and we do this by focusing on Builders the events we do are very much about building interesting things bringing on developers designers creators anybody who wants to build things the goal and emphasis is very much about focusing on learning uh being able to get the help and just growing to everything from your potential to learning about the things you're excited about so the theme here for this entire weekend is going to be a few distractions and more time building stuff and we believe showing is better than telling the whole weekend is set up with that philosophy in mind and I'm excited to tell you all about this in the next few minutes we kind of have done the same thing for multiple in-person events for the last four years across five different continents and it's just so exciting that we're able to do this again this year onwards and we have five more to go and this is just the very first one in 2022. and not only just that we we also managed to figure out so many amazing ways to bring the same philosophy and culture onto the online events the last two years for also equally exciting for us on the online cycle we had so many events where we're able to bring on people from all over the world and really remove any constraint around physically being in any given City and over the past four years youth Global has brought more than 50 000 developers and people in this ecosystem we've seen over 4 000 projects come out of it and although we don't really care about this metric but the companies that have come out of the projects from the hackathons have collectively raised over 500 million dollars and it is a massive thing that we never thought would be a thing that we would see but it still brings me a lot of joy to bring that forward all right so all that history let's get that over with let's go into Amsterdam this is an incredible venue and so many people are here today we have 1100 attendees in this building for this entire weekend they're coming in 56 different countries and 31 of the people participating are new to the web 3 ecosystem we're coming on from web 2 that is a massive number it does deserve a big round of applause these are specifically people putting their jobs in web 2 to be able to go all in on on web three and I can't wait to see what everybody builds in addition to that we have a hundred mentors from our partners and dedicated people who are there to help you unblock whether it's technical or go to market or anything else they would like to know and we have 40 technical workshops they'll be Hands-On and stuff around how to use different protocols or everything that's happening in the world of Any Given topic you can think of from nfts to scalability to defy to you name it and only seven talks we're gonna very keep it specific around things that we think are important for us to know about the development of ethereum and everything that is an active research problem so we'll minimize a lot of talking and we'll make sure that you all get to chat with each other in person and see what everybody else is working on and of course prizes there are 400 000 in prizes to be won and we'll kind of get everybody on to tell you about what the prizes are and how you can win them and also how you can think about choosing what to work on so before we go into all of this I want to thank 50 incredible partners that made this event happen um gearbox optimism dydx one inch Network have a grand Style live peer ipfs fall coin and polygon wallet connecting scale without their support this would not be possible so please give them a big round of applause we'll just keep in order as fast as I can and let's let's keep the energy going so Tatum Mina super fluid skill wallet lens protocol radical and try to electriot bolts temper sooner swap grass program coinbase wallet the graph no says equine connects Uma Syria and gelato epns quick note CK sync Broadway Network Clock Team and Amber Pandora avma student analytics Spruce Union yearn Finance flux fuel anchor coin specs swing stack OS cyber connect and ZK pad thank you so much we're gonna bring some of them on again too but you can talk to all these amazing companies building so many incredible protocols and just make your lives easier with the sdks and not reinvent the wheel as you have only 36 hours to act all right so let's get started a couple of things we're going to do here we're gonna just quickly talk about the agenda we're gonna have a quick interview here and uh after that we're going to bring on some more partners and then for those of you who are still looking for a team right after everybody we're done here we're going to meet in this corner and anybody who's still looking for a team uh we're gonna just do a quick team formation session in person so you can join us if you have any ideas if you're still looking for teammates you can uh you can do that right after this ends but before that we want to have a quick interview with a person who needs no introduction so without further Ado let's welcome vitalik buterin the founder of Bitcoin Magazine on stage hello hello all right so we were thinking about the stuff we wanted to cover today and uh it's all over the place when I talk about the future of the past of course and stuff but uh let's get right into it at this point what could stop the merch from happening oh did you hear the announcement we deleted until 2027. it's 2027. no no um I think uh realistically yeah what what could uh I mean what could slow down the merge definitely unexpected security books I mean that like if I you know if you wake up and uh you know some um crazy high months of this year and you discover that The Verge hasn't happened yet since some you know security bugs and the clients is probably going to be the reason um things that cannot stop the merch um any kind of like weird minor mouth is it's like if miners try to do some last minute thing in a break to break the merch that'll just like I mean there's going to be you know some kind of manual fork and it'll happen faster what are the possible scenarios of that and also could you talk about the yeah I mean what what what could minors do in principle miners could uh a 51 attack around the same time as the merge but like with the way the merge is designed it's like basically designed so that like the beacon chain Fork choice just picks one of the forks and so we're fine miners could like if they were really coordinated like kind of stage of protest and just all quit I mean if they do that then like we set a particular terminal to all difficulty and so like it could just make it take a really long time until we get there but like if they do something like that and it's really serious then like once again like people will just make an update that uh just like either changes the tpd or just like sets a particular hash right so there's always a recovery there um I mean what else can they do they can like make fun about centralization on Twitter I don't know um like I think like on honest at this point so I mean like practically speaking I I do feel like miners have generally you know realized that ethereum is going to proof of stake and I got you know a lot of them are not just miners they're also stakers and you know their own plenty of them are very happy to be kind of participating in you know both both parts of ethereum's transition so I'm actually not too worried um and you know lots of them I'm sure like they're going once they're like start mining on ethereum classic or Z cash or like any of these other systems um and so you know like they as an industry do have a kind of common interest even going Beyond ethereum there so yeah I guess not to I guess not too worried about that and I like I don't know what else like I don't know I feel like aside from you know like the possibility of software uh bugs which are which is exactly what we're in the process of testing to find out it's pretty much your Full Speed Ahead so I think this this obviously kind of touches upon just the complexity that lies in in the base layer and you kind of talked and blogged a lot about just how the layer one should be as simple as possible um what's kind of philosophy behind that how does that kind of now reflect on the design for the merge and let's go deeper into that yeah I mean I think in ethereum we've been kind of moving toward this like hybrid philosophy where layer one tries to be kind of very simple um and or at least as simple as it realistically can be um while Layer Two kind of takes on the complexity burden of uh you know providing like uh very high levels of scaling providing privacy providing a lot of the things that users want right the the changes that are all kind of going in the direction of I mean a layer one does improve somewhat like it switches to proof of stake I mean we add the Dank sharding a lot of data uh that the chain gets consensus on the Roll-Ups can use and all of these things but the goal is still to try to like add a limited number of tools that's a very general purpose I mean then the you know Layer Two and the application layer and it does the rest and what's the design process that like do you actively refuse to think about adding changes to the base layer or is that more of like you only get to realize this in retrospect how do you kind of think about that as you're planning this yeah I mean it's not just like it's not my decision right like so like so now you specifically just as uh you know and I know on one of the you know recent alcohol deaths calls was like just decided to kind of not really push hard on kind of non-emerge related dips for a while um and uh like there's and like in general I think there's definitely been kind of more and more pushback on uh adding EIP as like even things like pre-compiles that would have easily gotten into or three years ago like they just have a harder time justifying themselves now which I think is healthy like I I think it's uh you know good to kind of not keep on I mean increasing complexity forever and kind of throwing the kitchen sink in and like really step back and think like what do we really need um so you know there's definitely an attitude of like growing conservatism towards changing things um like if I like if I had to kind of change that formula a little bit like I would say yeah like what I would want to see is uh not like not just conservatism in terms of like the size of the changes but also like kids services are the final results like not not just thinking about like uh you know changing a little but also like can we make changes toward an ethereum of tomorrow that's simpler uh the Indonesia ethereum of today um so like Banning self-destruct is probably one of those examples right I think like I do not want a world where um you know your grandchildren uh you know wake up in some uh you know a dark rainy morning you know 2072 um you know take a look at the killer AI robots outside briefly um and then uh you know ask you about Grandpa like why yeah why does ethereum like just have all of this uh extra two layer weird state tree structure and why does it have half ROP and half SSD and like why is it why is me creating my own node so hard and like you have to answer well you know because we uh some people in 2012 are kind of just uh basically give up and prioritize backwards compatibility right like I think um you know there is something to like the virtue of a kind of accepting short summer short-term costs um in order to achieve long-term benefits and like obviously it's important to prioritize and obviously you can't do everything at the same time uh but like having this kind of discussion around you know what are things that you know do incur short-term costs but are going to like actually make things better like ethereum a better system into Asia you know a simpler system with um in the long long term is like a discussion that will definitely love to see more of so maybe this is a good time to understand how that got applied to sharding and the design in the architecture could you tell us about the original design what it is now how that happened well in that case and it's a it's a bit of a different situation right because like shorting is something new and so like the question of like minimizing complexity of the change and minimizing complexity for the final outcome like they just end up being perfectly aligned with each other um and the design really did evolve a lot in the direction of simplifying uh the base layer right so uh you know at the beginning um it's uh like you know there was this really complicated like quadratic and then like eventually cubic sharding design and you had committees on top of committees and you had chains on top of chains and had to you know it got really crazy and then eventually that simplified down to a beacon chain uh with a bunch of shards that had crossed that were chains that had crosslinks eventually that simplified further we got rid of the crosslinks we got rid of the shards with an independent Fork choice and now we don't even have Shard blocks right like the dank sharding design is uh actually like actually very Ultra minimal because it basically even has one proposer that just chooses all the contacts for the for the entire block like you know the entire um 16 or 32 Mega megabytes or whatever and it ends up being right um and uh that is um much like I mean it definitely is still complex right um but at the same time it's like vastly better than what we would have had to deal with had we actually tried to look properly Implement any of the designs from uh 2017 while at the same time you know also having these five other road maps of like account abstraction and proof of stake and vertical trees and all um and uh all of those things right so I think uh I do think that the ethereum is a kind of like research Community learned um and like has updated a lot in the direction of like proposing things that are actually implementable um so I think the interesting thing I've noticed is that this is a very recurring theme and it's like a great thing which is we kind of have Initial Ideas they get kind of iterated on then they just become simpler or even better or or just more efficient is that something that you think is because we're able to minimize the feedback loops or is that because we just have a lot more research that's kind of being applied faster than in other Industries like how does this kind of why is this repetitive in a good way as a theme from your perspective why do we see this happen often that the designs get simplified especially in in how we think about scalability yeah I mean I think a big part of it is like the first of all just the quality of the research team improving um SEC like I think uh you know the more kind of research thinks hard the more like it actually can like build things that don't require developers to work as hard um and uh like ultimately development is like a bigger slogan research is right so I think it's a you know it's a good one you can make those trade-offs and just think a little harder and make something better um the um other thing is also just the proposals keep improving because like you have the benefit of understanding you know versions one to version n of the thing when you build version and plus one other thing um I think it's a combination of both of those two it's just impressive that we see that consistently happen on the research side and then three obviously it's just that like this ongoing process of like actually just like learning to Value like for like real simplest anymore well speaking of simplification I want to talk about two eips and uh I think it'll be great to kind of have you talk about what they are first and then let's kind of go into uh should or should they not be included we'll start with 4844 what is it and should that exist sure so EAP 4844 AKA protozanic sharding um I guess uh okay to explain that maybe we need to start like going into a dank sharding in a bit more detail right so ding sharding is the sharding design that is uh kind of the result of like this long chain of like simplifying things and throwing things out after we started from crazy chains inside of chains back inside of chains back in 2015. um and uh the way ding sharding works is you still have like one block purse a lot it looks like basically just like a regular non-charted chain except validator nodes don't actually have to validate everything right instead validator nodes like randomly select a few pieces of every block to verify and because of like Erasure code and data availability sampling a bunch of like math magic they're like that's actually enough right like it's actually enough for every validator to only verify a few randomly selected uh pieces of this like big 16 megabytes like blobs or okay I guess blah blah um so uh that you know the problem with the exhorting though is that it does require like eraser coating and all this stuff to actually be implemented um and so what happens before then right um so before then uh we have uh proto-dink shorting which is basically a like it's a kind of halfway house that can happen uh before full dank shorting can really be rolled out and what happens there is it's kind of like you do dank sharding without actually shorting the data right basically you introduce all of the data formats exactly as they will exist in full tank sharding and like you introduce this concept of blobs there's Trends or transactions with this extra really big piece of data that's uh much cheaper but that can't be accessed directly from the evm you introduce kcg commitments you introduce all the math you introduced like all the the ways that interaction between the execution and consensus so it will work you basically do all of the kind of infrastructure work except you don't do this kind of like random sampling check you still require everyone to just like fully download all the blobs and check them right so in every spot everyone would actually have to like download and check maybe about a megabyte of data so this amount of data is still a lot it still provides a huge amount of space for Wallops it still stands you know big good chance of making Roll-Ups way cheaper than they are today but so does this have any long-term effects on the state size right so on the state size no because of these blobs are not part of the state but on the history aside eap444 is another important one this is the history expiry EIP basically making it so that clients don't have to like store really old history anymore and this is important both to keep the disk size of an ethereum node spell and also actually to allow ethereum implementations to become simpler right because like you don't need one implementation to be able to process all past versions of the ethereum protocol that ever existed you needed to be able to adjust the like process like maybe the last one or two hard forks and then if you really want to have a node that checks the entire history like you can basically just uh you know download multiple versions of the client and then like you know we'll we'll have to like early verify yeah serial EVR file or we'll have to implement like some interchange format so you know you can run one of them then export the post State import that as a free state to the second one run a few more blocks export the post data and put it into a third and all that but like that's all doable and that like that does like basically the idea is to try to like allow the nodes responsible for a consensus or allow the nodes for like responsible for the really critical thing of keeping the blockchain running today to kind of be as simple as possible and like there are going to be ways of doing all the other stuff like there are already plenty of ideas on how to like create automated networks that kind of automatically start backing up all of the history and to make that really robust so it's like basically guaranteed to know it's like a one event trust model that the I mean history will be uh will be uh actually saved and uh also you know like actually be able to like check and see what happens in them in the history um but like that would be a kind of somewhat more specialized functionality and like users who hear about that will be able to do it but but users who only wants to run a node to verify what's going on today would not have to consider themselves with as much with that and they'll be able to like just process a narrower piece of the chin uh so yeah that's the ap444 uh what about four three three seven four three three seven is um the account abstraction I believe um it's going to have a presentation tomorrow so I highly recommends people watch it uh but uh account with abstraction this is another one of those things that I've cared about for a really long time like basically it's like making smart contract wallets first class citizens right so today's there's two kinds of accounts in ethereum there's what we call eoas externally owned accounts which are the accounts that like most people have their you know coins and assets and everything in um and then there's smart contract wallets smart contract wallets use like smart contract code to be able to impose arbitrary conditions on when the funds can be spent right so you can have a multi-sig wallet where you have like say five different keys that that might even be controlled by different people and you need three of them to approve a transaction you could have social recovery while it were like a three of five can change the key that's needed to sign you could replace ecdsa with a different signature scheme you could replace it with something Quantum resistance right like you could do a lot of things but the problem is that smart contract while it's today they base like smart contract wallets cannot initiate transactions and so actually using one requires you to have some money in an eoa um and like you basically just needlessly complicated and that's a big part of why not many people use it but then EOS they only support like one form of authentication which is one single private key right so I think um look so 4337 does it basically it's like an extra protocol um like second layer way to make a smart contract well it's basically be as convenient as eoa wallets are today um and so you know regular users for like it will be much easier to like actually have one of these more secure like you know multi-sig or social recovery or whatever kinds of wallets and so to try like you would actually be able to um you know you like feel safe and comfortable using ethereum without having to worry about like what happens if someone hacks my computer and steals my private key or or what if my private key gets lost is this just an Implement is it just in the implementation phase or what kind of how do we think about that from just I believe look it's already on test Nets but we have erc4337 is going to be released on the mainnet fairly soon um so that should change how most of the hackathon projects work that's going to be awesome um you already touched upon the quality of researchers that are going to come on in the last few years to kind of improve the protocol but let's kind of zoom out a little bit and go into how do you think the ethereum foundation's role has changed in that same window and just kind of from your perspective what was the role now and how do you think the the role Foundation service I mean I think ethereum Foundation First of all it has really stepped up on kind of improving its quality improving its sort of organizational capacity like there's just a lot of things that the ethereum foundation was completely not capable of doing just because like it did not have people and there will be lots of people who would just say like hey like you know can we do this and like I just unfortunately would not be able to point them to people who can actually do it and they can now all of that stuff is just so much better right like you know there's like excellent people in the in the foundation like Stephen Gilbert for like Chris been you know doing a lot of like Latin America uh work some other things um you know Josh Stark has been you know great at just organizing a whole bunch of things and uh in the you know Foundation core and I know there's this new executive director has definitely been you know great um and uh you know both you know her work kind of organizing the foundation and a lot of the philosophy that she's I'm introducing I think have been an excellent so know just a a lot of like really good people lately that I'm happy very happy about um so it's definitely a much more capable organization it's definitely an organization you know more capable of starting to like have have breathing room to think about the long-term big questions and so like in 2016 and 17 like we barely had breathing room but like in 2015 like we're here we had money I mean that because of merely having money we've barely had people and then in 2016 and 17 we've barely had enough people to do things and like finally um you know over the last four years we've really managed to exit that kind of you know vicious cycle which has been uh you think excellent we can actually observe it too which is the great part uh just the last two years have been phenomenal and just seeing more transparency the level of effort going into different geographies just this event itself Dev connect um yeah I absolutely agree yay do you think the ethereum foundation should just focus on making the protocol better or do you think this expands into supporting or collaborating with other protocol and to get more involved athleticia application layer um and I also think that there's more room for everyone except the foundation to get more involved at the protocol layer right I'm like uh I think to some extent this has happened already right but uh like I think for the first couple of years like we have had this kind of like like interesting sort of like half decentralization where you know there's these like five different Layer Two client teams um or well responses way more um like five different uh not layer twos um it consensus client teams and there's a lot of lawyer two teams there's a a lot of uh execution lawyer teams but like a big part of a lot of their budgets would still still come from the foundation right and so like it sets up the structure but the foundation is still kind of have to like has this kind of very strong very Central role um but like we were already starting to see signs of that diversifying we're already seeing signs of like actors outside of the foundation supporting all of these different teams supporting all these different individual developers and you're referring to just kind of companies in this space that are like companies this one like you know obviously you know there's a consensus um there's like the various uh different Dows there's like well I think like Lido announced that they're supporting protocol Guild um you know the whole protocol killing effort in general um I think you know the whole the cell like the nft for EIP 1559 um and like there's I think a lot of potential for this to go much further like I think we still need to remember like that we are in a world where I believe is this still true that the the unit swap Dao has uh more uh Capital than the foundation does yeah I believe so too yes um I guess what about collaboration with other layer ones do you do you see a feature where we can work with the Bitcoin community oh interesting um yeah there's a lot of games anything I mean anything can happen I think um you know out of um you know coming out of the the covid pandemic um you know New Century uh you know new challenges um you know it's uh possibly you had time to get a time to make new friends um I'm it's uh yeah well I think you know especially like both the Bitcoin and the ethereum ecosystems are just kind of so different from what they were five years ago um and you know they're just like clearly here you know do things that are somewhat similar and also somewhat different um and I think like there's a a career sign that like you know actually coexistence between these two ecosystems is possible um and uh like I think uh the the big thing that you need for like people to feel comfortable cooperating is like the feeling that there doesn't exist a kind of neither can live while the other survives a relationship between the two right because once like like people are at their most evil not out of green but out of fear right like when people perceive that you know if they don't like fight for their interests and for their own interests that that they're gonna like lose to some existential threat that's when people are going to be the most willing to sacrifice everything for their interests um and uh you know if the like the competitive part of the relationship is not an existential one that already just like reduces the temperature so much I mean I think I mean technical collaboration is not definitely possible I mean there's definitely some happening already okay a well you know the you know the Nerds generally like they're they're happy to kind of like you know ignore the politics and just like work on really fun and cool stuff and interpolate the following all meals together uh which you know I think is great um you know damn I think I'm you know more and more uh very possible over time that's great all right so for the next section um I'm gonna call that underrated overrated I'm gonna give you a topic if you uh comment on is if this is underrated overrated and then a short answer on why sure so first one 85 hot green tea 15 red wine underrated like only a few people have heard of it so far we need to like spread this we need to like make it the new thing the current thing we'll try to serve that at midnight one coin one vote I mean one coin is a scam uh no oh oh I see I'm like a token voting governance um I think realistically realistically a thing's still overrated like I've yelled a lot at it but I feel like a lot like the yelling hasn't really yet translated into people actually seriously experimenting with Alternatives what's a good framework for thinking about how voting or governance should work overall it's a very broad deep question but specifically for the vote it is I mean I don't think there's one framework I think there's a few different Frameworks like one of them is collusion resistance right like how to prevent like basically how to prevent concentrated interests from always beating out diffuse interests right like because like that's uh the big the big problem that always happens in the world um and um you know photography is actually not very good at that like what other things can be um the second is um how to like even look and then the first one you can think about it in two ways like you can think about it kind of like mild ways where you know you have like the concentrated interest as like a fairly tame actor like in a no Paradigm Paradigm is tame right um and uh the diffuse interest is like you know just like you know random community members but then on the other end there's like the concentrated interest is like a hostile attacker that's uh like um you know there was that 80 million dollar defy hack right like someone tried to roll their own stable coin technically not act yeah right technically it was a yeah what was it it was working as intent it was a special cryptographic operation um yeah um Yeah so basically what what basically what happened there was like there was this uh State um someone tried to roll their own stable coin um and it had a governance token um and the governance token I mean I had to like eat and something like an 80 million dollar market cap and this is like lower than the value of the assets it was protected that was the treasury I believe right well it was yeah the governor's tokens was lower than the value of the treasury right um and so someone did a flash load and they just like borrowed 51 of the governance tokens right and they voted to transfer the money to them because the governance vote and then they flash loaned it themselves and they got approved yeah right so um you know you want to be resisted to attacks right uh so uh that's also is delay the best way of thinking about that or well I mean civil resistance it's like I think the delay thing can kind of like it's it could help in the short term it's a Band-Aid but if you're like in my article I think it was like moving beyond coin voting governance or something like that like I talk about some like longer term Financial attacks that can still work no matter what the delays are and so you know I think it's uh still concerning um so there's uh that um so like what that so that's one framework right of like thinking about collusion and attack resistance another framework is how to ensure that the decisions are high quality right like basically how do you ensure that the people with the governance power actually uh are people with expertise who actually deserve to have the governance back hour and like delegation is one of the answers but is the delegation might not be the only answer because um you know there's it's still subjectivity yeah I mean there's like people who don't know um in canola they don't know but then there's people who don't know that they don't know right um and you know if they're gonna um uh just like delegate to like peep the Frog number one two four three seven then like that's not also not the best uh so uh I think I think uh we should go on to the rest of the podcast because uh there's a lot more there um pfp nfts pfp nft is I think a bit overrated just because like uh you know the problem is like you can all like you can clone them and like we don't really have good infrastructure for like telling clones apart from not clones and even like answering the philosophical question of like when is a clone even an illegitimate clone in the first place and like when is it just like you know yo dog that's part of the game public goods funding still one of them you know one of the most important problems in the world so um you know probably still underrated actually I have way more questions so I won't dig into it um rlp um I mean it's still part of the ethereum protocol so it's overrated [Laughter] Plato art Play-Doh art like the philosophy earn oh play to earn oh I see it [Music] um we can do that art of like the of the Greek philosopher I definitely would want to see some more ideas um would you would you have Plato artist or pfp maybe okay yeah Plato and I think about uh probably a bit overrated like I think the problem that I see about it is that like I haven't yet seen a credible story about like who would actually be the one that's like providing the capital that people uh end up earning by playing is an argument for just not having enough time passed or you just mean it's an economically it's just an economic thing like if you have like if you have token outflow you have to have token inflow who's gonna pay for the inflow um L2 centralization like centralization of Layer Two protocols winner take all effects in l2s oh um well I guess like you have to be clear about what you mean right because like one of them is um like oh you know what if like fuel gets 995 of the market share um but fuel like becomes a super decentralized I mean then basically you have like this you know weird kind of awkward two-layer ethereum distinction but then the other one is like well what if there's like five different Roll-Ups but but the sequencers were all run by one guy um I mean the good news about lawyer too is like those are like even the worst outcomes are not as like actually necessarily that bad uh right because you still have trustlessness um as long as the Alters are designed correct we still have censorship resistance probably the biggest risk is like governance capture like what if the L2 has governance and it does a governance vote and there's too much Network effects for people to like actually be willing to exit if the governance like turns it into something trusted for example are you worried about that influencing layer one design in a way that you would not intend or just like l2's influencing layer One Design um I mean possible like I mean I definitely do think that like application layers try like things it's not necessarily always about governance like it's uh it's not just an L2 problem like it's ever it's a it's something that could happen in like so many different ways right like there's going to be a lot of conflicts of uh interest between different kinds of applications um on on ethereum um right I mean you could go like all the way dystopian and like oh you know is there going to be like some major uh you know a centralized stable coin that starts lobbying for the base player to have kyc uh which uh like I feel like that one is like a bit too blatant and I think too many people would just like resist that one very quickly but I mean others all kinds of things like that so I think the answer isn't so much worrying about like one specific interest as it is about making sure that the governance as a whole is like secure against like those kinds of so of like social attacks from all of possible uh constituted interests last one private Keys underrated or overrated oh underrated I mean you know you used to like freaking trying to ban people from having their own uh personal wallets like come on uh that's uh yeah I think uh like personal wallets where like you actually control your private key or it's a social recovery or multi-sig wallet in your family controls some of the keys like that kind of like cyber self-sovereignty is I think like a really important Bedrock of having a decentralized crypto ecosystem uh even with account abstraction uh even with account obstruction yeah so like I think like smart contract wallets are not about giving up control they're about like being able to actually choose who to who to trust who we can recover and like like these things don't like even like multi-sig wallets and social recovery does not have to mean centralization like I mean as I said like you can choose five different friends who don't know each other um and have them be your recovery Guardians like I actually recommend this right um so there's a lot that you can do with that but like like anything like that is far better than an ecosystem where like almost all users like just interact with the blockchain through a centralized provider or they where they don't actually control their own access yeah I think permissionless needs to be truly permissionless How uh how were the last two years for you with covet and everything oh it's been I mean it's definitely the kind of mandatory break of my usual schedule was definitely kind of interesting and fascinating um in that um like before covet I was basically on on a plane on average once every six days like I mean like I literally have like tracking and like that was my life between about 2014 and 2019 and that obviously had to like cut down completely I was basically you know holed up in Singapore for about uh some you know most of a year in the middle of that um and I ended up walking to every district in Singapore you know it's a nice small city-state 700 and I think 18 or something square kilometers um that's uh I think like was it somewhere around somewhere around like 300 Freedom Units a bit less um but uh yeah you know it did yeah in Singapore is nice like you can actually do like literal cross-country running there uh but uh the um yeah so it was also just a you know a good opportunity to kind of like think about things um you know just like get quiet work done uh but you know at the same time also definitely a lot of like a lot of inconvenience like inconveniences and like a lot of serious stuff that I would have rather not had like there were definitely family members that I was just not able to see for a whole year which I think was you know really unfortunate and uh definitely yeah uh I think uh to pick up any new hobbies did I pick up any new hobbies um I mean I listened to a lot of podcasts um you know that was uh any favorites that you want to recommend I mean Hardcore History it was a fun one Alex Friedman sir a lot of them are very good um there's also like Alex Friedman's about history and there's Alex Friedman's Alex Friedman with the guy who does hardcore history in action you can like go meta on this quite a quite a bit um but um you know since then it's like I think definitely is such a so nice to actually be able to like also see people in person and like you know see yeah all of the yeah old friends again you know if I missed for uh such a long time I think that's one of the the really interesting pieces for for us today too there's hundreds of people that have participated at these Global events for the last two years which you've never met and we're seeing so many of them come to us and say hi and US knowing that including some of the global employees and team members we've never seen them you know until now and it's awesome to see that so I'm really glad to hear that today is the 22nd of April how was your 420 oh let's see what what yeah I mean 420 is an important day because like 420 is like let me explain it it's the smallest number which is divisible by all the integers from one to seven um so it's uh you know it's it's oh it's also um the current the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere um so you know very meaningful number um but uh anyway um what did I do I uh I I went to an in a mini internal ethereum Foundation research workshop and listens to miriamell or do an excellent job explaining Secrets a single secret leader election sounds awesome we've talked enough about the past eats to the merge let's talk about E3 what's coming what are some interesting problems and uh what's what's something exciting that we can share well remember there is no if two and there is definitely no E3 there is uh the merge The Surge The Verge The Purge and the Splurge right so you know the merge we know is completing the switch to proof of stake The Surge massive increase in scaling because of Layer Two is in shorting so you know we talked about dank shorting um you know a lot of progress on layer twos here um and that's something that we've really seen and have become alive over the last year or so right like we've basically gone from you know Stark net and optimism and arbitrary I mean most of these kind of being theoretical to like really being live I mean some of the some of them have been like around for much longer than a year right but it does really feel like the last year has been this uh amazing and huge uh Tipping Point um so The Surge like really getting kind of the scalability vision kind of fully complete um it is progressing right like I think uh very recently optimism added in support for a compression and that notice of weed decrease transaction fees by I think like another like something like was it like somewhere between 25 and 40 percent yeah the shipping yeah yeah so that's um amazing and like there are going to be more and more of these right like um eventually you know I could replace ecdsa with something else and I can like add a lot more compression uh eventually yeah you know proto-dink shorting a lot more and then folding shouting a lot more so I think you know we're going to see a transaction fees on Roll-Ups continue taking steps further and further down over the next couple of years and that'll be amazing um The Verge this is the switch to of vertical trees vertical trees are important because they enable stateless clients which basically means you can verify the chain basically without having anything in your hard drive like you can just verify any random individual block you want without having like 3x information about what happened in the previous block and that's really important right and uh what like basically because it makes it much easier to run a validator it's like very good for like proof of stake decentralization um it also means that we don't have to worry about the size of the state for a long time like you know there's always these concerns about oh are we going to implement State rents and like do we have to do that what happens when the state blows up to a terabyte but like if you have proposed or Builder separation so we can like allow block building to become more specialized Market while validators don't even have to run any state at all they just like verify stylus blocks then even at the state being a terabyte in size is like actually manageable right um so Verge is going to do a lot a lot of good things um then there is The Purge and The Purge is like basically like eliminating cruft so we talked about eap444 nodes not having to store history anymore there's like the very long-term vision of eventually doing State expire So eventually we also have we can also like allow even Builders to not Store Old Stage um then there is a just allowing if you're like and making it a norm for ethereum clients to not have to process and like be able to understand every single previous version of the protocol um is also part of The Purge simplifying the ethereum protocol so Banning self-destruct maybe like getting rid of and replacing the 2300 gas stipend like maybe getting rid of and replacing logs uh because like do we really need in protocol Bloom filters when like basically no one uses that infrastructure and everyone is using the graph anyway right like archive notable exactly like at some point time you know I think you do have to sort of ask for that question um what other things are there there's um I mean it's just a lot of simplifications in the ethereum protocol that I think can be made and that I think should be made and like the purchase all of that and then the Splurge is like basically all of the other cool stuff right so account abstraction is really big importance proposal Builder separation is really important um if there's this guy like um adding vdfs to increase the security of uh you know validator set is also really important so a lot of really nice things um and also there is um I guess you could put this in the merge bucket because it's also proof of stake uh but this uh longer term idea of moving to single solid finality um so instead of blocks finalizing after two and a half Epoch sub blocks finalized like immediately in the next slot and this has like a bunch of important benefits there's a bunch of technical reasons why actually it might be easier than we thought um and like you know over the last like year or so you know we've discovered that there are a lot of like just inherent complexities that are difficult to work around how do you think about reorgs in that world I'm just curious yeah so the point is that reorgs would do not exist unless you're in the special case where like more like a large portion of nodes are are offline and so you're not finalizing if most of the nodes are online then you're finalizing so you can't have reories that's like the big benefit um right so like this the thing that we realized over the last year is that there actually are a lot of like unavoidable complexities and like room for bugs and the way that we combine Fortress rules and finality today I mean so moving to singles a lot just like reduces the number of protocols from two to one um and it just makes things so much simpler potentially that'd be huge that's awesome um yeah sorry I'm done there okay final question um we've been part of ethereum for the last seven years at the Bitcoin and just the cryptocurrency ecosystem is around for a little over a decade how kind of how does that evolved from your perspective the space what they were talking about the research or the community or just overall the blockchain space give us like what the last five to ten years have been and uh kind of how do you see this moving forward and then for the next five to ten years I think the the crypto space today is just like so different from what it was uh like five ten years ago or even five years ago like there's even there's aspects of these old space that I really miss like I definitely miss like how it was this kind of like very small and Niche thing that like most people didn't really know about and even people who did know about it kind of thought that it was a sideshow this is an anecdote uh our last event was either London two years ago two years and like a month ago and we were struggling to make that a full house and that capacity was 300 people so exactly yeah and then you know yeah there were definitely these kind of like very mysterious and undiscovered aspects of it like um you know even like visiting China and like discovering this kind of like Dark Forest of like various 16 year olds who have actually been mining Bitcoin for four years uh ended up already being multi-millionaires and quitting High School um like uh there's just like a lot of um Libertarians and socialists uh peacefully arguing with each other on bitcoin until I can like having like actually a fascinating highbrow conversations um oh um sometime around this time I think is like the 10th anniversary of like either the pirate at 40 hack or bitcoinica or maybe both like I forget um quickia remembers pirate at 40. wow oh who here remembers Bitcoin okay um you know uh zotong um who was uh I'm gonna give us a little bit of background uh I think it was like the first like Bitcoin lovers training platform it ended up just getting hacked over and over again and eventually it just didn't have any money and lots of people got angry um and uh pirate at 40 was uh an anonymous guy running uh basically like a fund which was like a way of uh investing in like some Bitcoin related stuff and getting like some like I think it was like seven percent weekly profits um and uh you know the guy basically said like hey you know trust me and a bunch of people did trust him um and uh you know what Mark of what uh Mark Zuckerberg said 20 years ago okay about people who trust them uh so uh this guy was Anonymous so it was uh um he basically just like ended up ended up just like oh no he actually did get caught and he did go to jail eventually uh but uh did it was just like such crazy stuff happens back then I mean I guess you know these days like we have like different versions of that like we don't have that like that sort of stuff severity has been slightly minimized well I mean it's like the sizes like the dollar amounts of crazy stuff that happens or I think about the same but like as as they have been all along but like as a percentage of the ecosystem it's definitely much smaller and like I definitely think that's good right um so it's definitely good that the ecosystem has matured um and you know it's definitely grown a lot of people understand a lot like what actually can be done what can't be done um you know how like what kinds of things make sense in terms of scalability in terms of privacy in terms of all of these issues uh so I think um you know over the next five to ten years like uh we're gonna see you know the continuation of that process and we're going to see like you know like a lot of crypto applications continue to turn into something that's like really mainstream um and uh you know I think there are going to be some costs to that like I think uh like the aspect of um you know the the crypto space being this Frontier I don't think that's going to go away like I think uh the group crypto was just like so hard to control that there's always going to be a frontier within crypto but like it's not going to be the case that like all of crypto is a frontier anymore right uh and uh but at the same time um you know it's hopefully going to be something that like just lots of people use as a regular part of their lives and it's a good feature um before we end any predictions for what the next few years look like oh um the ethereum price will be 12 000 but I will tell you in what currency could be Bolivars Venezuelan um you know it could be or it could be Doge um you won't tell us what currency or what base exactly yes um and I will tell you if that's a thousand in a base 10 or base three um so um what are the predictions at the end basically I think I'm you know scaling and zero knowledge and smart contract wallets and all that stuff are going to be mature and you know the ecosystem will then have to like basically either succeed on its ability to um actually deliver on the applications that people have been expecting for so long or it'll not do that or something in the middle um I mean I do think that like blockchains uh have already already proven that they are here to stay and that they do have some value but there is still this question of like well you know in what places exactly how much um like you know are we talking like the new uh Windows of Finance are we talking the Linux of Finance um and uh and not just for finance like what how how does that um and that plug playing out in every other industry um so no I mean it's still um you know a lot of things that remain open and undecided but you know I think you know all of the lovely yeah you know hackers at the hackathon here will can you know do a lot to try to kind of make help make them the more positive outcomes happen it's a perfect night to end this on thank you so much and uh let's give him a big round of applause all right well hope you all enjoyed that so A couple of things to go uh we're going to cover the logistics for how the weekend is going to work especially for all of you that are hacking uh I'm going to talk about all the things that we have planned and let's go right into it so there's a few things so the first one is we're going to talk about how you can get help which is uh how Discord is set up all the prizes you're going to win as a quick note for all of the partners that are coming on stage to talk about their prizes please go on to my left and your right right now just uh we're gonna get that set up we're gonna also talk about how judging is going to work and also if you're still looking for a team a team formation is going to happen right behind me on my left your right right after we finish the ceremonies so everything in terms of official communication will be on Discord that means if something is due as a deadline or we have an announcement or something is not on schedule we'll be communicating that with everybody on Discord if you're not already on Discord you can head over to eth global.chat and it'll redirect you to the event Discord on top of that everything is a channel under the East Amsterdam category so if you are on Discord you know see the word Amsterdam on the left sidebar find one of us in the venue and we will make sure you have the right permissions and this is where you can talk to any of our partners any of our mentors hear all the announcements and especially as we get to judging on Sunday any updates around there we'll be communicating on Discord on top of that you're all here in person just talk to each other in person walk up to us if you can't get an answer if you know somebody looks like go up to them definitely engage in a meaningful and in a comfortable way and also if you need help with something that you're stuck on whether it's a buck you can absolutely stand up and shout asking does anybody know how to fix this all these things are very much possible and on top of that there are a lot of workshops and talks happening so the first set of Workshop blocks starts at 9 00 pm and they're all on the second floor over there so to my right and your left you should have also gotten a calendar invite for a lot of these talks and if you ever want to know what's going on the latest schedule is always on the website so how does the hackathon work hackathon officially begins now which means you can start working on your projects and a lot of you have already gotten this started but you can have your team set up and you can work with up to five members per team you don't necessarily have to work on a team it's totally okay if you are planning on working on your own and using that as an opportunity to learn so please uh put the make sure that your team members are listed on your dashboard because if they are not listed there we will have no other records of those people on your submission and if you win a prize that will not be distributed to the people that are not listed on that on your dashboard you have 36 hours to hack which means the deadline is 9 A.M on Sunday that's when the submission forms will close and we'll begin judging shortly after and I'll walk through how all of that is set up simple rules and criterias for the hackathon everything that you're going to do and submit should be done over the course of this weekend which means you cannot continue working on a project that you've been working on before it is okay to use bowler plate codes if you purchase some templates to make the design easier that is okay if you want to Fork an existing project that is okay if you want to Fork your own project that you're working on the site from a week ago that is not okay but make sure you are working on something that you are starting today there are definitely some nuances there so if you think you're one of the edge cases come find any of us in person we'll assess that and talk to you about it but uh please make sure that if you win any prizes we will verify everybody's code base before delivering them to you so do not we'll make any attempts to cheat simple stuff again which is if you are not listed on the team which means you were not ours feed and confirmed as a hacker you will not be eligible to win any prizes and of course just one more time any questions send us an email ask us on Discord or find me or anybody else on our team in person and ask the questions right away lots of incredible workshops and talks 40 40 of them are happening uh in the short burst of times there'll be about 30 of them happening in the next five hours up on the second floor and a few more tomorrow morning and tomorrow afternoon the whole schedule is on the website and everything in terms of details is listed on your info center which is on your dashboard as well as in your calendar invites also we don't want you all to be fully up and watching everything all the time so everything is also recorded if you miss something especially people who are on the live stream that want to catch up on some of the content you can catch up on that on YouTube directly by heading over to youtube.com Heath global and to see the schedule and the prizes and everything else you can head over to eat amsterdam.eth global.com or just go to eat global.com and click on Heath Amsterdam on to the submission submissions are due at 9am which means that at 9am the page that lets you submit your project will automatically close so please do not miss that deadline of course if something goes wrong on the technical standpoint if it breaks we'll we'll obviously extend that deadline but you have 37 hours from now to submit and work on a project the way judging is going to work is going to be really important there's a lot of people there's a lot of projects and we have a short amount of time to go through all the projects for submission so there's gonna be a lot of parallelization there's going to be eight rooms that are going to be doing the main judging so as soon as you submit a few minutes later you will be assigned a room which will appear on your dashboard so all you have to do is press refresh however many times you would like until things start showing up and you will know exactly what room you need to go to and you'll see a set of Judges there and the same format Works which is you have about four minutes to present your project and I'll get into that in a second but judging begins 30 minutes after the submission deadline so everybody will go there while that is happening the prize judging is also going to happen at the same window so depending on what room you're assigned you will also be given an order which means if you're one of the later ones in that room you have the first hour or two free you can then come down and talk to the sponsor you wanted to present your prize to and demo it to them individually so if you apply it for five different prizes you're gonna have to go to five of those companies and tell them what you did so make sure you time it yourself and then you can go up and go to the main judging we'll share a lot more on that today and tomorrow an email and everywhere else so don't worry if you missed any of this and the way project submissions work is you will have four minutes to demo there is an option to record a video demo especially as when you're doing a live demo things can go wrong or things may take too much time for your transactions to confirm if you're doing something on mainnet so we just recommend you record a four minute video as well which you can play if something goes wrong please don't do this thing last minute there's a there's a couple of big questions around tell us how you did it how things work which requires slightly longer answers either prep them ahead of time or make sure that you are kind of paralyzing that work on your team so somebody can fill out the screenshot somebody can fill out the video somebody can fill out the long description somebody can pick all the prizes just make sure all those things are counted for because it will take you more than 10 minutes to make everything um right for the submission and all the details must be on your dashboard which means that if you are applying for a prize and you forget to select that nobody will know that you apply for this price so there's no way we can communicate that to all of our partners to have them say expect these companies or projects or know that you are choosing to submit and demo your project so I said a couple of these things already but when you are done with your main judging you can come down and find the sponsor you're trying to present to and demo your projects to them as well so this can be before or after or at any time code of conduct very simple we have a code of conduct that defines how you should behave in this building especially over this weekend all the rules are defined on eth global.com rules it talks about how you should treat everybody here the answer is please be respectful for everybody else and harassment will not be tolerated in any form if you think somebody is behaving the way they shouldn't please let us know and we'll be able to act immediately in terms of intellectual property anything that you build is solely owned by you and it's your up to you to do whatever you'd like with it and of course if there's anything else that comes up if you have any questions if you have any edge cases some of you have to check in early or late or you have to leave because you have a flight on Sunday let us know we can figure out how to accommodate everybody but uh just want to make sure that everybody is comfortable over this weekend on to some of the amazing prizes so we're going to bring on some of our partners here and they're going to come here talk about who they are why they're excited to be here and what prizes they're giving so let's welcome our very first partner today gearbox and uh there's Mikhail and this is a special moment for us because Mikhail was one of the winners of Market make a year ago as a project that came out of global and they're giving back to the community and I'm super excited to have him here yeah thank you and hello as Amsterdam I'm pretty boring guys because as a Karthik said basically uh it was only one year ago when gearbox became a market make finalist and now gearbox became a sponsor so so boring for me personally and now I really want to say thank you for AS Global family and Karthik personally for support and this support cover gearbox for all our story during the hackathon after hackathon and even now we feel a lot of support and it's great so thank you as Global family thank you Karthik for that let's apply them so at this point it's my personal thoughts you shouldn't consider this hackathon like three days event it could be a really great life-changing event in your life and I really definitely believe that this supportive culture encrypt is very very significant for all persons here in gearbox we are building a generic and composable leverage so it based on credit account which is notified primitive it looks like smart contract wallet which allows you to take more money and manage them as year-round and gearbox itself maybe it's not an end product we really use other protocols and empowers them so you can combine gearbox with unit swap to get margin tracing you can combine gearbox with earn to get leverage farming and you can buy gearbox slider and many other protocols for leverage straight uh staking and so on and so on and so on so mindsite today may be the best strategy ever not to try to think how to build next uni swap killer or how to build a new competitor to one inch it's much better to seeing how through composibility we can create totally new way to really link existing protocols existing ideas to create great experience for users and which help us to attract next billion encrypt industry thank you and build on your box thank you thank you next up Kelvin from optimism [Applause] hello hi my name is Kelvin I work for uh where I work on a project called optimism where we are trying to scale ethereum's Tech scale its values and hopefully provide the funding for its future we're working on two key projects I guess we got optimism the the optimistic roll up and we're also working on a novel funding mechanism called retroactive public goods funding where we're trying to fundamentally change how people can get funded within this ecosystem to do all the work that we desperately need done uh we've got some exciting hacks here if people want there are some exciting prizes for hacks here we've got uh of course 2500 a couple twenty five hundred dollar bounties for the best optimism ecosystem hack so if you just build on optimism um we've also got twenty five hundred dollars for the best optimistically uh ethereum hacks so just hacks that contribute back to the ethereum ecosystem at large so maybe you want to work a little bit on eip4844 something like that um and then of course there's some money thrown in there for people who just want to try deploying on optimism um I highly recommend checking out optimism.io Amsterdam where you can learn all about optimism and uh and the prizes that we're doing so if you want to come hang with us we're near the front uh thank you and public goods are good fun public goods or we won't last thanks Kelvin next up we have Sergey from one inch welcome Sergey [Applause] so hi everyone my name is sirge I'm co-founder of one inch Network we actually started also in a hackathon back in 2019 on this nice uh very very nice organized sector on the th Global uh from up one of your best best in the world we participated more on 17 hackathons around the glove uh um with the team name cryptomaniacs so uh and we are saying here as one inch Network we invented aggregation among this release exchanges back in 2019 and we um have um uh some bonuses for you guys so um you we have like first second and third place uh you can earn up to eight thousand dollars by just uh innovating um building something new uh for D5 or for on top of one inch Network we have multiple protocols we have limit order protocol mm um we have the aggregation protocol user API it's a very well documented described in the documents on oneish.io so uh thank you very much and yeah have a nice hack build [Applause] next up we have stani we have stani from Javi and Lance protocol welcome Stoney hello so um my name is Tani I'm I'm the founder CEO of Ave and we're a team that created the um Ave protocol uh essentially you can deposit cryptographic assets and earn interest rates and then take flash loans and hack other protocols just just kidding Don't Hug any don't hack any protocols um yeah also we created uh lens protocol which is a decentralized social graph uh essentially uh you can create a on-chain profile and and then you have you can have a following graph um on chain as well and also you can publish content directly to your followers um yeah so we have two kind of bounties so we have one track for the the oven bounties and and essentially we're looking for most innovative uh products or pocs or whatever you want to call them uh bill on top of the other protocol um and I think like there's um we've been doing hackathons and participating since uh for three four years now and we've seen uh pretty much a lot of interesting Innovation and it's very surprising how much creativity there is in this room so essentially what is innovation it's it's pretty much you to um the size decide and craft but essentially uh the first price will be seven and a half uh thousand dollars worth second is four and a half third is three thousand and forty is uh one thousand and anyone who is hacking anything on top of the other protocol is already a um kind of like a winner in in our sense and we will definitely love to see some um kind of like a creativity between the the um the other protocol and maybe also with the lens protocol kind of like a money Legos and social Legos combination and these prizes are sponsored by the other grounds down which is a sub subdial or actually spin-off dial from the the um so we also have bounties for the lens protocol and essentially we want to see uh very interesting ways to interact with the content that can be some new way to stream um and and use maybe using live peer at the same time together with the lens protocol and create something amazing something new that we haven't seen before or something old that just works better and is more decentralized so essentially 6 000 for the first one and two thousand for the second one and of course if you have something less protocol you will get also uh some of our swag which are the lens socks and they're very very cool so and there's just limited amounts so first come first will be served um yeah and also tooling so if you see some interesting stuff being built on the tooling side that's also very appreciated but really really I would love to see some very very cool front ends being built or can be even games with um following logic um and and so forth and of course we have some Alpha to League here so we have on Sunday the rave party and here's the code so there's only 25 uh tickets with this code so type in let's hack and you maybe get the code if you're fast enough so I will leave this for you for grabs thank you so much foreign we'll give you all five seconds to snack those tickets and with that we are ready for our next sponsor please welcome Paige from life here hi everybody um my name is Paige what live here is live here is a decentralized network providing um transcoding capacity and transcoding capacity is the essential process to deliver live streaming video across the internet in addition to providing this uh transcoding capacity we also provide a really easy to use API so that you as a developer or a hacker can easily include video in your applications both live streaming video or very recently video on demand so already recorded video like to create a YouTube a YouTube like application and we also have a new video minting uh video nft minting SDK so you can stream video and mint nfts from that streamed video and we have a few prizes um so uh life peer is sort of a great tool if you're thinking about using video in any capacity in your hack specifically for like Creator applications social media or gaming and so that's our top prize so six thousand dollars for the best the a killer video Centric social media Creator or gaming application um we also our second prize at 4 000 is the best use of the nft video minting SDK what creative apps can you make that use uh mint nfts uh video nfts and our SDK is available in our hacker quick start guide which is linked in our sponsor Channel and then the best video on demand application like YouTube there's so many interesting things that we can do in in web3 to create the next um like YouTube competitor or web3 YouTube using our VOD MVP what can you build um so that price is at 4 000 and then the best application of life here in the metaverse we've seen cool applications of streaming into the metaverse or out of the metaverse or videos in the metaverse um this is a fun one so uh what can you use live peer in the metaverse for um and with that thank you so much we're here to help you we have a booth we're here to help you uh IRL come talk to us we'd love to talk to you about your projects help you hack um or hit us up on the Discord thanks so much thank you so much next up we have Pedro from wallet connect please welcome patreon stage hey everyone thanks for coming thanks for coming for my workshop earlier and I hope you guys learned how to use vulcanic if you don't we're over there in the corner so you guys can learn more about us uh obviously while connect wallets and if you do integrate into your adap uh you are eligible for our bounty we created two tracks because we want to see more social projects we love the D5 projects we want to make sure the social projects get the chance to also have their own bounties so we have 4 000 for the first one two thousand for the second one and one fast for the third one on separate tracks we want to see a lot of D5 cross-chain projects and we also want to see the social and identity projects and we also have a pool prize for honorable mentions at 2000 they're going to be split for other projects that we find that are great and as well as connect we always like to see projects that are very interoperable and use standards so make sure to like really make us happy so I look forward to see your projects and I'll judge them on Sunday thank you amazing thank you so much next up we have scale awesome all right hello everybody uh Christine from skill Labs here excited to be here at East Amsterdam with all of you and I want to talk about the prizes first because we're really excited for hackers to hack on scale we have 16 000 worth of prizes and scale bounties uh the 5K will go to the best use case on the scale Network and then the LA the middle two are going to split the prizes so if you build in one of these categories you will split between 5K or 2K each and again there's a there's a 4K prize pool divided among all teams that simply just hack on scale now what is the Skull Network we are a layer that sits on top of ethereum that helps remove gas costs but also speeds up transactions what's great is that it works really well within the scale the ethereum ecosystem so all of the tools that you love on ethereum will work seamlessly on scale as well so there are nodes around the world on the operating a proof-of-stake manner and when you decide that you want a scale chain we group together a subset of those and that subset creates your scale chain but it doesn't do just you know processing transactions you can also use file storage which allows you to save files directly to the blockchain or an interesting messaging agent which allows you to transfer assets back and forth between ethereum now this is one of many so one of the first multi-chain architectures out there and what that means right now is what's really cool is we're launching the scale verse which basically means that we're creating organization within this multi-chain architecture so applications are coming together to create exchange hubs nft hubs Community chains but you can also still get your own dedicated chain that's able to talk to each other within the ecosystem all right now back to the prizes if you want to hack with us definitely scan the QR code here which will give you all the information or just simply enter this URL directly in your browser all right thanks guys bye thank you so much next up we have Tatum please welcome Samuel on stage hey guys I'm super excited to be here I'm Sam CTO and co-founder of Dayton I'm going to tell you what datum actually is datum is the developer framework which helps you developers build the blockchain apps and scale them super fast and super simple you can build any app you want on any chain we support you don't have to understand how node or solidity works you don't have to be blockchain expert you can just leverage a ready to use features in your app we provide Tatum consists of more than 300 features you can just plug it plug them in and you can just build what you can do with us you can do anything you can do any application you want on any chain you want you can create wallets you can use direct RPC calls you can mean the nfts if you don't know how to work with solidity and you know how to create smart contracts we got you covered we have already made templates for you where you just on one line of code you deploy your nft or smart contract of your choice to any of the supported chains we support more than 40 different blockchain protocols if you want to read the data from the chain if you want to perform thousands of transactions per second and scale beyond the blockchain limitations our off-chain features are there for you right now more than 50 000 companies and one of the biggest projects in the world are using datum so if you want to test it out it's easy just sign up to tatum.io get the free API key and start building we're having a workshop today which you are all invited I'm gonna very quickly show you how to start in 15 minutes uh we have some nice pool prizes for some of the best projects uh nfds some virtual accounts whatever you want to build we are here to help you so sign up and build thank you guys thank you so much next step we have Evan from me now please welcome Evan on stage [Applause] hey everyone I'm Evan I'm one of the co-founders of mina protocol so Mina is this protocol where we put zero knowledge groups kind of in the heart of it um which both means that it's very easy to verify and good to program zero knowledge proofs with so in particular it can be very cheaply verified with the zero knowledge proofs on your browser on your phone or even inside smart contracts on other cryptocurrencies additionally uh We've also unlocked some very good zero knowledge pre-programming functionality it's all in typescript and you cannot only access the scale functionality but you can also access privacy so you can natively program with privacy zero knowledge proofs in typescript if you're like a typescript developer you can use this without being a cryptographer so that's really awesome and and yeah so one of the things we're going to do with this is we're working to make Mina verifiable inside of an evm smart contract which will let you do your privacy and scaling part of your application inside Mina and then the rest of your application could just stay on ethereum so if you've wanted to use privacy but you're like not going to build an entire like sidechain or like become a cryptographer and you want to just use typescript and get going with it you can use Mina for that um we had a workshop earlier today that talked about how you can program with zero knowledge proofs and Mina it happened earlier so if you missed it uh you can actually see it online there's going to be a video up soon on like the youth Amsterdam page I'm going to hand it over to Jack now from o of one Labs one another Meetup protocol ecosystem company we'll talk more about the prizes foreign hi I'm Jack and I do developer relations at Owen labs and we've sent the last oh and Labs is the company that incubated the Mina protocol so uh we spent the last year building out snarky JS so that you can build uh a whole new class of a decentralized applications and simple idiomatic typescript we call these ZK apps and they expose a whole host of zero knowledge Primitives that are really powerful so that you can build a whole new kind of game or roll-up or privacy preserving application whatever you want we have prizes at uh eight thousand five thousand and three thousand dollars for first second and third place respectively and as long as you build something that relates to mina you should be eligible infrastructure and integration are both fair game if you do choose to build a zero knowledge app I recommend that you build something kind of simple that makes unique uh that you know makes makes use of the unique properties of Mina and snarkyjs in a clever way if you need help reach out to somebody in a hoodie like mine or even if you just want to say hi most of us are core devs at Mina Foundation or on labs and um if you build something really cool or maybe if you build something at all we'll give you a hoodie other than that thank you so much and good luck thank you Amina protocol next up we have ipfs and filecoin please welcome Constantine on stage hello everyone my name is Constantine and I'm having a pleasure to welcome you from ipfs and file coincide what an amazing time to be here in Eve Amsterdam to meet with all of you hacking in person for the next few days first of all without further Ado ipfs is the protocol which makes the web peer-to-peer it makes it resilient accessible and scalable for the future applications moreover we have a filecoin which is built on top of ipfs and uh which serves you with the largest data storage provider on the web free and allows you to have your data being resilient and reliable all all the time when you need it moreover our ecosystem is the strongest asset in growing the file coin Network and web free in General on one side we have a rapidly expanding storage capacity of the network with more than four thousand of storage providers available to you right now and more than 18 XB bytes of total storage capacity in the network right now on the other side we have an increasing demand from the explosively growing ecosystem with more than 300 startups working on different Topics in ipfs and filecoin and more than 9 000 developers contributing to our protocols day to day from all over the the world we are more than just a storage though we are also building new solutions to enable compute on the file coin we are developing a new layer of programmability via file core and virtual machine and we are also joining our effort to make fileco improvably green and this all becomes a foundation of the web free being sustainable reliable storage compute and much much more in the network moreover during the hack you can see or find US during the workshops at nine today I'll be giving an introduction for ipfs and filecoin and book your time tomorrow at 1pm when our CEO and founder John Juan Bennett will be giving you a talk on regenerating crypto economics for good I would wish you all to get creative and good luck have fun and for those of you who are doing the best of the best projects and available uh and building the web free future together with us we are preparing the amazing prizes with a pool of 16 okay to award you and the challenge to participate in our uh to participate in our challenge you have to fulfill the very simple criteria of building together with ipfs for content and dressing and file coin for decentralized storage or any solution that builds on top of either for you for the quick start we have prepared many tools and guides but you can scan the QR code or feel free also to follow the nft.storage which can give you an immediate hands up with in given a few minutes to freely store your nfts on ipfs and fileco and you can also your web free dot storage for storing all three things and you can use flick for also hosting your website directly on ipfs making and ensuring that your website and content on the web is reliably stored for whenever you want it I would wish you all great success and enjoy your time at the hackathon congratulations and good luck on the hack thank you a lot [Applause] amazing uh oh he's tall um next up we have polygon so polygon wasn't able to make it here because of a travel minor issue but I'll read off their prizes really quickly so polygon is giving a lot of prizes so you have fifteen thousand dollars in prizes and the first place for an open track of best use of polygon integration will receive five thousand dollars the second place will receive three thousand and the third place is going to receive two thousand dollars and they have two separate tracks one for the best app incorporating polygon Affinity design system that will win 2500 and the second trap of best app incorporating polygon ID in their hack that's also going to receive twenty five hundred dollars all right with that we are ready for our next sponsor and that is skill wallet please welcome Alex on stage from skill wallet [Applause] hello everyone so this is Alex and the co-founder skill wallet we have a sales over in identity protocol that binds together the individuals with the communities that they join and reward them based on their participation now as for our prizes once the slides arrive we have in total 8 000 usdcs as Rewards so we have two main tracks They will appear yeah and the the main one is the ID activist is for building something interesting on public goods for creativity and less coding so you can use our protocol to build a brand new app and some new use case for example in profit sharing the second one is a feature track is a little bit more techy and you can play directly before protocol to add a new feature that you don't have or for example something that experiments with new models of governance like participation weighted loading so we also have a pull price that is in total 1000 usdc's whatever you do is kill wallet to just have fun integrate it and you will take a share of the pool so heck have fun and enjoy your weekend we are there bye bye next up we have Rafael from toucan hey everybody so um I'm Rafael CEO and founder of toucan and funnily enough toucan was started at Eve London two years ago and now we're here so big thank you to if Global you're doing amazing work uh toucan is empowering web free to address climate change so we do that by Bill building building blocks essentially that tokenize carbon credits and allow other people to build on top of liquid carbon credits um to do it like in metaverse and nft use carbon as a collateral asset in lending stable coins Etc so really it's a bet on new people to uh yeah build crazy stuff with carbon and to lead by example we've actually offset this event so you can eat and drink as much as you want and there is also eight thousand dollars up for grabs and prices I don't know if they show perfect so we have five devs here that can support you at any point in the night in the morning so the booth is right here if you need help for building with carbon and uh yeah like everyone in web free obviously we're we're hiring and uh yeah you want to build work on something cool that has meaningful impact then please talk to us thank you so much next up we have Fran from Super Floyd Welcome Fran on stage hello everyone uh super excited to be here last time I was on stage at if Global was Eve London as a hacker so it's amazing to be here as a sponsor and studs and hopefully I'm going to help you guys to win a prize so superfluid is an asset streaming protocol you can make continuous payments without making recurring transactions and you also don't have any gas fees so it's all on chain it's very programmable you can build a ton of really cool stuff and we have a ton of bounties so there's eight thousand dollars in open bounties and on top of this we have a ten thousand dollar Bounty with Uma protocol you can find the details on our Twitter that's ten thousand dollar Bounty for one specific project that's already specked out so come and hack with us we have a workshop at 9 30 in room eight uh looking forward to seeing everyone and good luck hacking yeah thank you so much next up we have Tom from triped out welcome Tom on stage [Applause] hi everyone I'm Tom I'm from the tribe Dao the tribe dial is a dial with a set D5 protocols inside it we've got Faye arari vaults a few others um this uh hackathon um we've got three prizes available based on three new things that we recently launched um two and a half thousand dollars each uh one is for tribe turbo which is um a way to get a customer sign of credit and put it in the yield strategy one is for ERC 4626 which is a tokenized vault standard and the last is for flywheel which is a way a generalized way to point incentives into markets so yeah have fun hacking um we did a workshop earlier so catch up on that and ask me any questions thanks thanks Tom next up we have web3 off [Applause] hi good evening everybody I'm Elisha and I run operations at web 3 off so we built simple self-custodial auth infrastructure for both web tree applications and wallets and our goal is really just to make replace seat phrases with an MPC enabled multi-factor like key and bring the next billion users into this space so we are built on threshold cryptography and our onboarding flows emulate something that everyday users are very familiar with which is really just signing into an SSO like Google Twitter email username password on a trusted device without the need for any you know additional installations our keys are self-custodial interoperable across devices and platforms to fa capable and user recoverable web 2 off is simple to integrate and it works with metamask so we are sponsoring eight thousand dollars worth of bounties for projects that integrate with web 3 off and we are looking for exciting projects with exceptional ux and a business case so we've got devs on site to help you build your debt with web3 off in about 20 minutes and we're holding a workshop later uh at 11 p.m at room 2. so catch us at our booth and uh let's hack something together good night guys amazing next up we have Simon from volts please welcome Simon on stage hey everyone uh so we are vaults and essentially uh we are an automated Market maker for interest rate swaps so what does that mean in its simplest form it basically means that you can trade fixed and variable rates with leverage so again in the simplest form think dydx but for raids uh if you want to learn more about the way the protocol kind of really works then make sure you come along to Art of my co-founders talk at 10 o'clock tonight otherwise in terms of prizes so we have 8K of prizes in total which breaks down as 4K for the most useful two and a half k for the most creative and one and a half k for another qualifying application if you've got any questions come over to our booth otherwise good luck and looking forward to seeing what everyone builds thanks Simon next up we have George from Tempest please welcome George on stage [Music] GM everybody I'm George co-founder of tempus and we are currently working on fixing the files we have a pool of 8K for prices we will give 5K for the best uh and for the second place we will give 3K everyone is welcome to build anything back and or front-end on top of tempus see you around enjoy amazing next up Boris from uniswap Grants program please welcome Boris on stage uh Hey guys Boris from the grants program here so unisop decentralized mm exchange on ethereum and both arbitrary optimism and polygon and yeah for our challenges we have best usage of any scaling solution with unit swap so you can build something cool either for the existing deployments or you can think about outside the box and work with deployments that you know deploy somewhere where unit stock currently is not anything goes here and for our second category we have most Innovative Unison projects so we don't want to limit you build whatever you think is cool and it will be great for us thank you so much thank you Boris next up we have Shana from coinbase wallet please welcome Shannon on stage hi everyone um I'm excited to be with y'all at East Amsterdam tonight we have some awesome prizes for integrating with coinbase wallet I'm sure you've all heard of coinbase hopefully some of you have heard of coinbase wallet too it is our self-custody wallet it has millions of users um we have a new feature called coinbase pay that's really interesting it allows for Fiat on-ramp if you link your coinbase account um you should have prizes okay perfect these are our prizes for integrating with coinbase wallet so it's five thousand dollars this is USD for first place plus an introduction to our Ventures team so that's pretty exciting two thousand dollars for a second and fifteen hundred for a third place my colleague JM gave a workshop earlier on what coinbase wallet is and how to integrate with it so check that out on demands um and then find us at our booth thanks everyone thank you so much next up we have natter from the graph please welcome natter on stage all right uh I'm nattered Abbott I'm here with the graph protocol we're really excited to be here we have a booth set up over there if you're willing to come by and ask us some questions or pick up some swag we'd love for you to do that the graph is an indexing and querying protocol for a decentralized blockchain networks like ethereum arbitrum optimism and a few dozen ebm compatible chains as well as near protocol and ipfs so with the graph protocol you can Define the smart contract or smart contracts that you'd like to build an API with and we will allow you to deploy open apis called subgraphs to our Network giving you a really really nice querying API for doing things like full text search relationships between your data querying for filtering sorting all types of stuff so um if you want to learn more about the graph go to the graph.com we have documentation there to kind of get you up and running we have eight thousand dollars in prizes here you can either build out a brand new subgraph and win either first second or third party I would say grand prize first and then second or you could actually use an existing subgraph that someone else has created that you can then find that's publicly available to use so with that being said I hope everyone has a great time you know working with the graph and if you have any questions again come by we'll be at the booth all day tomorrow as well as part of Sunday and we're giving a workshop later tonight so check it out Simone is giving that thank you thanks Nader next up we have Jorge from gnosis safe hey everyone Jorge here from Nosa safe for those who aren't familiar Nosa safe is a safety standard of web3 and the most trusted platform for individuals and communities to manage their digital assets so with Nosa safe programmable accounts users essentially have much more control in granular permissions over controlling their assets currently there are over 70 billion dollars in USD stored on over 50 000 safes so we'd love for you to join us in building out some future ideas that are relevant to what vitalik was talking about around self-sovereignty so the first one being essentially a recovery module so we're looking for novel ways for people to recover their assets in the worst case so 4 000 in bounties up for that one and then novel ways to sign in with Nosa safe is our second Bounty another 4 000 for that and we're looking essentially for people to have just better compatibility with authenticating into applications using their safe last but not least Herman is giving a workshop at 12 30 in room 8 on getting started with the safe core SDK so come stop by our booth to learn more about safe get started if you have any questions come talk to the team thanks thank you so much next up we have AP wine please welcome Gasper hi everyone what if you could get your other yield of an entire year but today that's one of the things that you can do with ap wine through yield tokenization we create derivatives and yield strategies in a very modular and composable way and that's where you come into the picture we want you to come up with good ideas and relevant integration to build on top of AP1 and we actually have a workshop in a few minutes in room two where we'll showcase or SDK and demonstrate how easy it is to build this API and leverage the manual compatibility of the space so feel free to come to the booth feel free to come to the workshop in a few minutes and we look forward to seeing very cool ideas and integration with everyone thank you thank you so much next up we have connects please welcome Sanjay on stage hello everyone this is Sanchez from connects connects is across Gene Bridge which allows you to send any piece of information from one chain to another and it could be anything a token vote uh nft or whatnot uh we are the only bridge in this space which is in the trust minimization and uh the most secure one without any trust assumption so yeah if you care about the security do build on us and uh this is in an event where we are launching and announcing our test net which will be live and the test night is live right now but the product itself will be live in six weeks and with this one uh you know uh there are so many potential uh instant transfer from one chain to another nft Bridge uh doubt interaction uh metaverse metaverse walls apps uh uni V3 traps and whatnot so uh anything everything is possible cross stream now and uh this time we are offering uh three tire off prices uh which we are offering when where we are having the couple of the starting ones from our contact to contract interactions um on sending and receiving side so uh do check those out if you have any problem we are happy to help you anytime and uh the process price list and details are available on Discord as well as at Amsterdam site so yeah uh peace out ciao thank you very much thank you so much and our last sponsor for today please welcome Chandler from Uma uh clearly they saved the best for lost um I'm John from Uma um and today we're just going to quickly run through a little bit about what Uma does if you're a developer that needs to use an oracle for any form of data that's not typically a price feed we're the kinds of team that you're going to need to use for your hackathon um for our prizes we're going to get six thousand dollars away for the first prize and uh Second Place runner-up for the you know honorable mention at two thousand dollars if you want to know how to go from zero to integrating with the optimistic Oracle I have a workshop at 10 o'clock today um I highly recommend that for anyone that's wanting to get integrated with optimistic Oracle and then Super fluid mentioned yet yes a little earlier uh we have a product that we're going to co-collaborate on and this is actually a honorable mention where we're throwing uh ten thousand dollars joined between the two of us on this spec product you can find both of those on our twitters either one of our super fluid or at Uma protocol looking forward to it all right couple more things to go before we close there's a lot more prizes here so 130 unique ones I think we have F maziki sync Union gelato block team in zirion Spruce Amber flux Fedora Boba doing your own epns quick note and radical all of them are giving a lot more amazing prizes and you can check out all of this and the full details about how you can qualify by heading over to amsterdam.ethbubble.com prizes all right too close please pace yourself we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we really want you to all have fun and this event is very much about experimentation and learning so even if you don't finish what you wanted to do we still encourage all of you to uh present and get some feedback on what you wanted to work on and with that let's get hacking thank you so much everybody we'll all see you here at the venue if you're still looking for a team please come on this side and we'll also convert this middle Auditorium piece to a hacking spot so let's get going thanks everybody what's up foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign thank you [Music] [Music]
