hey y'all welcome just giving a few minutes for the live stream to get set up welcome again we have adriel here with us from unstoppable unstoppable domains and he's going to give you a workshop on login and identity let me take the stage thank you appreciate it you can hear me okay perfect all right thanks vichy and thanks everyone for having us i'm adriel i'm a product manager at unstoppable domains and today we'll be sharing our login with unstoppable product um but before getting into that let's get you jump started towards earning some rewards so as part of this hackathon we're asking you to integrate login with unstoppable on your app or to submit a pr to merge this feature as a login option on your favorite d5 or nft dap now we're giving away prices for the top three uses of login as well as some general price pool giveaways and that's for qualifying teams all right so the qr codes and the links here on the right are what you need to get started right away so feel free to check them out all right so i'll be sharing that information a little later in the top two before i forget so you'll get to see that in a little bit but before diving into what login is and why it's important i think it helps to talk about what we do at unstoppable domains so at unstoppable we envision a future where people benefit from the value they create online not just companies all right and to help shape that feature we're building products that return the power to the people all right so we'll work to give you the right to control your data govern your data and ultimately make your own choices with that data all right so our products the way that we consider our products is that they combine to form the foundation for an identity system for web3 all right and at our core are nft domains which work to simplify crypto payments so with our domains what we've done is basically replaced hard to remember cryptocurrency addresses excuse me cryptocurrency addresses with the human readable name so think about that no more forgetting or mistyping an address you've got a human readable domain that you own it's not rented like other domains um and the domain is stored in your wallet just like a cryptocurrency all right so now that you've got the domain what do you do with it right what's next now you can now send receive and store cryptocurrencies and nfts with that easy to remember domain um and you can also use that domain to log into apps and websites which will spend the bulk of our time today talking about logging with unstoppable but aside from that you can also set up gallery style websites for your nfts and build your own profile pages which allow you to share your information across social media and web3 of course you being the owner of your information and how you share it which i think is a good way of kind of segueing into data and owning data right now we're in a predominantly centralized world where we're web 2 apps own all user data as you can imagine there are a number of challenges that come along with that um so one big issue that we see is and that we've all experienced really is having to start from scratch every time we adopt a new app or innovation basically what it comes down to is that our network and reputation just doesn't come with us right and what we're doing what we're working on is to build a world where the user can bring not just themselves right but their data the data to help better shape that experience on these new apps now so how are we getting there well we see login with unstoppable as a great first step towards the promise of decentralized identity all right what it does is it helps mobilize the power of our domains so all the capabilities that are currently available with your domain and that ones will continue to build out and improve upon will help you as you own your web three identity all right now before getting into how login works let's talk a little bit about the benefits um i think we should start with dapps so dapps are are able to provide their users simple and easy authentication okay you can quit they can request uh personal data the user owns to provide a customer or customized experience rather now that same permission data can be used to better engage with the user so it provides you a way to have an opportunity for you to have one-to-one communication and on top of that it's very simple and safe to use which is uh you know has a number of big pluses and one that we like to call out is that it frees dapps from having to maintain a database of user profile information right so um and we touched upon this a little bit earlier here but when it comes to the uni uh the user benefits users enjoy the benefit of a privacy forward universal sign up and login experience across all applications right and they own 100 known i should say and control their identity and data okay so let's get into login and we'll start by showing an example of how you can implement it using a partner app integration what you're seeing is the cook finance app we welcome you to visit their app using the qr code at the bottom right of this slide or by going directly to cook.finance all right now once a user clicks on sign in they see the unstoppable domains as an option for login once they click on that button they are presented with the modal to enter their human readable name all right clicking continue takes them to the screen where they connect with the wallet associated with that domain after confirming their account they are shown what the data or excuse me what data the current app is requesting you see that in yellow there after choosing to connect they're logged in and you can see they're logged in because their domain is at the top right corner so effectively your domain is your username all right now we shared earlier um we're going to continue to look for ways to improve our products and humanitycheck is the latest addition to our login product um i think the simplest way of relating humanity check is that it it's a way for people to verify their online identity without having to reveal anything about themselves to the applications and services that they use right so how does humanity check work first off users can access humanity check through the domain profile page that's included on our website right so it's a part of our website once they log in they can get to the domain profile page and i'll show that in a little bit but they can also access it through the login experience now it's it's important to note while they can always access humanity check through domain profiles an app needs to support humanity check in order for to be included in the login experience so as you become onboarding configuring your implementation of login you can choose humanity check at that point now um the identity verification process is managed by our partner persona all right and persona requests a series of photos and images during that process they use these images to verify the person is who they claim to be and then the final verification and sign uh they finalize it by verifying and signing the message with your wallet um also part of that verification uh process persona generates a random id number and it's that random id that is what's passed to the to unstoppable and the app so nothing more and we'll talk about this a little bit more but really the random id is all that's being surfaced and passed along it's part of this process and at the end of the day it basically equates to a pass or fail human or not all right okay so let's see how that looks like for the user um as mentioned earlier a user can access humanity check either through their domain profile or through login um on this slide you'll see on the bottom left there's an image that shows how that confirmation looks like for a user once they've passed humanity check all right let's go through the process once they've selected to go through humanity check they're guided through a series of steps all right and that first step is it starts with what country their government id is from next they are then provided a list of photo id options to choose from in this case we've chosen driver's license they're prompted to provide a photo of the front of that driver's license once they've uploaded that they're asked to confirm the quality of the photo and once they're happy with the quality of the photo they're requested for a selfie all right now there are a couple of prompts that they'll follow to scan the user's face and after following the prompts they're given a confirmation message and prompted to complete verification as i mentioned earlier i want to pover here actually because i want to restate that neither unstoppable or the app that's requiring humanity check ever see or collect this personal information right and a user can always choose to request that the data be deleted so they can reach out to us we have a couple different ways for that to happen but wanted to re-emphasize that but again the random id is all that's being passed not this information okay login provides a couple of key features that we've kind of talked about but as a map you'd like to access some of that data to better engage with the user well here's a high-level overview of the scopes that we support through login admittedly the list is currently short but we do have plans and we're actively working on expanding them all right and those are updates that are going to come sooner than later um on the right you get a view of how the scopes are requested of the user during the login process and as i mentioned those scopes will grow over time and will help to shape the user's identity especially as they go from app to app they will own and manage their data through their domain profile so let's talk a little bit more about that domain profile here's an example of a user's domain landing page all right this is a publicly available page that's available through our ud dot me portal all right and what is showing is this particular user what they what information they've chosen to share publicly and if you want to go see her page you can use that qr code there at the bottom right for uh one of the more later examples all right now they manage that information through their unstoppable domains account by updating their domain profile included in that domain profile is their email address if they choose to share that as well as their social accounts and this is what we're looking at updating but at least you get a feel for what we have available today all right all right so at a high level we've shown you how it works um but i figure you'll want to start integrating with login already i know we've provided some information at the top of the call but i want to talk about the steps that you need to take to get integrated um and to do so they're like i said there's a couple of simple steps the first is to get your client credentials and that's through a dedicated client dashboard you also then choose your integration path we've got a number of different guides available they include with and without pop-up web3 react web 3 modal bnc onboarding and node.js as well all right once you've chosen your integration path we show you how you can configure the login ui and to make sure you get the right visibility to your application and for integrating the login we also want you to connect with us to help promote your application right now at the far right there again we've got a qr code that will take you directly to the login technical docs so you can get started right away all right let's see here all right so um again you can get all that information through the technical docs but we did want to in a way kind of connect the docs for you all with an easy to follow flow so you get an understanding what's happening in the background as your users are going through the login experience so um like we showed in the the cook finance example a user first chooses to log in with their domain all right so they type in their domain once they've chosen that login option the app does a lookup of that domain to the blockchain which then returns the owner address along with the off server url all right the user is then redirected to the auth server url who then requests a signature and once the signature is completed the auth server returns the auth token and resource server url what the app then does is use that auth token to request metadata from the resource server which then returns the metadata to the app and all that ends with the user finally being logged in okay so yes there's a couple different steps that need to happen in order for this to be completed but as we showed earlier the experience for the user is pretty seamless and we're always looking for ways to improve that too right minimize the number of clicks etc and for you as an integration partner you have a number of integration options as we mentioned earlier and ways for it to connect with us in the community to help support you all right okay i'm going to move forward now and get into some faqs um let's start with uh some login faqs to start with login is free it's free to use and free for apps to integrate we also have a number of ways to help you integrate and promote login so again we really encourage you to reach out to us for guidance um another common question is around how we're different from wallets it's logging in with unstoppable is different from logging in with wallet for a few key reasons right one it's using your human readable domain okay so it's not a complicated wallet or account number two users and apps can choose how to share their off chain data which is not available through a wallet um and three your identity and login is associated with your nft domain so you can transfer it to a different wallet in the future if you happen to choose to all right um some more questions that we're continuing to improve the user experience which includes how they choose the information they want to share with each app um i gave you a view of the current domain profile page we have plans to introduce additional metadata that users can share and of course how that apps can access in order to enrich their experience lastly users currently cannot create accounts or acquire a domain through the login experience but i can say we're actively working on adding this ability so i'd stay tuned it's something that's definitely in the works and we should be providing an update on that relatively shortly all right i'm gonna move on to some humanity check faqs um i kind of touched upon this earlier but when it comes to a user's personal data so our identity verification partner stores the images and data used to verify and the random id created during verification is off chain but again as we highlighted unstoppable and the apps that are requesting verification do not do not have access to the personal data we only have access to the randomized id okay and lastly for us to be fully decentralized we need an identity verification partner that is decentralized so while that currently is not available we are definitely open to opportunities to work with new partners um having a lot of discussions um and we actively welcome suggestions from the community again join our discord we want to hear from you um if you've got ideas definitely we want to talk to you okay so um before we wrap up i want to share some testimonials from both users and partner apps the users that i'm showing here in particular are calling out some some interesting use cases for humanity check they include helping to support uh rewards programs something we're hearing a lot of interest around um there's also been buzz around using humanity check for nft marketplaces where creators can be verified that's another one we're hearing a lot about too um and here are two partner testimonials from cook finance in atlanta's world um there's a lot going on here um but i think the the main takeaway here is that for d5 login and humanitycheck make it easier to onboard users um and to ensure that you can meaningfully engage with them right with your most important users those are two key things that have been called out and [Music] from those that have integrated okay i'm gonna come all right so yeah back why to why we're all here right so as part of this hackathon we're asking you to integrate with login on your app or to submit a pr to merge this feature as a login option um again for your favorite d5 or nft app so what we're doing is giving away prices for the top three uses again of login as well as have some general price pool giveaways for those teams that qualify definitely reach out to us for for more details and again the qr codes and the links here on the right are what you need to get started right away so um feel free to check them out and also to reach out to us if you have any questions all right last but not least i wanted to provide you some credit to buy and try out our and try your own nft domain excuse me um we ask that you join the conversation on our discord community as well as the one that heath global has set up for this hackathon and to follow us on twitter we've got great content and engagement through all these different channels and we want to make sure we get your feedback right so please reach out to us and if you have questions specifically on how to best partner with us i've added charlie and ash's information here at the bottom um please feel free to reach out to them they're great resources as well as i am right um that's all that i've got for us today thank you for having us and um definitely open to hearing your questions there is some questions in the chat there if you want to take them though all right how are fake sorry i'm just looking through them right now um so this first one around so this question around uh persona yeah it's just thanks thanks charlie i'll just starting to even do that that is correct your assumptions are wrong for some so i'll read out the question persona can confirm your identity and then you can request all the information that was used to establish your identity be deleted so that no one including persona can ever have access to that that is correct right again that random id is all that we need at unstoppable as well as the app that's asking for that to confirm your identity is just basically a pass or fail so we've got a couple different wallets that users can use with our domains and a metamask is uh one of the major ones that we have charlie i don't know if we have a full list somewhere that we can share with folks but um i know we've we've got that across the board thank you so how are fake accounts prevented like registering and posing as someone with social media accounts yeah that's a that's a great question i'm not sure how um specifically we have any fail checks or within the process to to to keep fake accounts from being created but i do know that we have ways of their i'm sorry just charlie answer something yeah there is a verification process within the domain flow so yeah that same domain profile that i shared with you earlier when you're entering in that information there's a verification process in there question around could one person have multiple identities i guess i'm trying to understand what what that's asking there is is this in reference to the humanity check yeah so humanity is tied to yeah one single domain one government so thanks for answering that you can have multiple you can have multiple domains but you have only one account right and so that's where the humanity check is tied to as the owner of the persona account how are you able to avoid accessing the dashboard containing the user data as the owner of the persona account i guess i'm not following this question i'm sorry guys so if a user verification does not pass then we get past fail so we either know that you're you're verified or not and that's all the app would know yeah so yeah that domain dashboard that we showed you earlier we did not get any of that information from persona so none of the information they use to verify is going to be accessible through your ud profile yes so the domain profile really is what you've added there it's not specific to humanity check again that's that's only on persona servers all right a lot of questions on um humanity check which is great um let me see do i have this here just wanted to share that if i did ask add some information in here in the deck we'll she'll get access to where we talk about um persona excuse me definitely welcome you to look more into what we've got available here very good um yeah right here on humanity check on the fats for humanity check we provide details on persona and how that works on that qr code here on the left all right definitely encourage you guys again to reach out to us um here are again the instructions for how you can get started with integration there's uh charlie's telegram feel free to reach out to us directly there through the discord our discord community as well as through um the hackathons discord as well thank you thanks for having us thanks adrian i'll see you at the next workshop all right take care thanks for
