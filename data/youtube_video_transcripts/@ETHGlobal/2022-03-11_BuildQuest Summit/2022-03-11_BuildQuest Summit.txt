good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eat global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to the bill quest gaming and metaverse summit so all of you are watching this on eatglobal.tv this is the platform we'll be using today for all of our talks uh this lets you ask us any questions live we'll be able to relay all those questions you put in the chat to all of our speakers and you can kind of engage and ask questions and also collaborate and just enjoy this with the rest of the audience here also as a quick note for everybody anybody who kind of signs in and engages with our audience will be receiving a poep nft token for their participation so please be sure to log in customize your avatar and and say hi so let's uh let's get started uh this event is brought to you by eath global and for those of you who are joining us for the first time heath global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and summits and build quest is one of those events so we have a hackathon going on uh right now that ends this sunday and as part of this event we're doing a summit on just kind of giving you the latest and the greatest on what's happening in gaming and metaverse worlds for the hackathon there were 630 hackers from 67 different countries participating building really amazing metaphors and gaming related uh projects and we'll be able to see what everybody comes up with uh this coming week so i'm super excited for kind of seeing all the incredible things that come out of the event and this kind of brings us to the summit piece which is uh what today is all about and i want to kind of give a quick overview of what we're going to cover for the next few hours and without further ado let's jump right in so we're going to have some opening remarks from cake we're going to talk about sort of what does it look like to build uh the metaverse with ipfs and just using a lot of these decentralized storage primitives uh we're gonna talk about just some new ideas in web3 gaming that we kind of finally get to blend in and just introduce some crypto native primitives uh we're going to talk about randomness in web3 and gaming all together and we're gonna have to have a panel and an amazing discussion around plato earn or play for fun or just what does that category look like and how we're seeing it evolve and then we're also going to talk about building for multi uh blockchain games uh just what changes in that realm as well as sort of what you can get excited about unless i'm closing remarks at the end of this summit um and uh that's that's kind of the inflow talks are gonna happen and we are super excited to welcome all of our amazing speakers so uh let's quickly get started so without further ado like to welcome cake to kind of share some kickoff remarks with us and um he'll he's gonna talk about everything that you should also be excited about so welcome hey thanks for having me um cool so i'm going to share my screen uh first off it's an honor to be here uh i think it's really cool that everyone is building web 3 games i think there's a lot of potential here and so i'm going to give a quick overview of what i think about web3 gaming as well as some of the talks that i think are coming up and then some of the depth tooling that i think is really interesting so uh at protocol labs we love games uh factorio is a fan favorite you can see a lot of people in the company playing uh factorio and it's a lot of fun um we also have a long history of games so i come from a background of playing ultima online uh ragnarok online final fantasy 14 world of warcraft all of these games have economies and all these games have economies where when you did play these games you actually never took anything with you when you left so you might have had some small community where you traded stuff online on some web forms but um even in games like raw online tibia t4c and lineage one uh the games your character kind of died of the game when the game kind of got too old and so um one thing that was really popular in these games that we all are aware of is kind of the in-game economies so you had these auction houses where you could trade gold and you know in-game uh gil for like different items uh you could craft items but all of that stuff was locked in the game and so with this you know we learned i think in the last like four years you know when you run a token on ethereum in web 3 those tokens can actually participate interoperability between like many different ecosystems many different pieces of software many different types of clients and so i think this opens up a huge amount of opportunity and why it's really exciting to kind of bridge the gap between what we're doing what we're seeing in the space and web 3 gaming and so web 3 games take advantage of new protocol features that give the player more lifetime value over the games they're playing so imagine a world where you have a favorite game but the assets that you have you don't actually lose them when the game shuts down or if the game is open source you can still play it and the game industry is massive like we have um 35 billion in revenues for pc games we have 49 billion revenues for console gaming 90 billion in the mobile games market so there's so much value being generated here but if we continue on the same trend and we make games where everything that the players put in to the game they don't get back so you imagine all those mobile gotcha games where you're you know rolling for characters and when the game dies your your investment dies that's not so great so um i think there's opportunity here to really improve on this and so how do we get here um what's what's special about web3 versus web 2 um anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service you know that's what's really cool about i think this opens the door from just like domestic us west uh gaming or you know like european gaming kind of brings everyone together to play games together in the same space you can call this whatever you want but there's a lot of cool opportunity there no one can block you or deny you from access to the service that's also pretty cool for gaming um so if you want to play games in different regions but they're kind of region locked there's there's a possibility that you can make a game that wouldn't be region locked um payments are built into native token uh this is a huge unlock as we mentioned earlier you know with auction houses or whatever in the previous games in like world war warcraft for example um if you have the payment system built in uh with a native token that changes everything and people can trade like you know back in the day people used to trade runescape items outside of the game you know so opens up a whole bunch opportunities you can pretty much program anything with a smart contract so there's a lot of things you can do and there's a lot of tooling that's getting better and templating and wizards and then web3 servers can't go down so um you know if we get to our vision of a centralized network of like thousands and thousands of computers keeping this stuff up um i think you know you can really trust in these services and the cert network can adjudicate basically all the assets that you own and make sure that you don't lose anything so i think to be succinct oh sorry uh players own parts of the game there's actual economic value and there's never composability that's never been seen before and so um there are many mechanics that you can add to your games today i think like you know if you wanted to stake your tokens that's a completely new thing so um you know a lot of games have this built in if you played you know any role playing or mmorpg but with the mechanic that you can play to earn capital you can take out of the game as well that's kind of really exciting um token assets can be used in one platform as i mentioned earlier which represents interesting opportunities nfts are global objects to use in any way the developer sees fit and then games can be community run with voting mechanics which can be really fun to like listen to your players if you're playing any you know mainstream mrpg today there's always a lot of criticism about the game but if uh players can vote on what they want to see next you might be able to avoid a lot of design decisions that would ruin the game that you like uh token assets can be listed on exchanges so imagine if wow gold is actually tradable anywhere and everything else that we already love in games so web3 is very additive it can add to existing web 2 paradigms without like you don't have to lose the things that you enjoy in web 2 but now you have additional features and so like an example you know like a a team during this week can you know create a world letters want to belong to they contribute ownership to that of that world to a community they can launch a token to bootstrap a live economy they can uh create a community that raises capital by a shared treasury and then they can launch a minimal viable game with token syncs where as you are you know destroying a token you're creating asset in the game players can decide if they want to that increases the value of the token network and then values reinvested in the game you're playing and then you continue to make more games and people can bring that token to different games there's a lot of really awesome stuff um that you know you can do so we have a couple really interesting upcoming talks one of them is coin up coin up is a global community of entrepreneurs and investors operating at the intersection of gaming and blockchain we have playment by david moore this is really cool because they're video game veterans and so they're going to be working on a lot of interesting stuff to help players earn while they play um ox park is seems like the dream we do research and development they do work with zero knowledge proofs they do open source tooling infrastructure and ecosystem development um there's going to be uh anonymous pronounced name sheridan's is the leading media and technology law firm whose lawyers combine in-depth legal and commercial knowledge with breadth of expertise and experience to give unparalleled advice to your clients so a lot of interesting insights here and then uh sid from protocol labs is doing a talk on drand which if you are a game developer you know how important random numbers are uh to making sure that you can um you can create uh valuable loot drops that are distinct and feel unique in your game and there's also some interesting development tools in our ecosystem so we have mmt storage empty storage is a long term storage service designed for off-chain entity data for up to 31 gigabytes in size per individual upload um using it is as easy as creating an account so highly recommend checking it out um tableland uh you know if you love using postgres you love using sql imagine building on web3 using you know what's familiar uh this could make game dev a lot easier for you so very interested about this project i think it's gonna make things a lot easier uh foundry um i think the dream to be able to write solidity tests in um in solidity so uh look at check out this tool if you're writing smart contracts and you want something where you can really really test the edge cases of what you're building because there's a lot of cases where things can go wrong when you deploy your smart contract uh and then web3 storage is by protocol labs it's a simple jobs npm library you can easily use the pin data to ipfs uh there's no invite necessary so anyone can create an account and the document is super solid if you want to use it in an estuary we have a tool to easily get data up to the file coin network so if you wanted to make sure your cids were durable so that if you know you're pinning something really valuable and you don't want to lose it you can make sure that it's replicated six times on the file coin network and uh we have gateway support and it's really easy to use and so that's it that's a overview of pretty much everything um hope you guys have a great time amazing thank you so much kate for that uh incredible overview of what we can look forward to today and uh with that i'm super excited to announce our first talk today and we're gonna have jonas and benedict talk about building the metaverse with ipfs so uh let's welcome both of them to stage and i'll let them take it from here eunice benedict welcome hi everyone let me share my screen i hope you can see it uh fantastic to be here i hope you're having a great time at build quest so far and today uh we will talk about in essentially the next 30 minutes about building the meter with ipf's i have benedict with me um who will then go a little bit more into the technical part um later on in the presentation we will cover essentially three things um give a quick overview of the metaverse and what we think the meteors will be then dive into it and from a technical side essentially looking at the components that are required to build a metaverse and then last really going into what it means to build a metaverse app and what kind of decisions you need to take during this process and at the end we will have some time for questions so please don't hesitate put the questions into the chat and we will go through later and answer them but let's get started let's let's look into the metaverse and i think metaverse the terminology is something everyone came across now right since they changed from facebook to meta it is in every media outlet someone is talking about it but for me personally the metaverse is essentially about virtual spaces which will fundamentally enable us as humans to experience the web or technology in a fundamentally new way that hasn't been deaf and the main reason why it is so different is that there will be some kind of sense of presence today when we interact with technology it's usually in a kind of two-dimensional way we sit at our um pcs or laptops and kind of interact in a two-dimensional way but with kind of the metaverse it will fundamentally change and we have kind of this three-dimensional space and that will unlock a lot of opportunities and values um it's not really comparable but i think with the launch of the first iphone and therefore touch screens being widely available it opened technology up to a wide audience and with the metaverse it will be even bigger and that's really exciting to me luckily we are just at the beginning but can already build on the experience of kind of the last 30 years or even longer because materials is nothing new and here i put on a slide that kind of started the first time with the internet but i think first signs of the meter was we've seen in games for example with dungeon and dragons in the 70s where you were in kind of some kind of virtual world and inactive with people but with essentially the internet this really took off and inspired first um author and i think everyone heard about neil stevenson with snow crash who coined the the term metaverse i think looking through the history um what was for me a very interesting introduction was um second life i think that was the first time where people were speaking about there's something living in a virtual world where people buy land interact get married and that was i think now looking back nearly 20 years something really new and sometimes i think even people were afraid of it right but um i think that has changed and then there's multiple events throughout right um we look at um 2011 with ready player one the novel that really introduced virtual reality to people and then facebook acquiring okolos i think that put a lot of additional attention on it and then i think the first time where we had vr er in the masses was with pokemon go that was really millions of people this ar and was some kind of game that kind of worked at least at the beginning and um i think that that got quite excited but it got quiet again um and then throughout something like fortnite i think um started as a game and then really involved in so some kind of metaphors what is i think quite exciting because we can learn a lot of how to get started and how to involve and then obviously now in the last couple of years the web 3 space a lot of things happening as well as big tech like microsoft facebook trying to push into space but as i said it's early right this still means there's still opportunity a lot of opportunity and a lot of challenges that we overcome need to overcome and if i look at it i think most people think about tech challenges but i think there's essentially six dimension where we see challenges for really making this meter verse vision a reality and first and foremost it's about content and experiences i think if you are now trying to experience virtual worlds what you will find quite quickly is there's sometimes not so much to do right so we really need uh enough experiences to have rich and and interactive words as well as meta with native experiences meaning experiences designed for the materials for people understanding what are the potentials because i think as with currently at the beginning we design things we know and haven't really understood what might be possible and to enable all of this obviously we need tools that enable builders and creators to focus on the kind of artistic and the creative process and enable them to build such experiences if you look at the technology side of things um here is obviously about software hardware if it comes to hardware uh we we just need to get better here right and i'm quite excited for 2022 2022. i think there's a lot of hardware coming our way with higher resolution higher refresh rate and if you have better hardware it means you can do more with your 3d engines to really create a more immersive experience and then i believe a very important point to really achieve mass adoption is um how does your avatar look like right the avatar will be your representation in the 3d world and this needs to be immersive and it needs to kind of allow you to express yourself and i think there's so much potential for us still to innovate and improve and then obviously uh things around um we need to establish standards and interoperability to kind of create this open method where people can change between platforms and are not logged in next to technology and that's something we shouldn't forget is things around privacy and identity giving that it is such an immersive part we need to be kind of responsible for what we're building so we need to think about tracking we need to really learn of what we've done over the last 20 years in the internet and kind of find a way how we can be responsible with data in a privacy preserving meta especially if it comes to storing data handling identity to really enable users to own it and to control it and then for all of that we need the right people to build right and i think that's super exciting bringing different um skills together designers developers but then content creators storytellers people who have experience in building events or artists so that's quite important to kind of build the workforce and the skills to to build out their metabolism and then if you've built a metaverse you need to think through and solve for governance kind of how are you finding a governance model that might be community driven where you find define the rules for the metaverse and then more even more important how to ensure safety of the users as well as how to think about moderation in terms of protecting the users and last and that will come slowly and we cannot get around this kind of regulation especially with metaverse getting bigger and there will be regulation and we need to figure out how to link the existing policy systems of countries for example with kind of a virtual world i think that's quite exciting and i think all challenges can be overcome and actually i believe all of this are opportunities for all of us to build and shape the materials of the future now um the meta versus reality today right we have examples and builders who are doing a lot of things and i have five examples with me um and then in kind of five areas where i think there's a lot of potential and that might be areas to kind of be worth by looking into obviously gaming that's most likely the one area for the meter verse where we have something like a sign of product market fit social um i think there we are already getting an understanding what could be possible productivity i think a lot of to discover well-being making sure we are kind of um fit or mindful etc and then obviously art i think is something that that blew up in the last year due to the whole nft space so if you think about gaming i think uh fortnite is a super interesting example for meter wars that grew out of game and then became a platform where people can enjoy have an incentive making have some kind of economy and then even more important have the ability to create own experiences and experience um live events and what's especially interesting about this design is that you're not just bringing together players you bring in enterprises like brands who are using that to launch new product and i think there's a lot of things that can be learned from fortnite and epi games how they designed it and um and i think it could be a good inspiration for others if you think about social i think one of the meta verses in the web 3 space that's been around for a long time is decentralized launched in 2015 and then the second launch now in 2020 um um where you can kind of come together in an immersive 3d world and interact with people um obviously it's anchored around buying land but i think there's a huge potential to have this kind of social interactions if you think about productivity for me a very interesting example is mozilla hubs where you really have 3d spaces where you can come together have an event share presentation and interact with people and i really would call out try it out it changes how our meeting is handled it's not like zoom so if we would do this event in a 3d space it would have a different hype and a different wipe to it well-being i think it's quite early there's for example supernatural who really built something around fitness to really have full body workouts with a fun part of being in a three-dimensional world the last example and i'm really excited about it is is mona mona is building beautiful spaces 3d spaces that you can use for example as a gallery for your amazing nft arts and i think that's a really great example how to bring together artists developers by building something beautiful but that's just a few examples there's so much more um and then something something we did recently is we launched a metavest landscape that is community driven built on top of ipfs where you can check out different projects and contribute if you have your own project or you came across so we can kind of grow it together and allow people to um kind of have a starting point for them to understand what is out there what technologies do we have what kind of projects we have because it's a continuous involving space now at the beginning i said the metaverse is something that is offering and will offer a completely new experience that is uh much more presence than what we have today and i think tim swenney the ceo of epic games it's a fantastic quote um kind of the callout he makes because the meta voice will be per person and through that um very powerful and we really need to think through what kind of decisions we take along when designing metaverse experience a metaverse because there's a lot of responsibilities with it because what we don't want is that there's one person controlling it because that will be like god and that is something we shouldn't do so um what we put here is a couple of things you should think through when designing a materials um i think there's there's much more points but for us we felt that's quite important um and it's that kind of designs decisions you need to take so if you think about a building right you really need to decide what kind of software you are building is it close is it open um what are you using um open standards is the property and that has obviously an implication of human device what i think is a very crucial decision here is everything around data and especially identity avatars do i control it as a platform or do i control it as a user and how am i governing my whole metaphors is it again central or is it more community driven and i really can call up would call out take these decisions explicit to make sure we're building the metaverse in a responsible way let's go into the technic part over to you benedict thank you so now when we dive into the more technical part we basically developed a framework to kind of reference the different components that we feel are important to build a meta version in order to structure this we see three broad layers so the first one on the top um is around everything related to the experiences um that you build so the actual meta versus um but then this is enabled by user capabilities that is everything that is let's say more user-centric so things like your avatar and capabilities that bridge over to the real world and then on the bottom layer we have everything that is infrastructure so different building blocks that we have in place today for the web um already um but that are also important to drive the meta versus of the future and i want to point two of these out especially it's fast gear replicated caches and the persistent shared storage where filecoin and ipfs can play a broad wall um and we will dive deeper into those into a minute what i just want to also highlight is that this framework is current thinking so we are still evolving it and jonas mentioned in the last section that we built this metavest landscape so this framework is part of this landscape and we evolve it as we come across more projects that are building in the metaverse and try to categorize these projects into the different components we see in this framework and this really helps us to drive the technology um understanding and the tech stacks of the future to build meta buses now if we go into gear replicated caching and the persistent storage um we basically see that for the um for the caching part ipfs really shines because you have a decentralized um infrastructure where the next node caching your data might be very close to you this is highly relevant for the metaverse because you don't want long loading times and then the assets around you pop up very slowly instead you want low latency and high throughput to deliver the assets to the actual users and then um yeah examples are assets in different forms so it's not only the 3d models but also um other things like um sounds and other information that build up the environment around you now if we go over to position persistent shared storage this is where firecoin really comes into play because uh the protocol of ficon basically incentivizes the long term storage of data that you put there and this is important for everything that needs to [Music] stay and has a longer life cycle in the metaverse you can think about nfts that you want to keep around long term but also other things that you might want to share over a longer time or intel where user interaction takes place okay now if we um think about what does it mean um in in terms of building your own metaverse we really wanted to take our research one step further and implement um basically a showcase so that we can validate um and yeah learn more and we're learning especially learn where the gaps are from a research perspective and our use case is basically in the well-being sector that jonas already also mentioned um and we are building essentially a meditation space so you can come together with multiple people and then start a guided meditation so um we set out to basically achieve three things here um the meditation should be guided and live it should be shareable with your friends and and then everybody is represented by their own avatars so that you have this aspect of expressiveness for each participant now to build this there is a six key decisions that you need to take on the technical side um and that i want to go through with you now so the first one is basically around the 3d engine that you use so what what do you use to make up the world around you and we basically chose a project that is run by mozilla called a-frame and we chose it because we wanted to use an open technology that is web-native to really lower the boundary for people to participate so you can basically send a link to somebody and they open it up in their browser they're already in our meditation space now alternatives that are viable to this would be game engines that are around today so notable examples because they are pretty big are unity and unreal the project that you just mentioned for example mona is building everything on unity so that is totally possible to build these metaverse bases with existing tooling and existing engines the next decision is on how to design the avatars and bring them into this experience we choose a project that is called ready player me it works essentially by taking a selfie of you and then from the selfie they generate a pretty realistic replication of yourself that is kind of stylized so you can really feel yeah that you have a little mini-me there and we were also able to integrate it pretty easily into our meditation obviously the other alternative would be that you bring your own avatar that you have custom designed by a 3d artist or you just use default avatars for everyone that you can choose from maybe but then again ready player me really drives this aspect or the goal that we have that you can express yourself in this meditation space already now the next decision is on identity and we chose metamask as it's one of the default options if it comes to web3 identity and wallets and basically gives you a frictionless experience so when you um join the meta meditation space you can activate your metamask and it will give you direct access locked in access and will be able to pull your personal overtime into the space based on your metamask login alternatives here would be social logins that we know today but as i mentioned we really wanted to have this a bit more open and decentralized so that's why we went with metamask on the compute side we chose a service that is called roku that basically is a cloud service comparable to the other big cloud services the reasoning here is that we wanted um to be able to operate it easily and alternatives would be to just deploy to a custom or dedicated server that you operate yourself or go with one of the other big cloud providers now storage here we have basically requirements to deliver and distribute the assets very quickly and this is where ipfs comes into play so ipvs as the decentralized storage network gives you this capability of gear replicating the assets around the globe but obviously you can also achieve this with let's say the cloud storage services that are in existence today um before our talk cake mentioned that there is different tooling to access ipfs today that is also pretty straightforward so you can program it as easily um as you would use a um existing cloud provider so notable mentioned cr estuary and web3.storage that we also used for this meditation experience and then last but not least is about the access we wanted to have it really open and fictionless for everyone who wants to check this meditation experience out so we basically chose to go with web browsers um the big icon alternative would be that you have a proprietary client that is specifically designed only for this one experience so think about something like fortnite or any other game or some app that you need to download to access the metaverse or the experience okay the next thing that is interesting is that in order to build a metaverse you need a different skill set compared to building a website so in addition to [Music] the website building skills you need 3d design and modeling skills and then some knowledge around the engines that place these into the 3d world you will want to have experience around sound design and audio because the space feels quite weird if you don't have any audio in there um and then on the more classic side you will also have um web development skills um most notably with javascript um to basically build all the logic and interactions um that is if you don't use an existing game engine that basically hides this um programming um for you so if you use something like unity this is kind of kind of hidden a bit but the way we chose to go with a frame you basically built this yourself in javascript then if you go with the same decision we did on identity that you want to have a web 3 enabled wallet you will need to understand the basic web 3 principles and then the identity provider for example metamask to basically access this world of decentralized identity and last but not least is the cloud or infrastructure part where you need to be able um yeah to deploy what you build um and this might also include solutions like ipfs so where you basically need them to learn additional services all right so if you're excited if you're excited about about the metaverse right don't hesitate to reach out be especially interested or kind of passionate about kind of identity avatars communication stories and caching but if there's anything else where you think we can help just just reach out and i think we have now um five minutes four questions you understand that was awesome thank you so much for uh kind of going through that and just kind of going into the technical side but also just kind of what's up coming uh for anybody who's kind of listening in the audience feel free to can ask for questions always going to be like a 30 or 40 second delay so we'll have to kind of manage that in the live stream but one obvious question we got at the beginning was um can people uh get a copy of these slides because they're super informative and they're requesting um to be able to read these on their own um so that's like the most obvious one yeah for sure um we can share that i guess we can distribute it on twitter or wire your platform yeah or it's like if there's a yeah if there's like a link that is publicly available we can just put that in the chat right after this you can send that to us anywhere and then um obviously and for all the people listening uh please follow unisonmandik.twitter and you'll see everything there too so easy easy ask um i think that the product kind of one other kind of question is uh in terms of just how you're seeing people uh built uh in this space especially you can as we look at gaming um are are largely are people largely sort of doing things where they're just porting existing things that they know and they're just making that more web three from the point of view of like hey it's just going to be retrieved from a non-centralized server or are you seeing more creative things being done whether it's new primitives or new kind of um just a new kind of game play being introduced that's uniquely enabled by crypto so how does that look like from your perspective and sort of what do you think that people should be spending more time on yeah so i think we are seeing both on the one hand we have a camp where people basically try to replicate what we did in the web two days kind of so first building the experiences um yeah basically um more for the web but then there's also the other camp that really rethink how you build um the whole experience so um new exp primitives that are very popular right now are nfts obviously and then everything revolves around those entities this includes all the assets that are in the game um this might include um avatars that you can unlock and certain other things and then obviously this is also true for the economic side where you have the native two native tokens of the different blockchains um to facilitate payment absolutely um and then sorry oh if i add to this um i think what is very apparent is that especially things where it's really tough to do if it comes to 3d having a 3d engine that's how we've been doing it for 30 years but that's obvious because there will be not a battery native engine overnight because epic games is building it for 25 years but i think on the more easy things where we are more established if it comes to metamask for example for identity or even for avatars there are more web3 solutions already out there but i think now at the beginning in 2022 and starting to build a meta was it's really about building together and not saying hey you are web 2 and i'm web 3. it's like let's join forces and shape the future together oh it says a perfect note um we're also at a time so any other questions that come in from the chat i'll be uh i'll uh be able to kind of reload them to you directly but thank you so much for kind of going through this presentation offer for the summit and uh this is super exciting thank you awesome thanks for having us all right with that we are ready for our next talk so i'm super excited to introduce omri david mateo and justin and they're going to be talking about new ideas for web3 gaming there's a lot more we can do here from web 2.5 side of things instead of going all in web 3. so uh without further ado let's welcome everybody here and i'll let them take it away everybody yes hi hi everyone um mateo here um i'm gonna be asking mostly questions so i'm gonna be mostly silent today um i'm uh i'm an investor investing with three uh gains and i've been uh involved in lots of web 2 projects before mostly in gaming as well but i think um again we want to hear from the other guys here and maybe we should start with a round of introductions and guys if you can just you know say who you are and what you're working on uh briefly then we can go deeper in the topic of the discussion i will call you out just so to avoid awkward sequence problems so david you're the first in in my strip so if you can start yeah thanks matteo nice to be here um yeah my name's david i run a company called playment here in the uk i'm a long time game native so i've been making games professionally now for 32 years so all sorts you know console pc free to play i've been in blockchain game space for about a year um the first game that we built is on the in the loot verse which is an ft collection most people will know and really enjoyed jumping in using our sort of game production capabilities but applying to a whole new area this fun crazy world of blockchain and web3 that's me i think thank you justin hey um yeah thanks for having me here my name is justin i work at xerox park we support innovations on top of ethereum then go beyond defy and uh on nfds so we are behind dark forest a bunch of new projects that are still unannounced and essentially we're trying to see we're building for a world where we get one trillion gas per second like if you think let's say like decentralized technology one and we actually have like very fast yet consistent and censorship resistant computers what can you actually build so we try to build for the future um and that led us down very interesting rabbit holes we can talk about later yeah i'm ready hi everyone uh great to be here thanks mateo and i work in the day to day as a lawyer i deal with crypto blockchain and so the use of blockchain you know within also interactive experiences such as the one that david and justin are working on and yeah great to be here great so um the the topic today is really um you know started from a discussion we had a few days ago right about um you know what are the real new ideas of webtree and what what can you do with it in gaming that is not considerable in what too and that's what really excites us all um maybe david can you talk a little bit about your experience you mentioned how you come you know with long experience in web 2 gaming um what when did you start when you decided to take this webster thing seriously at least professionally and why you know what are the most interesting ideas that really got you excited and attracted to it yeah i think it's um it's it's not obvious at first how this technology can be used in games i think everybody has a sort of eureka moment where they uh think of a how it can be applied to games and as i say i've been doing this for a while i remember big evolutionary changes in the games industry as we went from 2d to 3d or when we could connect people and place multiplayer over the internet or free-to-play business model it's another of those kind of technologies that once you start to understand what it can do it becomes very interesting i think we're still relatively early but um there's just so much opportunity so many new ideas that can come from blockchain technology i guess central to that is the digital ownership but of course if you can own something digitally then you have the right to sell it and if you have the right to sell it that you can potentially make a profit from it so you had a monetization aspect that hasn't really been there in games before interoperability i think is a another interesting new idea that we've successfully integrated into our um first game called the crypt and i think you know i would say that when i first first started looking at this and it was very easy to take web 2 games like like fortnite or league of legends and just sort of sprinkle nfts on top or add a token to it but i think that's a mistake i've made that mistake before we're moving from console to free to play just trying to adapt an existing game just trying to adapt that web 2 game to suddenly be web 3 isn't going to work i think you really have to burn everything back down to the ground and start again and so i think that's uh that's where we're starting and i think um we're in a really nice position as i think a lot of other people are on this call where we don't have to turn around an existing business we don't have to take our web to game company and turn it into something uh something else and i think not being encumbered by the fact that we have an existing game an existing culture and can throw ourselves into this from the off is a great advantage and anybody who doesn't you know that that's the advantage that people on this call have over people that are great at making games but just in the habit of making web 2 games that's super cool and and can you elaborate a little bit on loot right so you you mentioned how your first project is in the loop verse and what is the idea there that kind of is the most interesting to you and change the way you build games yeah well well first i mean loot when i first heard about i thought it was crazy idea the idea of starting with a game element and then building the game from that it's nothing that's ever been done before and at first i thought it was crazy what's the point in releasing a game item for a game that doesn't exist yet but then of course people start to build games and experiences around this loot nft as a primitive and so now if you own any dilute nft then there's a dozen things different things you can do with it and they all sort of all interoperate with each other so our game is relatively simple we take a loo nft and you can use it in out to battle our dungeons it's a pve game so if you have a loot nft then you can collaborate with other players to collectively try and defeat our dungeon and when our dungeon is defeated then anybody that was successful in raiding it ends up with one of our relics which is a prize so it's a pve on-chain cooperative game i think uh probably the first of its type it's been a lot of fun to make probably the simplest i uh games that i've ever made but also i think one of the most interesting uh it's been fun to make and you know we continue to evolve having at least now two chapters our second chapter went live yesterday nice and we can talk a bit more later but um justin um building on not on this topic of um interesting ideas that are really native to web3 can you talk a little bit more about dark forest and what is the real meaning of fully unchained gaming and what um how does it change the way you should think about game design yeah um i think this is why i'm gonna refuse to use web3 game as a term from now on because i think it's like it doesn't actually give much signal on what actually the thing is um and like one one sub category of of projects we're really interested in is where we we coin like crypto native games and and we have a bunch of rules for what a crypto native game is and but like the tldr is most games today that um i've been on top of like ethereum or ethereum like networks um have only the asset ownership on chain and then the game runs on like regular decent like centralized servers essentially um so that is interesting because it allows developers to have easy on-ramp off-ram and secondary markets because that's what blockchains have been really good at but it kind of defeats the purpose for a lot of stuff because if those centralized servers go down um those nfts are essentially useless pointers to things that can't do anything anymore so a very contrarian idea like a couple years ago i mean when we started dark forest was well what if you put the entire game on the chain like those the smart contracts you have are not just your c720 ones they're literally like game engines um they're you you could think of it as like the back end for a game so they only have the rules in the state of the game and then anyone can build a client that consumes those contracts and allow you to play and as as david was saying it's very counter-intuitive but it leads to a lot of very interesting downstream properties um but the thing you have to pay to be able to get all those downstream properties is that you're essentially dealing with a macintosh 512k as your back end like you just went back in time in 30 years when it comes to back and technology uh in exchange you get a lot of really neat things the first one is that the game lives forever and if you've been playing games strong enough you know that most multiplayer games just go down the servers get shut down they're never open source the community has to rebuild the servers from scratch and most of the time people can't play it anymore the interesting thing here is that because the game is unchained unless there's some sort of like admin function that destroys the game but even if there were people who can still form the contract and the data most of the time that admin function doesn't exist given your users pay for compute and storage as a company as a group as a creator you essentially put a piece like an artifact on the internet and then you don't have to take care of it anymore like node operators run the game for you miners make the users pay to change the state and it's just there so that's like the first thing that is really interesting essentially you build an entire fragile product so you don't have devops the game is up when developers run a lot of money um and then the other thing that you get from this is that the data is open it's client agnostic it's just like email you can use gmail outlook here if you build a game you can interact with the game the way you want and most of the time i mean david's game is is on chain um people probably use um like the playman front end i don't think anyone probably has built a new front end but they could they totally could build a new front end um and without first we saw this the best players started forking the front end and creating new one so to avoid fragmentation what we did is we added plug-ins so people could spawn up plug-ins in the official front-end itself it changed the way they want i think this idea is really powerful because it allows you to create fractal games what i mean by fractal game is like imagine a game that is so big in its span that depending on whether you're new or not you can go be anything from a little merchant to a politician and you can imagine that those types of players will use different interface maybe if you're a politician you are on the opponent of twitter just vote on proposals and look at the big real-time strategy maps and you just change stuff if you're a new player you just roam around and those different clients could be made by different companies but different like it's like chess like you don't have to buy your chessboard from hasbro you can buy it from anyone you want so this is like this really interesting property like clan agnosticity and of course the last one is composability because it's really hard to compose with games that only have their asset ownership on chain because you can move those things around but you can't build games with them whereas here you can build smart contracts that pretend to be players but if the protocol is good enough if it lets you call other contracts in the game you can do crazy stuff like imagine a massively multiplayer pokemon like game where any player can deploy a contract that plays for them when they're not there a contract that implements your strategy so now if anyone attacks you the contract can immediately reply and be like oh this is justin's ghost that is like playing on the chain and i don't even have to keep that up as a machine it's just like up by the node operators right so yeah i mean i could talk about this for like a really long time because there's a lot of stuff to cover but basically it unlocks an entire new category of experiences and you really have to completely change the way you think about designing those games and that's a really exciting opportunity today it's as david said it's not take all principles and just try to shift them and like sprinkle some stuff on top it's fundamentally rethink the way you design those games yeah no absolutely and i think being also more more in mindful and inclusive of the community that becomes part of the also developing uh uh our you know arm of your of your what you're trying to do but like we we can come back to that concept in a second i actually want to start ask omri the lawyer question right and and you know omri that we're talking to developers here so uh keep it simple for us but like um in in in a way what i'm trying to understand is um how do you make sense of all of these um new ideas new concepts just the ones that david and justin mentioned in a second ago um and what are the risks and opportunities that arise from from these ideas um so first i have something written down i need to read so please note that the following is not legal advice but it's a you know the typical disclaimer is a lawyer because you know when you work as a lawyer in this space you also need to rethink in a way your way of approaching the law and the regulation because it all becomes a sort of a risk-based assessment so um you know both david and justine gave amazing you know hooks and ground on which you can start and like going chronologically you know with what uh taking from what where david started with the concept of digital ownership so when you know first of all when you're dealing with distributed ledger with blockchain and nfts and tokens you really need to also think about what what do we mean by ownership and that's that plays an important role because of course you know although the media like to for example in the case of nft uh think that you know or attribute or call fts as jpeg nfts are not jpeg you know they're basically cryptographic assets which are packed to some form of content now the reason i'm saying this is because of course the kind of consideration justin and david mentioned involve cryptographic asset the use of cryptographic asset recorded on distributed ledger technology so what happened is effectively and what what has been very attractive in you know this kind of early iteration of play to earn is the fact that now you can extract value from the game so as a long time term you know gamer myself i've always been a bit frustrated with the fact that um i could not recoup any of my investment in terms of time finances and so on and so forth and i think what what's very interesting you know this particular technology is the ability to reward players from you know for their investments in a game but that also means that if you can extract value there are it's kind of a convergence right because entertainment is now not only converged with uh in an interactive element but also with an economy and that means that there are new risks coming up so for example anti-money laundering financial services gambling and you know a lot of times for game developer for game developers and studios this comes a bit as a surprise because of course the the the the way that the structure of the business the way the studios are structured is to you know go full on on the interactive element on the uh game design but they're not prepared to assess you know the kind of regulatory risk that might arise from that and you know like justin was saying and like david was saying as well in terms of you know you really need to rethink the design of the video game you also need to rethink the the way you structure a team and what concerns you might have and what concern you might not so if you look at for example um you know when we think about distributed ledger technology and making the most out of this web 3 opportunity or creating crypto native titles i think what's important to understand is that most products so far that have been successful have been you know a community centered or community empowered designs community empowered brands and and so the community really rested that stays at the heart and you know like david was mentioning it it's very revolutionary thinking about first releasing building an experience if you want on top of an asset that already exists out there but that means that you're effectively building an experience for a community um which which means from um you know it has an impact in terms of uh culture and so on and so forth but also in terms of intellectual property because you might be building an experience that incorporates intellectual property belonging to someone else and you really want to be careful you want to make sure that you are able to incorporate the intellectual property into your title and right now you know we haven't really heard much about uh lawsuits with respect to you know games that incorporate assets because it is commercially convenient it's almost like you know the case of people streaming on twitch without having a license it's kind of marketing but you know the more the more this kind of phenomena grows and the more you know there is start to be a strong economy behind it and wider user adoption this we could potentially become an issue so if you are developing a game like as a takeaway if you're developing a game around a particular class of assets or a group of nfts let's say or characters that make sure that you can do that make sure that for example if you're a developer if the license um you know states that there are commercial rights the commercial rights really belong to the player sorry to the collector not to the project itself so you would want to seek licenses from the collectors if the intellectual property on the other end is centralized then you would want to liaise with the project so you'd have to communicate with the project seek the necessary authorization and if the project is what is called cc0 or in the public domain which is often you know mixed with uh commercial rights which is wrong unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation within the community then that means that the intellectual property is open and i think that makes for a very very interesting case when it comes to um you know crypto native titles because it's hard to justify sometime the price that is attached to an nft let's say a collectible that doesn't really provide you commercial ownership over the image or the asset but the value still lies within the utility that can be built around the token because remember the nft for example would be we're talking about the cryptographic assets with the unique id on a database so it's not replicable with a certain piece of content attached so even if the even if the collector doesn't have commercial rights to the image you can still build utility and that means that you're incentivizing the adoption of the original nft whilst at the same time creating something that is culturally relevant so i think that's interesting and story i know that i lost a little bit myself speaking i'll be very quick on this next point um other considerations that come and we touched upon them you know it's anti-money laundering for example and you know you might have seen already on twitter it was you know um yoga lab and animoka have uh released uh say a new uh coming soon project requiring um well it's requiring people to want to join to uh provide proof of identities and proof of um residence and that's a big development within the space not a surprising one because when you're dealing with money transferring money transferring money is worth so nfts or things that you can trade freely then that elements come into play and it's something that you know shouldn't be dismissed because there are you know there could be severe consequences and finally you know if you are including any sort of um distribution of royalties or governance over a particular you know a company or how the company behave or how the studio behave please keep in mind you know there might be a risk on like from a financial services standpoint and of course gambling um is also very relevant so i don't want to put off anyone that's the problem that's your job right as a lawyer but like um i think that the first concept that you talked about a little bit of you know you should be when you build on someone else you know assets you should be aware of what you can do or not with those assets i think is important but also going back to what justin was saying and david is it's it also works the other way around right as you build in this new web you know web3 um ideas and you know fully chain and and interoperability you you should be more comfortable with others taking your work and doing stuff with it right and and it's it's potentially also you know difficult especially if you come from a long-term from web to to accept that and embrace that and unlock unleash the power of that so maybe david um starting from you and also justin how do you feel about that and how how do you so for example when you tapped into the loot community how did it work for you in the beginning how did you get involved and how do you feel about others potentially building on top of what you're doing yeah i'm going to start somewhere else which is uh alex the ceo of he was talking about this question came up where people heard he obviously in the axi game he sells land which is going to be used in gameplay functionality in the game and there was a situation where people were offering utility in their game for axi land and they were using it as a mechanism of attracting a set of players they said your land your axilan that's been provided by another company is good in our game and using it as a way of drawing an audience a very smart way and i think the question that was put to alex was you know isn't that frustration for you his point was no this is great i'm in the business of selling land axi land and now you're providing more utility the price is going to go up if you can use that land across a number of games and i think that's a very different way of thinking about interoperability i think ordinarily games companies would try and prevent that from happening because it it's pulling money away from the game but because in that case it was axi sky mavis that was selling that asset that nft then it was them that's still seeing the benefit from the uplift in the sale price so i think it i think it uh it gets thought about in a very different way and for us we've seen huge benefits of addressing the uh the luke community it's an addressable audience there's 8 000 og loop holders and there's mlute which is a wider set there's about you know 50 000 or something and it's an audience that's there and waiting for things to be built and and not only can we give those players something to do with their loot packs but also the things that they win from our game can be used in other people's games so you have this weird sort of the the whole being some greater than the sum of the parts and it's all considered part of the loop verse and there's people that will build narratives around what how all these games fit together and where it is in the timeline and there's really like hundreds of people all operating independently but at the same time sort of cohesively by exchanging each other's tokens nfts that kind of thing having functionality having utility of one nft in several games and that's you have this sort of criss-crossing of nfts and tokens throughout the loop verse so this is something that i've never seen in web 2 games in 32 years of making games never seen this stuff before and it sort of opens up a whole new set of ideas that's that's great and and justin also you're from your end obviously you're um you're excited about this and and will embrace it but like can you talk a little bit about what it means to not even control or own your own front end potentially right and others just messing with it and just and where do you feel ownership if if you need to uh and where do you build the value for you and your company um yeah i mean there's a really easy way out this is you don't build value i mean this is not the answer i'm going to give because which is and i i allow that answer as well obviously but you know if you can elaborate on that i mean yeah i appreciate it but yeah yeah well first i have um i have a like a follow-up to um rxc having len that is used by other games one thing that i found find really interesting is that even in that relationship there is a relationship of power from sky mavis to ever use their assets downstream because there are ways for them to just change the price change in dynamics and stuff like that and one could not imagine a very big game studio building on top of xc land like it makes no sense economically like you should just rebuild it from scratch and that just again leads to fragmentation so i think that one idea that is very interesting is how do you build a shared state that becomes there's this really good blog post by the founder of zora about hyperstructure and how do you build like a shared state that becomes a hyper structure hyperstructures are admin less essentially they're owned by no one and so more loot and even the original contract after the keys have been burned is essentially it's a hyper structure because there's no relationship of power between whoever owns the more loot contract and uh claimant because nobody owns the more loot contract so it's just like think of it i like to think of it like lovecraftian gods you know like looming over us they just exist there is no way for us to like do anything about them they're just there um and so how can we build bigger games that are not just like simple assets that are administ because then you don't have relationships of power anymore and one can imagine very big studios building up above them because they have no fear of um whoever owns the thing to stop giving them access because there is no one that owns it and the code is verifiable so i really want to go more towards this this this this this universe where um we have massive world that is better admin less and i think we're not going to be there anytime soon but that's probably where things are going to go to because one like just with the history of ethereum and cryptocurrencies in general is that there are coordination mechanisms that incentivize positive some games and positive some games always end up winning like you can't have a competitive game that wins against a positive some ecosystem and so similarly with ethereum like ethereum doesn't have an admin uh like vitalik doesn't have a master node even if it's like a well-known myth uh and so in the end ethereum is a company that sells block space anyone can buy block space from ethereum using eth and that's it like there is no board of shareholders uh apart from the core devs and the courthouse essentially the only thing they have is legitimacy right so i'm really interested in this and i think we still haven't seen it because the problem is um most people still think in terms of like word building with assets like if you build a beautiful world with assets and stuff like that of course it's going to come from a company because how the hell do you pay a thousand artists to do this which is why we can talk about this later again but i want to go more towards the idea of physics defining a world that is just rules no content because a word that is just rules allow people to build content of it without an admin just like in this word this rock was dead there was nothing on it people came and built stuff and there was no admin key nobody needs to get like a certificate from god that tells them they can build a house right you can just do it and so the really interesting thing here is that if you build a world that just has physics i think we're going to see massive players collaborating on top of it and but by players i mean like um players in the market so like big studios collaborating on top of it because they don't have to keep each other in check because they know that the other people can't like stop giving them access to it and this is the same thing with the with with emails google and microsoft and whichever megacorp can co-exist together because the email protocol has no admin they can all build their products on top of it so i'm really trying to figure out what the right structure for this like uh rules-only word would look like and i think we it when it would be there would be obvious and i think we're going towards that that's that's very exciting and i guess hombre has maybe some risks and concerns about that yeah no i think it's very i think it's very interesting um concept i think it has to do you know going back to the hyper structure if you want ethereum is a hyper structure like it depends like at what level you want it so you want to pass it so if you look for example at um you know creating effectively what i understand a set of rules like by you know like physics like justin mentioned you know you're you're moving away like what we discussed in terms of content you're moving it away you're shifting it from the you know the entity that is creating this um physics and you're placing it on to people that are still or studios that are still creating the you know the content that then goes and leverages that that physics so it's more of a shift i think and but that's beautiful i'm not against it i think that's actually the key and akin this um you know starts in a way with with what you said mateo at the beginning you know this point is there needs to be and there is already a shift in in culture in how we understand intellectual property for example because intellectual property has been used traditionally to exclude others and ip is a negative right now this is really important because it means that it doesn't entitle you to make an income ip only entitles you to stop other from using a particular piece of of property that belongs to you so if you think about it traditionally we've been accustomed to monetizing intellectual property by giving permission to either to use it or otherwise to selling that right to someone else now when the problem with ip is enforcement because when you're meeting scale it becomes really really hard to enforce that right so and you see it for example at the beginning of the of you know when you look at the internet when you look at the early 2000s the music industry was destroyed almost by illegal downloading because you know it's one thing is for example you mateo you know use a piece of property that belongs to me without my authorization i can come and sue you but when you know when you have two million people that are using your piece of intellectual property you know without my authorization it becomes a whole lot harder to put the genie back in the bottle so i think that that's the key really from the perspective of you know an ip lawyer if you want the that the three that's where the value lies to me in in blockchain because suddenly you don't have to do that suddenly you can incentivize you can provide incentives to adopting the original rather than you know relying on deterrent like for example you know lawsuits and so on and so forth and if you look at uh there is a starking example i invite you all you know to really go and look at this uh kat simard and cat is a photographer and when she had you know at the picture it's called freya why the project and when um she had a problem with this picture because everyone was using it without her authorization and by everyone i also mean companies that companies you know everywhere without their authorization and you know once the gene is out you can't put it back so what you did was brilliant um created an nft with that picture that's deemed original because you know it has provenance you can you can certify that it's that it's that particular token and then she sold it and on on the sale which by the way sold for 300 000 on the sale the copyright just opened up and that goes to shows that you know intellectual property right nowadays is important i think to identify uh the the legitimate you know ownership or legitimate honor of a particular work like to reward you know the effort that goes into it and the creativity that goes into it but you don't have to rely so heavily on enforcement because you can create you know um assets or you can create words and you can incentivize adoption actually incentivizing adoption brings up the value of the asset you want people to use it you want people to to you know go out there and create a lot of amazing work around it because you're creating something that is culturally relevant interest goes up you know awareness goes up and you're able to if you want if you want to monetize and uh first of all you're always able to claim um you know authorship over that because it's certified you're the author but also if you're monetizing through it you'd benefit from secondary market sales you know because you can get royalty through through smart control governing the asset and so on and so forth so i think this is really important because again i i really i really do hope that this future that justin talks about it comes you know sooner rather than later because i think that the creativity has been stifled a little bit uh recently because of this need to you know exclude other and sue each other whereas you know there is a commercial drive which is incredible you know through collaboration so i think that that's an interesting point in my opinion yeah i was going to jump in a little bit on that and say that when i talk to people about interoperability in games and you guys must have had this as well i think people that have made games for a long time automatically jump to this idea can i take something that i own in fortnight and move it to pubg and then they start to think about the game production reasons why that might be difficult but i don't think that's how this interoperability is really going to work i think moving something from one web to going to another web 2 game or uh even a web 3 game i think it's more starting with a central item or an item where you know as justin describes better than me somebody that's thrown away the keys i think that often people approach this interoperability in the wrong way and even now i'm not sure that we can we've got any sense of what its final form is but it won't be just taking something that somebody has built from one game and try and re-represent it in somewhere else yeah i mean it makes no sense what's what's a ferrari in world of warcraft like just it's just stupid like this question like i don't understand why people over index on this so much um like interoperability is a synchronous program program like synchronous calls between different computer like programs and i think one thing that is very obvious is that you cannot have items that move from one game to another if there is no sort of like energy conservation because like the problem is then the really easy attack is i create a game and i'm like i'm gonna create extremely powerful dragons in my game because i can i just like wrote down the rules and then i bring those extremely powerful dragons into world of warcraft and i'm god and so the problem then is if if you don't have any sort of energy conservation mechanisms then what you do is you make it um permission like you make it permission basically you're like well we have a dao with tokens that votes on who can bring games to whatever and that just doesn't work because it just takes a lot of time and also like even if you have permission someone to do something doesn't mean that their code is frozen now because if you're then permissioned then if you have a tiny problem where like the economy is slightly off then you're gonna have like problems all over the place and we've solved those problems already i mean not us god or whoever created physics did it and we have energy conservation laws and they work really well and again in computer science people have been working on this for decades um like category theory and service part of those problems and stuff like that so you can just come up and say well we really don't have to design games like the way we did it before what we have to do instead is just like you have to stop thinking in terms of content like the if you want to build games that are like email where people can build on top and connect with each other the idea of having a game developer like thinking for an afternoon snapping their finger and bringing up a new sword of infinity that has like plus 30 damage that's not gonna happen anymore because it doesn't make any sense like this is it is completely arbitrary and it will obviously break some rules that already exist and we'll have deep dd repercussions downstream because the more systems you have connected with each other the more non-linear your your actions become essentially the more complicated it is to predict what's going to happen right so i think we really need to think in terms of protocols and rules and and physics and energy conservation and like bitcoin did it really easily with the 21 million cap like bitcoin is what is it's a function that turns entropy like computational power into it like a an asset that caps at 21 million with like an exponential dk in terms of like its issuance and it works really well it's like very basic physics that still she came up with and it has been working for like 10 years now so i think we need to do the same thing with games but the problem is if you're a game designer that has been in the industry for a long time it's extremely frustrating because now you can't just do whatever you want you have to go back to work on very simple rules and see what happens there so yeah and and that gives me a lot of hope because i i look at a lot of the people that have been in the industry for a long time and i'm i i doubt they'll be able to like reinvent themselves so for like young kids like me i'm like oh like it's okay like we came up with the right with the right ideas and it's gonna be all right but i'm really excited for people's like i like for for mines to shift here and and that's gonna be really exciting if yeah if i can add to that matteo if i just can't share in a moment on that point i think it's really interesting because um i think the part of the problem of you know now we're kind of um criticizing pretty heavily the the game design philosophy and i think the part of that and you know i agree with you justin i think that a content right now reigns king and it's because content is what you could commercially you know leverage and you couldn't leverage mechanics because game mechanics are not protectable for example under ip so if you came up with some super clever game mechanics well someone else could copy it so that and you know it's not deemed as a copy so i think that that's and you know with with you know using distributed the blockchain um you can get a reward for that you there are other ways to benefit from that and i think that that's really important uh you know from a court from a commercial standpoint because at the end of the day studios still need to make you know some form of income and this is an eco there has to be some form of economy you know and also another thing i want to say about you know revolves around decentralization so and this is just something to keep in mind when you're developing a game and the assumption how far you go with the assumption is you know we think that okay you create a smart contract you deploy it out there that's it it's decentralized that it doesn't have anything to do with me but you know the concept of d5 is really really complex from a regulatory perspective because um the regulator sometimes regulators around the world could still pinpoint response liability to you now how that will show up in terms of you know crypto native games to be honest i'm not sure the most basic form in terms of you know d5 is when let's say you you start a project let's say like some from a staking mechanism of some kind or just you know smart contract that has some form of governance and reward you know provide rewards based on contribution or so the problem with that is that once it's out if you still retain as a project or as the person that has developed it you know a substantial amount of tokens then although the smart contract operates independently from you you still created it and you are still benefiting from it economically that could create a tie i'm not saying that if that happens you're automatically liable i'm just saying you know keep in mind that sometimes we might be you know um we might get in the frame of mind that you know if it's decentralized i'm not liable anymore just just be mindful of that it's uh yeah it's something that makes sense i would be i'm not curious to do some research and check if the inventors of the email protocols have ever been attacked for spams because you know they created the email protocol and spams this downstream effect of email and so that would be an interesting thing to look at um but it did not benefit from it which is like a fundamental difference i'd say and i think it's very remote so it's almost like if you're creating the smart contract if you have bad actors that start to overload the smart contract i don't think you'd be liable for that i i'm talking more about you know if the smart contract for example incentivizes what would otherwise be deemed as a gambling activity or as a financial service then you know that's the kind of scope you might want to be careful with because you'd still be deemed to benefit greatly from it if you know the value of the token goes up and you have like a good result i agree yeah sorry yeah a contract that has admin access is not decentralized it is decentralized compute but it is not decentralized at all like for something to be a hyper structure it has to be admin less so and so we're going to enter actually a new era of like financialization and like ways to monetize projects where the main like research subject would be how do you monetize hyper structures uh and that's going to be really interesting because as the creator of an admin less protocol how do you make money out of it and like my i have one playbook for this that i'm ready to share to everybody for free and it's the gmail playbook essentially you create a hyperstructure and then you create an extremely good close-sourced client on top of the eye hyper structure basically like well we deployed this protocol as i mean less but because we know the protocol so well we ended up building an extremely good client at the point and we still access to it that's that's one playbook there are many of them but i think it is possible and and it is very much akin to the open source way of financing like big open source project read this and stuff like that which had to like find in superstores databases and of course they got mega screwed by aws because of their licenses but in the end i think that here we can learn from the mistakes of open source projects that had a hard time making money and see if there are ways to shift the incentives slightly and i would add something that is not to incentivize anyone to go down the road but uh you know in my opinion true decentralization um happens in the lack of humanity in a way like you need anonymity like that's why for example bitcoin could be one of the only example of true decentralization because there is no entity to attack there is no one that can i'm not incentivizing anyone to do that because it has very bad repercussion it's gonna you know it can be really damaging for you but um yeah i think that unfortunately the the human involvement like part of you know having having a human involvement it's kind of you know the the point of a compromise within a system and it's always been you know i think this technology limits it guys i i have a one final question for david and justin but i want to also reserve time for for questions from the crowd so if you have more time i will ask it otherwise um i i was shut monitoring the the chat i think there is a there are a couple of questions kartik did you um see anything um i think yeah there's one i would love yeah there's one that came in that kind of follows up to something just said but uh i think you can continue with yours and then i can come in so i think we have only for a few minutes so maybe let's let's make sure we cover that and then i can ask the final questions if you have time left um so so yeah so um by the way this has been an incredible discussion i've been hearing about this in the background here but uh the question kind of comes in from um a sort of adjacent follow-up to one of the points that was made earlier and the question is about how do you uh think about frameworks for managing projects especially as these are largely being proposed to be built and decentralized where everybody can kind of come in um how should somebody look at leadership and hierarchy in that sense and how should we think about just some any suggested rules to like understand how do you make decisions efficiently um do you have does anybody have any any kind of comments or frameworks around that and that's kind of the intent of that question [Music] oh yeah yeah yours is going to be more interesting it's 30 seconds i think that protocols can be designed in a committee so you need to keep the team extremely small when you design core protocols and as soon as there can be paralyzed tracks where there is no right answer and different ways to approach something then it becomes much easier to get the community involved but i think it's extremely hard to design a protocol with a lot of people and know like i recommend everybody to read this essay called the tyranny of structuralnessness which is about the fact that like if you have no structure there is actual structure is just hidden and so it just becomes politics so that's really really tricky and so for protocols what we're doing is we stick to extremely small teams mine just equally quickly is uh that it's so embryonic at this stage that just do things quickly get it out there let the numbers speak for themselves i've really found i i've always felt this that sometimes people are guilty of making games more complex than they need to be and sometimes something quite simple and interesting and new can be just as engaging so i would say yeah do something cool that seems interesting that you can do quite quickly and then measure it the great thing about everything being on chain is that you it's an analytics because everything is there that can be queried so a couple of tips from me yeah and it is actually already kind of something that mobile free to play gaming brought to the industry right compared to the previous um that's right decade but uh it's even more powerful here um kartik is there any other question yes one more follow-up to the yeah structures is uh just if nobody technically owns um a hyperstructure here what are good ways to think about monetizing it yeah i think i mean justin talked about the fact that you can if you align yourself closely with a popular client in the same way as gmail monetizes through ads even though it's it's on a hyperstructure of email if i understood justin's point correctly i mean also in in the case of our loot game just to give us some context then sure we took somebody else's nft that was there for everybody to use and we can do different things like we could you could charge to raid one of our dungeons with that loot nft and also you could say if we in the case of ours we uh players can win an nft and we take a a some money from the secondary sales of that five percent on the secondary sales so actually there's quite a few different points where i think even if you're using elements to in the public domain and and a hyper structure there's still ways in which you can monetize it yeah um i think we are out of the time that was assigned to us so i don't know um to end it here if uh yeah i mean the next thoughts feel free to yeah i'm actually maybe just on one part and talk like a question for me for for everyone here in the panel is um you know you actually david you you recently started a new student web 3 but it's been a year what a year now but if you you know people that are listening that you know thinking about starting a new um studio to do something in the space and and kind of embrace some of the ideas we talked about what is the first thing you would um recommend people to think about to prioritize as i said at the top of this call right the main thing is do not be drawn you know so often i see people in joining the games industry because they love a certain kind of game and they end up doing the same game as all the games that came before it if you're new to this part of the games industry and you don't have a game company that you that you need to convert this is a perfect start whatever you do don't do a game that looks like a thousand games that we've seen before instead go down into the weird end where justin lives and find out some of these really cool this is where the value is going to be created this is the interesting new part of the games industry don't go backwards go forwards justin oh i mean yeah be more weird um also don't think too much about venture capital that's like my psa here there are so many brands so many ways to just have a bunch of money a tiny amount to be able to live and do stuff the problem is venture capital puts a stealing on how interesting a project can be because it puts you in a box um and it's always okay to decide later on to raise venture capital but again like the county theorem would not have been what they are had they raised venture capital right so and it doesn't like you don't need the aspiration to build something that is as big and as legendary but i think it's always interesting as an exercise to first spend six months a year think about this without the box of venture capital and maybe use it later because like capital is so cheap these days we live in a very special place and time the generosity of people is through the roof especially with crypto stuff because you have so many people that became rich overnight and now they're like oh yeah let's just find a bunch of stuff so use this and be more weird and experiment with more stuff i'm really maybe a parting thought that is not scary yeah no absolutely so uh going you know kind of surfing this way with david and justin started about being weird and thinking out of the box also you know we've been talking about games about physics and so on and so forth but you know ultimately this one as we said is a technological convergence and i invite everyone to think outside of the lines and not necessarily develop an experience that is within a screen you know immersive technologies are advancing very quickly and i think the word can literally be your pl your playground and that can have a very very strong implications and imagine you know like justin was saying god or some entity created the laws of physique so go and interfere with those um so i mean don't promise anyone they can fly but you know like i think be weird and experiment but also not just in the traditional way of how we think about a video game or an interactive experience this this can go a lot more you know a lot it's a lot more powerful in my opinion than i don't want to say just the game because i love games but life is an mmo can be an mmo it's about translating data it's about empowering people to communicate uh to to you know find joy in little things and i think that's such an important aspect um of you know design and maybe i say that because i'm not a game designer but that's a product that as a collector and as a gamer i would love to see that's why we love you because you're not just a lawyer so thanks for that well uh omri justin david thank you so much for that amazing discussion and mateo thank you so much for facility and facilitating that amazing conversation uh we don't have any more questions from the audience but the only common comment is they wish this chat could have been a bit longer because there's so many interesting things being talked about so we'll have to do a round two here in the future but uh with that thanks so much and uh we're uh we're getting ready we're ready for the next talk thank you all right thank you everyone bye-bye thanks bye-bye buddy so up next i want to bring on sid and sis going to talk about randomness in web3 and gaming so dram is a really interesting initiative here um and i can't wait for all of you to also learn more about how you can use true randomness in your metaverse application so without further ado let's welcome sid he said um you are uh hi good greetings everyone i hope again you can hear me and i'm going to share my screen shortly we can i hope you are able to see the slides everything is good all right awesome hey uh thanks thanks for thanks for joining us i'm really uh really privileged to be here uh talking about why randomness is actually important in web3 and particularly in in in gaming uh so i'm myself i'm just a quick introduction for myself i'm sid i i work for protocol labs and we are part of a group of researchers and engineering people who are trying to build decentralized systems decentralized protocols and offer them our services to the to the to the general public dram is one of the protocols that we that we operate as a public utility and i would like to talk to you more about why um yd-rand is is essentially a very important and critical uh part of the of of web 3. so just a quick quick motivational slide on on why randomness is is effectively ubiquitous it's it perpetuates everything but we don't seem to be talking about it explicitly so let's let's understand why um we need to have fairness uh in in generating good randomness why all applications that are going are working in a decentralized manner need good run around in this so just to give you a quick broader view of why we need randomness and just and to get them set the motivation in context a lot of the protocols and crypto cryptography primitives actually rely on uh unfair and verifiable bias resistant randomness which cannot actually be influenced or be tampered by by anybody in a network so ideally things like leader elections in proof-of-stake blockchains for example filecoin or even though you know sharding even in the gospel in gossiping protocols randomly choosing peers in the network to actually disseminate disseminate information all of those things need to be done in a in a in a fair manner and no one particular entity should be able to influence the outcome so to speak so um i think it's pretty obvious that uh when you have uh things like zkp's uh zero knowledge proofs and and um and diffie-hellman's exchanges happening in in the various cryptographic schemes they all make use of a very i would say a bias resistant and unpredictable seed uh that gives them the confidence that yes there cannot be any tamper tampering going on with the actual method used to generate the random the random value so to speak so um similarly it goes into goes beyond web3 and obviously goes into into medicine trials and stuff like that so randomness essentially is everywhere and we want to make sure that we are leveraging the same good properties or good of fair good random randomness in web 3 great gaming as well so for example uh and i don't i don't want to dive too much into it because i i assume the audience here is are already experts in games but uh for both input and output randomness that we actually use to create a more dynamic and a more engaging um gaming experience uh it actually relies on trusted arbiters of of randomness where the where there is true unpredictability which means that you you you can you can vouch for the source the run in the source itself that it is truly unpredictable uh if if the if the audience if the if the if the gamers uh start realizing that some of these outcomes are actually can we either be biased or either can be predicted uh then it it obviously erodes trust right and that's not good at all the other place where we actually see especially in web 3 is the area of dynamic nfts which actually unlocks significant monetary value in the network so to speak and is is essentially uh i think the key differentiator for web3 gaming so to speak from the traditional web 2 gaming where uh the the sheer the vastness of the of nfts and the way they can be used to represent a variety of digital assets um it can be made a lot more dynamic uh within the games outside the games based on fair randomness which means that i can i can alter the the colors the rarity the animations and whatnot uh for of the nfts based on some some pretty sound and fair random source randomness source right so similarly for lotteries and loot boxes i mean i think it goes without saying that uh in order to create rewards for users folks for sticky monetization and gamification you definitely need to have a way to verify publicly verify that the source of randomness was actually uh truly random so uh why do we need good randomness i think i think i've touched upon this but there have been many cases in the past where lotteries were actually rigged several millions of dollars worth of value was actually eroded from the network businesses obviously even went completely off the grid um and and then there's just a general um uh i think a sense of distrust amongst the community saying that okay we we don't really trust these guys we don't really trust a centralized provider or we don't trust a particular provider so web 3 is all about decentralization and that's the one of the key uh primitives that drag has actually used to ensure that we are decentralized from day one so i'm going to quickly uh touch upon the need for a dependable randomness service for the internet the internet fundamentally needs a dependable randomness service and this should fairly ideally be available to anybody out on the internet and at the moment we start associating specific incentives for someone to provide this randomness it becomes a little bit tricky to be able to say that hey here is a network that is truly um unbiased this is truly um formed of a set of people who don't who are not really trying to trying to game the system so to speak so like we have the dns protocol we have ntp we have we have pki infrastructure we all of these are fundamental foundational building blocks for the internet uh and we've believed that randomness is similar to ntp similar to dns and a very fundamental building block of the internet especially definitely web 3. um so yeah so what are the key properties of a randomness service that you would like to offer to the internet right uh in the decentralized web specifically we need the properties of being unpredictable of being bias resistant of providing public verification so every single random value should actually be it would be should be verifiable using public apis it should be decentralized that means there's actually a network of of active parties who have come together to generate the randomness and then of course this randomness service should be highly available it should never go down just like ndp it should always be always be there for you so here is where dram comes in and these are all the primitives that were the design principles for for dram and uh so basically drag is essentially uh an open source software it's a it's a project on github please check it out uh and it's built in golang and is run by a set of independent nodes run by a set of independent organizations which i'm going to come get to very shortly and uh we actually offer uh a public randomness beacon service using the threshold cryptography concept in which we actually uh do a distributed distributed key generation process where we actually make sure that there is at least a threshold of uh of more than half of the nodes in the network that actually are have have gone through the key sharing process and is actually based on the g2 curve g2 method of the bls pairing curve same as e2 and it essentially binds together independent entropy sources so there are multiple each each each entity in the network each operator in in the network has their own method of generating their own entropy they don't run the randomness and drain essentially binds them together uh into one publicly verifiable value so to speak and additional sources of randomness can easily be added because if there's another operator who wants to join the network and they have their own let's say they were they use lava lamps in the data center to generate uh randomness they can join the network absolutely and we actually have an ongoing process to actually onboard new operators into into the network and of course it's a production grade service is tested audited and globally deployed and of course we have made sure that this is accessible using uh http through the through cdns and things like that so you can simply do a http api that's available we also provide uh gossip sub or lib p2p for for publish subscribe sort of uh a consumption model so to speak uh but simplicity was there was essentially the one of the key principles here so um i probably will not have a lot of time to go into the details of how drain works essentially there's a setup phase at the beginning where we do a distributed key generation ceremony and before generating the random values the the nodes actually perform a ceremony to agree on the threshold as to how many what is in the minimum number of nodes in the network that need to be that need to participate in order to generate randomness for example if i have 23 nodes i need at least 12 nodes as a threshold to be able to participate in the randomness generation process so to speak and then of course they also have to agree in in the period or the frequency at which this actually is going to be done so the current dna network operates at a 30 second frequency and of course we are working on a multi-frequency network we can actually support lower frequencies that's coming in the future very shortly but each node generates the keys from the preferred randomness source like i said lava lamps cha-cha protocol you know seismic seismic infra data whatever it could be and they all uh generate their own keys from the preferred randomness source and create their own signatures and the second part is essentially to generate the act to once you have created your partial signatures you actually then add every epoch each node broadcasts their partial signature to the rest of the nodes in the network each node waits and collects to capture these signatures from at least the threshold number of nodes in the network to match the threshold parameter and this node can then create the final signature so and of course we provide a randomness verification api which is nothing but a bls uh signature that can be verified again and again by the by the by the nodes in the network and that's how we actually service uh verification requests so uh so diran uh i'll probably skip this in the interest of time but essentially it's a chain uh right now and we are also working on an unchained implementation to actually implement things like time lock encryption uh which will actually help us help a lot in in preventing front-running attacks and stuff like that so that's some exciting stuff coming on dram very shortly uh so yeah so durian beacon as a foundational internet protocol decentralized bias resistant unpredictable and perfectly verifiable and as of to march 2022 we actually have we have 15 independent organizations who have who are currently part of the dram network and we have completed more than 1.7 million rounds of randomness with zero downtime in the last one and a half years thanks to having a decentralized network so this is this network of operators is known as the league of entropy and we're very proud of the fact that we we have a pretty broad selection of participants uh from the web 2 world from the february world uh from universities from for-profit organizations we have ethereum foundation cloudflare epfl protocol labs university of chile ucl so a pretty vast and diverse selection of participants um so you can actually check it out more in the uh on our website so uh it's probably skipped a few slides here yeah so essentially dram is basically a three tier architecture in which we have at the core we have the drag nodes essentially which which distribute which actually share their the random values to a more public network which is a dram relays both hdp relays and gossip sub relays which then actually broadcast or distribute the random random values to a to the outside world while ensuring that the drain nodes are part of a secure private network which cannot be uh accessed from the outside and the design clients so especially the ones who are actually running lip p2p or gossip sub they themselves can act as a distribution point for an ungroundedness as well so it's a it's a pretty uh significant fan out model so to speak um and of course i i don't really have to talk i already spoke about uh the production reading network uh what we have so uh ddos resistance availability continuous monitoring is a prometheus and stuff like that so that's all so those that's all built in uh of course and and most importantly we actually have a governance model in which we actually want to have a set of participants as large and diverse as possible uh and they all have the different interests different incentives but this is actually a pro bono service which we believe we are going to evolve this into a into more of a i would say a community driven public uh utility and good so to speak and we would definitely appreciate a lot of interest from from people who want to build this as a and support this as a protocol and another protocol for the internet uh that'd be awesome um yeah so uh sorry um just one last thing was about the some of the examples of dram consumers that we have so file coin obviously being uh one of the largest users and the first users of dram which actually use an off chain secure source of randomness that cannot be influenced by the minor communities so to speak of any particular blockchain so they actually picked derand as the most secure option for for randomness and use it for multiple use cases including leader election for consensus and so on so forth but the most important aspect was the public verifiability the unpredictability and the bias resistant properties of of the rand and of course the dram randomness can actually be used as a as a seed which can actually be verified in in vrf based or verifiable random functions based leader election we also have other use cases such as decentralized lottery systems such as lotera who are also creating the tier and smart contract which can actually enable consumption of drain across multiple um smart contract systems so drag having both a beacon as well as a verified very verifiable verifiable functionality built into it can be can be consumed directly by by smart contracts as well so yeah um uh i think i might be at time so i'm going to uh essentially see if uh if there are any questions or anything in particular uh you would like to to answer today i was gonna say we have a good ten minutes so i think you're gonna cover something more we do that and i can point any questions in the meantime and for people who are listening if you have any questions for said or about just how randomness works please feel free to put them in the chat and i'll relay them here yeah i think one of the key things i would i would say is that um sorry actually i mean i went through i want to make sure that we cover off as many things as possible but the some of the more important most important things is this is that durant is a threshold cryptography network which means that randomness can be is one of the outputs that we are looking at that we produce today but this network can actually be leveraged for many other purposes especially in smart contract applications so the roadmap for durant is pretty exciting and the properties of having a threshold network does make it uh i would say uh highly relevant and i would say a bit more unique out there to serve as a as a solid protocol randomness protocol for the internet in general uh and that's why we are we are looking at the league of entropy as an example as a collaborative project and having productionized that we are running that for more than half and a half years without i mean without zero downtime literally so it kind of proves out the fact that decentralized uh networks can actually work and decentralized networks if they have the right composition if they have the right participants it can actually add significant amount of value for the internet in general and and threshold networks are are something that uh we would like to uh leverage a lot more in many many use cases especially around the in the smart contract space as well so so file coin obviously uh being one of the one of the key users and there are several other users as well but uh they believe that uh this is also this also helps with the scaling story so that which means that you don't need to have your own on-chain source of randomness which kind of uh uh prevents you from actually uh scaling scaling your your your blockchain based system uh beyond what you evolve you believe was possible so having uh having a more secure network-based uh uh threshold network-based uh source of randomness is is key um and we actually have have uh uh essentially opened applications from many more um interested parties out there who would like to join and and help us grow and build the network further uh so i'll start kind of jumping in with a couple questions too uh one thing that um i have a slightly missing context from the chat is uh you talked about a verification um or a check earlier in the slide and uh i don't know where that reference was specifically but the question was like what is the check for so i know this is vague but if you know what i'm referring to then i think that's probably one question that's from the audience yeah so so essentially the the signatures themselves are based on the vls uh signature model so the so the value is basically a hash of the signature so um i think i i think i mentioned this uh over here somewhere so uh so yeah so the signatures formula form a chain so the final signature is is a regular bls uh signature that can be verified by the rest of the nodes in the network so uh each each node when it collects the signatures from each of the different nodes they actually the final signature is basically a regular um bls uh hash essentially so uh the you along with the along with the random value you also receive a receiver hash which you can actually use to check back for any particular randomness round that you receive you can actually generate a hash of that particular bls signature and see if it actually matches what you were originally provided so um that's the sort of a verification that's kind of built into the to the protocol itself and that's available as part of every epoch that you that you every value that you get as a as part of every epoch and i can definitely point to the i think that the documentation has much more details about the specifics in there but uh it's kind of baked into the the way the hashes are generated and provided as part of every round of randomness that we that we share out there amazing well hopefully ego that answered your question there the the two questions that uh we have here are one just kind of maybe we do have a bit of time so i know you can have sort of uh skipped a little bit of uh stuff around how degrand itself works uh so maybe like we can just sort of get an understanding of how the randomness actually verified and generated um that's one and the second question is uh which is related to this is sort of what does it mean to uh improve this over time like how do you measure that this is uh like is this like a done deal is this is fully figured out and we don't need to do anything here like how do you improve this thing over time and what can be actually improved at it or just leverage more as this becomes better and more used [Music] right okay so yeah so i think this is actually a very um it's actually quite simple to be very honest where as part of the uh the key generation ceremony hang on i think uh yeah as part of the key generation ceremony each of them each of the participants actually have to agree on certain threshold values uh for for which means that out of the total number of n nodes in the network uh for let's say we have 23 nodes participating in the network uh like i mentioned we have 15 independent organizations we are running 23 nodes so we need to have at least a an n by two more than half of the nodes in the network should be actually participating and available to us to share the signal partial signatures but in order to form this particular initial group that's the that's the dkg process the dynamic dynamic key generation process where each of the uh a leader in the network will actually start the process and then each of the nodes will actually agree through the by exchanging um by changing the messages between themselves and of course based on the allow list we have an allow list of based on ip addresses of what or which nodes are going to participate potentially and once those nodes come up and execute the certain commands of the drive network they actually then decide to determine through a pre-configured values in which you supply in when you start the demons saying that we are going to start with a threshold of let's say 12. if you have 23 total number of nodes i need to have at least 12 which are participating and the frequency at which we are going to be sharing these signatures so to speak so there's an initial setup process the the using based on the dkg or the distributed key generation process and each each node then generates the keys from their own preferred run and running their source and shares that and uses that to uh to sign the messages which are then uh shared by every other node in the network to agree on on membership so to speak and once membership is actually established for them for a particular group we then move to the generation of the random random values themselves so at every epoch the each node is then going to generate or broadcast their partial signature to the rest of the network and each node then waits to to uh collect the partial signatures from each of the other nodes that are participating in the network uh which is the threshold t so to speak or let's say in a in a network of 23 nodes at least 12 nodes so uh each node will have to we will have to gather partial image signatures from 11 other nodes and then say okay i have received all of these all of these signatures i can now use the drag protocol to generate one final one final signature so to speak um so that's the so so that signature is what we actually uh uh send out as the actual uh what you call uh the random value so to speak and the and because um the the final signature is a regular bls signature it can actually be verified using the using the the the hash of that of the bls signature can i can actually be used to uh to verify that yes the the value that was advertised can be recreated again essentially so the final value is basically a hash of the signature the final signature and that's what is used for the verification as well for the verification you can create a hash of that and make sure that the random value that you received matches the hash of the bls signature so that's built-in verification so to speak um and the other part i think the question was um the other part of the question was uh more about where is this going so to speak so this is actually we are taking this to a space where we are not going to be relying on chaining so right now d-rand is a chain system where if you want to get a random value for a particular epoch you need to specify the the signature for the previous round and uh we believe that removing this particular mechanism so unchaining the dram protocol so to speak will actually improve our our ability to actually build in things like temporal signatures which means that i can actually encrypt a message further into the future which can only be decrypted at a particular point in time t in the future things like front-running attacks and mev and those things can become essentially become possible and the other aspect is that because this is actually a threshold network uh if you don't really have to depend on the previous uh signature to uh to essentially know hey i'm actually getting the right um uh random values or not because this is actually part of the end of the fundamental nature of the threshold signatures is that you don't really want to grind on the previous values and essentially if there's actually a more than 50 attack there could potentially be a grinding happening where uh the uh a brute using brute force um an attacker can actually try out many different previous values to essentially predict the future value so you're breaking that in the future going forward you're going to remove that chaining mechanism which unlocks us uh to to obviously uh have a better security model so to speak and also be able to implement front running you know temporal signatures and things more much more advanced capabilities but yes we are actually adding more and more operators to the network um and this is actually a community driven process where the existing members of the league of entropy actually vote on the applications that we receive because we want to make sure that there is there it's it's in good faith good interest and nobody and there is no real financial or some other incentive behind being part of the network and of course we are also exploring mechanisms such as dao's uh decentralized autonomous organization model and other mechanisms to have a public funding or a public goods funding model associated with brand as well but the intent is to operate this as a protocol for the internet not to say that you you need to spend you know uh 28th to get to get a random value so that's not the point the point is to make it easily accessible just like we have dns and ntp on the internet today now this is a good example of a utility that actually benefits off of uh being a public infrastructure so this is incredible and thanks for sharing uh like kind of what the future looks like this is actually yeah just being able to reduce that dependency on the last round is it's going to be huge awesome yeah so i think i might die but uh all right time so i said thank you so much for this and uh hope everybody got their questions answered as well and if there's any requests for uh seeing these slides i'll i'll reach out to you and i share this with the rest of the team on the chat or the audience on the chat awesome thank you very much really appreciate it amazing and with that we are ready for our next panel so the next panel is going to be about plato art um and just overplay fun so we're going to talk about just kind of what's happening in this space and what everybody should be looking out for and should be excited about uh and for this panel we're going to have constantine bc darrell paul at penn joining us so without further ado i'd like to welcome all of them here and uh i'll let them introduce themselves and take it from here welcome everybody all right thanks a lot martha um hello everyone uh welcome to build quest and today's little panel play to earn is it real or should we play for fun thank you so much for joining us it is so good to have you all with us today so my name is pian again or pansy i'm a final coin developer advocate and your host today we are honored to have with us our guest uh paul gady of op games daryl lim from metal pals constantine contract of protocol labs and busy of basic beasts so welcome to everyone with daryl bc constantine paul really stoked to have you all with us here today thank you ben glad to be here looking forward to the discussion thank you great so a little introduction for our panelists today um paul is a co-founder and ceo of op games so he's been kind of like in the game design scene since the 2000s and he's been exploring emerging technologies and how to combine them with gameplay so he's like a veteran here ob games is also part of berkeley blockchain accelerator open web collective and outlier avengers base camp it's pretty awesome constantine um calls himself a startup operator um humbly with that but he's been an artist and technologist with like impressive background in civil engineering um for instance he has won the spacex hyperloop competition prior to joining protocol labs um he's my colleague and he's currently focusing on various nft applications specializing in solutions like benefit of storage and onboarding developers onto the web3 world that's pretty impressive constantine we have to talk more about that competition later thank you and hailey from europe is bz our mysterious founder and developer of the upcoming play to earn nfc project basic beasts which by the way started out as a fun project between him and his little brother um but has since accumulated thousands of community members um that's that's really awesome and really impressive also basic beast is our file coin grantee and we're really proud of being the opportunity to actually back them up so bc it's really impressive what you've done so far thank you ken and i'm happy to be here and last but not least daryl uh is the co-founder of metapals um he is and his team are working on a very cool nfp project that i truly love um it lets you adopt nfc creatures and have them live right in your browser which kind of reminded me of the early virtual creatures i used to have on my desktop very back um that's that's really cute and really innovative um meta pals are also a final point grantee and a part of techstar accelerator so congratulations daryl and that's alexey hey thank you man all right guys so before we just head off and get right into the fray here um for people who are listening right now we are doing a final coin swag giveaway to all of you who are listening so during the panel i'll be kind of announcing quick challenges along the way and

to any panelist of your choice here um if we have some time um probably in the last 10 or 15 minutes we'll address your questions when we can alright guys so again happy to be here happy to be hosting you guys um so it seems like if the metroverse is you know the word of the year 2022. um play to earth isn't far behind especially in gaming world many are looking at p2e games to disrupt not just gaming but the creator economy as well you know where you saw influential game is streamers earning like massive stream of income from what they do right it kind of enables a new kind of wealth per se for the new generation like you don't really have to find work anymore all you have to do is just kind of um you know just stay in your couch or day and just play a game then you can earn like income really that's that's a pretty awesome thing and in fact a lot of like newer generations are actually doing that um well on the other hand you know the other side of the table seems to think play to earn is like some kind of this um giant scheme where you know average gamers can't really earn anything without investing what they don't have initially right um i know there's a sentence this sentence play for fun in today's topic um but i really want to focus on the poor and the economy of play to earn since i think playing for fun and also earning something is kind of like a no-brainer for most of the gamers anyway um so why not right so let's talk about like the serious things that might be useful to um game builders who are listening on right now uh so paul can you please do the honor and educate me about what state to earn really is uh why am i hearing this everywhere i go in the gaming world and you know if op games are kind of like doing anything in this space oh yeah thank you fan and yeah i think i can start with of course discussing the term play to earn right and and maybe a bit of the history also how that happened i would say uh it's largely because of course the permissionless nature of the blockchain and uh and the token standards that came about right so when erc20 the token standard uh came about and then of course nfps um game developers saw that uh that now they can create their own currency create their own virtual items and tie that together to a market economy right so that naturally led to games having a way for people to earn from from getting these virtual items so of course you've seen apps infinity which is the the the current uh biggest example of pay-to-earn people earn play by getting these nfps by initially in this model purchasing them from the market right and then using them to earn a token uh for example slp and then using that token and and trading them on the open market to get fia so so now as you mentioned uh in the philippines people are playing axe infinity and using that to earn so and during the time of uh of axis peak i would say just last year right like the slp reached very high valuations so a lot of people in the philippines were were really using that as their job and a lot of uh a lot of guilds sprung up as well people organizing to to play these games and and yeah and we we i guess this was something that we we kind of saw would happen just because of the nature of virtual items and and i'm happy to talk about virtual items also in uh further on but one thing to notice one thing to say is at opi games we are looking at play to earn but one thing we realize is um plato earn is is just the earliest iteration right because because of the technology what we want really game developers to explore with us is is now we have all these tools we have we have ethereum we have any kind of blockchain and now you can build economies outside of what we currently know like a lot of game developers have started building games for in-app purchases and now i would say that mo a lot of the uh economic models of focus around ads uh and and that's something i think that we should uh actively push back on right we've now been trapped in these uh in this older game design models and now we have all these tools that we can use and yeah so that's that's what we're building at opi games we want uh game developers to uh know about smart smart contracts build their own entities build their own tokens and explore game design because this is a very exciting space for us and i think yeah i think this is just the start that sounds all great and it's great that you mention um axi infinity and you know the players from the philippines um because one thing that i really want to mention here is the high barrier to entry for general populations to some of the play touring games of course especially um axi infinity being on ethereum where the market and the gas prices are pretty extreme um so like for for for to my understanding um of course actually infinity has been enormously successful um but it's also been kind of challenging to onboard new users as far as i know you know they have like something along the lines of two million monthly users um but given the time they have been in the market they could have done much better um i think is it because you know like the new entrance to axi universe you know you you must first acquire like i don't know three or four axes before you can even start playing the game and you know that on any given day you are looking at a minimum of like three hundred dollars right to start getting to axi and play something from from where i was born that's kind of like a month's worth of salary of income if not higher for for a lot of people so this i think kind of makes it hard for new players from other lower wage countries uh should participate in play to earn in the first place so what do you think we can do or are they um alternatives to help the rest of the world to to get on board and try out the play to earn games yeah maybe i can i can do a bit of introduction or there or just talk a little bit about it and pass it off or to the other panelists but i agree pan i think that's one thing that i i personally don't like about that model is that because of that high barrier to entry what we've seen with most of these play-to-earn games is there's now like uh i guess a stratification of users right there's the manager which is the owner and there's the player which is the which is the or the scholar which is the the person playing the game and earning currency for it and uh as i mentioned earlier i think this is the first iteration right honestly i think the the mod axi was designed during the time of cryptokitties right where the the model was uh you breed uh nfts and they create uh another nft out of that and so i don't think the the economy was designed at the start to to to really be scalable to this extent so now apps is trying to uh map sky map is trying to fix that right and i think they they at least have the i guess the experience to to be able to do so um but i think something that we should really start thinking about is sei is we don't need to rely on these models that we we that we relied on before like it was built on the nf on the cryptokitties model right and now that uh now that we're building new things i think you play to earn developers uh should look at uh different models right how do we how do we not rely on that initial uh barrier to entry and there might be things to learn from free to play for example um maybe there's ways for uh for that initial ownership to be subsidized by someone else in free to play it's by the ads right um but here you know without we have a lot of other stakeholders that we can rely on so so and yeah and there's a lot of economics uh economists looking at paper as well so we we need to learn from them and look at what's worked in other ecosystems so so so yeah i do agree that there there's this model that makes it hard for people to come in that's stifled that's infinity's growth i agree also and if someone can solve that problem and able to to scale bigger right and then they'll be able and they'll be able to possibly build something more sustainable so we haven't found that yet honestly i think i haven't seen that good game that does that so maybe anyone in the panel has seen one i'd be curious to know also or or have some ideas about it yeah guys what what do you think about this um feel free to join in yeah maybe i can jump shortly in also coming more from a gaming experience here than building nft solutions for games i really would love to see more of the content inside the game where i think you're completely right that play to earn was like the initial version of it or that was just an exploration at that time but what a lot a lot of projects are lacking in my in my personal feeling is the actual game content that is behind the nfts and this economic system so we can always talk about the web 2 examples of for example world of warcraft even though you have to pay for it you have to pay for subscription it really gives you the enormous amount of content which is not anyhow connected to the economics and people find themselves using a lot of a lot of different things without the need to actually uh pay for each and every step or pay for each and every combination and that's what i feel should be coming more to the field right now as there is a lot of attraction there is a lot of effort and developers time we need to see more of or we love we would love to see more of the actual gameplay which is coming in together with the nfts but not just the economics which drives people to be in there but then if it drops then there is no people anymore in this group yeah i like to kind of add it on that right because um you know gaming should should be all about the gameplay experience i think it's like the fundamentals of why you're ever playing a game i mean i don't call myself a professional gamer but i probably played enough games you know in my you know growing uh you know adolescent years you know and you know in teenager and adulthood from games such as you know neopets tub hotel runescape you know to you know playing you know common you know games that we know today um you know such as you know uh world warcraft diablo the thing about what makes these games awesome you know even games with like really good economy such as eve online is that the gameplay experience is really awesome right and to be honest people don't i mean the thing is that gold farming um exists for a really really long time right and that is the very essence of what we call play to earn the only difference here is that we were able to unlock uh the value in terms of where players are able to to basically you know cash out the in-game currencies um um to basically you know crypto and basically to fiat right that's the only difference because um back during those days if you have played games like maplestory even runescape you probably even have a hotel you'll probably wreck your brains into the black market as a kid and try to figure out you know how to cash out on these these you know in-game currencies itself right but the thing is that um the games are actually fun and i don't really see that i think that's something what i like about the space as well where there's so much room for innovation because there's just isn't you know enough games out there that's coming with new models right everybody's calling himself plea to earn uh but the thing is that if your game uh you know your unique selling proposition lies on the very fact they can make money off it it's not really a strong proposition at the end of the day because technically anyone and everyone can kind of do that and so i think um as as you know game developers ourselves we have to in fact that's something that we prioritize number one and that is don't think about the economics first right that's the second priority but the number of priority is that you know how how you know from a game from a gamer perspective but what is the experience they're gonna have is it going to be fun is it going to be engaging you know are they going to have in our sense you know emotional connections because you know my my perspective game is tamagotchi right and i see that as something revolutionary because it basically you know captivated you know the the asian market and of course they're slowly influencing the west um through husbandry which is literally taking care of something uh basically 24 7 if not it's going to die that's game right but we managed to capture the essence of it right it's literally a game where you're talking of a pet that's gonna die that's it there's no there's nothing in there right but the thing is you know that that emotional connection kind of get people inside and and and i think emotion catches what bring gamers together and so i'm one of those gamers where i like to play halo right and i want those uh a person that would try to save as much npc as i can of my of my fellow u.s if not gonna restart the campaign all over again right i don't know why but it's just how i played right so so i think you know yeah that's something where i focus on which is you know the gameplay experience and it's you can't ever discount that the earnings should not become the main component of it and also the side of earning becoming the main component side effect is that there are a lot of unlawful members that try to join the team you mentioned bots there is a lot of mining happening and this ruins the experience for the actual gamer base which you will have naturally and i feel that a good example of that is also from the web to the diablo which you mentioned diablo 3 was initially with an opportunity to cash out for the items you looted and then it was really flooded with the market and they had to actually cancel this feature out in order to normalize the environment so i would love to be in the game for the actual gameplay and not only thinking oh this is my job now i have to like farm this thing for eight hours and hope that i can sell it afterwards or nothing happened for me at all and instead of that i really want to have this ecosystem of players which a could find something they enjoy doing uh maybe that's farming maybe that's pvp anything which like a gameplay kind of content but i can actually interact with people and find the ecosystem where people do different things but they all are surrounded around the gaming component not the earning component that would be the the the future i believe of any game and as well the industry development yeah and i guess that's one thing to add there really quickly i think that's what uh the game designers who are looking at it pretty deeply are starting to understand like uh like people are trying to move away from play play to earn for example and moving to play and earn right because they realize that building something just solely for earning is is really unsustainable there has to be a there has to be some form of burn some form of utility for the token and or or there should be people who are really just there to to to have fun right so they don't have any expectation of return so yeah so the moment that everyone is there for earning then it's it's really hard to balance something out in terms of economics i i totally agree i totally agree bc you have something to say yeah sure um so i of course agree with the like the the panelists and uh i would say that well the reason i guess that we haven't seen really enjoyable play to earn game yet like not because actually infinity isn't enjoyable for some people um well it's because we just had a beer market like before 2021 like like for the last three four years i believe so if you think about how much it actually costs to make a triple a game because like god's unchained cost five million dollars right it's also like a place to earn game uh they have immutable hobbics have done quite well in creating a nice experience and like seamless experience and then we have fortnite that cost like 50 million dollars it's very difficult to like get a game studio in a beer market to start building a triple a game like that especially because no proof of concept had really been proven yet up until like x infinity started growing so much yeah and at the same time we only have like 50 like 50 000 smart contract developers so if we think about the larger scale well this hurt around 13 million full-time developers something like that there's also like a competency a competency problem like we need to like on board with two developers somehow either through making sure they do they don't even need to write smart contracts or they need to like start learning so we have those issues and then well then there's the scaling issues if we look at actually infinity's data because we mentioned that well these according to actually infinity did like their players spend five to ten times like more time on the game because they earn from it like they that's for some people it's how they provide food so you just have a massive amount of more concurrent users which also like overloads their database and stuff like that and they have to prioritize like fixing those things instead of like maybe like the game experience right and why do they have to prioritize that with the team well that's because people are not able to provide food for the families in some places if yeah if they can't get in um so i think yeah we probably just need to be patient with the market and like uh i'm i think what we will see is going to be very interesting is that the most interesting place to earn game probably won't come from like the big companies like uh fortnite uh unreal engine and i believe it's probably going to be like smaller mid-sized companies like game studios because like if they innovate as the limit for big companies like the smaller companies are much more likely to go all in with nfts like they will have less monopolistic tendencies and they'll be more likely to share our profits with the communities um and yeah i guess the value of place your earning is like there's this guarantee there's you guarantee that your asset is tradable you guarantee that there's scarcity and yeah you won't even have to like trust the developers just a coach make sure of this so yeah um guys i'm glad you guys brought up the fun in gaming here so it seems like we have uh ourselves a bunch of uh gamer nerds here um so yeah yeah i was trying to steer away from the fun and then i was brought back to find a game which is like totally awesome um you know i i think since billions have been playing for fun only in you know it since pong from atari in the 70s right so i think like in in my perspective i think in real life you can't really be that successful of a gamer if you only think about the financial yield first like i don't think it's possible in any in any venture not just in gaming but like in startup as well you guys are like building startups and stuff like that all right like i'm sure you guys know that of course like profit and like the business model and you know just getting margins everything like that those are important things but you know what actually kind of leads you into building a business or startup is the fun of actually doing it right so that is the only thing that can make you guys successful actually like you know at one time okay you have to make it a profit adult business but you know most of all it's just the fun of like building something or or for that matters in in playing something and achieving something in a game right so like my point here is that you know i meant i have fun playing games and when i got like really good i wish i could i wish i could earn something from that too because oh my gosh i'm at the age that i have to think about um going to college and you know i'm in high school and then my parents are actually forcing me to study and get like the right degree and and all all that sort of things like if you know if there's a career or there's like a future that i could you know i can earn from actually just playing games or nothing else like be this this this child forever i know i think that would be pretty awesome don't you think i guess one thing to add there as you were talking about that i'm reminded of this talk by brooks brown from uh i guess he has a company invested in by delphi digital he mentioned uh as a great example dota like dota has a big prize pool right and when people when the champions win though there uh they and they have a lot of money right uh they they don't stop playing dota the the moment that they win the international like the next day they're all online playing the game again and he he described it that like there's this magic circle of gameplay where in dota this is a pure game right they're there playing it and uh and the financialization aspect is in a different circle they don't think about that so so yeah so you're very right like uh like one thing that will make you top of your game i would say is is really really uh really having fun right really enjoying that process really learning really competing with others in in the top of the game right so so yeah so that's that's very true i'm totally in line with you paul here as i'm personally playing it and i can say for sure that the financial part well there is no financial part in dota at all and it doesn't stop you from enjoying it but i also see the point from japan where you want to have some more careers in gaming or gaming becoming the fundamentals of your life not only from the perspective of getting fun but also getting uh the development of your career or development of your uh financial status and here i would definitely strive for looking into the balance between those like i'm getting fun i'm getting the rest and i'm getting the work those things may be aligned in some games and i can totally see that some pro gamers exactly do it for that on some streamers uh i'm on this side i'm only a little bit in the controversy because of there is also an example of sports where in order to earn with sport you really have to go to the championships international tournaments all of that but if you're like casually doing sports it's also mainly for fun or for health or both in this case but you don't really earn from that and i would assume that for sports to start earning it's even higher threshold than it is for gaming but that's my personal feeling about it and i feel that generally a lot of uh controversy about earning games is actually coming right now from web 2 companies like ubisoft who tries to bring nfts but do it in such a bad way that basically no one wants it and right now they still dominate the market we cannot deny that and i i totally in line with steam or gabe newell in that perspective that they don't want to deal with uh nfts or like crypto stuff just because there are so many bad actors i definitely here for fun and if someone is taking care of that being naturally been in again and i'm totally with it but if it's something which adds additional problems stress then maybe that's a good discussion if something like that has to be in game on the first place but if you can also earn from making fun that's definitely a no-brainer i would say everyone wants that it's just oh give me that if you find an example yeah um i still remember the time when i was i was i was younger and um i was like doing nothing but just like you know just immersed in this this game boy that i just had and it's like so much that my father had to kind of locked it in in a locker to to just kind of like preventing me from just playing this game like 24 7. and then um i still managed to um sort of like to to loot it out you know whenever my father when my dad was not around i would just kind of like i noticed that where he put away the keys and would just like you know stole the key and then just unlock the locker get the game out and just play and then when you know i saw him like coming back which is like put everything back in place like really uh in a minute or something so yeah i i feel like you know if i could if i could just be that boy who just kept playing um just like professional athletes right they just kept playing on right they never had to give up um what they love because they know that you know you know it's it's a bet so it's a it's it's a big bet but if you're really good a good athlete you could you could make a decent living in the future right and that kind of that kind of norm is like something that i wish like you know play to earn can actually like change the arena here you know i i think you're right pan in some ways um i mean okay we suffered to start with the truth for the matter is there's two billion gamers two billion of us right in this world does it make sense that all two billion people on earth started making money off of games and not do what they've been doing in a day job no it's just not realistically possible right or well only if you can replace the the conventional job exactly exactly you know live in time of peace and prosperity um but you know it's not gonna happen you know with the current technology or moving right now right so but at the same time i think what you say is kind of true that if you're really good i think the key word is that you're good to find where you're professional gamer then you kind of deserve um to be you know earning that amount right to basically make yourself a decent um living because the truth of the matter is will everyone who comes on board a game be making big bucks no right because number one you have to be really good at it and two it's just simple economics right there's just it can't be you know simply equal distribution of wealth from the game itself right because then everybody will be earning peanuts and that kind of defeats the whole purpose of making money off the game itself and let's be honest here some of us here or i would say most of us we play games uh all kinds of games from kyogre games mmorpg simply because we would like to connect with friends or you know reminisce of childhood right and that's why um even for me till now you know even though i'm i'm you know a business professional i still try to slip 30 minutes in in that week to go play you know games that reminds me of my channel right but that's just because you know it's it's it's me it's it's kind of like what i do for recreation but you know you don't have to kind of you know be gaming 24 7. that's not how life works but i totally agree man like for the ones um you know who wants to earn a decent living because they're professional gamers they're good gamers i truly believe that you know blockchain basically you know open up and create more value from that because now you know they're not they can't you know not just be earning from sponsors which is a really the main you know um revenue stream of been absent urban ads but you know way more you know right now to the the very um game mechanics themselves so i think you know there's some i would say you know uh value to that but i think we have to recognize the fact that not everyone can kind of be you know um those kind of users or individuals that be making kind of money it's just simply not sustainable and just not for everyone yeah great point here um so before we continue here i totally forgot i totally got carried away and forgot all about the challenges so sorry guys um we'll take a quick few seconds break here and you know drop in a challenge here if you guys want to participate just just type the correct answer in the chat all right so here goes the challenge and i see that storage is a free api gateway for nfc builders to quickly upload their game assets and mix the data onto iprs and filecoin network without all the fuzz so that's nft.storage the challenge is what is the mascot of nft storage what is the mascot offender tdot storage so first um it's a corgi it's a dog it's a puppy second second it's a smiling geometrical shape it's just a smiley shape all right and the last choice here the last choice here it is a honeybee all right the first the first is a dog a corgi the second is a smiley all right just a smiley shake and then the last choice the last choice is a honeybee all right if you get the answer first you just type in the chat and then we'll contact you and then we'll just send away the free swag it's pretty awesome the final coin free swag is like pretty cool you you don't want to miss that at all um trust me all right getting right back in the discussion wow like time really flies right now we have just 10 minutes right here so bz um asked an upstart game developer how are you seeing your nfc project evolving into a full play to earn platform um and you know what has to be done in order to move there from the current stage you're in i mean i i imagine nft are just a character gateway uh for for uh play to earn game but the game itself is like a totally different app and it can take years to develop and launch like what's your take on this like what's your plan what's your roadmap um to bring basic beats into um this like full-fledged play to earn arena like especially i i've heard that like some a person one of your users have built like a fight simulator for your basic piece i mean that's pretty awesome like do do you want to merge that into your company or you want to just is that your plan yeah yeah so that's pretty funny it's true that the one of the community members made a battle simulator and i was super surprised about it and it's funny the way that also that the community are like yeah pushing certain things to the game right and and that's i don't think you will normally see that on like in traditional uh communities uh whereas like where free people really have a sense of ownership of the entities and really want to like contribute in some way and they also really incentivize for it due to like the economy like tying the community together right so as for the road map um since i don't plan for basic bees to just like ask a bunch of investors hey would you want to like give us 50 million dollars and like let's try this out um so the way i prefer it right now is that that will like work on a really great experience on the browser like because that's what i'm able to manage right now in building that experience and figuring out like exactly okay the technology aspects also like we basic beast is our pro blockchain and we use something called fcl to connect with the blockchain and interact with this or smart contracts well in order to create a beta experience than what we see in traditional games they like with the place to earn stuff the best experience would be that they can play and they are able inside of the game to trade their assets that they don't have to use wallets all that those stuff like just like what they're used to like normal emails like click on the press a button that's it and they don't need to know anything about seed phrases so technology technology wise we like still have some time there to develop so right now it's like figuring out the experience how can we make something fun a collectibles game on the browser uh like from a website and then yeah i start to like be like spending many next years to see well how could we build a mobile app and how could we probably work with these gatekeepers which is apple and google who can at any time shut down your app because they change the rules right and so just like risk from that but yeah that's uh yeah that's what we've been planning and uh yeah regarding the battle simulator yes it's pretty fun and it's something that like from the one that we have been thinking about that's why we have skills on our nfc's right the media data there and that's one uh our community member based it off so it is something that i do plan to like see in the future after i've built some other stuff in the roadmap yeah and that's that's awesome dj i really love the example here of uh community building stuff within the game i think that's where exactly a lot of games were lacking right now and that's a huge opportunity also for investing into your community i mean yeah the game at some point of time arrived from an add-on map from the warcraft free and lots of lots of things if they are developed by the community if people are given the opportunity to build inside the game that's where the true value created and if you can also support the developers inside the game that would be an outstanding opportunity for a game to develop for the game developers to develop and this is kind of like self self maintaining mechanism i would say so exactly that's like that's a whole new like like dimension that we are entering there like that anyone is able to attack with the blockchain the nft is right uh we'll probably see many more modders of gamers like and private servers where the game studio well the the instances are live because people will use the nfts more than like when people get bored of a certain game and go to a private server well the the game studio don't see a penny of that but if anyone is able to just like build on top of your game well it won't like this incentives are aligned and people are probably also much more likely to spend more money on their virtual assets because of that like that fact it's the same thing as the very very popular chess auto butlers here right now everywhere like but i i doubt that the initial idea creator or developer of it is any earning anything from that so that would be lovely to like and for ensure that the community is developing with the play to earn not earning from developing with the community not only just by playing yeah definitely all right guys um time time does really fly actually like i still have tons of questions really to to bombard you guys like it's such a shame like i was given just this amount of time to to hang out with you guys um oh man it's so sad here um yeah and anyways um paul dz daryl um you know asked the you know let's say just the um participant in this this this gaming play to a gaming world and especially you know beezy and daryl you you are the elements of a hackathon not different from this build quest and you know you kind of like grill your your project from a hackathon um how would you guys go about giving some advice to the builders who are listening on here um you know mario who might be just starting out building their first web free games um yeah i mean is there anything along the way you want to like briefly give the advice before they they they hack away on their their their game journey yeah maybe i can start man um i i guess i have a short list here but i think one of the first things is to to really do be creative uh i don't think we need to rely on the the older models that we've seen and played to earn and even web do right if you build a game uh using the old model of flip to kitties as i mentioned it's probably not going to be sustainable so so be creative learn from the things that people are doing there are some interesting projects out there that are also aren't aren't purely games but also on defined learn learn from b5 learn how things are built together understand finance and build a game that really leans on the strength of web 3 i would say we now have the tools that allow us to to use economics in our games and to really involve the community as constantine and bc said so so let's focus on that build these games we don't need triple a mmos we need these two kinds of games these new kinds of community based games so so yeah so build that with us uh make it open source build it on ethereum build it on all of these other chains easy daryl so i would say yeah build it on ethereum offload blockchain like because that's uh there there are some major differences and especially if you're a small team and yeah of course you you have to like decide which blockchain you want to use we prefer to use the field blockchain because of asset security and scalable like scalability and also the current gas problem for the users right um and because we saw nba topshop was able to do it like it's like yeah a really great nft project so i would recommend people to join like if people from descentology ipfs like like flow like their discord because what you see in web 3 that you might be surprised if you're like from work 2 is that people in rip free are pro for some reason like whatever reason it is like much more likely to help you with like answering your questions yeah they are much more engaged i was so surprised and we're not like going to work to discord and like ask for like like a problem no one answers actually whereas the i don't know why but you just get a much higher response rate on in rep free so really join the communities like many people are happy to help you and i think it has something to to do with the incentives in this space yeah awesome so um we are at time we're learning a little bit over but i want to thank everybody here for uh kind of doing this amazing chat and it's still a handful of questions that we didn't even get to from from the audience so uh maybe if a few of you can just kind of join the chat on global.tv and just answer them uh over the chat they'll be awesome some of those outstanding questions can be answered there but paul constantine daryl and bc thank you so much for uh being on our panelists and thank you so much for moderating uh this chat and i'll also let you decide who won uh the prize for the for the swag so feel free to declare that on the chat as well thank you so much thank you everyone thanks for having me thank you man thank you everyone thank you guys everyone all right and with that we are ready for our last talk of today's summit i want to introduce kwame to the stage and uh he's going to be talking about how do you build multi-chain blockchain games that everybody can play with and builds on so without further ado let's welcome kwame hi hey everyone my name is kwame i'm from chainsafe and uh i'll just get my slides here going okay yeah so my talk is gonna be uh multi-chain uh games for everyone and um uh just a bit about myself i work at chain safe um on the gaming sdk my duties are a mix of development uh developer relations and community so you'll see me there helping people out with tech questions or whatever i need i'm lucky enough to have worked my whole pretty much career in game development uh did a lot of match three game mechanics on a beat jewel project that jammed at now ea montreal and worked as an instructor in the video game industry at various colleges in toronto uh so in order to kind of talk about uh you know blockchain games and where this is going and i kind of have a little bit of a timeline um starting off with uh cryptokitties and and seeing you know nfts being brought into uh the mix as far as like our first kind of blockchain game and uh with nfts we saw the you know scalability um you know issues of the l1 ethereum chain um although this was considered the first you know blockchain type of game it really actually didn't have you know you know game mechanics to it you know you had breeding and all these things but as far as it being really a game it that could you know be you know uh debated um 2018 to 2019 we see uh you know axi infinity coming along and we have this you know an actual game mechanic uh this you know pde or play to earn game mechanic and you know uh you know where you have this kind of like earning mechanism to it um in 2020 this is when you know the whole you know plate to earn well i'm kind of being subjective here but in 2020 is when this whole play to earn kind of concept like really um broke out and you know actually basically led the way a huge success as far as you know blockchain games were concerned and this is when a lot of the you know uh bigger studios or you could say triple a studios started like looking at well you know how could we start incorporating you know nfts and game phi and earning mechanisms to our games and then 2021 um you know this is kind of where there's like a bit of a shift where a lot of these bigger studios were like you know what uh i'm not too sure about these nft things maybe it's a bit of hype um gamers kind of went against it uh you know newell from valve uh throughout a bunch of fud um about you know blockchain games and this whole game fight nft mechanism um but there was a lot of other bigger companies like ubisoft that were like you know what this this you know could be a big thing um you know and started to look at different types of uh different like blockchains that would be able to handle the through output of a real blockchain game and then you have um you know like epic who was you know thinking about getting on board after of course valve and duel um you know threw out a bunch of fight in it and now in 2022 um basically all the indie game developers and you know folks like you that are doing build quests that are you know going to be the blockchain games of the future you know we want you we want you to build out these awesome games we want you to be able to you know put out your ideas start companies and take this out to the next level so here are some of the you know current like you know blockchain games that are out there or things that probably people have heard about in the industry um you have cal star from gala you have of course axi uh splinter lands uh forest knight crypto blades and these are some of the games that are you know have that uh you know play to earn game mechanic that is uh you know the kind of like the standard of if you're making a blockchain game it's basically you know a play to earn game mechanic that you're implementing so to get into where the you know the whole history of what a game is well right now we're currently still in the stage of a centralized game right that has you know blockchain type of mechanisms to it so if we look at a centralized game we have this basic client server architecture and these games have a single point of failure so if this game like gets shut down or that there's a server outage like this whole game is is offline there's just no way of you know playing the game unless it is spun back up all the player data maps they're all stored on the server and all the you know traditional like you know massive multiplayer online games and all the traditional games that we're used to are still based around this you know client server architecture which we could really deem as you know the web to uh infrastructure um for you know either like websites and games and any you know web applications that are currently online um hold on to this structure and then we have our decentralize which is our web three games and then we have our you know a lot of the game data that is stored you know either purely on chain or you know with something like ipfs for our nft images and you know 3d models which are usually stored on ipfs and then all of our you know game data is like is on chain which is like the the whole disconnect from you know the that client server architecture where everything is stored on databases and player data and stats and all this and now moving this to the decentralized but free infrastructure where all you know this game data is currently stored and at this point uh you know a pure like blockchain game um is usually like a turn by turn kind of like a card game you know i have a hand or i make a move um you know that hand is basically salted that salt is um you know sent on chain player two does an operation um then that salt from the first player is is used to reveal the hand and then a winner is is kind of like defined and this is kind of like the the realm currently right now of a you know of a pure blockchain game which uh all the gameplay is purely done on chain and it's kind of like in this kind of like turn by turn world and then you have like the hybrid um and this is kind of like you know games like axi uh town star um a lot of the games that have like a lot of the you know the the hybrid versions where they're a mix of both you know centralized parts and the decentralized parts and and marrying those two and this is like the you know the honey pot or the sweet spot of of the blockchain gaining ecosystem as it currently is is finding that like that perfect mirror marriage between you know the decentralized parts which work really really well for gaming and the decentralized you know client server architecture parts that are still needed because a lot of the games that you're going to be building if they're going to have a lot of uh you know engaging game mechanics uh to it are still gonna have are gonna be better off uh you know in most cases on a client server infrastructure and trying to balance uh those twos is those two is kind of where we're you know trying to you know find ourselves right now so blockchain game mechanics like right now currently um you know a lot of mini games uh drive the player to to do a you know a bunch of different things and um you're going to basically you know earn tokens or you're you're in nfts and some kind of you know um economy based around that so right now um you know do a lot of the blockchain games you know hold you know traditional quote-unquote traditional game mechanics or is there actually uh you know a blockchain game mechanic right now so is there a clear definition of a blockchain game um and i'm just speaking for myself right now i don't think that there is uh blocked like a a blockchain game currently is just is so new every word all of us that are coming from a traditional game development background from web 2 and then you know all of us learning this new web free infrastructure and taking all the you know years that we have an experience in developing web 2 client server based games and trying to vary it with the you know infrastructure of web3 is hard and it's all new so we're all kind of like learning as we go and most pure on chain games as i said before are just these really you know turn by turn like i i do something you know set to some salt it goes on chain and then another person doesn't move and then at the end uh you know you use that salta to reveal that hand and this or you know that card player whatever um you know mechanism that you had as a game mechanic that you had implemented and then you know there's either a winner there's a winner or a loser or there's a tie um or they're like you know like a doge dash type of game or you know some kind of like flappy bird kind of like endless you know endless game type of mechanic where you're uh you know incentivized to play because for each um you know thing that you traverse you you know gain a token and at the end of it you get sense um a bunch of like player tokens uh from the the actual game itself into your wallet and that's your incentivication model so a lot of the games that we have right now or the play to earn is not really a game mechanic it's just like an earning mechanism that are employed in games so i guess one of the things that i would really like to you know kind of stress on uh when we're you know as game developers making blockchain games is that we should be really making games first and then looking for areas of our games where um the blockchain is really um you know shines through um so yeah again we're still at the early stage of this um we're moving traditional games uh to the blockchain and again the industry is just really new and as as i mentioned before that concepts like play to earn are mostly you know us like issuing out nfts um you know you start a game you buy a ticket to play the game a certain amount of you know token or whatever gets sent into escrow and you know a bunch of people play and then the winner gets a you know a share of pot or you know whatever so it's kind of like a lot of that same uh type of thing with wrapped into you know a traditional game uh so blockchain game development um and this is just from like my point of view and as i said before like we're all still like i'm still learning this stuff there's a lot of you know different ways of looking at these but if if you're going to be building a blockchain game and you're you know going through build quests you're kind of making you know assumptions of what you're going to do is you're going to want to find a a chain or pick a chain that has like low transaction fees right um because first of all if you want to have engaging game play well you know waiting you know for you know 15 like rights uh to the chain or confirmations before something happens or if um you know a player in your game is going to buy an asset for like you know say like ten dollars and it's gonna cost them you know three times that amount in in gas fees well that's not really you know a great experience so um a bit of research on you know different chains out there that that support uh you know high you know transactions per second um will allow you to integrate a lot of these traditional types of game mechanics and game play um other than just you know the turn by turn and actually have it be more fluid because the the biggest uh problem from my perspective in blockchain games is that if you're using like you know um you know ethereum as your you know game of choice where crypto kitties um are like if the um transactions per second um and the through output and the scaling um was was there would of would kitties have been developed in the way it was and probably it probably wouldn't have been right um you want to take a look at uh what your community is using and look at the community that you're going to be building this this game for right and that that will give you some ideas and doing some uh some research um in this whole um you know area of you know blockchain agnosticism and allow that to be kind of like your driving force of you know what uh chains to put your your game on but there's you know there's tons of different games right um you're going to want to use a tool that allows you to develop your game in an environment that's already has a large uh game development community right so if you're building out this uh this game and you are looking for a chain to build it on well what are the tools that you're going to use to build this game um you know like using something like unity is definitely a great choice because there's a lot of unity game developers currently out there um so it's easy to to get help it's easy to find resources um you know assets and to kind of get yourself upstarted and then of course you need to you know find uh you know some kind of software development kit or some kind of you know tooling that allows uh you know for integrating um the engine that you're currently going to use with the chain that you're going to want to hit right so um so in order to to do that um you know i'm going to show uh you know the chainsaw gaming sdk as a as an awesome tool to to use for building your you know web-free enabled blockchain games we currently have support for desktop mobile and webgl um so you can basically write your game in one you know tool and export it out to all these different uh platforms um it's easy to integrate um we have a bunch of like pre-configured prefabs that allow for you know connecting to you know erc20 erc721 and 1155s and all all that the the custom uh you know tokens from the ethereum ecosystem and we have a large uh you know discord community um so you know getting help with you know ramping up and actually building and deploying your you know first game um definitely if you have that support then it's you know easier for you to you know make it there and as we said before we have these prefabs that allow you to just basically drag and drag and drop this functionality in there so here i might just have a screenshot of how you know you would access the balance of an erc 721 this is just basically a co-snippet and all you have to do is just basically you know set in the chain network the contract address and the account that you're working with and with this whole blockchain agnostic paradigm that you're that we're talking about here um as you see in the chain you'd just be able to change the the chain and uh with the chain that you want to hit whether it be you know poly or avalanche or phantom and a lot of these other chains that we support so if you're making a blockchain game and you don't know exactly where you want to you know deploy the finished product to well you can use the chainsafe gaming sdk as a tool in order to you know iterate and build out the game constructs and then you know deploy or try out your game on different chains and see which one best fits uh the game that you're working with or you know deploy them to ball to all just like redeploy your your contract to the chain that you want to specify and then have um hooks that will change to the different network that you want to want to work with and this is just another example that another screenshot of how you would you know work with a specific change um switching in the network and how you would integrate you know the um the api and then you know making a call or passing arguments it's a very simple to use interface so we've taken a lot abstracted out a lot of the you know ethereum um connectivity parts and just allow the game developers just to be get game developers so if you're from unity or your web 2 developer or unity developer and you're you know looking at bringing those awesome uh sent like you know client server based games into uh web3 um you know this is a perfect tool because you're really just building a game and then all these specific components of a that you want to you know implement that are maybe just like nfts or tokens which we use to be points or you know skins that are your nfts you can basically switch those up and we have like really easy uh you know pre-packaged components to allow you to do that and uh yeah so i do have like a demo it's not really a demo it's just basically um it's just i'm just gonna show you guys the interface here just kind of go over it okay so once you have uh unity up and you have gone to our um gone to our github you can just basically go over and download our package from the unity asset store we're currently at version 1.2.4 and it has also has a link to our documentation that you know basically goes through all of this you know information of how to basically get started and ramped up and after downloading and installing the package you'll notice in our prefabs folder that we have prefabs for erc20s and erc 721 1155 doing just base evm calls um you know working for with uh private keys in game handling wallets and then working with you know webgl so you know like as a really basic example and this is not really supposed to be like a coding session but just a brief um you know interview uh overview of it but if you just wanted to say like you know get the balance of you know an account for erc20 you would just drag in your basic prefab and then click on play and then if i can scroll up you'll see that we have you know the balance here and i'll just like open up the script and you can see that it's uh you know similar to you know that screenshot where you can just pass in the chain the actual network that you want to hit the contract that you want to interface with and then the account that you would want to get the the balance of and as far as like multi-chain support is concerned if you're building you know web 2 games are like web free games like that are webgl inside of our network file here all you do is just basically update the chain id with the chain that you want to hit so you can see here that we have like a list of different um you know chains that you can work with and to be honest with you if you're you know anything that is evm based that connects to metamask um is going to work um if you can connect a meta mask it's going to work as far as like the webgl is concerned and all you're doing is just basically up updating this value with the chain id of the network that you want to connect to and and that is basically uh my presentation if there's any questions please uh pass them over and we are hiring and then have links to our sdk how to get started and uh please join us on our discord amazing well thank you so much for uh kind of going through that and also being able to sort of bake in the demo i worked really well and nothing uh murphy's lagging kick in which is usually what i'm worried about um i think maybe the only kind of question we are at a time unfortunately but uh one thing i would kind of be curious to hear about is uh what's been the the feedback and the reaction from developers who've tried this and then kind of what are they excited about or want improvements on or what do they think that they can and cannot do like how's that loop then from the developers um from the developer side of you know a lot of them are coming from the you know unity based world so they already have that idea and it's usually just them getting ramped up our documentation has videos on how to you know do a lot of this stuff so mostly it's their they're uh learning about like solidity working with apis it's a lot of the web free stuff that you know anybody who's getting new into this space is um is all the same questions but they have that background so like even with uh you know with eve global and everybody's like okay i know react i know of this but i've written a slightly smart contract and how do i work with this api thing right so we we have the same kind of um you know issues uh you know in working with web3 and just everybody learning about it but the one thing that's been awesome about eat global is that you just jump on the discord channels and you have all these teams that are willing to help you out so we're no different if you guys need help and you're gonna use the chain save gaming sdk for your build quest project just jump on over and we're there to help that's amazing well thank you so much for that awesome chat and um yeah i'm glad that uh uh we got to learn about what you're doing and how people can now use this for building more games in uh well just cross chain so uh just yeah yeah multi multi chain block team games here we come oh and i just want to do one more thing for all my chain savers i got the the yellow crocs on well and there's already a couple people on the chat that are actively uh watching for the chainsaw team so i'm sure they'll have a kick in 20 seconds since thank you so much and uh i hope you have a great rest of uh your weekend yeah youtube thank you very much bye everyone all right with that we are at the end of our gaming metaverse summits i want to thank everybody who kind of stuck around to watch the whole thing and ask all these amazing questions to all of our speakers the last few hours have been super fun so uh thank you everybody and uh just as a quick reminder for all the hackers watching submissions are due this sunday at 12 p.m eastern uh so that is exactly 48 hours from now um and to uh for everybody who's watching and is interested in seeing what comes out of the hackathon from all teams you can tune in next wednesday at uh 12 p.m eastern as well for the finale we'll be talking about what all the top projects are from the build quest hackathon and you can kind of watch all that on your global.tv so we'll see you again in a few days and next wednesday specifically for all the uh the hackathon results and thanks again for tuning in in the meantime enjoy some low-five beats and uh this concludes build quest take care everybody all right thank you very much and have a great weekend perfect see everybody you
