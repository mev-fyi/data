was around doing good we had a dog around screen oh good dog I brought her to say how to hack a fast man how sweet oh my god I can't see any eye that's just it's just black black boy and Rafi good we're good straight up enough I'm not talking about the dog we can get back to that later welcome everybody to the last event of week zero it's pretty incredible that we had I think five or six events already and the hackathon hasn't started so congrats I know bunch of people have gone to these workshops this week hopefully learn something if you haven't heard my schpeel before about what this is going to be today's for tonight's wherever you are this morning session is a little bit more flexible more open-ended Juan's going to be sort of leading but everybody else is free to wanna jump in and pitch their ideas he's gonna be pulling from the hundred ideas hundred hackathon ideas sheet that we put together last week hopefully you've had a chance to look through it see some of the concepts he and others have written if somebody can grab that and drop it in the chat long rambling that'd be good yeah so we're gonna we're just going to talk it'll be an open session and hopefully people get inspired they come away with maybe a different idea than what they had before or a more solid understanding of what they were already going to build I don't need to intro one which is good that means less work for me yeah and I uh before before we wrap at the end I'll just go over staking and to kick off on Monday but most of you probably already know that kick off on Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern and the final thing before we jump into it all we're gonna we're gonna play one of those games again where you turn on your video and let's see what we can do this time pick up the most random object on your desk the most random object wins the session are we got a wine-opener ipfs award a carved elephant Tarun is that a bit of box of beans thank you it's a box of brains really all right I mean I I this is might be cheating but I think Andrew might have the strangest thing probably because most of you can't tell what it is it's like a holder of some sort also doodle tool alien an alien antenna that's by homemade iPad thing homemade okay I think that takes it homemade iPad thing cool feel free to keep your videos on cuz we're gonna it's just it's just nice to see faces like I said so maybe and maybe we'll jump in and you guys think we can get a second place weird object later on I don't know Juan I'm you take it away let's let's jump into it awesome thanks great so really started to bring some today I think we have a whole bunch of like different directions that we that we we have to explore so I wanted to kind of go through another structure of how I am thinking about about the session so I'm gonna ask everyone to open this doc and I'm gonna share my screen and then guide us that way let's see so here's how I'm planning to - to do this I'm gonna just give a brief overview of the session and then gonna discuss a little bit how to how to brainstorm really well as a group this is it is non-trivial to brainstorm well as a group and so I'm gonna go over a few kind of rules for how to make it make it really good and then I'm gonna have some inspiration time where I'm gonna talk about a whole bunch of I'm gonna show you a bunch of images and talk about a whole set of ideas and then then we're gonna I want to go into kind of various different sections sweet so the you know kind of rules of brainstorming how to bring someone sacred the the most important thing about brainstorming as a group is to be super generative to open your mind and let yourself come up with ideas and bounce on the ideas of other people and the best way to think about this is the yes and principle of theater improv how many people are familiar with yes end from improv all right awesome who wants to take a take a stab at describing it I'm gonna call Govind is that how you are yeah so then I also go by God but yes and is basically just you set a scenario and I I add something and the partner has to say yes and and continue and say something else you basically just keep playing off this whatever you built with each other yeah exactly so it turns out that when whenever we say an idea and we somebody else rejects it that kind of shuts down our generative brainstorming ability and so for the most part when you take a very positive go with the flow go with the last idea and build on it figure out how to make that idea even better like take the suggestion accept it and build on it that ends up being super good for for brainstorming and it lets you go really quickly through a ton of ideas together and so it's a way for a lot of our brains together to connect and come up with a bunch of ideas so yeah yes and so if you hear an idea yes accept it and build on it and come up with something else normally in a lot of tech environments you know usually because of how how technology works on how engineering works there's usually a much more kind of rigorous no first approach of saying oh here's like you hear an idea and immediate you're like oh here's how why that wouldn't work or like that sounds that sounds like it's not gonna work because of this and so on just completely suppress that like this is not a time for nose so don't think about like why that wouldn't work or something like that think about like just ignore that for now the whole goal of this session is just just generate ideas so don't don't get um don't get snot gonna be like oh my god that sounds that's not silly that wouldn't work I'm not gonna suggest this or if you hear somebody else's idea and like oh I don't think that sounds good or whatever just think about like imagine that the whatever problems it may have don't exist and think of like hey that's that's a really cool idea what else could you do with that like how could you go from that to something even better or something different or or you know think about that idea and very one thing and then what does it turn into so we focus on generative and kind of positive yes and thinking so one one kind of quick rule about the document we're gonna be kind of writing things into the document together so don't delete anything so if somebody else writes an idea it's there it's their sentence that that's fine yeah yes and no don't get stuck in in and then feel very free to like copy paste and remix like you see something really cool oh that's awesome like copy it paste it and like change of thing I'm like boom new idea and so like you really be super free to to kind of um we mix a bunch of things then of course remember the there's a hypothetical to conduct there's a whole set of ideas here I think this is probably like the the only case we're like it's not yes and it's like wait hold up maybe not that idea just remember the code of conduct and keep it up keep it a good and a positive environment for our own and so yeah I think things are I think everyone should be familiar with a code of conduct by by now and then um feel free to add emojis to to things you like that can be super motivating to people that come up with ideas we can help attract attention and be like oh that's really cool heart emojis are good so this this document has a whole bunch of space for a bunch of things like of course we're not gonna go through you know 22 pages and stuff in one you know one session but the point is to be able to let all of us roam into the different areas of the dock to kind of write things that we that we we find interesting and cool and whatnot and so as I go into some of the inspiration session or as people as we kind of we're gonna break up and go into kind of sections for sections we can just think of like if you think of an idea that's kind of fit that category yeah just feel free to kind of write it down and and come up with something and so feel you know maybe look at a it's really helpful to have the the document outline on I don't know if you if you it defaults for you to have it on but that lets you kind of scan the list on the left a whole bunch of different areas for of kind of what's what's here so I'm gonna rattle off a bunch of the so because the goal is kind of inspiring things and and so on I'm gonna rattle off some of the different areas I'm just gonna scan through the document so you get an idea of like the possibilities and you get a little bit of a lay of the land and by the way if you come up with a different use case it's like not here like so for you at it likes totally fine just be aware that once we get into like writing the part of the reason why there's a lot of blank spots is that it makes it a lot easier for us to write if a lot of people are kind of like pressing enter many times then then it can get kind of funky to have a lot of us editing one one document like this I hopefully should be should be really good but um but yeah we'll we'll try it out alright so I put actually networking at the beginning because it's kind of concrete and it can get get us to thinking about a a set of things very quickly so anything from that will kind of like expand out but here are some categories around networking so connections and relays like what happens when you have like a bunch of different nodes connecting to each other there's traffic flowing could you are there kind of tools and apps around measuring traffic or being able to pay for traffic or things like that pub/sub is a whole category of of techniques around networking where you're able to like to spread messages and maybe those messages are directed to a specific topic or a specific application and right now most positive things are not advice maybe they could be for something like that there are local area networks where you may be disconnected from the rest of the world and you might have you know you have a set of devices and they can talk to each other what what cool things people with like you know connecting applications that rely on just local connectivity then you know anything related to browsers like there might be a whole we might come up with a bunch of things that are about making it easier to interact with with the centralized applications from the browser we might come up with cool things around domain names and how to point you know some short short string to to content or applications we might get into kind of large-scale now we're testing and visualizing that or something like that and speaking of visualizations we may get into like really cool ways of like looking at looking at networks in traffic on networks and you know being able to kind of explore what are all the parties and all of the different things that are there on the network all right let's go then there's kind of a category around markets and b5 so think about we're gonna be talking about the storage market and what happens when you have storage providers and miners that are that store a bunch of data and serve it to other people when you pick - - all the same or is it kind of like a marketplace view view to them what happens when when you're able to kind of like select between a set of miners and their different profiles and different different properties retrieval is a whole other part of this there might be many parties that have data that they want to server to you and there might be a bunch of tools and applications just around how do you retrieve things better faster cheaper from specific regions with specific properties there might be a whole set of things around tooling for storage mining so if you if you are gonna be storing a lot of stuff for other other parties and you're gonna be kind of a service provider a source manner there might be a whole host of tools around around that then there are things like data markets being able to store and host data that you then are able to sell valuable I think about valuable that people can can sell access to then you get into things like randomness and and what might you do with with unbiased will randomness and Marcus you can do things like like lotteries and games and things of that nature where where being able to kind of rely on on a random selection that everybody can trust this could be useful then you get into things like loan market it's not in like the traditional defy sense but hey there's gonna be a whole bunch of parties participating in this large network making deals and putting collaterals and and so on and those parties that have storage but but in hardware but less money there are parties that have money and maybe there's kind of like a loan loan market structure they can emerge start then getting to like you know brudder kind of applications and double storage so what what happens when you when you what kinds of like gaps could you make could you make that's super broad this like I didn't start with that one it's like not very concrete are there tools or things that around website how do you make it like easier to publish or view or find websites on on in the decentralized web maybe there are tools around files and data you know how do you make it easier easier to import certain kinds of files or ways of structuring a file to make it easier to navigate or to view the mighty things around collaborative clusters where hey a set of people really like or really want to preserve some specific data because it's important and valuable to them how do you enable them to get together address that data and and store it and serve it together then there's you know verifiable storage what happens when you're able to certify with a cryptographic proof that you are indeed storing something that becomes a really useful property what kinds of things really care to know that the data is there and want a cryptographic proof to know that the thing is not missing maybe a whole kinds of things like that then you get into kind of like the realm of dynamic halves and like what happens with things like chat and social networks or games and so on how do you make those you know the centralized storage network then there might be things are on version control and version control files and version control of directories or version control of data sets you know hard scientific data sets then there could be something around content discovery how do you find different different things like there's there's interesting pieces of content or interesting pieces websites and so on how do you do discovery on a decentralized network that data is a little bit different than the normal search problem then you know then we get into kind of things like developer tooling like what what can you do with payment and state channels right there's all kinds of really cool applications of payment and same channels and we have the etherium and Falcone payment channels to work with if there's a whole bunch of other state channels this is maybe you can make that with like the puffs of thing before I'm like doing this and devised about something then there are things like gateways and pinning services and other on other nodes and service providers in the network then there are things like private networks where you know some group of people want to operate in a network that's cordon off and you know maybe it's like a like a company that just wants to connect to to certain parties or maybe it's a different application that just wants to connect separately then there are things like hosted api's and analytics and metrics and BOTS and so on things related to github and get lab that are all kind of like developer oriented cool and there's some like general things like games and video and audio like what can you do with libraries of these things or make a game things like photos and streaming and news and media what happens to news media when you can certify that the information is there or that hasn't changed you know like a how many websites out there how many newspapers out there change their wording and you have to like catch that what can you do with art and when you when you mix it with with with with crypto and you know thinking of n FPS and so on maybe there's the Metaverse and being able to kind of explore a decentralized space together and and then there's developer assets things like containers and VMs and packages and code what what do you do with moving around that in the decentralized way then there's like you know traditional storage things like personal files and org files scientific datasets large datasets certificates and provenance sensor networks medical data offline first yeah this is this gets gets longer so in and these yeah I'm sure a lot of you have seen a number of these these are these kinds of cases before all right so this is a very long list I got tired even just saying it let alone like we're not gonna go through all of it together the goal is to give you a sample and each of you is gonna gravitate to a different area each of you is probably getting pretty excited about one part of this and not others and so the goal of the session is to kind of inspire inspire us and then we'll have some time individually true then kind of explore the areas that we want to explore and so we'll kind of like have a moment of breaking off or we can go a navigator to those and then then we'll have some time together to kind of like go through a few of them and kind of talk about them and see if they've a sparks more ideas all right enough of listening I'm gonna I'm gonna show some images and and then kind of hopefully that'll that'll help inspire things and so this is kind of some random selection from previous talks that I've given so it's kind of like sound like a really good comprehensive view but maybe some of these things might might inspire ideas and maybe in fact what I'll do is a lad kind of a source of inspiration at the very top if you want to put links to other things you cool I'm gonna go through this kind of quickly it's just uh just flashing some some images I'm gonna skip things that have sex so don't worry about it too much things like video publishing things like social media apps games and game distribution virtual world data there's all kinds of awesome stuff happening in the central and crypto voxels and all that is still mostly hosted in centralized things developer assets datasets scientific data sets making things peer-to-peer what happens when you disconnect from the from the centralized servers what happens when you're in a local area network and what kind of information can you can you move around that way sorry it's like a whole bunch of different applications and systems domains music marketplaces and also self stuff other kinds of marketplaces stores a lot of defy what happens about important humanitarian councils being able to distribute content that that various people want to shut down pinning services and other and other tools for the network look at this you optimization and verifiable storage being able to map the network and see who's where it's market where you have many providers that you can you can get quotes from retrieve all and move being able to move around the data and get it to be able to move around the data to bears locales and distributed faster by by being able to rely on the people that just received it so think of like a like a auto-scaling CDN kind of thing you like all the different scales of mining thing there are tools and things for small miners and think tools and things for a large miners that you know want different things think of a you know once you once you commoditized stories you have a market when you have you think of like potentially order books and things where you can have bids and asks on both sides but those aren't for for exchange and currencies are for for buying storage could you have like a like a real-time order book on on on storage asks and bids and then think about like market places like Airbnb for a moment think think of like the UI and you accessing able to to navigate and explore a market place like Airbnb what would it look like to for this would be kind of like the you know if you if you're trying to store petabytes of stuff maybe the map isn't a city but it's like the world and you can see there's different storage providers around the world and you can maybe find out more about them and you can see their profiles so instead of pictures of rooms you get pictures of their facilities and so on and you maybe you can see like their profile maybe you can contact them in and so on here's like a like a staff - once that staff dashboard from a chrome POC when there's like 17 petabytes but is it all that sorts the same where is it what what kind of properties does it have here's like an example of all of the a lot of storage miners from the poplar network there are a whole bunch of facilities so this is the kind of pictures I could go into profiles right look where you start showing them the marketplace with with you know the facilities and get an understanding of how people are are storing the data so kind of possible things to build it's kind of like a product map scientific base that's blockchain explorers personal file storage being able to like have a you know think of like a Dropbox style kind of thing being able to kind of drag and drop stuff into an intro folder being able to view it being able to get verifiable storage and and check that uh that the content is truly there and you have proofs all right I think that's it for this one and then I'm networking wanted to show a couple cool to see stuff like this so there's a lot of networks in our world that um you know and this decentralizing the tributed world where it'd be really really nice and useful to be able to see and visualize the the network flow and maybe it's specific protocol or maybe these are not just specific protocols but these are like the connections between certain parties in a in a in a market or something like that I think this is like a refreshes a lot of visualizations break if you like leave them running in the background for a while or maybe I could videos like running out of RAM yeah this is a really cool visualization this is say yeah this is like an order book that yeah we'll see in a moment come on network there we go so this is a real-time view into into an order book this is a bunch of like notes any propagating orders and so on being able to like see something like that for the for the source market really really cool all right cool so there's a lot of stuff all right now I'm gonna give gonna give all of us five minutes to scan the list and pick one topic that seems really appealing to you and doesn't matter if somebody else picks the same thing and is riding around there just pick one topic that sounds interesting and appealing and to start writing ideas there and if you kind of run dry and you're like oh I can't think of anything else jump to a different topic and so we'll each do it for five minutes and we'll kind of like write write some things and then we'll take check back in check back in five and come to something else together you [Music] you hey that was five minutes let's see some of the things are coming up with whole bunches up around here I'm just gonna scan through you can follow along or or not goal is to like let you read and see if inspires my disk you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I'm all about the means really all of that because it's just a meme distribution system you you you you awesome a lot of really awesome idea this is this is pretty sweet let's uh let's keep keep that anymore I'll flash the hundred hackathon ideas that we've seen before like there's probably some stuff here that we can we can grab and the goal is for this document here that we're gonna I'm gonna try and get to translating what's here what we come up with in this document over to this so I just wanted to use the Google Doc because it's probably easier to type up on this together I haven't done play with notion and thirty people before so so this will end up over here but if you scan this this one and you get some some good ideas then you can come up with other stuff cool how how about we try another around another five minutes of going into some of this and I'm checking you you you you alright that was five minutes let's check you you you you you you you you you you you you you you a lot of really awesome ideas this is really cool you you you you all right we're gonna I'm gonna try something that uh we'll see how let's see how it goes I know that zoom has a way to break out into breakout rooms so I'm gonna try and like get people talking cuz I can always like help coming out come up with more ideas current I can keep my or Andrew one of you is the host I think I do you know how to send people to breakout rooms yeah I think you have to set it up before the meeting all right all right yeah we can check though well if ya can just we can just start up a couple separate rooms and have people join there we might end up spending a lot of time on that given additionally three minutes how about this we can I'll plan another based on the detection for next week and those are folks that want to join we can do it we can do breakouts then mention it before cool what uh so if we can't have breakout rooms what a would we all one other idea that I had was looking at one area together and maybe do I do go through one one second together and kind of all of us come up with ideas in that section and then I got a suggestion for QA would you prefer to do QA or would you prefer to do kind of all of us look at a section and then kind of give a bunch of ideas in like a couple minutes and I move to the next section raise your hand if you want Q&A or raise your hand if you would like to go through a section together on two three it also it's I don't know how much time you have one but it's it's totally fine if we go over we don't have to end it right at nine yeah the shuttle X Bowl and we like just aggregate the ideas first and see what the most popular like five sections were and then break up then we get kind of the best of both worlds do you have a good way of aggregating them beyond the categories that we have now I just take the ones with the most ones or I'll give you an example so say you have a messaging Club sub then you have encrypted messaging right those - even though they are in two separate sections in the sheet those kind of come together as one now I know now we're starting to do like Information Sciences but like that's all yeah yeah I guess if we spend a lot of time kind of like massaging a document well we'll lose it we will waste people saying so how about but thank you for the suggestion let's do let's do Q some Q&A first and and and go through some of the questions that people have and then then we'll do we'll do some sections great so the people that I raise hands for Q&A don't ask questions I'm curious just how's the integration from the browser just trading and file coin directly from the browser is that gonna plug into a meta mask or just has that function yeah question so two things one there there is a JavaScript library already that you can do all the payment signing directly in JavaScript and so you can submit transactions that way and I know that there's work on some meta mask integration - to bring - I think it's kind of threw them at a massive staff stuff but I don't know that's that's ready yet so I think I would recommend checking out the JavaScript library first hey this might be a bit of a question out of ignorance but up until about this week I was thinking that al-quwain was in the ERC 20 or and kind of piggybacking off a little last question there on meta mask looking at this sheet of a hundred questions there the the store things together suggestion talks about using eath and a contract that works with file coin and then a couple items down and says that there's gonna be an e thin file coin bridge so yeah thanks Adam because I'd like some clarification on that yeah yeah so uses a storage based consensus protocol where the storage power is is the way that kind of like miners gain power in the network and so there's kind of a block reward associated that so if popcorn is its own chain it end up becoming a layer 110 it's not clear what like the future holds it's possible that as the sharding world expands five men could go into into it it could work closely with other chains but for now it's kind of its own layer one chain and kind of the saturation of throughput in that chain like kind of course that as well the so that means that then we need kind of like bridges over to etherium and to other things so you can have like it here's my contracts calling following itself from from etherium and it also means we can do wrapped file coin in the same way that there's like wrapped BTC and wrapped out other things to let Falcon tokens right on on eath we own the FC Twente so that's probably one that yeah but that comes from UM if I could just add then on that because the yesterday maybe they did before there was the bid ler workshop with solidity it is file coins smart contracts built with solidity as well then or is it a different contract language yeah great question so it's a right now Falcone doesn't have the ability to put ad in your own your own contracts so think of like putting a contract on aetherium and then interacting with Falcone so you can likely do this with with power gate we're like you can you can put a contract with solidity on aetherium and then you have some node kind of watching that contract and then causing operations on on Falcone eventually that bridge that bridge is gonna what is what's gonna make it like really really easy to do that there will be kind of there will likely be the user level contracts on Paco in the future but that's that's a this looking longer term thing so yeah if you want yeah for smart contracts just put it as smart conversant ethereal and then kind of caulk all things on popping cool other additions another worth for Joseph yes so just to add on what Austin is going with I want to know if is there like some material or some sort of you know some training for how to interface with the tedium and with fire coin like how do you get the data that's on it the that's on file coin into your theorem contract or you know or how do you do that yeah great question so there are some tutorials on how to do that with ipfs right now where you have the data ipfs and you can interface a smart contract with it before ectly then the would so those couple with faculty in that once the data so might be fast you can just kind of pay unpack one to keep it around the but but it sounds like it sounds like a good idea might be to have a workshop around that of like how do you mix a theorem smart contracts with storage on unpacking and so on so maybe i can look at like putting something like that together for for next week cool other questions yeah so basically i just wanted to ask take this file coin also supports major transactions so let's say i'm running a service and i just want to offer some free storage to my users so so that so that they have the ownership of the data but we are just paying the you know five point on their behalf so this is something we can support yeah great question so right now right now not easily you'd have to the way to do that is your application can have a wallet associated with that and then you can just put the phone in that wallet in the wallet can then pay out that way like any user knew the file right now yes there's a publisher pays model that is kind of like a good hack to make where where you could use you can give like bear tokens so this would be like a great great hack idea right like you you create a contract on aetherium where you have like bearer tokens and so you those tokens gonna be like redeemed for for faculty to use in the to to like retrieve our source source are okay thank you yeah to it are there are other questions right now the right now there's no market where you can purchase about coins because it's not live yet so once it's live once I mean it is like then dope yeah then Michael's won't come after that but the test you can play around in the test map with um with like there's a phosphate and you can you can do it that way cool so let's go through some more more ideas together let's see if you have some suggested so if you want to suggest some some some topics to jump through I was just like take suggestions from the chat and then I'll kind of call it follow this so I see files and later tools there's a lot of ideas great let's go to that all right started secret backups keep a life plugin for a web app q is like top level separation of files file shrinking helper proxy encryption CID some yeah it's just like such a use new to integration with key base for allowing story in the folder yeah why don't we want us fit like a couple of minutes each of those like writing other things related to us and then we'll hop to a different topic either not everyone at once sounds like this one is not very very generative let's move to a different different one anybody have other traditions how about something related to music and video how about okay we what could I do with we do we do what do we do if we have a bunch of music right so we already have like all of the audios library of music already that professed what can we do with that there was two other really good ideas there with yeah that user curated content with voting that was a really good idea whoever posted that one was Spotify there like that was genius I mean user radio stations like just shared and swarmed somehow that just sounds amazing cool and what about photos what can we do with with photos so questions so normal ipfs things can fall out of fall out of favor because one of the issues with storage is I mean there's a lot of privacy issues around this and so you pushed data out there and you you kind of wanted to decay you know I don't know I mean there's a lot of issues around this this is where you I mean all traffic on the Internet is already moved around with just encryption so if you're moving around data and you're capturing packets in the wire and you can liquor at them later then you're it's the same boat so just apply encryption beforehand and and so on you can you can maybe maybe the point is like you'd like to know who's storing this stuff and where and where is it so maybe getting some disability and that is useful but uh but if it's secretaries the same same model as the as the Chrome web yeah as a society we have to come to some kind of understanding around this this is yeah I mean mine is like it's already it's already messed up right like like just moving around from your phone to like the cloud like there are so many intermediaries that look at ciphertext so if they can break the encryption so you know there's a world where like if they can break the encryption they've broken the encryption right so if they can't then then it's okay and then for that for those cases like you can already use textile right now to to put all of your photos into into a bucket and and have a whole gallery or something like that and then and how they encrypted it let's correct right Andrew let me know if that's coming yeah so like all of that would already be encrypted with your own keys so only you and the people you share with well would be able to see it you you maybe you could have like tokens for number of views so that like when they see it like they'd rather tokens they can't view it anymore and as a destructive key or something I don't know something like that you what about use cases where you don't have to worry about encryption like what kind of like public uses of photos are there so there's some art galleries what about other guys you there's a whole bunch of websites around the web that are about like manipulating images and all of them really don't need to be paid website nobody has to host those you could just build an app that does that and then as long as you can move around the app and it can be loaded in the browser and you know where to put the data like you no longer need to like have that stuff be ad driven or anything like that so there might be a whole bunch of like cool ideas from things like meme generators or filters or imagery scaling or editors how's the indexing plan for ipfs as a home it's going to get massive for indexing all those images because I mean even though it's true that you could build this decentralized to happen that index would be J it's like it like any application like you you would have a that application would have an index of those systems big data structures are good this is a matter of light knowing where to put that index and how to access it how much is a right partition I mean it's probably isn't a call but like we'd partition it we'd have to partition that index and spread it yeah good question would it be useful for I mean I think this list is amazing we're generating a bunch of like really awesome stuff would it be useful to kind of like get questions out like people interested in like knowing how to build some of these things and the next week we can do like some sessions on actually breaking down into like what technologies you would actually need to make a thing and it kind of like how to do that like how to approach building something like that how to build on it you know like you're saying how to make the index and so on it sounds like that's popular cool all right cool so well plan to do some of that maybe then the question would be like you know after the session go through the stock and like really flag either in comments what you would really like to kind of request to to be explained and then over the weekend I'll scan through it and and then pick a few and then we'll like oh I'll figure out how we can do some workshops next week on breaking that idea down into components and how you would go about building that yeah I think that's a great idea and definitely one thing that I think we maybe have in the back of our heads we didn't realize is the fact that people have these great ideas for connecting aetherium in PowerPoint but they might not necessarily know how that's like a big big knowledge gap there is there definitely some tutorials out there that I can think of but we should probably have a session dedicated to that like what tooling can you use to actually do this that would be a good thing for next week yeah sounds great let's do it you you so we jump to a different section let's see how about we go for ten more minutes and then we we wrap what does anybody if you think Molly Molly had suggested some earlier which I know if you went over them already I went through one thousand data network visualizations how about like if you if you have a section we you want our whole combined attention post it on a chat and and then we'll take one of those including including our visualizations [Music] cause I think we have a network solutions and sensor networks they're pretty related let's do a let's look at how much there is on each one let's see network visualization is to some cool wants and then IOT and sensor networks some good ones as well great let's go through let's sort of it I with sensor networks and then move back to our neighbor Brazil occasion feel like I said I've thrown a bunch of ideas happen that's often what other kind of public data feats are there there's a whole bunch of interesting ones there's like weather and temperature and like airplane data like yeah open maps and jst up for sure that hope could be a whole category is it query I I think they have some transit data stuff that they do yeah I think query does there's some amount of transit data from like buses and and so on New York City subway turnstile counts three specific [Music] cool and let's maybe go through network visualization for for the last set let's do a few minutes on this one and then we'll call it a day and I say reminder network visualization is like all kinds of things you could visualize the you could visualize all the connections in a network you can visualize specific protocols like like pub/sub or you could visualize like the flow of content and the network all kinds of things like that this might also be really useful for you to wear to your Susan let it be so if we both like if you build like a lip you P network visualizer and that'll be super useful for for ipfs for file entry - or polka dot and so on [Music] [Music] but there's a lot of really awesome ideas I'm mixing just like payment channels and lipid appeal like just being able to do incentivized content distribution sorry is that device connections right like you can set up a relay and you can like connect to that relay and that's like your your weight of like an items whereas the world and you pay for it you could do like an send device like mash network we're like you're doing bandwidth sharing pretty easily you can do yeah you can do like this pops up a delivery you can do like and then it sent device tht so the issues are like really problematic if you do like him sent to by CHD that's a good way of like breaking civil resistance they should do like a whole session on like mixing payment channel something bit of people so that I might be like that like a good one and I think a lot of the tooling for that is like if they're in payment channels and say channels would be wouldn't make super well with it right now there's something really magical about being able to look at a globe and seeing network connections right now this globe and on the five point page it's not it's like like figure that would be amazing to be able to see some point this for for all kinds of decentralized protocols for like being able to visualize a theorem network this way or IP pass that would be like super super cool like but I didn't able to see like the block propagation of a theorem for like know something like choose the reported or some forethought there's a lot of really cool inspiring Eustace is there it also would be like a good UX for like storage market you may like it where the storage facilities and you can make explore the map like oh it's interesting like click on click a thing and bring up like photos of the open facility I know you know you proceed I mean would that be like terrorist risky not to be weird yes and yes and it's terrorist risky sorry I screwed that up you found the cyber security now yeah you don't have to do addresses that's a great great point you don't have to go busters you could just have like a point on a city or something and so there's like you know it's in that city you don't know where this and you can then see like this node is in this city but um and then you can see like the photos of the inside the facility and why not I think with most of the stuff like once you once you get access or IPs and so on it's not that hard to find it where people are especially like data centers yeah I mean AWS like we didn't I just quit working for AWS but like yeah we're pretty protective of that but people would check in on their phones and then someone like WikiLeaks dump like the data senator Madeline she's always nice it's pretty incredible yeah awesome well we've been going for about an hour and half I think we generated an amazing list of it yes this is really really really awesome I think yeah let's keep the document going let's share it with the with the rest of the hackers and see what other things people add and then if I think the goal is to like maybe move some of the stuff over to to this because then we can like do categorization and searching and so on but that'll take some and it's kind of like pressing well what kind of discuss how to how to achieve that but for now yeah if you want to comment through the stock and say what you would like to get explained or or in or from this list like what what things you would you would love to see kind of broken down in terms of how to build it with the available tech you know like really comment on whichever wants you think like would be awesome to see and and then I'll over there we can I'll take a two or three or something and then kind of think about how workshop where we where we do that yeah that's pretty amazing that we were able to come up with we collectively we all with so many ideas and this is definitely like a really great diversity of people I'm just scrolling through it now kind of riffing off of other ideas I did like there the prompt at the beginning of yes and and it's is definitely a different session than what we've had before it was I think 50 percent silence just people sitting kind of thinking about ideas reading so it's nice to have a change of pace a little bit more of a chill session I think we could probably wrap there if you unless you have some final thoughts yeah this one's good I think at the end of the day like the I think there's a lot of potential in a lot of these like even yeah already there's a ton of really awesome ideas like being able to see some of these things built over the next four weeks would be would be really really amazing some of these are like really great projects and tools some of them are really like potential like strong businesses and so on there's a lot of really good good things to hack on yeah I would say like keep adding for the next week like getting more things on here go read through see like what uh how you get inspired and like add more things if there are missing categories suggest them as well and and so on I think through next week well we'll keep adding to it I think our homework is going to be to figure out the system for surfacing up the ideas that people are most curious about figure out some sort of signaling like you said you did with emojis or comments or something and then we can hopefully integrate that into some of the workshops next week that would be really awesome kind of just keep building iterating on what people are interested in so that'll be a each global and protocol labs homework for the weekend it's figure out how to set that up for everybody awesome thank you everybody for showing up and sticking around for an hour and a half this was really productive looking forward to people keep adding to it over the weekend - yeah thank you thanks for watching see ya we'll see you all on Monday don't forget to stake that's right in the comments yeah
