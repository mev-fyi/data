foreign [Applause] [Music] welcome um my name is Cree I'm part of the youth Global team and with us we have Christine Perry hello welcome um sweet she is from scale and so yeah we're gonna have skills Workshop is called how to leverage Zoo gas fees with scale um super super stoked for it and um what else am I supposed to say oh yes at the end um if you have any questions feel free during the workshops put them in the chat or at the end we'll probably have like the five to ten minute q a session where you can raise your hand and ask a question um but if you're like me and you're a little bit shy to do that in front of so many people um you can always drop those questions in the scale Discord chat um so yeah Christine feel free to take it away awesome and thanks great really excited to be here again with eth online I think we're really excited to see what projects get created um during the hackathon this time and what I would love to show you guys today is one versus a quick very quick overview of what skill is I promise not to kill you with slides just a few and then I'll hop over into some fun stats and then we'll kind of go through a little bit of the documentation in the code mostly so that way everyone can understand how to use skill at the hackathon so I'm going to share my screen and let's get started all right I'm gonna hide everyone from the screen all right there we go all right so how to leverage zero gas fees on the scale Network one thing that's really great about the skill network is that um when a processing transactions there's no gas fee involved meaning that you don't have to create a negative user experience for you and users that just want to use your application this comes in really handy for various types of applications as you can imagine games data apps um and so forth dials anything that you can think about creating where you don't want to introduce a fee for any transaction scale is a network for you so one of the before we get started though would love to first talk about the hackathon prizes that we have um scale network is giving out 20 000 worth of on scale and it's going to be divided into a few different categories the first one is going to be a grand prize winner so 5K awarded to the best use of scale the next one is going to be a metaverse gaming and nft award up to 8K and what that means is multiple projects can win within this category and split the Bounty there there's a partner integration award there's a lot of partners that are at online as well and up to two thousand dollars split among various teams depending on on what Partners they integrate that's another award that can be won and then lastly there is a generic pool prize meaning that for any attempt at developing on the skill Network meaning that we can actually see that you deployed to the skill Network we've seen transactions going through you would then be able to divide that full prize among all of the teams that deployed all right so now one of the things about the scale Network too is that it's ethereum native meaning we're not an ethereum killer on chain but instead all of the tools that you've grown to become accustomed to and used to if integrating with ethereum will automatically transfer over to scale and so as you can imagine all of the web 3 connectors hard hat web 3 ether JS truffle all the token standards almost all the wallets Sable coin any coin and then much much more and pretty much all the ethereum tooling because umscale runs evm compatible chain what that means is that you don't have to change your setup in order to deploy into skill Network so if you've already started on your application you've already started on a rink B test net just switch the endpoint to point directly to the skill Network and from there you are able to deploy and take advantage of the low cost and extremely fast transaction speeds now how is this accomplished one of the things that I think is different within the skill network is that while there are going to be fully decentralized nodes about 160 just around the world um the difference is that instead of having all the nodes run one massive chain what happens in the skill network is a group or subset of those nodes are grouped together to create your skill chain now your skill chain that coin is pretty much on the very very descriptive here because instead of having you know one blockchain where all applications eat up the same exact resource so this specified diluting the transactions per second and diluting the speed you're able to really compartmentalize your application into a dedicated chain now what happens here is there are 16 nodes that are running them for your chain but to add a level of security what we do is we swap out a node or two ever so frequently to prevent collusion um and what happens here is that means that it adds another layer of secure 30 for it not just the entire network but for your chain that's running within the system now your chain is one of many because all the other applications will be running on their own chains and what you're seeing here is that there is a bit of overlap because within the skill Network there's an idea of sizes within change as well instead of having you know one type of change where you all have the same storage the same processing power the same speed essentially what we're able to do is through Docker make sure that we can create sort of a sharding mentality where one node could run up to 128 different skill teams or 16 different skill chains if it's medium chain or one skill chain if it's a large chain and so what that means is that you have the flexibility to grow with the skill Network as your user base grows in Azure transaction throughput needs increase as well throughout the Journey of your development of your application so how is this looking in practice one thing that the community has told us is that well we want to create some organization around this multi-chain system it's great that we have all these chains everywhere and with having all those trains everywhere well how do we get them to talk to each other how do we get them to share resources how do we get applications that want to provide a service to other projects within the system to group together as well and so thus came about this concept of a hub mentality and a hub basically means that okay if you have you know like projects such as liquidity dexas Fiat on ramps Bridges and let's say nfts you have marketplaces and you have projects that just want to deploy nfts why not provide a system or a chain where they're able to deploy into a single environment now we have a few that have already taken this on wire connects Ruby boot um on the nfmt marketplace side NF trade affen XP Network my lilius and all the other applications that still want their dedicated chain are able to do so but because multichain network was um in the beginning thought of to maybe application that works um and Synergy with each other we do have applications that sit in between all of these allow them to easily transfer data transfer assets transfer tokens not just between ethereum and the skill chain but also between skill tree and scale chain and when we think about you know scale also being zero gas and fast transaction costs it means that transfer is instantaneous and the cost is zero so when you are interacting with an exchange when you are interacting with anti-marketplace your users again don't have to have a diluted user experience because they um have a minor transaction cost that's popping up here there every so frequently and again I just want to make sure to call out the all the same tools that we talked about before um still work within each and every one of these skill chains and to take it a bit further to help with the facilitation of transfers of assets specifically tokens between all the different chains within the scale ecosystem there's a skill widget that is customizable by application which allows you to provide a good user experience for your users to be able to easily understand how to migrate from change a chain without having to go to code without having to um you know understand what endpoint they're on all of that can be Pro programmed directly by the application to make the transfer of assets very seamless so this is just one way that the ecosystem is coming together and it's really exciting to see the on the community decide to take that even further all right so as I promised I will keep the slides to a minimum and we're going to hop straight into documentation and demoing before doing that though I did want to call out some fun steps um as I mentioned you know in a multi-chain system that means you have more than one chain right and so to date we currently have 22 scale chains running for various different applications and so far we've surpassed um four thousand four million transactions and as you can see over here this is the estimated gas fee savings by not having a gas fee associated with transactions that are going across with a network which is really exciting to see the growth within scale has just exponentially just like grown over the past few months I think with the launch of Ruby exchange the decks with the launches of fun gains crypto blades and so forth we're seeing some really awesome momentum with um users deciding that they want to take advantage of an ecosystem where there's no transaction cost for or the base level transaction that they're trying to do all right so how do you get started with the skill Network well if you hop over into the iPhone line on Discord you'll be able to go to the skill on sponsor section and from there we have links to point you to how to get started that link is going to take you here to hackathon that's called that Network and there are two main links here that are of importance one is going to be the one that allows you to choose which test net or skill chain that you want to use during the hackathon you can easily add that to your meta mask directly here you don't have to copy and paste the endpoint or anything like that simply decide on which one you want to use and add it to your metamask and then you can also go to the various block explorers for each specific skill chain all right the second link here is the docs and the docs is going to help you understand how to get started with everything within the scale ecosystem if you hop over to develop this is one of the best sections to go through and understand how to integrate with some of the most popular tooling that most developers use so truffle is Here remix is here anything that you might want to test out or quickly deploy I'm using you'll be able to come here to get some really awesome code examples there are some other features within scale that are very specific to scale um I don't see this in many other networks because it's been built directly into the scale Network those are things such as the scale Oracle meaning that yes directly on each and every scale chain there's an oracle that comes built in meaning you don't have to pay for Oracle you can simply connect to any API out there request data and use it within your smart contracts if I head back there is also a feature called multiple transaction mode now within most um you know blockchains you are able to send multiple transactions which is great they get added to a pending queue which is great and you have to wait for a few blocks before they're actually processed which is not so great within scale what you're able to do is send up to 2 200 transactions for the test net chains and what that means is that within the same block we will process all of those transactions for you now this is very useful for applications that are building gaming mentality because if you're building a game you don't necessarily have to rely on specific subsequent order if you're building a Decks that rule does not apply to you because as you can imagine with dexes and with Finance you need to make sure certain transactions happen before the other however multiple transaction mode has proved to be handy for a lot of applications already today because let's say that you are mincing 10 000 nfts well if you're able to net a thousand every five seconds within the skull Network that allows you to go a lot faster by using the NTM mode and taking advantage of that there's some great code examples for explaining exactly how to do that specifically how to increase the knots in order to make sure that you are able to process all of those transactions and then from there that's all you have to do it's already turned on for every test net skill chain here at the hackathon so there's nothing extra you need to do to get started with this the other cool feature that is very unique to scale is a random number generator now a lot of projects sometimes will always need like a random number in order to create Randomness within your application right um and so a lot of times it's not um very it's not possible to do it directly within smart contract well why because it's costly and that's because um you know with other um you know blockchains you do have to code your smart contract in a way to really be mindful of cost well when you're dealing with a zero gaspee environment you don't have to deal within those constraints you can simply code exactly how you want to and that even extends to something such as using a random number generator directly within your smart contract because you don't have to worry about that increasing the amount of cost for your um your users now similarly to everything else within our documentation portal you will be able to take advantage and see just really easy to use um code Snippets so you're able to copy paste this directly into your smart contract and retrieve a random number that's presented in the form of a hash okay well wait how do we actually take that and create you know a random number that's between 1 and 10 or 1 in 100. well we make it super simple by explaining to you exactly how to do that just Implement a mod mod 10 mod 100 mod a thousand and you're able to get your integers between those specific numbers all right if you head back though again everything you need to get started um even as simple as just deploying onto the skill network via the various commonly used applications will be here and the last thing I would love to show you is using two of the very unique features random number generator and MTM mode directly within a project that was created by another Solutions engineer Abreu on the team so you are able to download this if you want to play around with it directly from our GitHub it's underneath the scale demo repository and essentially what this does is it creates something that's called a strange token and that strange token is randomized where the dots within on that specific token will change based off of the random number that is being used within that token so you can see here I'm pulling up a new token here now this is already deployed onto a testnet on scale chain um and what what this contract does I'm going to first show you the contract because the skeletal token contract is just your basic ERC 721 um smart contract it leverages opens up land on standards and the one thing that is going to be different here though if I scroll all the way down remember how I said we're taking advantage of using some of those unique features so it's a random number generator well you place that function directly within your smart contract and you are able to use that specific feature very very easily and what there's randomized randomization is going to do is make sure that I can move those dots and create a very unique token or nft for users so I can create 10 000 nfts that are all going to be unique very fast now to show you this using a multiple transaction mode I have a very basic you know web3 connected on JavaScript um code snippet here which essentially what that's doing is going through increasing the knots to create a hundred tokens all at once very simple and then what it does here uh like I said it just we'll just use web 3 in order to send that across um to be able to um attach to the the skull Network and amend those tokens directly onto the Scout Network so let me show you what that looks like and I already have my very handy code snippet here that I'll paste press enter and just like that we've mentioned 100 nfts so super fast and then if I come here since we're on I am using a different scale chain I'll show you what that looks like on the Block Explorer to bring this full circle as you can see um 14 seconds ago I mentioned 100 um tokens and you're able to see all of those token men's heads um create it right here on the Block Explorer I think what's really cool about um you know the block Explorer is that it's just like etherscan and I'll show you exactly what that looks like as well I'm going to copy the smart contract for that strange token that was already pre-deployed you're able to verify your smart contracts and if you want to use remix you can to be able to interact with a smart contract but if you want to use a block Explorer directly you can do that as well and so from here I'm able to read the smart contract see everything that's available there for me as far as the methods and read and write directly from the Block Explorer as well so all of the tooling to make your journey here at East Global for developing very easy and of course if you have any questions along the way definitely feel free to reach out to our team within the equal Discord so I know we're almost that time so I wanted to make sure to leave a couple minutes for questions if anyone has any so I will stop sharing my screen yeah if anyone has any questions feel free to raise your hands um but yeah again if you are shy uh don't hesitate to drop them in the Discord later on um all right good thanks so much Christine that was super super informative like I feel like I learned a lot on scale that's why I love like hosting these uh workshops with the sponsors I love it um well then yeah if you have any questions definitely feel free to reach out to us and that you Global Discord um our team will be hanging out there around the clock we have Team around the world so you'll definitely um get a response from one of us in the channel um and happy building guys I hope you have a fantastic time building at this hackathon yeah thanks bye everyone
