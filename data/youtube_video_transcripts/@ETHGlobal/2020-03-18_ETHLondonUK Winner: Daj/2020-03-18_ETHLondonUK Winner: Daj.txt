all right so we're dodge it means interesting lingo nyan that's beside the point basically it's a time warping machine that allows you to get future money right now so what I mean by that is that if you want to your die for example to earn interest your bet this is a lot of Star Trek memes in it if you want your die to an interest you have to put it on IV or compound and you have to wait for that interest to accrue and you actually don't know how much you're gonna get because the interest rate is variable so dodge solves both of those problems you know exactly how much you're gonna get but not only that you're also gonna get it upfront so you're basically getting your cake and eating it too so that use cases for this hopefully are obvious it's a good way to avoid the opportunity risk with a lot of popular activities in web three if you're staking or escrow deferred payments say for example Alice wants to set up a coin bounty for Bob she has to lock up her die but obviously if she's looking up her die she can't an interest on that day so she uses dad to get the interest upfront right so you're going to show how it works it's basically based on the new asset class which are called future tokens so future die f die the letter wasn't taken so we took it nobody else can have it now sorry quite typical I can approve the presence so you can just select how much if you want to deposit what's the period you can see what are the current right so right now we are waiting for the interest rate to be transferred from the future what what actually is happening behind the curtains we take your deposit we look for the best available option on the liquidity pools we diversify the risk and we recalculate the interest rate and send it back to the user so what you receive is a future token in this case future F that is locked until a maturity date Express here actually it's kind of a multi token ERC 11:55 and what can you do with that token you can transfer it in space and in time so what do you mean by transferring in time you can decide to let's say okay take part of your deposit and push it further to the future and earn more interest or push it closer to the present so we pay the interest that you already taken up front let us try that and maybe let's show also how to transfer that in space because they fully fungible token within the categories that we defined so we can send it to your friend you can put it on stake on the different protocols you can mix with other defi up and you can even swap future F for future die if you are brave enough so here for example Alice can put F D or F in get Quinn and when Bob delivers the bounty he'll get his left eye and then can convert that for actual died at the maturity period so if it's June died in June transfer it space to another account and what's going on we also have we're working on this as an actual product so we've been developing also a nice user friendly front-end that explains it that you can get your future money up front with like nicely sliders that hopefully you know gonna win the UX peeper prize we don't know [Applause]
