[Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to hack FS hello everybody thank you so much for joining us for the hike FS kick-off my name is Karthik and one of the cofounders of eath global and you may know me as the person it was being emailing you for the last two weeks I am super excited to welcome everybody here for this very first day of hack FS our month-long hackathon on the protocol labs in the fall cone ecosystem and I'm super excited to get this call started we have over 200 people watching this thing live a lot of you on this call from so many different time zones and different times around parts of countries from the world we have also a lot of people on YouTube and Twitter watching the live stream directly so I want to thank all of you for being here and taking your morning afternoons and and evenings with us to learn more about what we have planned for all of you for the next four weeks so hack FS is a collaboration between eighth global and portal collapse we Eve global did our first event that's an all Agathon call hack money about two months ago and we had so many amazing things that we've learned from doing something online largely we got to learn about how do we actually make our events and these hackathons accessible to more people from all over the world and not only that how do we actually set up a process to put all the developers that are out there in a position to get more help and actually perfect and excel in building what they wanted to do originally as they started off with the hackathon so Eve Global for those of you who are not familiar is an organization with a simple mission our goal is to get as many developers as we can into this what three ecosystem and we do this thing by doing a lot of developer focused events across the world so far we've done 16 events in the past two and a half years across all continents where we've had over 11,000 hackers apply to these events and have had over 1200 projects being built and people from over 85 countries of physically attended these events I talked about hack hack money as our first event where we got to learn and make this even more inclusive for developers from all the other countries that we have not been able to do an event in so as we kind of expand to doing the events online and in-person this becomes a perfect spot for us to to kick off and and make this even more of a better offering for all the developers that are out there projects like get coin crypto kiddies set protocol it's adapt or theorem and one into exchange has been some of the projects that have had their written stories from our global events and as we kind of look into all this when we initially started our conversation with protocol labs about a month ago this became the perfect opportunity for us to make this apartment ership where we actually get to expand both of our missions by broadening the scope of the web 3 ecosystem and merging our communities and bringing the technologies from protocol labs in the IP IP FS ecosystem to the theorem world in even a much broader capacity and today is going to be that kickoff for how we want this to to work for all of you here and I'm super excited to share what we have on board and in the process so three weeks ago when we launched hack FS we had announced our intent and we were blown away by the response we got as of today we have over 380 hackers that are staked and shared their intent to participate at this hackathon and these hackers have been already working on over 75 different projects that they've indicated and we have people from 50 countries and 19 different time zones that are going to be participating over the course of the next four weeks we have people from all these amazing places on this call and also at this event and I'm so happy to announce that for hack FS we have people from all the continents participating and this is absolutely incredible and not only is it just about the hackers we also have an amazing set of mentors and judges who are going to be with us for the next month helping everybody here not only with technical and support for the theorem and the protocol labs ecosystem but also for on various aspects like how do I actually expand and work on my projects and how do I take it to the next level so we have so much of this planned and we have an amazing sort of set an agenda for for all of you here and I'm super excited to go into the details of how that's going to be structured for hecka fest in addition to all of our mentors and judges we also have a amazing set of companies that are with us for this event that are going to be helping all of you as hackers and by dedicating their time and their SDKs and their protocols to help ensure that you get to build the best projects out there in the falcone entire ecosystem so I want to thank all of these sponsors and companies that are participating and we'll go into a lot of details on how they're going to be helping all of you just a little bit later in this call so hecka fest I want to give a quick overview of how this call is going to be structured we have a few things I want to cover in this call I'm going to be talking about what the next three days will look like for all of you participating we've had a lot of questions coming from how do we actually think about working on an idea or a team we'll go over what a check-in is and how you can actually get help for the project that you'll be working on and the prizes you can win as part of working on and participating at this event and also all the talks the workshops and the aiming sessions we have planed for all of you from our sponsors and our Mentors so before I go into all those details I want to take the time here to welcome the founder of protocol labs one by name to give us a an overview of Falcone and the broader ecosystem from protocol website he'll go into the details of how this event is going to be structured from their end and covering some of the basics of the technologies that are going to be made available for everybody to use up this event and then shortly after that we'll have a welcome from our sponsors and I'll be going over the details of the logistical information all of you need to know for kicking off and getting started with your hacks so with that please welcome on four from Oracle labs and I'll have him share his screen for his talk thanks a lot my screen one sec all right I hopefully you can see that let me check out the chat we're all set great thank you thank you very much for the introduction it's a great honor and pleasure to to be here with everyone today I'm super stoked for this whole month it's gonna be a blast I can't wait to spend this time with everyone I wanted to chat today a little bit about you know at a high level why web 3 matters I was really blown away by the amazing response that we've we've gotten with hackathons and have been super super excited and proud to see so many people joining us from that have they don't have a lot of what fair experience yet and so that's a really phenomenal phenomenal thing to see so when I kind of go go over why would three matters a little bit then we'll talk about our work in building web 3 and kind of what ifs and bakwan are and how they fit together I'll touch a bit on how to confess and try to give you some some pointers and then then we'll we'll touch a little bit and kind of like the next the next wave of of web 3 and kind of what you might how you might fit you or work over the next the next month and I confess into like the broader the broader landscape alright so why would three matters I think the day I think we live in an incredibly unprecedented time as I'm gonna try and boil down a very important and meaningful message in a very short number of slides but it's so important to to give and it's important in terms of the context of well three that I can't like do without this so I'm gonna talk about why web three matters in three parts one part is is I'm gonna talk a little bit about computing than the internet and then web three so in the last 80 years computing has effectively transformed most of humanity we have now superpowers that our ancestors would would really not distinguish from magic we can do you you and I can do now and we are doing right now through this video conference things that our ancestors would have really never been able to been able to imagine so it is already the case that we are effectively superhuman in terms of you know comparing ourselves to to humans of the past and computing has you know all kinds of technology has have contributed to that but computing is one of the major areas of this and has been accelerating over over the last 80 years and so you can draw comparison from say 80 years ago to now and just see the dramatic difference and in in in life not just for an individual human but for groups and entire nations what we do today as humans is very very different so think of it as you know billions of humans and trillions of computers live and work together deeply integrated everything you do day to day nowadays or at least most of what you do tends to be mediated in some way by by computers think of all of the activity that you do think of your learning your work you're writing your messages how you connect with your loved ones your friends all of that kind of communication most of it is is now mediated by computers so all your work all your play all your relationship keeping and so on so more and more what what humans do has migrated to the computing medium and it's now powered by the Internet and what's extremely amazing about the Internet is that it is a software platform that enables us to upgrade our superpowers so in not just computing hasn't just given you given us a few superpowers it has given us the ability to constantly upgrade our superpowers by creating new applications it's very easy not not just for a large powerful nation but for a single individual or a small group to create a new superpower and grant that to the rest of humanity it's an amazing amazing thing that has never you know had never been as a this is one of the I think the remarkable things about our time the fact that a few people can get together and create a new superpower and give it to the rest of the world and so we have this amazing upgrading system installed around the planet that more and more people in the world are able to be connected to now most of our communication and most of our interactions stilted as they mediated by screens and keyboards but that's going to change over over the next few decades all kinds of changes are coming down the pipeline things like AR and VR brain machine interfaces and then now computing is starting to get embedded into all kinds of other systems like cars and we're getting autonomous driving and so on and the the potential the possibilities of robotics and AI loom in again the kind of decades time scales so when when you think about the last 80 years and how much Humanity has changed and you project the same exact amount of time forward and you think about what the next year it's like next 80 years are gonna hold you can think of you can try to imagine how our lives are going to change in the lives of all the people that we know are gonna change and and it sounds difficult to to really understand that what exactly would happen what are the key changes that will occur when will they occur how will they come about will it be good change will be a bad change what are the unintended side side effects and consequences all of those kinds of effects will will will unfold over over this next next pathway so a lot of us today will see these changes happening and a lot of us today will take part in in shaping those changes and changing setting the direction that the technology take takes so when you think about what to work on you know over the next you know 10 years perhaps 20 years just consider that that the computing platforms of today are going to shape the way that humanity operates for for many decades to come and so this is kind of this is what brings me to web 3 so web 3 is the next iteration of this really fundamental superpower granting machinery so if you think of the web is this this amazing super power granting system web 3 is the next iteration of this which takes the the web from being a read rewrite medium to finally being a trustful people medium by adding verifiability so this is where we imbue a lot of the of the of the tech that we use with all kinds of properties from from secure cryptographic protocols to game theoretic equilibria around specific protocols and and a whole host of other you know good and open open governance and so on to produce systems and protocols that are that are trusted by default and their trust but not because you trust a some sort of good authority but trustable because you trust the math or you trust the the actual properties of the system and you and you and you're able to rely on these systems with strong guarantees and in in a sense web 3 is bringing to the Internet hook host of revisions and improvements that we think are critical and fundamental because when when you think about you know how all of our lives have been you know impacted by by computing in the internet and improved when when you start considering how shaky all of the foundations of of computing and the Internet today are in terms of data security and so on there's a lot to improve and there's a lot to make better so the entire web through movement which which I think it effectively got kicked off with withing things like Bitcoin as the first frontrunner then it's here I'm gonna piss on a whole host of other other systems the whole broader movement is to is to bring about these kinds of values in these kinds of of systems so things like freedom of speech freedom was an assembly online being able to control that our data being able to have transaction secured transactions being able to do so verifiably without central control and so on and the end of the day web 3 is kind of this combination of blockchain tech with the decentralized web and with linked data and so this is this is the the whole picture of what what um what its kind of making up web web 3 this is my salad other people have have their own perspectives I'll leave it at that in terms of defining web 3 you can find out more at I've given some talks about this and in the past all right so let's talk a bit about a building web 3 I've been super fortunate to work with a whole with an amazing team of people on a number of projects and we build a number of things around making decentralized web and went through year reality and we've broken it apart into a number of different projects so we tend to refactor our things and try to take out the common parts so that other people can use them so for example we we took in the networking stack of of ipfs and turn it into a project clipping a key this is a module or a peer-to-peer stack and it is now it has a whole bunch of adopters across the across the entire were three landscape and even beyond even folks outside of the weary world are starting to use the p2p and it's going to be powering if your room to it already ours polkadot it's gonna be powering file coin in a whole host of other other groups it also is an amazing example with inter echo system collaboration we kick off the the initial implementation of the p2p by extracting it out of my PFS then the parity team built Russ implementation and then kind of that over to the well three foundation and then after that aetherium to adopted Lapita P and then God for other implementations builds and now we have seven eight of our implementations of this other system this is a really in there's a whole set of things that we could talk about in terms of local TP and it's a great source for potential hacks so check out the there was a workshop last week and and there's probably a lot of other people that are excited about talking about this so check out more about it so that's the networking layer the on top of that ipfs brings in the addressing and the content model of the decentralized web so this means making the work web work peer-to-peer so go from the kind of centralized model of HTTP where the server and a lot of the the computers kind of interact directly without server making a request for for files or images or or api's and so on and moving that into a fully peer-to-peer model where the application itself and and the data in the code the represent the application can float around and move around the network anybody can serve you in the content as long as they have it and you have a strong guarantee around the continent integrity and and so on this kind of model enables both all kind enables things like censorship persistence enables verifiability of the content and it also can even work in in offline settings so there's there's ways of deploying I think other applications such that they work in a kind of disconnected environment without having to talk to the rest of the internet which is a really really great place to be so this is kind of where the interplanetary and ipfs comes from the you know full intention at some point to have a how they working in in Mars so the the basic of the model is miss-ghetti automata is that you map human readable names to directly true to the hashes of content and then distribute those and so that way anybody that has that content can conserve it to you there's a whole there's a large ecosystem of adopters I ran it because there's a lot of applications using it more than this in this screen grab shows these are just a few of the folks that we we've we've identified it's it's used a lot in the if you're an ecosystem for all kinds of things whenever you need kind of offline sorry I've chained the data it is very common to address all of it in with I profess and and to the tribute it that way or whenever you need a front-end for for adapt so the typical kind of deployment path is you deployed a contract data that you can't fit them in the in the chain and the front end of that of an app into ipfs and then you deploy a contract to etherium and then that's how you kind of interact with with the system but then outside of the blockchain world there's all kinds of other other systems that are using using active us including including you know developer tools like container integration so there's a group attainment and Netflix that are exploring they use for doing container deployments there are groups trying to do package manager distribution and and now we also have a browser adoption so we have gotten I think us into into a couple of of major browsers and and more to come after that so these days we it's also now super easy to deploy to host and deploy web sites and apps on alright because thanks to tools and systems like flick you'll hear more about them later but this is a very common way of using using IP fests where you deploy your website type FS and then you added a centralized domain to the to the website by the way happy to report that that both ENS and and unstoppable domains are easier to use than DNS so that's an amazing achievement a great place to be then you can also build a whole bunch of dynamic apps with with tools like textile it takes a group that builds a number of different different libraries so things like buckets and threads and power gate you hear more about this later and there so there was a workshop last week and there'll be another workshop I think later this week this is a great way of building all kinds of dynamic applications with ipfs I'll also give a shout out to orbit to be as well it's a whole other different approach to to do doing dynamic apps with wood IP first and I think there's some amount of synergy here I also want to put but probably most of defy is powered by ifs in some way whether it's the front-end itself or some of the data feeds that the people are using but it's a it's a really nice nice example of the tooling being fitting just right and it being kind of like an afterthought that yeah of course like the front end would be would be kind of hosted and distributed by us and there's also now applications that are that are reaching a certain level of quality that you would only expect in the or that previously you wouldn't expect out of the web through ecosystem so now we're we're finally reaching really high quality applications that that run fully decentralized run a full protocol moving around and downloading all of their assets both the the the images the media the code and so on with full IP FS nodes and a great example of that is audience which is a music a whole music protocol and music a system so definitely check check that out it's a really really awesome awesome platform and it's amazing what they've been able to do with with a deploying IP fast directly to to the phone so if you're interested in hacking on mobile apps definitely check out what they did another great example of that is the Haven and open Bazaar folks they may be that they also deploy to mobile then they built an entire Marketplace on top of IP fast so this is say a fully peer-to-peer decentralized marketplace think of it kind of like eBay but in in or yeah eBay and Shopify stores on to profess and and they have it all working on on mobile as well and there are other other things like origin protocol letting you build build stores and and deploy those with IP facets are also worth mentioning that IPS has been used in a number of humanitarian causes so this is a really really important for us and and the whole a whole lot of the folks that that work on on the stack this is really putting to the test the kind of the why for web 3 at the end of the day the tooling and the tech that we're building is is establishing certain kind of security properties in the network that kind of raised some of the bars in in a and what it's like to to deploy and push out content to the rest of the world so definitely if you're inserting this kind of stuff definitely check it out there's there's a lot of information around the web on on both the distributor we could be in there that made all of Wikipedia be able to to move around the FS network or how it was used in in other in other cases also super happy to report the the which I think it's the one of the reasons we wanted to host this hackathon is is we are seeing the usage of IP has grown tremendously over you know kind of every year and this year we're reaching a pretty significant level of traffic both in the gateway that we run and just in general and in the in the broader network and I think the the recent adoption by by significant browsers enabling ipfs content means that now is a great time for applications that to really kind of go fully active as native and then be able to work in a whole host of browsers also has been great to see just a large ecosystem of a businesses develop around around ipfs and around the idea of of pinning and distributing ipfs content and doing all kinds of other other services so you'll hear more about these folks later please it's been it's been great to see the because of some flourish so that brings me to to falcon which is the last project i'm gonna talk to you about and this is trying to address one of the one of the key questions that i think is left open ipfs talks about addressing and moving around the data but it doesn't force any kind of of storing of the content or anything like that it kind of leaves that up to to either services or businesses or or collaborate collaborations to try and backup stuff together so Falcone is a protocol for building a decentralized storage market that enables just programs to be able to hire storage using cryptocurrency and nothing else so today if you want a higher storage in the internet you effectively have to be a human or an organization and have a credit card this should be should be way way way way easier so the goal of PowerPoint is to build a decentralized efficient and robust foundation for Humanity's information there's a lot embedded in that it includes thinking about the the moats that surround cloud storage and being able to create a model for for anybody to be able to contribute storage and work together to to build build a network to really being able to find and and leverage any kind of cost reduction in the in the surface and so the the kind of vision of Falcone is to be able to to build the network where where instead of a few big players dominating dominating the the Souris landscape we have a large network with with a lot of parties and an open market where anybody can contribute open storage and so we we're building the kind of network where anybody wherever they are I can plug in additional storage and be able to kind of join and serve and serve data I think of it as a kind of two-sided market where there are clients and service providers or miners and the clients who want to store data select from a set of miners and kind of offer offer a contract and and then pick a set of miners to to store the data and then on their turn miners once they agree to a contract and and and I'm now storing the data will have to prove over time that they are indeed storing the data so this is the verifiability component and it's a very important piece where Falcone automatically checks and verifies the data is being kept around and and otherwise enforces penalties and then in terms of retrieval as a second step once parties want to retrieve the data being able to select from any party that has to the content and to get it as fast as possible it's a really really nice property that there were aiming to achieve where ideally you you can build a kind of self scaling CDN where any party that has the content can serve it to you and so that means that there might be agents on the network that are observing traffic and are observing so amount of requests and then can decide to speculatively move content to certain regions and start serving it from there so we want to see a kind of we want to see what happens to the CDN world once you make it an algorithmic trading kind of kind of thing so really aiming to build a large-scale network like this and really enable anybody to to bring bring swords and and turn what is now a very a cloud only three or four really large players are able to control and provide for the world and really create a decentralized and robust infrastructure that anybody can participate in so what does it look like for look like today so we're in the in the kind of later stages of the of the protocol we're aiming to to deploy main that in the in the coming months and we're in the in the process of building out the sights of the market so primarily we're focusing on the storage market and right I'll show some some of the sights on that the retrieval market which is kind of that auto-scaling CDN area is much more much less developed and and that's what until they a great area for for for hacks we're in the homestretch to get to the main net and so this is one of the one of the goals of having the SAC event for us was to to now take all the all the tech that we've been building for for quite a while and put it put it in your hands and see see what you build with it and along the way see what we can improve and why not so in in this period I want to want to highlight just like the vast amounts of storage that we're pulling together so these are actual photos of the storage facilities of a whole bunch of minors that are massing storage to put it on file point and you can find you can look at these on on on the web and there's one one particular the built and a really awesome video that you know takes you gives you a tour of the entire facility and they may have in the hundreds of petabytes of potentially an exit mic so this is the kind of staggering scale that we're talking about this is way beyond all of all of the current data storage of web 3 and in our Testament which is so that's kind of like registered it's kind of like what miners have been saying in the test night where we verify the storage we have you know we decided I think a couple weeks ago and now we've we've amassed 19 petabytes of storage there's 19 petabytes of storage just sitting there right now doing nothing that we could you can use to to be able to store a whole bunch of stuff in so kind of beyond that beyond kind of the mining side there's a whole ecosystem blossoming with groups building different kinds of applications companies being set up - I'll do mining or building services around it there's a whole whole set of folks building wallets and custodian services and so on there's there's now foreign work-in-progress implementations of the protocol and there's a lot of libraries and documentation being running and there's a you know large number of communities around the world that are springing up and I really wanted to highlight a few a few tools that are in development now so one of them is power gate I I think you you're gonna a lot of you may be building on it during the sacrified definitely definitely check it out another is pot gonna discover where we're pulling together a whole bunch of really important data and then providing a pathway for that data to to reach miners so think of it a whole bunch of really critical important valuable data sets and massing them processing them and sending them to miners turns out that once you want to ship petabytes of data you really shouldn't be using the Internet you've got to move it around and ship it physically so we have that entire pipeline set up and if anybody's interested in doing something like this or or dealing with large amounts of data definitely reach out because a lot of the tooling that we built is is there for you to play with and they're also really exciting applications like Starling which are creating a really important kind of verifiable trace of parties storing information that is extremely important to to hold so for example working with groups like the USC Shoah foundation or others to gather really critical and important testimony testimonial video and and records and really make sure that parties are preserving it long-term so this is really critical data then must be around with a verifiable ability trace is something that no other cloud really provides and then there are tools like slate which are now bringing kind of the idea of Falcone and the kind of command line view of a coin into a beautiful user interface that people can can play around with so definitely check this out all of this is open source so you can if you're trying to build a UI or send your components look at this so in really where we are is that the you know we've built the rocket and it's kind of laying in the hangar we're like running the putting the finishing touches and testing a whole bunch of things and pretty soon we're gonna be standing it up and then launching it and so this is kind of a pathway to that and this is why we wanted to host a set of events around it in particularly high confess to now put all of the stackin in your hands and see see what you can do with it great so finishing up so you already here you already know all about hacking fests so won't won't say more about there but I'll definitely recommend you check out the learning resources there's a lot of really useful and valuable links that we're gonna be collecting here this this will be very helpful for you along the way definitely use chat and ask all kinds of questions too to folks leverage office hours and workshops there we are preparing a whole bunch of content for you definitely go to those workshops or watch them there's also a lot of links being passed around for workshops that have been done in the past and recorded definitely check those out as well because they're there they're really really useful as well and and really encourage you to to use chat and talk to us if you get stuck with anything definitely ask questions whatever we can do to to help you get unstuck quickly the better the better we'll go for you and for for the entire hack from the pro class folks these are the ones highlighted on the website and there's a whole bunch of others that are just on the on slack so you can ping any of us and and we're picking some chat in general but these are a number of folks folks that I'm I can hop up and now some quick advice really encourage you to do dive in an experiment um so really try learn learn a lot explore or brainstorm and explore a bunch of things and really use the kind of the first week to do that try try out all kinds of of different areas of the protocols play around with different tools and then and then try to aim for finding an MVP relatively quickly and then once you have a rough idea of that MVP then get into prototyping mode kind of end-to-end there's all kinds of really good reasons it's out there and if you're not familiar with doing this definitely ask on chat and we can we can point you to good resources of how do how to go from hey I have an idea to here's an MVP that I've planned out to them here's the prototype and and now I'm iterating with that prototype and and really can source is enough get help don't let yourself stay plot tons of amazing things get built in hackathons and usually I think the the teams that manage to do that are extremely good at and just keep keep keeping the momentum going and and moving forward and making progress and so really get help from other folks and last but not least really have fun at the end of the day this event is is a is a Grom hackathons are extremely fun we are of course not able to be in the same place but but we we hope is going to be a really really amazing experience for everyone and so really enjoy it so yeah really kind of visualize this kind of thing well your your hacking on things alright I think given given timing I'll cut this part really short which is just want to flesh and give you the idea that when you think about the blockchain in the last few years you know in 2009 it seemed like Bitcoin was amazing and it couldn't really be improved or maybe people thought it could be improved but everyone's just really stoked with it by 2012 it you know the pain points were really really clear and the theorem came in to radically improve all kinds of things and then from there's this amazing ecosystem sprang sprang out where all kinds of systems and applications got built by just improving a few of the key characteristics of of Bitcoin and so turning going from to a much faster transaction time going to a much better programming language going to a much better programming model and building much better developer tooling just enabled massive amount of applications and systems to be built and and now we're seeing the same kind of thing happening we're now kind of eath one where where everybody's feeling the pain points we're seeing the the issues and now a whole host of new systems and applications are a new block chains are being built to kind of address those those problems in those pain points including a theorem - and so really you know pay attention to these characteristics and how and they're improving rates what's going to happen over the next with the tech that's being developed now and over the next year is going to create another wave kind of like this one with all kinds of new applications and systems and so this is going to be an extremely extremely powerful wave so when you think of all of these systems that are getting launched and deployed over this year and next year this is going to be you know radically transformed the entire web 3 landscape and finally I think started hitting in much larger scales kind of the web - landscape as well so really getting to you know 10 xing or 100 xing the transaction per second throughput of blockchains or really enabling the storage of you know exabytes level of data that's when when we're free can finally be able to kind of contend with with web 2 and so it's gonna be a massive wave but you've got a set of paddling now so I think this this web will really hit kind of in 2021 at some point and so if you want to build an application and be part of that large large move you got us our building now and in the next few months great so that's all for me thank you so much and I'll hand it back right to you so much this was absolutely incredible it actually ends up summarizing a lot of points was gonna make but uh to to kind of echo what Ron just said I think this is perfectly the right time and that inflection point for a lot of this thing to to be utilized by all of us so we can quickly test this out we actually can develop the right abstraction so that and the tools we need to make high level applications that it would find useful and more more interestingly this is kind of the goal here which is how do we make seamless apps that provide value and and the end user it doesn't notice anything behind these things in terms of trade-offs or speed whether that's P or flexibility on what they can cannot do so pakka fess and just generally the the ipfs on the protocol labs in the phone ecosystem and the paste Iraq will really be the kind of a goal from our side to help accelerate that to be ready for primetime and interestingly a lot of the projects that we're just talked about in this talk are here for this event to help us accelerate our development for for the hackathon projects and I know some of you have already kind of heard about these companies but I want to quickly give a shout out to all the companies and that RSO sponsors of course protocol labs and we have unstoppable domains we have textile fleek consensus in Fira unlock protocol because of meta mask ceramic network the graph pinata three box the theorem foundation equilibrium orbit DB eiope FS main and ENS who will be here with us throughout this entire event helping everybody here with anything that's technical around their protocols and SDKs and the ifs and Falcone ecosystem but also just generally to help you with any technical questions that you may have about getting your project ready so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to have some of our sponsors come on and I share a bit about themselves and by the recited to participate at hack FS and also talk about a handful of prizes that they're offering and with that I'd like to call up first Brett from fleek who is going to go well fleek is and how they're planning on making us an awesome event for you awesome thanks so much awesome talk Juan makes for handover yes so my name is Brett Jairam the co-founder and CEO at fleek we are a modern web development platform built on top of IP FS we have a few different products you can use during this hackathon to make your development life easier on top PFS we have our hosting product storage product and then our just very recently announced space diamond so I'll cover those pretty quickly okay go to the next one yeah so Quan mentioned hosting your front end of your DAP and he mentioned fleek as an option so yeah we're the easiest way a few clicks to get your to get your application your web app your front-end host on an IP FS you just connect your github set your build settings and click deploy it's that simple we also detect any frameworks you might be using if it's a crate react app or hugo site or whatever other static sites might use it's very very quick deployment and we have a built in CDN that makes it really performant as well as a bunch of other features like SSL certs you can connect TNS domains directly to the UI really easily and some other stuff as well so the prize for using fleek hosting is going to be $100 to 10 teams so all I have to do is just use the the hosting product to host your site or the front of your app and we'll be looking out for that and handing out prizes for it and here's some resources so we have a bunch of documentation on how to use it different we have a blog post for like every single type of static site you might use as well as YouTube videos that you can watch to walk you through it's a pretty simple process this is a fleet storage so this is a really easy performant way to store your files on ipfs so images videos etc we have a web app UI as well as fleek Jas the UI you can visualize and see all the folder the files EFS hashes of those and like download them just you ought to manage it kind of like a sort of Amazon s3 type UI and then we also have the fleet Jas library which is a really really easy to use JavaScript library that you can import into your project and has a lot of different methods for just pinning uploading fetching files really simply so that also has a built in CDN has image compression and resizing so that fetching the files uploading files is extremely quick so for that just for using that in your product and your projects or your teams as well we'll be doing we'll be giving out $100 to temp teams surprise and then here's a bunch of resources we have a lot of documentation on storage we have documentation around the the fleet Jas library blog posts how usually we also have YouTube tutorials on each that will go through each of the different methods and how to get set up really easily and then just very recently released is the space daemon so this is a JavaScript client and library that makes it very easy to develop peer-to-peer and privacy focused apps its packages together IP a fast textile and until like one daemon that's very easy to install and download so that you can kind of get going building apps for different types of use cases really easily on top of them so we've exposed like JavaScript library that has this daemon already built into it so that it's just a set of a set of methods that are really easy to use that are pretty much like built around the use cases of like being able to store files privately sharing files selectively so like you know peer-to-peer directly to one other person or creating teams and having them between teams those kind of use cases as well as like an application interface so that like for instance you could have an app store files like in the user space like user control data interacting with applications so we'll definitely be around and we'll be helping out with and we're also getting a workshop on this so this is kind of this is someone who's released and we're actually using it ourselves to build an app right now so that app will be announced like fairly soon and yeah so we'll be around on be giving workshops for that as well the the price for this is three thousand dollars to a first-place team yeah a bunch of resources it's completely open source here's a github repo to the client which has like and then all the documentation is on our Doc's page where you can see all the different methods available you can use to get set up and build the Peter Peter privacy focus apps really easily and then our blog post we just put out so yeah well that would give me a workshop on that Wednesday at 10:30 on the Damon on the space Damon and you can find us around we'll be on slack and we'll be in the slack answering questions we'll have work office hours and everything so thanks so much really excited for the act though thank you so much Brett I'm also proud to announce that I confessed calm itself is also hosted on on fleek and it is indeed as easy as he mentions next up we have Brad from unstoppable domains and I'll let Brad talk about why they're excited to be at I confess alright thanks a bunch for putting everything together there so I'm Brad I'm co-founder of unstoppable domains we're building onboarding tools for the decentralized web and we built two block chain domain registries one is crypto which is on aetherium a registrar called ensembl domains calm and we're also building tools for non-technical users to launch ipfs public websites we've had more than 15,000 and web sites launch in the past few months on ipfs using our tools and these are again non-technical users so we've got two prizes one is so we actually we just built a chat protocol that we're calling d chat which is built on a peer-to-peer network uses blockchain domains as user names and so our first prize is four thousand dollars to build a decentralized chat protocol on ipfs so you could use threads DB or bid DB I just saw textile flash there good timing or other decentralized EB tech it must use IP FS you must have a working chat app with like a web 3 connect where you're going to be signing in assigning a message with your private key that controls the domain name in order to do sign-in and it needs to work for both crypto and daddies so that's our big prize a peer-to-peer chat the second one is another four thousand dollar prize pool for launching cool ipfs web sites will give you so there's three prizes here that we're gonna split will give you a free crypto domain too and we're looking for interesting apps like douse content with paywall decentralized reddit etc will be doing a technical talk on Wednesday we have all of this information including links to technical information in our dock so please reach out and if you have other ideas also let us know thanks a bunch thank you so much bread next up we have angel from textile and I'll let Andrew a little bit about what textile is to everybody hello hak FS super excited to be here yeah so we're sponsoring a bunch of different prices if you've followed us for a while you know that we're huge fans of ipfs and bio and so we really just want to help you build awesome things so one of the big areas that we're gonna focus on this month is the power gate and so we had a workshop on the power gate last week it's recorded on a video so you can go review that but we have two prizes of $1,000 for the best apps that build on the power gate if you didn't make the talk about the power game the power gate is a really powerful API that wraps file coin and ipfs for app developers and people building systems where they want to do management of datasets on file coin but make that data available and fast and do deal management and stuff in a very specific way and so definitely check that out I think it can power a lot of different apps and use cases and a bunch of people already building on it so - $1,000 prizes there we're also going to have a workshop tomorrow evening my time on textiles technologies called buckets and threads so threads are decentralized databases they're for moving your metadata user information around in an encrypted and user owned way they're meant to be interoperable data sets for ipfs dynamic data sets and buckets are a technology that allows you to move dynamic folders of data around and they're highly interoperable and you can you can create a bucket that all buckets of IP NS addresses you can change the data in them and they'll constantly be updating your IP FS hash addresses for the data they also get HTTP endpoints we provide web sites for buckets that you create and we just launched encrypted versions of those - and what's really cool is you as developer can use these technologies but you can also hand them over to your users of your app so that your users can own buckets and threads and so we're going to workshop on those things tomorrow we'll also show you some really cool things that you'll as a special hack FS audience you'll be able to take advantage of some buckets meet power gate meet file coin API is that we're not making available publicly yet but so we have three prizes of $500 each for just best uses of buckets and best uses of threads so if you're building dynamic apps if you're just trying to host data on ipfs these are great for you just to get going there's go clients JavaScript clients api's everything you can imagine and then the next three prizes are just specific specific kinds of apps react app react native app we have a $500 prize for best react native app that uses the textile libraries or api's another $500 prize for the best browser app and then a $500 prize for the best desktop app and we definitely encourage people to try to double dip in there and take as many as they can use the power gate use buckets and create a react app and you can get a lot of prizes so and then we're just here to help I'm with my team Aaron Ignacio sander and the world-famous Carson farmer just here to help you so if you have any problems with ipfs or using file corn or textile find us on slack and annoy us and just send us a lot of questions because we're here to help as much as we can and yeah good luck hacking thank you so much Andrew and lastly we have Gabe from consensus awesome solid lineup hi everyone this is Gabriel Anderson I'm the managing director of tachyon attack ends its 12-week accelerator program to bring the bring to market the best of all three technologies we're part of consensus which I would assume most people know but consensus is a market-leading blockchain technology company we're dedicated to transforming the world's digital architecture into more open inclusive and secure internet of value something that one eluded to that we would all call the web 2.0 we actually have two divisions two consensus the first is our world-class aetherium software technology arm both are dedicated to building the infrastructure the applications and the practices that enable a decentralized world since 2014 consensus is incubated and invest in in over a hundred companies across the etherium ecosystem including some of the pillars that all of you use day in and day out like in Fura meta masks truffle sweet Pegasus and three bucks we're really excited to be a part of pack FS I think you know we came out of the etherium community and continue to build and support within the etherium community so we've got representatives from our software software side of our business our developer relations community and also our Ventures arm here to support you guys so come and find us on slack reach out to us we'd love to to chat with you especially as you as you start hacking you'll see us holding workshops demoing some new versions of our software I believe Jacob for the metamath team is gonna be demoing the 8 of meta mask and so that's really exciting and then we've got a number of special announcements that we're gonna be making over the course of the next 30 days but I think more importantly we're just really excited to see what amazing things get built by all of you and support views we've collectively work to make our vision of web 3 you know become reality and and really transform the world for the better we're extremely extremely bullish on the overlap of aetherium and ipfs Philo coin and I think events like these are just really important for us to bring forth that vision and that we all share so we're sad to see what you guys build and you know good luck out there hacking thank you so much gate I want to echo the same sentiment we're super excited to to make sure that both ecosystems get to collaborate even at a more deeper level and so I can't be king look I'm looking forward to seeing what everybody makes at the end so those were just some of our sponsors but that's not all of them so what actually want to do is just go over some of the prizes and also repeat them with the prize that the last response I've also set out I'm just gonna quickly go over them and make sure that everybody here is quickly aware of what these prices are so as we mentioned or as Brett mentioned for fleek there's $5,000 worth of prizes that are available for the using big storage hosting or the space liman next up we have textile where you have $5,000 in prizes for using power gate you're using textile bucket or threats DB in also creating the creating a react native app or browser or any other desktop apps through a textile as Brad talked about or unstoppable we have $8,000 worth of prizes available for using and building a decentralized chat API and making an app on top of chat and then also for a novel table crypto domain website next up we actually have the theorem foundation where we have 20 thousand dollars in prizes for the best use and the improvement implementation of any e2 and the p2p related hack there's going to be a lot more documentation available on slack and also on our prizes page and this is also an opportunity for everybody to get the latest update on what's happening with leads to and then also for two other categories that will be doing this thing would be their foundations and that is an app that helps reinforce the the goal of differential privacy and also a decentralized social media application and from looking at a lot of the applications from all of our hackers I'm sure this one will be an easy one for for a lot of you to that next up we have three bucks and there's three thousand dollars available in prizes for the best use of Reeboks api or for using a cross app chat box or creating a notify leaderboard using the three box protocols and SDKs then we have $1,000 from the pinata team for the best use of using pinata cloud and then we also have two thousand dollars up for grabs from the graph protocol for using and creating a new sub graph on the etherium ecosystem and then using that in your hack and lastly there's $50,000 worth of prizes available for this event thanks to the generous support of protocol labs and these this amount will be divided into the best use of apps that are building on top of full coin testing a domain net and the tools and services around the clock wound ecosystem and then of course overlapping them with the the best use of ipfs and the p2p and the general tools around this ecosystem and there's also a few more prizes that we're working on finalizing the details war from the state channels meta massive fear and the e NS team in law that will be available over the next couple of days to everybody attending if you want to find out more about the criteria in these prizes in general you can just head over to hack FS comm slash prices and you'll see the page with all these prizes that I just talked about and more immediately now we got just a little bit time left and want to just quickly go over through some of the logistics for this event the first and the most important part here is that all communication will be on slack from Iran slack is the place to be here everybody who has staked and applied for this event is already on or should be on the slack channel from from our side you would have been invited by the equivalent to join the slack a reminder that these are private channels for the participants so if you have not been added to this slack please email us or message us on the global team or the protocol lab slack for us to add you to these channels so you can see everything that's going on with respect to all the other teams the events and the talks and the workshops and just mentor support and we'll be able to set you up immediately because all of this thing is asynchronous slack will be our our main point of contact and communication for the rest of this event there's also dedicated mentor and sponsor channels to help you be unblocked from any issues you may be facing so you'll be able to reach out to specific companies and also mentors directly through the haka fest now to answer this really quickly how does this hackathon actually work the the general rule and and setup here is that the hackathon officially kicks off today and what that means is that as of right now you can start coding and you can start building everything you talked about in your application we're super excited to see what you'll kind of all build and the quick note on on building a project for this event is that you can obviously work on teams and if you are working on a team a team can be up to five people and the only rule here is that your hack must be new and must begin during the course of this event which means from now for the next four weeks this is in place to make sure that everything is fair for everybody else is also competing and even though you are free to use any open source library or work that is available for anybody to use we just want to make sure that nobody is immediately explained on just extending the part the the previous work they have done and and presenting that over the course of this event to our judges so a lot of you've already emailed us about some of the edge cases or some of the the gray areas of where you may fall in to those of you who emailed that we would have already clarified and answered them back to you but if you think you are in a position where you're not sure if your hack is going to be considered new or or a built on to a previous work just message us again on slack or email and you'll be able to clarify that and address that for you and generally speaking a lot of us are here from the kirim ecosystem and a lot of us are here from the fall Queen and the ipfs ecosystem and the most common question we got is how do I actually make sure that what I'm doing is is okay for this events and the check for that is simple we want this thing to be a very inclusive event so if you're hacking racks with all coin IPF a sleepy dopey or any of the broader a theorem in the protocol apps ecosystem you were qualified to work on your projects for this event and a lot of you've already asked us what does it mean for my theory and where my doubts you be compatible for with the IPF isn't about when you go system we actually have a lot of content and workshops available for that and as of actually this morning we also have a a scalpel repo that you'll be able to quickly use to quickly get started with deploying your app or any smart contract and integrating that with the ipfs ecosystem and of course through the use of the textile and power gate you'll be able to also deploy these things directly to take online and we have a lot of that coming up over the next few days through our workshops and our messages and communications to you on slack so if you think you have any questions about how to use and integrate this thing with the the ipfs ecosystem or we're here to help and ask and answer any questions that you have for us and then lastly a lot of you also asked us about what does it mean to do a checking and how does thinking work so the quick answer on that is the check-ins are here for us to make sure that you are not blocked in accomplishing your goals so the way this is going to be structured is that over the next four weeks we're going to be setting up a checking with every team that'll happen at least once a week and the checking is very simple it's just for us to understand how the project has been going since last we chatted and if you're stuck on anything and if you are how do we actually make sure that you are not blocked or if you're you get to help you need whether it's anything technical or any advice or a feedback from our mentors of our sponsors or anybody else in this ecosystem this is an opportunity for us to connect you with any people that may be able to help you quickly accomplish your goal and be unblocked and we'll be doing these things asynchronously on slack we'll reach out to you the evil team will reach out to each of these each of the teams participating and just quickly do this weekly check-in that won't be they are super short and behave like stand-ups and this helps us ensure that everything is on track for all of us and also that you're getting all the help you need and as a result after you are responding to all their check-ins justice can all you have to do to confirm in qualify for the state to be returned and any other additional questions can be addressed by us on on slack and a lot of you are so in the phases of figuring out why you might want to hack on or you're looking for other teammates so the good news on that is that we've already set up a lot of these channels on the attendee slack where you can go to it that's your best find a team and look for other people who are looking for other teammates and kind of talk to them about those skills you have and the complementary skills they're looking to get for your idea but also go and introduce yourself in the interest Channel and tell us about we're centered about what you're working on where you're from we want to learn as much as we can about you to help you succeed at this event and and also for the people who are looking for ideas but I have a team or looking to actually think about what is it that you want to work on and is worth working on we have a ideas channel set up as well where a lot of our mentors are the global team and all the other hackers are contributing different ideas that we think would be cool that have the best of both from the theorem and the Falcon ecosystem and of course if you are looking for a team a lot of you've indicated on the application that you're looking for teammates we did a brainstorming session just last week but there's also going to be a session my matchmaking finding other teammates this Wednesday and you'll be able to kind of join that call and find other teammates if you're still in a position to get additional members for your team and of course I know I've said the word team a lot and we talked about how teams and ideas work but there's no requirement for you to work on your team it is totally okay for you to to hack solo we want this thing to be a place where you feel comfortable with building and learning about what you want to do here so obviously it is a lot easier to hack on things when you have a few people you can share the workload with but it's totally okay for you to work in something something on your own and of course if you're looking for ideas still we also made this really cool document doc which you can find on a confessed comm slash ideas and you will see all the top ideas we think are just super cool to work on that taking into account all the different themes whether it's an audio or video related hack whether it's mining or or networking or just really cool apps that we think would be cool to integrate defy and others might contract related applications and lastly the event is four weeks so today is the 6th of July in submissions for all the event or the hacks will be due at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the 6th of August so we'll be following up with a lot of you on how the submission works over the next couple of weeks and also through all through your check-ins but I want to just put this up easily as a reminder that a four weeks from now is when all the hacks are going to be due and just give you a quick update on what the next four weeks will look like of course everything will be asynchronous so you are free to work on on your own schedule but we have this event broken down into four weeks and a week five where the fifth week is about going through all the judging after their submissions and at the end of week four but this week we have obviously this kickoff call we'll have a team formation session that I talked about to find more to have all of you find other teammates that's going to be on Wednesday and we have a lot of workshops and office hours for all of the teams here and hackers here and these things basically work as an opportunity for you to talk to our sponsors and just the the protocol allows and the etherium teams to just get help on anything you have questions about whether there anything informal or just you have any questions about how something can work or would work or is something even possible you can just kind of hop on to a call and quickly ask a question and then hop out and then the workshops will work as a way for you to have a more structured way of learning and then we have the same workshop so now if it's hours repeat just the office hours repeat every week and they're also going to be feedback sessions and AMA is with a lot of the founders and the people in this ecosystem and and in everything that is going to be happening here over the course of the month will be recorded and made available for everybody to watch so if you are not in a position to come online and watch them live whether it's a timezone issue you have a conflict you can just go over to hoc FS calm and simply watch the video directly on YouTube so a lot of you who said they were mad at you were not able to join week zero talks all of them already available on on the website so you just head over to Alec FS calm and you can click on any of the schedule items and just watch that recording immediately and then of course what you can also do is go to a confessed comm slash calendar and this will open up a Google Calendar link which you can subscribe to so you can have all these events with the zoom links and all the other direct times and links to joining these calls available and sync directly to your own calendar through this link and we'll be announcing all these things on its like as well so lastly what I want to really do is emphasize that this is a four week long event so we want you to really pace yourself we don't want this thing to be exhaustive we want this to be actually fun for you we don't want this thing to seem like work this is again an opportunity for all of us to experiment and learn more about what is possible and what else we can do this thing I do here to take this to the next level so don't don't burn yourself and doing this this is very much about having fun and learning and understanding what is and isn't possible with what the technologies that we have available to us so make sure that you are you are hacking responsibly and uh again this is very much designed to be a learning experience for all of us so take advantage of these workshops and office hours and try to get a really good understanding of how these things are being structured and what we're thinking about as we design these tools for the future so if you have any other questions we have a long list of FA cues and answers already from the common things we hear over emails set up on a dock and you can head over to hack FS comm slash hacker and this should address 80% of the things that you want to know about already and everything else that we haven't addressed please feel free to message us on slack or email and we'll be happy to answer them for you and lastly I want to just emphasize that we have a good code of conduct that we want to follow for this event and this is in addition to the Horta collapse code of conduct and to find out more of how the code of conduct is structured you can just go to each global co / rules and you'll see the code of conduct and the rules for participating at this event but to summarize please be respectful to everybody out there that is participating in this event and just in general to these slack communities and harassment and abuse are never tolerated in any capacity so if you think somebody is acting the way they shouldn't please let anybody from these global team know and will take immediate action to rectify the situation so with that I want to thank everybody for being with us and I want to wish everybody a happy hacking and I'll see you all on slack enjoy the rest of your Monday and looking forward to hacking with all of you for a cthis thank you so much bye everybody
