foreign [Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you're calling from uh we have Fabio here from push protocol who's going to be doing a workshop on how to power your fbm app using push protocol if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and Fabio will be more than happy to answer them now with that being said I will pass the mic off to Fabio yeah thank you Anna hey everyone thank you so much for being here today so my name is Fabio I work at Bush I'm working on the back end team and so today we're going to be talking about what is very technical Workshop so first off we're going to be talking about what is publish and I think most importantly what problems bush is solving and in the end we're gonna be doing some Workshop uh he could then which issue different ways of how you can debate push barrel hole into your debt with your back end with your smart contractor suppressed so first of all something that we always say is that everything starts with some notification right and Bush wasn't projecting from if Global back in 2020 and almost three years later we're heading to be now sponsoring the hackathons something that we came from and it was yeah it's very nice looking back to see how much has happened those three years so the I think the most important question is um foreign so there are a lot of missing pieces in web 3 and I think one of the missing pieces that we had we're currently having is improve the user experience and let's just give you an example so more specifically an example about modifications so for example everything that we do we in our traditional Digital Life everything starts with a verification what do I mean by this it's not like I'm constantly on Gmail refreshing to see if I have a new email right so how do I know I have my new email well I just received my notification and from the verifications I can see the I received an email or when someone sends a message on telegram I receive a notification and then throw the notification I do some action like the telegram and I can see that someone has message made so in web 2 that's how we go by Our Lives we receive a notification and then based on the notification we can take some action if we think about it in word tree we still don't have the same music experience that we had in web 2. so for example pro quality and expect users to come back to the protocol in fact the information themselves so for example how do we know today there is a new governance proposal for your favorite towel well we have to be very accessible Discord or Twitter to keep keeping yourself updated if there's any new proposal for your results or or for example how do you know if you're about to get liquidated in 85 protocol well you as a user as a repeated provider have to concentrate chatting your collateral ratio to see if you're gonna get liquidated would be much easier from the user perspective to receive a notification whenever some whenever an event stay interested me instead of me going to the protocol and fascinating Mission itself and this is exactly what pushburgh calls did so we're breaking the web the web to user experience into web3 and the applications for these are pretty endless so as I said for governance you can receive notifications Whenever there is a new governance proposal verify whenever you're about to get liquidated you can get a notification you can get a notification whenever someone out beats you on a nft Marketplace or for example you should follow an nft artist will be super nice to get notified whenever this artist publishes a new collection and I think the beauty of the notifications powered by which will call is that they are completely customizable so if I have a use case in mind for notifications how to edit notifications for a protocol is completely flexible I'm going to show you how you do to do this later but there are different ways how I can do this so what is the solution that much protocol is building so it's a digitalized communication protocol it's an open communication layer so that means is anyone can simply tackle to the network and size the modifications to themselves and I think very important it's very important to note that the negative situations they are tied to wallet addresses in web 3 your identities are wallet address so we're sending notifications to your wallet address and this is up since it's a local network anyone can simply tag into the more Network and say hey even with all the notifications that I have for this wall here the notifications they are completely Dynamic that means that what's going to trigger the notification how the notification looks like it's all customizable by you you can you have 100 control well the look and scenes of the verification and the notifications is multijank so we start paintball material but now we are in multiple Union chains its gases um that means that for a sign in notifications you want to send notification off chain each computer gas gas list all you have to do is just assign a transaction and spat for agnostic delivery where we test the beauty of this it's because any performance can speed the notifications so you don't need to install a push protocol browser extension or a mobile ad to display the notifications we have set of reactable borders that you can records into your tab to display the notifications right there so users don't need to know that they have received a notification for publish Pro all they just receive the notifications right so because that's how we're dealing with web 2. just receive the notification we don't care how the notifications and Link words I just want to get notified about things that I care and that's what we are doing so in push we have sent over a 2 million notifications we had over 60 000 subscribers subscribers that are wallets they opting to receive web applications and we have over 100 Integrations that means over 100 different use cases for verifications and I think in some awesome notifications by itself that they are only useful if you save value with them nobody wants to get notifications from things they do not care so notifications should have different use cases things that occur that you as in use at user ID just adding so we have different use cases for our modification or this is just one handful of specification but but types of knowledge pieces that we have and we call them friends of bush so we have different case for notification for example for unit Swap all together gdal or git coin cryptocurrency jobs and I can give them except another example as a notification imagine for cryptocurrency jobs Whenever there is a new job post you can get notified on your wallet address that there's a will both stray for example for the Defiance let's say whenever there is a new post you can get notified or new wallets when navigating a post for you to read so much started back in Chinese we were previously epns if you're in push notification service and now we have to be branded to push and we started with notifications back in 2020. almost three years later we're now happy to announce that we took the notifications one step further and now we announced something called push chats so with some web transmission platform provided by Bush that every notification sends on the protocol they have a long brain notification so if I send a message from my wallet to our wallet you will receive a notification there and the idea is where they could all the web true experience that we have for example for WhatsApp or Telegram and then bringing this web tree so the experience for sending messages and receiving messages are receiving notifications on your messaging platform will be the same as you do on those web platforms that we are we're used to so this here on the left is how did that looks like so it's just a classic uh medicine platform unless I we added here that's how the notifications look like on your soul and here on the right we did a demo on Defcon this is a demo that we did for push video so we added on top of us wallet wallet messaging video calls as well so you can not only message the same verifications but you can also be seen video calls on the bushburg so we have well this the date of 2020 at the beginning of 2023 is going to be a super exciting year for Bush Burger um atoms of new feature are coming so we have bestie game so to integrate push for a call we're gonna go over to SDK um differently it's helping with publishing ours to take we uh we have mobile alertifications we also have some SDK for this we are currently working long chats in very soon we're going to announce the seducation in the chat privacy chat as well we're all done the information all the metadata for a check is going to be encrypted and so on and so forth and here the right is just a prototype was halted the mobile app for the chat uh looked a couple months ago but now has completely changed yeah so let's start with the Devil so first off just looking up show you guys how how the depths look like and I'm just logging here shooting metamask so yeah and only let them switching maintenance and then Bobby cool so the the apps for which protocol is at dot push dollar so on bushberg call we have a concept of channels right so and the analogy is the same as a YouTube channel we had so we have different channels here and you as an invisible Camp opt-in to receive notifications from those channels here so for example we have maker dial lens or above let's say for example I am interested in using modifications problem you know let's say hey I want you I want to be another side whenever there is a new when I'm okay now sends a notification I'm interested in seeing those notifications me as an end user all I have to delete is clicking octave all I have to do is just sign a message and then boom now whenever there is a new notification by tidal problem I'll get water slide so for the end user they don't page you receive the notifications and or the center of the notification button if you send off chain notifications then you'll obey or will only pay for send own change notification so now let's take a look I've opted to receive a notification right so in this example we're just update to receive notifications from Key dial now let's Snoop into the other side let's see how we can send the notifications so once I have up to receive notifications let's start sending notifications so to set a notification all I have to do is first to create a channel so I have a channel that I have previously created here but what I can do I can just create a brand new wallage here just show you guys how does it look to create a channel it's great here and use correct oh so this is the UI screen on the Channel all you have to do is to stay click the bush and then you need to pay the the transaction says for this but if you go to staging.ph.org station.bush.org that's our test nuts URL so we can create n channels here uh for free now let's say English say push and fake to allowed to the create a channel is just the channel name you set the network you add a channel description and then you end here the URL from your Channel once you do this just up there upload the noodle and then you have your Channel created I had it previously cleared the channel here want to create a channel this is how it looks like this is how the device like and I have a channel here now let's send the notification let's show you guys I'll select so if I come back here so I have here on the right what I'm gonna do is here on the right I'm going to opt in to receive notifications from this channel here on the left and then I'm going to show you how you can see the notifications so I go to statement.coach.org you can go to channels so how does it my channels on my channel small demo Channel let's move from my channel and I already opt into my channel so whenever this channel sends a notification oh you receive it so now let's receive the notification I click here on send notification so there are three types of notification there is broadcast targeted and subset a broadcast notification that means hey notify all the subscribers of my channel the targeted notification is hate notified that address and the third one is subset which is notified this array of addresses in this case let's send the broadcast notification to notify all the subscribers of my channel the notification can have a title call it hello world heck and this is going to be the payment application here below we'll see how to notification inside now let's even send notification but I'm back yeah I must opens all I have to do is sign a message and the notification has itself so if cycle the other browser in my box here and I see the notification that I just sent it's here not only this we have a mobile app so we're going to receiving push notification on your phone whenever there is any notification you're gonna receive we have a browser accessation here as well so we're gonna see see more notifications here hello word every and you delete as I said before you don't need to rely and push from tense to display the notification you can display those notifications on your own tab as well all I have to do is just import two reaction components that we have so we have set notifications manually now let's see how to send notifications using the SDK in the JavaScript best decade let me show you guys what you click all this code here is in our repo um it's a number of docs actually I just took this from the docs and where is the dots so if you go to docs.wash daughter we click on developer Docs in this all the docs so if you set the notification here we have a section called send load applications and here we we had different demos um or different ways how we can send verification that's so notifications using the SDK so hit here sending notifications using push SDK and all I did I just copied and pasted portal gear and I had to be here so all this code is doing here is let me move this so always doing is to send a notification using the SDK we just need trade information first of all is the private key from the channel you're sending a notification from and the private key is going to be the private key from the wallet to create a channel so in this example here from my channel here called General demo channel the problem is going to be the private key from this wallet here we'll just export the private key I added this environment variable and I just prepared with 0x then I'm just using either just get the signer and now we just need actually one more information but in this case I have two here I have the channel address all right and the channel address it's gonna be these others here now just copying base here and as you can see the address has eap155 colon 5 column so we're just add in here inside we call this 10 format we're just saying that this address is on generating 5 which is really so we just paste here address and then in this case with this example we're assigning a targeted modification which means hey notify only the settings here and this address here should be this one which is a language it's got this yeah they're just gonna copy this address here and we options yeah option cool so I'm just gonna copy these edges here and that should be the rest all of these are just copied on the docs so if I come here and I just run this code so I set the multiplication so if I come back here click on the inbox and let's see this notification with a bunch of X with x the water added here and that's it so if I come here to the brother extension all I can do is logging my account here man let's receive notification here while you receive a notification on your mobile app or whatever you want to see if you see the verification on my second questions here how does push broker work under the to get messages from any mattress can you talk about underline mechanism package of course so how ultimately how much probable work under this but we have something called push notes it's a natural curve we call them communication models and all they do is to index communication so whenever you send a notification for example using the SDK all you're doing is talking to the pushing Network and then the question actually is calling The Accidental modification and then we're having node called delivery modes and these nodes responsible for dispatching the notifications so all the indexing inspecting the notification is done by this push Network and as of now it's a decentralized network and as of now the network that is run by push barocco and we're in the work of the center like this and the end goal is for the community to be able to work this this network and actually get incentivized uh by running it but before contributing to the centralization of the network though the key part of here is the the pushing node does it mean if you don't cause a little message angry as ask this question in yes correct so the demo that we didn't work without for a push video is exactly this so all the that itself if you come here push I will push that we have a section here called chest just click here it's about here this is how push chat moves later right and the demo that we did on mobile was there was a video but up there I just clicked here and I just video chat to the other address so the other address is really similarification exactly I'll be doing web 2 will receive a notifications say hey this address is calling you and you just accept and then you start the heater all I'm just doing some argument here in I see third question here I created a channel using the wrong website and update the Channel with localhost that is totally Edward asked this question if he can update um a channel setting yes now you kept before recruited oh so next move on it's there um with the Devil so we send notifications using the SDK I want to show you guys something very very nice that we personally like a lot which is how to display the notifications on your dad um so I haven't created a code here able game starts so this is how to display the notifications only up on that right so here so let me show you where the school is from so they go to speed notifications I just got from the docs as well so if you go to dock stepbush.word you go to receiving notifications more integration ends integrating logistic patients so all the codes that I'm I showed there it's here on the docs Integrity for them that's user Channel games so all these floaties blooming here show you the edit results we have a reactive opponent that displays the notification makes it act like this so these were some demos that I was doing the concept notifications they're putting that out so we can import this on your own data display notification pair so you don't need to tell your users to go change for alternative Communications I only did call to do this this is pretty straightforward it's just Mitsubishi yes so all it does is we have a reactional Bones called notification writing and please notification items responsible for randomly developmentations like this as we can see here and this is getting called Walton or a common base yeah and this is called by the Black Mirror London current Channel that's generous yep and that notification won't balance here who's being called here on the app.js and all it's doing is where we're using the Restless wrestling apis to get to get the modifications yeah we're just using the push SDK get seeds solution check out the notifications and then we'll pass the notifications get the area made vision and that we pass theory of notifications cheat direct problems that we had those three straightforgens played in notification level that but please if you have any questions just ask me can ask us on this word me personally I will be in this word answering all the questions and we'll have a lot of team members that are accessible to help to assist you in any questions there are other lists to send notifications but I'll just briefly touch up on them first of all you can send all chain notifications as well and what does it mean for example let's say that you have a smart contract then from Bismarck contract itself you want to notify another wallet that something happened on your smart contract you can do this click on sending notifications using smart contracts and here all you have to do is to do a function call to the push or call Smart contract and all the rest taken care of we take the event and transform the imagination notification and then we'll inspect the notification we also have another great system notification which is by using sub graphs so it perhaps subgraph you should if you already have an existing breath you don't have to change anything to start saying what conditions from the sub graph itself we haven't we have a helper voucher the internet works and from the helper function itself they will provide we take care of getting them getting the the events and respecting Innovation very I Circle more questions here is yes so we're on SDM as of now so I think we're gonna be deploying this on to our link that by tomorrow so I would say probably about tomorrow morning BTC generate starts sending notifications from fbm whether they are all chaining off chain manual using the SDK the push protocol has been developed from the ground up to be UGM compatible and in future we're going to be an auto game chance as well non-exam chance as well but yes much more original applications here music pushes the game can we make which group chats ourselves basically instead of using chat components if you use this decrease makeup group chat that's a good question um you can so basically you can use for General replicated book and assess that for example I send a message to a group that we have three members I can send the same message to all the other members so you can manually create a group but attribute is just iterate over the the people want to send message and send to them uh yes they'll do um or ask this question the answering yes would be uh plus what you did um all you have to do is to Loop over the people you want to send messages and then send a message and they're going to get notification whatever days they receive a message but what I can say is we're almost done with the group chats um implementation SDK so what I can say is uh the couple weeks we're gonna launch this single you you can just use the the chat reaction hold it and we're gonna be doing on your behalf so we just care on your logic but if you want to do me the second top this please go ahead okay this I hope I answered your question um another question here is India hackathon continue recently my group had used which protocols and you guys had provided apig will the API key also no that's not easy question yes um it should not be you can use the semi package no problem you should need any uh another just because something squared damage does this work with the smart contract address as well or we need a list since we do not have interfaced Smart contract light blue foreign [Music] yeah please help the notification looks like what you can turn your notification uncheck and we ask the question is it available Library space currently in low um not currently another question from sohub can you give us some insights on albums push chat to a gas and storage action so that whenever I send a chat message is they are not stored on chain so they're a gasless because the check message in their store only DFS on their BF fast in my troops so there's no cost to send chat messages so each check message or notifications not they're not stored don't change their start or the push Network or ipfs it's a little flexible so for this reason you don't pay per message that's why uh we don't have to pay anything we can put arbitrary gases yeah I think that's that was all the questions if I had any other questions just about this part I don't feel like I think that's it um thank you so much we're we're being here what's Adam yeah thanks Fabio for doing this awesome workshop for the spacebar Packers um this will be a great resource as people do their hacks and for the future um and thanks so much for the rest of you for tuning in uh we do have another Workshop in a couple hours so hope to see you there um and with that being said I hope everyone has a great rest of your day
