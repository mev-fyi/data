hi my name is johannes and i'm the co-founder of nfd port welcome to eath online we hope that you're going to have an excellent hackathon and nfd port is described for nfts a one-stop and simple nfd infrastructure and apis for developers so our goal is to help you bring your nft application to market in hours instead of months and we believe this is super helpful especially during hackathons with time is of necessity so during today's video i'm going to show you what's possible to be built with nfd port and get you up and running super quickly just for context some of teams that are using us range from small startups all the way up to leading ethereum applications such as poep and nfd port is pilp team affects nato monis and nvidia and backed by the co-founders such as polygon wise and and skype so why nfd port is necessary or the reason why it exists is because developing nfd application used to be really really hard uh or slow basically because the whole blockchain stack is complex you know learning uh crafting everything and especially all the technical answers is difficult then everything related to the infrastructure is by the nature is difficult so our sort of code is to really abstract the way the complexity and enable developers and so that's that's our mission is to really empower developers so they can make the internet ownable by end users and citizens we have three sort of core products which help you in your development one is multi-chain data so basically that includes metadata files contracts etc so if you have to pull any kind of nfd data into your application then you can do it super simply with simple rest apis which i'm going to demo to you as well then secondly easy minting so you can programmatically mint super easy using our apis and so and and the most simplest api is you just have to make one api goal uh and you can do basically anything into an entity and then we also have an enhanced api's apis which allow you to do very cool things such as basically doing reverse image searches um finding duplicate nfts etcetera etcetera and this if you get stuck uh anywhere or you have any questions thoughts ideas you want to share then we have an uh public nft developer community as well uh in in discard which you can join anytime so just a few um examples so let's say you want to pull in all the nfds and you can do super simply either from ethereum polygon so you can just basically get all the all the nfd's that are on ethereum's chain now let's say you want to do a little bit more something specific and you want to get let's see all punk's data so i'll take funk's contract and i'm going to get all of these for this contract so i just put in the country address set request and then basically i will start getting where the api returns all the nfds to their part of this contract and now as a next step let's say you want to drill even more down you want to get specific metadata about these nfds then this is the bunk number one and you will have all the metadata about this one attributes image url where is it's stored and a lot of nfds are hosted on ibfs so but the downside is it could be really slow at times and end users don't want to wait for ibfs to load then we also have a cached image url as well so you can basically use that url in case you are building fast end user applications and you want to display nfts to your users as well we offer or you can actually get nfd zoned by account so any wallet address you can see for a dollar all the entities this account owns so let's select one example account i have here and the api returns all of the entities that this wallet owns again super useful in different applications uh normally previously you had to do a lot of engineering to get this kind of functionality then the second part and as a few examples uh what have you built already with these uh multi-chain data endpoints so one is fringible so which is basically google for nfds so let's say you have a cool cool vitalik image and you want to find [Music] let's say maybe some much better image format and they want to find basically similar images just uh similar entities just like google reverse image would does work and basically that's that's what we get as you can see we have italic and other similar um profile pictures as well and this again quite a large [Music] design space all the products that can be built using these simple multi-chain data apis then the second big part is what we initially saw a pain that we ourselves had was the minting is super um hard uh like obviously for people who know how to write solidity um then it's you know it can be easy but it still takes a lot of time so that's why we abstracted away a lot of the complexity and one endpoint easy meeting is basically so simple that you can just run one command sorry one api call uh the mint and nfd so [Music] let's uh this is that let's take um line [Music] let's see if you can get the image here and let's say we want to during that internal entity then what we can do and we'll make them currently on polygon but the theorem is also available so big [Music] and put put paste the url here [Music] and now i'm into my address [Music] request and there we have it and we'll also show them let me check check it later and the polygon scan as well um also obviously it opens it etc etc uh you can use any uh or sort of the most popular uh languages as well so let's say you want to do it in python then we show the exact code snippets dude in all of the basically most popular programming languages now if you want to customize your minting meaning let's say you want to create your own collection and open c then what we can do is deploy an nfc contract first your own contract again let's do it in polygon because it's uh free so we provide up to 1000 nft mints for free and polygon and if you needed more than that then just reach out to us and discord and we can happily increase those limits but we just set the limit so somebody actually doesn't ddos us at the moment so uh my contract [Music] all right something went haywire here anyhow i have to do some debugging but it usually works and when you have your contract deployed then as the next step what you can do is use storage you can upload a file do i profess so let's say i copy paste it here i have this nfd port logo here [Music] a little load of png [Music] um super simple we cut back then hyperface url now what we can do is upload metadata.ifs and here i would basically pasting the file url and this is the logo that i just uploaded [Music] oops file yuri uh and here i will put 10 of the name i description actually do that as well and i can set all right let's put the nifty [Music] description and if you want to set any attributes for the nft then you can do that here as well and we get back type fs uri and that we could as the final step we reduce that basically in the customizable meeting and in the customer mis minting the contract address would be the contract that we deployed but it unfortunately didn't work at the moment to the metadata uri will be the one that we just got back from the upload metadata ipfs and made to address address that you want to omit it and you would shoot it away you know some of the application applications that are built uh with those kind of easy minting apis um you know this all the way up to uh nfd camera app this is built for example only by one person during the weekend um so that's super super um impressive um considering considering the time frame and you can take any photo and uh turned into one nft uh so using and it's built on netport there's a lot of other teams uh all the way from building basically spotify for nfts um doing ticket events for nfts turning books into nfts turning k assets into nfts you name it basically i live with different teams building on top of nfd port using this kind of super simple capability meeting wise then i'm going to show you there's also some user endpoints where you can basically get all the contracts and nfds that the you as a user have here deployed or minted then we have search uh basically meaning you can search across [Music] nfds by text and you get back uh the nav results were either in the nfd title or description is this uh string so metallic then we have recommendations ar which is basically uh something that you just saw in google for nfts so this uses recommendations ai and we also have copy detection ar meaning we can use this endpoint to basically let's say if there is you know somebody takes punk's crypto bunks and tries to basically mimic them or sort of tries to fraud users then you could basically find duplicate nfds using this endpoint and it uses ai to do that kind of visual visual matching so here's the sort of the quick rundown of nft port and as as i said priestley's vote if you have any questions thoughts um need any kind of support then we are more than happy to help during uh uh during the hackathon that's why we are here to give you rings so it's the best time to build nft based applications and to bring your ideas to life and with that we'd like to thank you and have a happy hackathon
