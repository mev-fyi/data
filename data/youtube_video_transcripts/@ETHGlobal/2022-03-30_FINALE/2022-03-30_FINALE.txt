good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to the elf girl finale so you're all watching this thing on eatglobal.tv so if you already have not signed in i encourage all of you to kind of log into the chat and say hi and if you have any questions or if you want to comment on any of the products we're going to see today you can do that on the chat and we'll be able to relay or answer any questions directly on this live stream through that and also for anybody who kind of engages with us here you will be getting a poet for participating in this event so lf grow is brought to you by eth global and for those of you who don't know uh what the global is we're an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and elf grow is no different so we ran a really incredible hackathon and also a summit last week the event was 10 days in total uh for the hack family there were 440 540 hackers from 41 different countries participating building really interesting and amazing things some which we're going to see today uh spanning 13 different time zones and uh they came in from so many different parts of the world and five different continents and we're excited to see more of you engage with our events and seeing what they can do and all of you can do in in what three and on top of that we have 10 incredible ecosystem partners 75 amazing mentors and we're also giving away 200 000 in prizes uh we'll share all those details very soon um but let's get started so the event submission deadline was this sunday uh that's three days ago and through that whole week-long process of seeing what everybody's building we ended up with 124 incredible projects from there um we had people use so many incredible protocols uh so one especially thank uh lens protocol polygon studios live peer the graph ens 210 ceramic unstoppable domains chain link and lid protocol uh people use all these protocols in their in their hacks to make a lot of their lives easier from anywhere from abstractions that you can benefit from to just adding cool utilities without kind of doing everything from scratch and uh we're going to see a lot of that today so through those 144 submissions we had 12 finalists that were going to be bringing on stage today and in no particular order i want to congratulate these 12 amazing teams i want to congratulate matt finance lannister private ai iris 0x rig lens collect auctions aura reputation lens raffle subhana hashchat silly and write together these are our 12 teams are going to come on and do a live demo of what they built over the course of this event and right after those demos we'll talk about all the prizes that everybody is eager to know and uh and that's it that's it it's going to be a pretty straightforward uh live stream and uh as we were kind of looking at these 12 uh teams there were some obvious themes that kind of stood out a lot there were utilities and a lot of them were kind of enhancing existing social experiences there were clearly a lot of emphasis on bringing on new experiences for existing communities or just new ways to engage with existing communities and then also a big emphasis on really interesting modules that you can see built on top of lens that sort of enable brand new features uh that are now uh more mathematically sound given to the web 2 alternatives so we're going to walk through all these and we're going to bring on these 12 teams in in these groups and they're going to go one by one back to back and we're going to do a rapid fire set of demos but before we jump in to our very first demo i want to quickly take a second and thank the 112 teams here um for kind of still building amazing things just because you were not one of these 12 teams does that mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong our goal with this event as well as kind of this uh finale is to highlight some of the products that we were all super excited about and uh our goal is to make sure that you are getting support you need whether it's feedback or you want to follow up with some of the the judges for any future uh kind of work the event becomes an opportunity for you to sort of talk to people who are also actively building and promoting what's happening in this space in terms of technical progress and uh this this is kind of how and why we do this so uh just because you're not one of these 12 does not mean you should stop caring about what you did or you should stop building we really encourage all of you to continue building your projects there were so many incredible ones that we all saw over the past few days and uh we kind of hope to see you build them whether it's just on your own time or at our future hackathon so and also on top of that you can see all the projects that came out of lf grow by heading over to showcase.educable.com so all 124 projects are there now and uh let's jump right in so we're going to bring on our first category of super cool utilities that leverage and enhance the experience with lens and uh we're going to bring on these things one by one so let's jump right into it i want to bring on sapana first and then we'll have private ai0x rig in hashchat so without further ado let's welcome our very first demo of the day daniel whenever you're ready feel free to get started uh okay hi everybody my name is daniel keys i'm from the sapona team i'm calling in from tel aviv israel but we've had hackers join us from india and africa so for this hackathon we built a search infrastructure for the lens protocol so what that means is two things we built an advanced search engine with a ui on top and we also built an open infrastructure so that every lens app that's building on top of the protocol can integrate search directly into what they're building and provide powerful search and queries to their users so to do that we used a number of technologies uh we started off by reading uh subgraphs to connect directly to the blockchain and then we use the lens api to augment that to build the most accurate social graph we could and then on top of all that we built uh an advanced elastic search search engine um and we also used a rango db uh to make sure that we were doing the visualizations and the graph search correct um so why don't we jump straight in i think that's the easiest way to see what we've done so here's the uh everyone can go on at lens.o and we can start with one of the prompts here profiles with dev in bio uh so if i click that i'm immediately brought into the profile page where you can see i've searched through bio to see devs and i can scroll down and then click on one of the interesting things here which is the social graph button so if i do that we see a native social graph within the results and i can kind of move this around and comb and see kind of who kipit is connected to uh in the future we'll be adding more advanced graph search natively here as well the next thing we can do is look at the filters that are possible so if i click expand all you can see the advanced uh filtering that's possible uh you know searching through content all of these words exact phrases hashtags uh searching through bio which is really cool if you want to find people who know a certain language or working on a certain uh uh project um and you can also look at you know who's uh posting or who they're mentioning minimum followers and posts and mirrors comments and collects we really try to mimic as much as possible the advanced search that we're all used to from web to social and lastly you can look at different apps that are publishing on lens so if you want to see directly uh what solar punx or polydogs are doing it's really easy to do that so let's take another look maybe at some of the advanced searches that we can do if i want to see who's mentioning you know elon musk i can see kind of all the profiles and i can go to top and see jogenthir has shouted out elon musk another thing that we have is uh kind of easy uh sorting so top latest profiles links i can click on photos and see uh kind of all of the media that's been posted uh really easily um so as i mentioned uh everything here is an open api you can see everything on uh our github sapana io um you can also look at the uh swagger uh api docs that we have so uh we'd really love for everyone to integrate this into what they're building so you can play around with it here and happy to help people get set up lastly uh maybe i'll just mention that uh you know i'm really excited about building uh a social search uh for web3 i think it's uh one of the most interesting uh kind of opportunities out there in the internet today and i think we have the opportunity to uh build search in uh much more interesting ways than we've previously done in web 2. so in web 2 every app and social graph is kind of siloed from one another but in web 3 when the data is published to blockchains it's really easy to integrate those and build strong bridges so we're really looking forward to bringing into lens data from across web3 so we've helped build search for dso and mirror and some others and i think it'll be really powerful to build better recommendation algorithms smarter feeds customizable social experiences so we'd be happy to speak to any devs or projects that are interested in integrating this um yeah that's uh that's us amazing thank you so much and uh i'm so glad that not only was just the first time oh moore's law didn't kick in so murphy's line i'm worse well this is amazing i hope that you keep building this thing and uh we get to integrate all the other projects we saw today in here so uh thanks again and with that we are ready for our second demo so next up is private ai whenever you're ready feel free to get started all right so what's up guys sutong here i'm a data scientist also designer here to talk about private ai my entry for this tactile in this project i'm exploring how to apply ai to enhance user experience for social platform built with learns protocol it is not easy to apply machine learning to web3 without sacrificing performance or users privacy but i figured something out in my project it features three things first powerful pre-trained machine learning model that runs inside browser second dynamic model learns from user's behavior and evolves over time third meaningful information that helps you understand the model's behavior now let's look at the demo this is the product publication feed in the middle model dashboard on the right anyone can say anything on social platform sometimes you might want to hide some malicious information to help that i introduced the first model toxicity detection model it is a powerful model trained on two million toxic online comments let's turn down well as you can see there are three publications hidden now let's learn about them they're all malicious posts attacking people there we have detailed reasoning listed this is this information will help you understand how the model works and looking back there's one publication from the same account that is not heated i think it's more like a joke instead of toxic so i think the model is doing a good job for standard tasks we can use pre-trained model for your personal preference there is the second model your preference model this model is trained in your browser based on your behavior data and publication statistics let's try it as you can see the model at this point is not really doing anything because it's just been initialized so it's like kind of random here but when you use this product you can like or hide a publication by doing this you can like click like button and hide button so let me just go ahead and hide the three malicious posts when i doing this as you can see there is a train button but that's because i just provided some new data for the model to learn from by clicking it the mode will be updated and in the console you can see it is a you can see the mod structure it's actually a small model with around 1000 parameters now let's apply it as you can see the the model now learns get updated it hides most of the publications this is the issue of overfitting because we only provided like three data points and they are all negative let me try to make things right by like some positive positive posts all right at this time the train button pop up again let's train the model again as you can see here now the model structure also changed it now has 16 over 16 000 parameters this is because at this point we provided more data so just to clarify this for demo purpose in reality you're gonna need much more data points to trigger this modal structure change let's apply the second model again so now it learns to only hide the three malicious posts and also promoted some of this post with the yellow but yellow icon listed here so that's for second model additionally two models can work together that is uh because based on like the architecture of this project and as you can see the results not changing because they are all height industry malicious publications so that's it for my project i should like it thank you awesome being able to do custom algorithms is i think definitely the biggest thing that everybody's asked for uh as a criticism for what too so can't wait to uh see this in production thank you great all right so next up is our third demo and i want to bring on 0x rig so luis whenever you're ready feel free to get started ready hi my name is luis and i am based in mexico city have you ever worried about your privacy do you love crypto do you want to be able to contact people without sharing any kind of personal or private information xerox rig is a disposable crypto phone for everybody built on the ls pro powered by live peer technology and secured by lead protocol to get started with xerox rig download and install or software contact other profiles and build a contact book you're now ready to call anybody that follows you all of this social interaction happens on lens live peer provides a distributed streaming network and 1000 minutes for free and finally because we also love privacy lead protocol keeps everything encrypted inside of a private token it's very simple and everybody can have their own rig you can quickly install xerox streak in seconds with one click visit xeroxrig.com for more information to complete your rig setup simply follow the instructions inside of the readme file okay crx rig is now installed and ready for action let's take it out for a spin all right 0x rig is hold on let me there you go xerox rig is a modular open source superdap designed for customization you can have different models on your dashboard i wanted to show you how to log in with metamask and now i have to wait to show you the rest of the of the demo let's skip it a little bit this is how your dashboard looks let's take a look on your different models that we have and let's go and see the lens profile model sorry because this all runs on a good pun i forgot i needed to we started waiting on the green room and stuff this will just be a small second it will allow me to show everybody not my env file hopefully this is a real live demo but just how to get started how to launch it once you got your all you need to do is run npm run html and then a different node run npm server you can close this to tabs and sorry about that now let's go back in track got my timer ready okay so let me go back a little bit sorry about this it's a completely live demo 0x rig is a modular open source superdap designed for customizations you can have different models from your dashboard and i can see already some of the finalists being integrated here in this i would love to see that let's try and see the lens profile and hopefully won't let me hang in this time thanks now lens profile allows you to create profiles search mo search and follow other people you can see a list of people are following you and the most importantly the list of all of your followers to start a phone call we need a populate or contact book and that means only followers will be able to be displayed on this list before we continue we need to set up our private api keys from live pier to do that just hang up on livepeer.com to get your free 1000 minutes click on developers create a new api key copy paste it right here and now let's see and with one click we have fully integrated live pair streaming stream streaming services to a rig we can now access our contact book and click here to start a call your call has now started and you can connect using obs streamlabs or you can even start calling directly from your browser the best part is you can totally customize it using any other software like snap filters or anything else and let's see it's this way now this way and thank you for your patience with this live presentations i want to announce everyone that you can go on and try it now it's live this software was built for you and we definitely look forward to see you fork it play around customize it and contributing back to the community thanks visit xeroxrig.com for more information thanks again sorry about all that cool thank you so much and uh this is just super cool just the fact that you can do uh direct calls to people peer-to-peer and uh just use everybody's cryptographically verified profile can't wait for others to uh use this too all right congrats thank you so much and then with this we are ready for our last demo for the utilities category and without further ado i'd like to welcome chat steve whenever you're ready great yeah thanks kartik and thanks for the the whole team we are uh hashchat we built an encrypted cross-chain messaging protocol um built on web3 wallets and now we're going to demo um how to do a messaging from a web3 wallet or an ethereum wallet into a lens profile nft um a couple of years ago i've been wanting to send a message to a wallet address and i've been wanting this for a long time and right now the way we solve it is you have to email someone and say is this your web address or is this your address that we can do a transaction with and you have to confirm it and it's a it's a it's a large mass mess but the crypto ecosystem has a fantastic public key infrastructure and it's you know the the distribution of keys the ability of people doing key management but we're not using it for messaging and we want to solve that with hash chat so we we've built this demo and we want to show it to you now um but first let me just introduce our team i'm steve darazynski max mandia helped out on the front end and cody hatfield uh did a lot of the back end work um and let's see um okay so let's show you what we show you what we built here uh on the left side i've logged into the hashchat app right now and i've got in uh we've got this light mode dark mode so you can see the difference i've got a brave browser with a certain uh metamask wallet logged in and it's already connected up and on the right side i've got a chrome browser with a different metamask wallet logged in um what i'd like to do is demonstrate sending a message to a lens demo a lens handle so we set up a few demonstration lens handles early on so what i'm doing right now is starting a new thread with with a lens handle owner and what this is doing behind the scenes in terms of our tech stack is it's building a symmetric key based on the access control conditions of who is the lens handle owner and who is the wallet holder that just generated this message so with that symmetric key we can now create a thread and append to that thread messages back and forth with that with that profile id holder so um uh let me just send a quick message hello um one of the things that is pretty obvious from this demo is there is a strong balance between speed and decentralization so what we're using right now in terms of our stack is a web3 wallet connected to the lit protocol that writes to ceramic ipfs on the back end of it and what you'll notice there is there's no chain mentioned in that part of that is by design because we want to be cross chain we want to send messages to any chain out there but the other part of it basically is fully decentralized and and anytime you look at a messaging app and you want to make it fully decentralized and encrypted sometimes speed takes it takes a hit on that so one of the things we're looking to balance is kind of the speed versus decentralization aspect and then match that with product market fit um so there i've sent i've sent a message over here i've got some other messages um already sent uh previously to the right hand side um but let's let's just take a look over here on the right hand side so this this is a live demo and super kudos to louise who just went before me i i'm so impressed that you got that demo to actually work um this is always always part of the fun because you're not only depending on your own machine but also the network behind the scenes so what we're doing when we actually refresh this is we're actually reading uh from ipfs from a number of nodes and we're actually decrypting the message and then displaying it so there's a lot of a lot of opportunities for optimization and a lot of um a lot of opportunities for it to be slow as well so there the the um the lens holder which is this uh address has received the message and i can i can type hello back and send it back to them as well and they can see the response on the other side um instead of waiting for that though let me just flip back to my slides and and give you a couple more uh points um our future plans beyond this hackathon is to go to all chains so ethereum to solana ethereum to tesos you know and solana solana and everywhere in between um that we see that as the real power of of kind of getting these uh the sort of crypto community together also you can think about the major nft marketplaces that are on mainnet tezos and solana would be great to be able to message to all of them and then beyond that we want to create any really great messaging app has very strong spam minimization capabilities and we see the utility tokenomics balancing that very nicely so so that's that's kind of um that's the focus of our of our next steps after this stuff um and i guess with that uh oh actually i got one more slide and we are actually live right now so um uh you can test our dap at alpha.hashchat.xyz please connect with us on discord i think uh we're making our discord live today um and but please be gentle when you run the alpha.hashchat.xyz it is very delicate and very slow but please try it out beat it up and let us know what you think in our in our discord channel we'd love to we'd love to hear from you guys so and thanks to the to the team at uh uh eath global and and this has been a fantastic experience and really appreciate kartik and emily and all you guys and your and your ability to sort of walk us through all of these green room things it's been it's been wonderful so thank you so much amazing thank you so much all right so that concludes our first category and i want to congratulate again these four amazing projects to find out private ai zero x-ray and hashchat so next up we want to talk about projects that are enhancing existing communities and just kind of looking at different ways of experiencing social networks so we're going to bring on zilli right together benster and iris so uh let's kind of bring on our first project silly so without further ado let's uh let's keep it talk about what they built yay awesome hello everyone okay let me show you my screen so do you see siri can you see it yes yes awesome okay so let's go let's present you zidi and hop on our new web3 social june so this is the team we were pretty much from everywhere working asynchronously that was pretty awesome thanks heath global so what about zilli the liberal swift main thing repetition communities and ownership we think that revolution can't live in a silo platform like in webtoon so just create your data set up a profile do anything you want if you're not happy with what we do here just take it somewhere else that's fine for every communities we want to create a place on chain so they can just gather somewhere and then we can have a clear track of record of what they've been doing we have many things for the future vision we want to be the social letter scan so you can search on anyone anywhere on any community on any address to see what they've been doing what problems they've been collecting what posts they've created anything also token gated access to community i think that's really important that's what we enable we have also many future plans for crowdfund communities so that anyone can create a crowdfund and raise some fun with the community okay so let's go with the live demo we have created a log and working url so just go on it check it on we've been implementing the dispatcher so the dispatcher lens allows us to take care of the gas fee so you can use it as a web to platform you won't see any um any gas fee you won't have to do anything with the little fox just do it use it the gas is on us okay let's go so here we are let's connect so since i already have a lens profile i will be choosing one but for you if you don't have anyone any any profile you can just create it just put a handle and you'll be you'll be set awesome the little fox is asking me to sign i'm signing i'm setting on the dispatcher so that we can take care of all the gatsby for you and now i should be live okay awesome you'll see that we've been aggregating a lot of web3 data a lot like pope like the older vote that you have the communities all the posts that you've been creating and many different things you can also edit your profile if you want to custom it custom it a bit add the profile peak how to copy pick anything okay so what can you do with zilli you can do anything you can just go explore the general feed of lens so here are all the posts you can just interact with them see all the comments i add the mirror you can collect it when you when you do it will transform it as a nft and that's the pretty nice surface of lens you can go explore the communities too so here we have more than 2 000 community that we've been gathering so you can search for example if you don't see it there here it is variable and boom how cool is that we don't have much yet but you can just imagine right now you you will be implementing a feed where every hashtag linked to variable will be there so that people can talk on in one place you can also as you can see there is a lot of search feature that we have let's take for example alex.if alex.if doesn't have any lens profile but that doesn't matter we've been creating it a profile with all the data i haven't changed so how cool is that you can see alex and then once he has a lens profile you'll be able to see his post right now it doesn't matter awesome so here's the home where there's my personal feed all the people have been following you can check on someone else's profile so let's go this guy i've been really active actually is is going to present you in a couple of minutes that's awesome let's also explore feed and maybe just add a quick comment awesome hey love what you do and as you'll see no little no signature the comment is just right there nice so thank you so much everyone we want to insist uh that we've been will be taking on with this project this is really something that's uh that we love and we want to build something that will just have an impact uh we had only ten days so it's a really short period of time so just try it out you'll have a basic future of lens but we'll be implementing a lot of stuff and going in many directions that uh that you that you might like so thank you so much guys and have a nice day amazing thank you so much and i can't wait for everybody else to use it too zilli dot versus that app go test it there we go all right well next up we have write together so robin whenever you're ready okay i should be sharing my window now okay so i'm robin and this is write together which is a dap where you can write the beginnings ends and middle parts of stories and write upon other people's stories and people can extend your own stories so let's see what it looks like to start a new story um yeah so you can basically give your story a title choose the font um and then all your the story extensions will have the same font um something silly [Music] okay so while that's creating let's go back to this page oh oops all right i have to do this um creating is the transaction okay so back to this explore page this is the home page where you just see a bunch of like um recent activity um so let's go into the harry potter story so this is a story called harry potter started by bojack horseman um he's just one of my other profiles here that you can choose from um yeah so there's a page two for this story written by robin but there's also other page twos written for it um so this is a bit confusing because i wrote the same page shoot twice but here you can see the comparisons between these two page twos someone has written a page three um continuing from this page too someone has written a page three continuing for this one so basically you can see that stories can branch off and create like really huge trees of different versions of the same story so if we wanted to like write a story continue from here and write a third page too this is how we do it i'm actually not going to do this because it's going to take a long time but basically you would see another arrow and you'd be able to see my third page two here what you can also do here is you can like um story parts um and what this does is uh the parts with more likes will be sorted first so um we'll see that when you refresh this page this stor story part instead of being the last one to show in this um presentation it'll be first you can also follow stories and that will show up in your feeds here probably not yet because it still has to load and trans index so let's go to my profile so we can see the story that we had just started right here you can go into it and we'll be able to continue it and other people will be able to see it continue it like it follow it all that good stuff um so you can this is basically just like recent activity that i've done we can see stories that have started and we can see profiles that i'm following um so if we go back to the harry potter thing it's probably done yeah so you can see that this has um one like and it's the first one you see now which is pretty cool um yeah so another thing you can do is collect um so when you write an ending it turns green and you can collect it and what this will do is it'll mint an nft that contains all the store uh the story content for that branch so it'll contain this stuff this and this um so i've actually already collected this and this is the nft that it created so all the content is here in the description but in open c they strip out the html formatting that gives like paragraphs and like bold text and stuff so to see that originally i wanted to be able to render the html here but i didn't have time to convert the html to svg and then show it here um so what we can do is go into the metadata and you can see it's just here in the description and i've already gone ahead and copy and pasted that into this html viewer so here we can see um the story um with all the paragraph formatting um kind of just proving that it's all here in the metadata um if i had time i would definitely try to show it as the nft image because that would be pretty cool um let me miss anything i guess we can go back to the feed and we can see that we've followed this harry potter story if you remember that happening you can also follow profiles so i'm following bojack and i'm seeing all this activity here um yeah so um another thing is um following stories like following publications and liking publications are not part part of lens protocol yet so i had to implement that in my own smart contract and i think before um making this project live i'd wait for those features to be like native to lens protocol instead of relying on my janky uh smart contract instead um yeah that's that's basically it um thanks for thanks for watching choose your own adventure for stories can't wait for a lot more things uh to kind of happen here so amazing demo and uh thanks thanks again no problem all right next up we have leinster say yoga whenever you're ready feel free to get started hey let me share my screen yeah hi everybody i am yogin from india the southern part of india and the solo creator of leinster.xyz so leinster leinster is a decentralized social media app built completely with lens protocol so these are the features we have right now we have profiles posts collect modules mirror comments communities crowdfund notification explore and meetup is coming soon so this is the tech stack we use i've used next year's react framework views period to reduce the bundle size and in css for design views lens official api also known as lens indexes let's jump into the demo so this is the url alpha dot lenses.xyz so i'm going to login metamask then we are going to sign in with ethereum sign yeah this is the timeline so timeline uh it's the list of posts curated for the particular logged in user uh we also have infinite scrolling in place uh this is where we create the post we can select uh just we want we can select some anime here and we need we can select an attachment we have limited to four attachments and we can select uh modules we have uh these are the modules uh by are provided by lens protocol so we said uh default to revert collect so no one can collect this post as an nft uh we have empty collect so everyone can collect this post for free and we have we collect where we can uh pay some amount uh if we are automatic or usdc or die uh and we have we can set some referral fee while tracking this posters and nft this is how the post looks like we can comment on the comment on that post this looks like similar to the post we are using the same component here then we have profile page so this is the profile page for a user uh where we display the basic details of an user like bio social links location and user id then we have uh tabs for the particular user where we can see all the posts comments mirrors and nfts owned by that user in right now this is on polygon mumbai for mumbai and robsten then we have explore page where we can sort post by top commented one top collector then latest posts then we have communities so communities are built on top of publications so uh this is how an example community looks like this is lindsay dao we we need to be a member to post in this community then we have nice feature called crowdfund so this is the last feature we developed like couple days ago so crowdfund is like any user can post a public good goods and we can fund on that public good we can see the title description and we can find we add fun 10 matrix to this crowdfund so we can create communities uh we have create crowdfund feature we we should give a title uh we should select the currency contribution amount we can set the goal here and the recipient the description and we can also have a cover image we also have notifications uh i just found out this crowdfund so i got the notification for myself uh if someone commented i get notification someone followed i will get notifications yeah then we have settings uh where we can edit the basic details account settings which we can select the default profile allowance we are trying to improve this ux so basically uh we need to allow the particular collect module to use that module and we have feature to uh switch between multiple accounts then finally we have a nice dark mode yeah that's all it amazing i'll find out lenster.xyz um well this was a really really incredible demo i think uh one of the incredible themes about all these uh events and a lot of these hacks is that we've kind of fundamentally shifted the work from doing everything to just controlling the view layer and this is an incredible example of being able to surface the same information that already exists in really interesting creative ways so congrats this is awesome right and with that we are ready for our last demo for this category and without further ado i'd like to welcome iris feel free to get started thank you all right hi everyone i'm victoria and i'm here with stanford who'll be screen sharing and my teammate ian who will be conducting the demo today we also have isaac and novia cheering us on in the audience we have a team composed of all students from vancouver canada and i'm really excited to introduce ours over the past week we built an all-in-one front-end experience for the lens protocol which incorporates aspects of twitter patreon twitch and tick tock for front end we customized and implemented the polygon finite design system we also use a custom lit protocol integration with lens to encrypt posts for wallets that are not following the user and next i'll let ian take us through the demo the first thing we can do is go to the create profile screen here we can select our handle and subscription cost which is the amount it will cost to follow this user we'll queue that up and switch to another tab while that loads so when you have an account you'll see our homepage and if you don't follow anyone we show some posts under the hashtag lfg um let's click into the pier cool so we'll be asked to authenticate with the lit protocol which is our which will allow encrypted messages we don't follow lapeer yet so there's some messages for followers only that have we're not able to decode yet but let's go ahead and follow the pier yeah and once that transaction is done we should be able to see that did anyone fail yeah i think it's a feeling switch to a different wallet you should have a different wallet that already follows up here yeah so once we have an account that actually follows the peer the message will be able to be decoded and this is built on top of a custom integration we did with lip protocol another feature we have is going live um so i think we're going to go live with the peer or maybe joe hansen yeah so stafford is now streaming from the pier and this is uh integration with live peer yeah so once we detect that the user is live the profile will change and we can view their live stream um and we can scroll through their feed while we watch their live stream cool and then if we go back to the homepage we can show you some of the other video upload features we made so you can select the video to upload and once you click on upload uh you need to upload it first and once you click on upload this will start pinging our backend it will start uploading the video and our backend transcodes the video and starts uploading it to live peers video on demand api and provides us with a bfs url or uri link and then we can go ahead and post that on iris and this is our post um module um and basically you can choose whether or not you want that uh post to appear to your followers only or to the public um so i guess we'll try that again yeah if we're connected to the wrong wall we'll have to re-authenticate with lens which is what that error was now we'll post that publicly yeah um like there's something wrong with my metamask right now um i can't post can make transactions okay that's okay yeah um that's fine uh well there's also of course there's the mirror and the like functions that we've implemented but i don't work right now um uh and yeah that's pretty much our demo um in the future we're interested in creating follower-only videos and images to extend the follower only mechanic and also integrating it with the fifa module so that it'll cost somatic or whatever currency the the user defines for their followers um and also enabling follower only live streams um so yeah that's iris thanks so much um we're also live on iris xyz.web if you want to check that out um perhaps our wallet stuff will work better there but yeah thanks so much for watching amazing well thank you so much for uh for that demo i know uh these types of things happen but uh you were able to do almost everything except that last post piece so that's that's still good news all right so with that we are going to conclude our second category of projects i want to again congratulate silly right together lenster and iris i think the the thing i want to kind of highlight and talk about here is that similar to how we think about composability in in just dfi or any other aspect of web3 this is even more interesting for uh social experiences because as you can kind of see a theme here for the last four projects we're picking the best of features that we like from existing web to services either we rely on or reuse and sort of coming up with a more composable platform that sort of lets us pick all the good parts so uh i can't wait for a whole new set of combinations of permutations of this and uh can't wait to try out all these projects on on main net all right and with that we are ready for our last four demos and then we'll go into prizes so the last category is modules we're going to talk about all these interesting ways to think about plugins and modules that sort of enhance and add and amplify even more of what you can do so uh we're going to bring on math finance lens collect auctions or reputation and lens raffle so let's welcome mad finance carlos and nathan whenever you're ready all right great so uh this is mad finance um the decentralized ad network my name is carlos beltran i'm from chicago i'm currently living between nyc and miami and i'm nathan from san francisco bay area currently traveling around the world so what did we build uh we created a reference module that enables users to create posts with lens that have real-time monetization built in for their content allowing them to be sponsored by brands or other accounts yeah so in order for content creators to monetize their content uh they would first create a sponsored post and so a brand can actually reshare those posts and twitter it would be a retweet but first they have to create a money stream directly with the creator when creating a sponsored post a creator can set a searchable tag and set a per second rate how did we build this uh so we used like a local hard hat node with the lens protocol and super fluid plus our reference module deployed there so our reference module is plugged into the local lens protocol whitelisted and everything and it brings together superfluid and lens and uh and then we have a graph node running our custom subgraph which indexes data from our module the lens protocol and also from super fluid all right so for the demo we're going to walk you through the user story on one side we're going to have a creator create a post and attach our custom reference module and the other side we'll have a sponsor attempt to mirror that same post so to create a new post i'm just going to go ahead and copy this uri the flow rate is how much to accept in wave per second the minimum seconds is just uh it's just the minimum time span for the mirror to exist and actually under the hood the protocol make sure that the sponsor has enough balance to cover it and set a tag so this is under the hood creating a post on lens and attaching our custom reference module great so if i go over to home my posts i can see it there so now on this side with the sponsor i can go on this tab i can see some data on the post surprise that's the uri and i'm going to go ahead and attempt to create a mirror so first we must create a stream directly with the creator and you can see here that my balance in fus dcx is that value that's the super token on superfluid and the fee is a thousand way per second you can also see the publication id and and the creator address and the metamask popup on this takes a couple seconds there we go alright so here we can see the call agreement on the superfluid contract all right so now that the stream was created this next transaction is creating the mirror and so what the module is doing under the hood is is checking that we have whitelisted this sponsor to actually mirror this uh this publication and at the same time we're checking that there's a sufficient balance to cover the stream duration all right looks like the mirror was created if i go over to analytics i can see the all the streams you know from uh from which address the token and the rate and weight per second if i go over to the home and i go to my mirrors i can actually see uh all the mirrors that i've that i have and the actual post and the stream ticker for the usbc x token it's currently going down it's probably a bug in the timestamp difference between the hard end node and the browser's timestamp but uh yeah that's basically our demo uh ask for what's next we're going to work with the superfood team to make sure that we handle all the edge cases like for example when a stream is abruptly closed they have this concept of sentinels we'll work with the lens team so that our contract can be deployed on mumbai and whitelisted on mumbai and we can continue testing on that and uh on top of that we also want to run we want to experiment with machine learning algorithms to enable things like bidding wars um and and dynamic priced content for creators and finally yeah you can expect sponsored posts from mad finance around the mainnet launch of lens if you're a content creator you can uh follow us on twitter and and expect uh updates on on that end especially for beta testers thanks amazing that was uh such a cool demo and uh what uh what a super interesting way to think about web3 native advertising can't wait to uh have this be on mainnet all right well with that we are ready for our next module demo and that is lens collect options so whenever you're ready okay thank you i'm mathias i'm from utrecht netherlands and i'm presenting my hack lens collect auctions so this hack is about collecting posts it has been mentioned before lens has this cool feature where any post you see you typically can collect into an nft and the poster that of the original content specifies what logic should apply so you can also say you can't collect it or only use followers collect etc and in this hack i implemented auction logic for the collecting of posts and both the dutch auction which decreases in price over time and an english auction where people bit higher and higher and the highest bidder wins in the end i created a front-end to demonstrate how the solidity modules work and i will show that and then i will talk a bit more about the code so here i can connect my wallet and i have three example posts and the second and the third one are two auctions so this second one here is a dutch auction that has a price to collect uh and it just decreases over time and i'm user two here in this panel you can see it balances and so i can it started a little while ago already it currently costs 111 tokens and i can collect it now confirm and now i got the nft my balance got subtracted and the poster earns that money and the lens treasury also got a tiny share and with the english auction it goes up so i can bid 10 tokens i need to perform the transaction again and the next person could now get 1050 et cetera et cetera and the english auction always needs to wait until the end of the auction and now the time is over and i could now also collect it because i was the highest bidder so that's how it works let's talk a bit more about how the solidity code works so here i've got a uml diagram the collect module that you can implement gets called in two places basically when the original poster creates his post he provides data about how this option should be so how long should it go what the starting price is and where should it end and that gets then stored on the blockchain in the collect module and when somebody then wants to collect then that call goes to the lens contracts the lens contract creates the collect nft and then calls into the custom module with a call called process collect and then the dutch auction module can do all the erc20 distributions or revertal transaction if the collector for instance doesn't have enough balance the english auction is a bit more complicated it also has the setup where the poster has to choose all the parameters then it has the bidding phase which goes kind of outside of the lens protocol it just goes immediately between users and the collect module contract and then when it's time when that option is over the highest bidder could come back and collect but that leads to the problem that the if that never happens because yeah he needs to come back a second time then the funds would be kind of lost inside the collect module so i found a solution to that by making the collect module itself kind of an intermediary and the collect module can call the lens collect then the collect module contract becomes temporarily owner of the collect nft and in the process collect callback it will both do the token distributions and then move the ownership of that collect entry from itself to the highest bidder and that means that also for instance original poster when the auction is over can trigger the end and get gets payment and not have to wait for the actual highest bidder to come back so this hackathon code can be improved in many ways what i thought about is that it would be cool if the poster can himself collect the nft if nobody within the auction period wants to buy it so that he can later try to sell it on a secondary market and i i thought mostly about the dutch auctions because i think they are more exciting because with the english auction you always need to wait until the end of the period which might be long and for the dutch auction there are many improvements like for instance allowing it to be multi-collected at the left last lowest price then different price curves like exponential and especially i think these settings are a bit cumbersome if you want to post a lot of content so maybe yeah it would be nice if the if there's an autopilot setting so that the system could detect like oh your posts get collected quickly all the time so you should the the bit should the starting that you raise or if it doesn't go so well you should probably lower it and that it does it for you so you can concentrate on actually the content and not on on these option settings so thank you and the source code is here thank you so much this is awesome just a super cool and well needed primitive that makes a lot of things a lot more fun um and uh yeah i'm glad to be seeing that you're already thinking about what next features you want to add here and uh and just planning ahead this is great thank you all right so next up is our second last demo for today and that is for our reputation so whenever you're ready feel free to get started hey guys so this is uh germa from aura reputation we have uh hacked this um together with uh joanne my brother and if you like what you'll see now please follow us at alamaslabs where we'll be sharing some exciting news so what is our reputation um so basically what we have created is a way to integrate reddit karma score into the lens protocol so the reason we believe this is relevant is because it doesn't make sense for you to have to provide all your information every time you join a new social network so for instance when you're trying to comment in a forum where you have absolutely no reputation you might not be able to do so because they don't know you and if you are spamming and so on also if if it's a forum that is for instance only related to defy stuff it'd be cool if you're only allowed for instance to post if you have uh only on chain activity regarding uh like defy activities like staking and so on and so we have decided to focus in a very narrow use case for this hackathon which is preventing for people to comment on a certain publication given that they don't have enough reputation so how do we compute reputation um so basically what we decided to do to compute reputation no let me let me walk you through uh here what is the the flow on the application so first uh a user wants to comment on a post so what we do is that we use chain link any ipi to gather the um to gather informat like the score the information about these users directly on the uh smart contract and so once we have this score um we do the the api request to uh our own endpoint where we assemble the score and and and then um when we are processing this comment we checked that when the user made the publication um and the threshold that they said when they were doing this publication the score of these new users trying to make the comment is high enough so and then we allow it so how it's made we used the graph uh to show to get all the information um that is relevant for the user we're doing we're doing it for a few only on the demo but the idea would be to gather many more this uh chain link any api to gather the information directly on chain polygon for the deployment next gs is where we're hosting our mpi and obviously where we used for the comment thing is is uh our reference module so let me show you real quick what we did here i'm gonna be running uh the demo once i show you the code here it's i'm basically running uh my own lens protocol locally with the reference module that is deployed so what we're doing here first of all on the on the api is that we're gathering some information so we gather if the if the certain user has a dns if they have a poet and all this kind of information so this is how it would look like for a certain user we can obviously go for like for another user like uh in this case uh vitalik and we can see the number of co-ops and if they did mirror contributions and so on and so we basically assemble this hour score which is just a score that represents how relevant might be this user is based on the on the waiting uh score that we created on our endpoint and so in our test reference so on a reference module basically uh we we set like our own um minimum thresholds by which we would accept a comment and if the user does not have this threshold um we we do not accept um like the comment so back to our demo you can see on our first use case we uh this is the use case where the user doesn't have like enough reputation and the second is a use case where the user has enough reputation so um on what's next for us here it's very simple we'd love to do integrate as a part of the reputation old posts and comments by certain users we could do sentiment analysis on this old post to see if this might be a toxic user or not would be cool to gather more and chain information so if there are parts of taos uh like if they receive their drops how long did they hold to these airdrops did they sell them immediately and this kind of stuff and we will also be could if we enabled custom weights where these different signals that we gather so each social media can actually actually create their own weighting like weight function on what is relevant for for them so they have their own um kind of score and that is uh that's uh all for us thanks awesome well this is uh this is a good case of a vampire attack so i like it this is great well thank you so much i know if you continue uh building this and uh and yeah we get to use it in different applications thanks all right so now we have our last demo of today before we jump into prizes so let's get right into it our last demo is wren's left lens raffle uh scorpio whenever you're ready all right hi we are team lens raffle from munich it consists of my brother alex and me corey we're both engineers trying to build a startup and are very excited to build applications for web 3. so for this hackathon we've built lens raffle the module for verifiable random raffles for social profiles on lens so creators and influencers love to do giveaways and raffles to increase their following and also to just give back to their community however since they are done in centralized social platforms they have several problems they cannot be trusted since they are very often manipulated and they are missing a lot of transparency also there is no proof that the prices have finally been paid out we solve this problem with lens raffle it the module provides verifiable random determination of the winners of each different giveaway and includes proof that the prize has been paid out it also provides transparency by showing a history of all previous giveaways of any social profile of lens it can be used by any social platform built with lens either by integrating it as a module or by using our external platform of lens rifle of which we'll give a short demo now so here you can see the lens rifle platform you can simply search for a profile handle for example lens protocol we found profile and then we can simply enter the amount of medic test tokens right now we want to go away so let's give away pi test tokens um so here we have to confirm the amount um using metamask and then you can see the reference is now ongoing so here we have all the 18 followers of lens protocol right now and what's happening right now is that we'll choose randomly one of those followers with equal chance who's going to be the lucky winner receiving those magic test tokens so for this we used lens of course for um yeah since it's a module that can be used by any uh dab built on top of lens and also integrating it as a module and since it's very important in our case to have a verifiable random function we've used chain link since especially for giveaways with high prices we want to make sure that it's not just pseudo randomness as you can see we also store a history of all past giveaways including the winner and the amount of how much magic they won so for this we've used polygon since currently then the transactions take really long we've prepared a finished raffle so here the winner is determined and as you can see it's been chosen to be one of those followers in this case it was actually me so uh we'll do another giveaway later today so if you want to receive some magic test tokens you will have the chance by just following the lens protocol profile uh so you don't have to go back to the faucet for your next hackathon project so we've got a lot planned for uh the future and additional features for lens raffle first of all we want to add support for nftt prices because here the options are really limitless creators can give away tickets for events or special community nfts such as access to token gated communities or also just a fan art or autographs so here also some fans who created some fan arts will have the ability to do raffles or fan art to follow us of another profile also we want to support entering raffles not only by following but also by liking commenting or sharing content in addition we want to add the ability to do non-uniform distributions for example that followers who've been there from the really start from the early beginning have much higher chances of winning a giveaway which is a great incentive to follow new profiles really early and also increasing chances based on engagements with your publications since this is something creators really want to have so thanks a lot for the hackathon and if you want to integrate the lens rifle module in your dab please reach out to us on twitter we'd really be excited to have one of you who's presented today to integrate our module thanks a lot awesome this is such a simple and cool utility that uh we see behaviors of everywhere in all social platforms so being able to sort of prove we do this thing is uh can't wait for uh this to be the standard this is great congratulations all right so that concludes all 12 of our finalist demos i want to again quickly thank matt finance leinster private ai iris xerox rig lens collect or reputation lens raffle sapana hashchat silly and write together uh it was just amazing to see all these uh demos uh not only live but just all together working and so many of them are ready uh and also immediately usable by all of you by just heading over to their websites and the part that i like the most about this event is that we are actually kind of addressing common criticisms and problems that we've seen from existing media platforms and the fact that not only can we do that as a prototype or make it even ready for production in just a week just to see if the idea works or if this is even possible it just still blows my mind and i can't wait for uh people to spend a lot more time here to uh to really polish up and make everything really um great and this is this is gonna be awesome it's absolutely incredible so congrats again to to all 12 of these teams and uh for all of you who have been waiting a lot for this uh let's jump right into all the prizes so without further ado i'm going to list every prize that everybody has won and then the logistics on what happens next all right so the first and the most

congratulations to lit chat and we have two winners for a toucan so regenerative lens wins 2500 for the first place of bringing building a tool that leverages lens and brings on carbon markets on chain and lens mandala will receive one thousand dollars for the second place price so i know it was a lot we just kind of threw everything at you but don't worry if you didn't get a chance to uh kind of read or see through everything uh there's a lot of uh ways we're gonna communicate this thing you can go back and scroll back on this video and pause we're gonna put this out on email and on discord and uh there will be ample opportunities to figure out who won what and then very soon you'll be able to see your prize on your showcase page as well so you can just head over to showcase.educable.com and find your own project and you'll see what prices you've won very soon in terms of logistics for prize delivery all these prizes are tentative and not final which means we will be verifying everybody's code base to ensure that everything was indeed done over the course of the hackathon before sending any prizes so this list can uh change and the price distribution will happen on or by the 10th of april that gives us enough time to review and understand everything collect all the information we need from everybody whether it's your address or any other uh identifier to make sure the delivery is smooth and then we'll be executing them in batches so please be patient and the next two weeks is the window where we'll be processing everything and on top of that for any pool price category uh they are based on meaningful integration of a given protocol and not just simply importing or referencing something in a small fashion so if you apply for a pool price you can see it it's because it was deemed not meaningful and uh we will not be able to dispute them this time around but if you have any questions you can ping us on discord or email all right that concludes all the things we wanted to do about the the finalists and our our uh prizes so hope a lot of you are excited about what you've won and we'll again we'll be communicating all this thing um to everybody on multiple ways in multiple ways but before we kind of wrap up these events i want to kind of take a minute and thank a lot of people that made all this possible starting off with kind of all these incredible groups of people whether it's our judges mentors volunteers speakers and sponsors uh and of course u.s hackers so all these amazing judges and mentors were there to kind of help give feedback and unblock a lot of you uh just making sure that your projects are done uh the way you wanted them to and i can't thank uh all these people enough for the time uh and dedication and effort they put in uh similarly we had an amazing summit and so many talks and workshops i want to thank all of our speakers for giving us the time and sharing everything about what they're what they're excited about in this space and of course our sponsors and our ecosystem partners there's so many here that were there uh helping out behind the scenes as well as directly on discord and just chatting with everybody whether it's giving feedback or helping answer questions technical or otherwise to really make sure that you are successful in building what you wanted to build also a lot of this goes behind the scenes we're trying to coordinate so many things in parallel with hundreds of people from so many different countries and without the help of these volunteers we would not be able to run everything as smoothly as we were able to so i want to thank all of our volunteers as well and i also want to give a shout out to the global team so a big uh thank you to kevin creed minnie and moaz luke emily andrew jacob and liam for kind of doing all the work behind the scenes so that you have a wonderful and smooth and easy and enjoyable experience for this entire event and of course u.s hackers so thank you so much for taking the time and spending all this time building something that you're passionate about and you're excited about and not only just trying a brand new protocol for the first time and seeing what the actual possibilities are but really blending that with solving problems that we actually are super aware of and we are striving to uh come up with a solution for so thanks again and uh i know we kind of call uh everybody here a finalist and we brought on 12 teams so we kind of heard about all the partner prizes that everybody won but we want to also point out that there are 12 other teams here that just kind of came on and we're going to call them finalists because we really want these events to be a way for us to highlight and showcase things that everybody is excited about and we particularly are excited about so we call them families because we really don't want this team to behave like a competition uh so we don't try to have a notion of first second third effectively uh from here all these 12 teams came in first and they have officially kind of won lf grow so uh as part of their prize for being a finalist every team member on each of these teams will be receiving 1500 uh as usdc from the youth global team and i want to kind of give a big congratulations to all of our finalists here that came on and did presented their demos live and uh and everything worked out and they're going to continue to also build all these incredible applications further so everybody else can also use them and not just that we're also doing something cool for this event which is anybody who submitted a project for this hackathon will be receiving a lens lf grow shirt so any hacker that has successfully submitted it's okay if you didn't present live or you just selected opted in for sponsor uh price selection only any if you are some if you submit a project you are qualified for this thing and all you have to do as a hacker now you just head over to swag.global.com click on the lens shirt and uh you put in your email and you'll be able to get that delivered to you in the next couple of weeks so enjoy we'll follow up with an email too because not everybody is watching this and uh this is something fun we can uh obviously do for everybody and our big shout out to the lens team for designing this uh and coming with this really cool short concept and just because we get this question all the time we made sure to point this out everybody will be also getting a pop app whether it's for being an engaging member on this live stream now or our summit or being a hacker or being a judge or a or a speaker uh we'll be sending you an email that will contain a link to specifically your unique poe app so please be patient takes time to kind of get all that information right generate and do all these things so you will hear back by mid next week on all these things so with that we are ready to wrap up lf grow i hope all of you had fun over the last two weeks and we certainly did and we can't wait to see what all of you do uh next and before we sign off uh this wouldn't be a neat global event without us talking about what's next so we're super excited to announce that our next hackathon will be two weeks from now called dow hacks it'll be a week in hackathon so it goes from friday the 8th to the 10th of april and you can head over and kind of build cool things that you're excited about for for dowels whether it's new ways to think about and create dials to just a lot of tooling on dials and how we can efficiently communicate and coordinate things at scale uh we're super excited to see what everybody builds uh for this event and uh and uh we're excited to kind of see a lot of you again in a couple of weeks so if you're interested in building cool things for and with taos this is uh the event and you can head over to dow.eglobal.com so with that thank you so much for taking the time and being part of this event and we are ready to sign off take care everybody and we'll see you in two weeks bye you
