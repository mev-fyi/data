[Music] great we are live so i have eric van der waal here with me from the nervous team and we're gonna do things a little bit differently today um due to technical errors so i'm gonna play a pre-recorded uh workshop video from eric and eric will be here to answer any questions as we go along so feel free to pop your questions in the chat and we can take them as we go eric anything to add before we start nope nothing at all just uh excited to be here and to connect with the community super in that case i'll play the video and enjoy hi everyone and welcome to my talk here um this is no community no cake for you so here's my promise to you for this talk if you manage to stay awake and not fall asleep and stay engaged and everything like that by the end of this talk you're going to have some practical actionable tools something you can actually use to build your community and of course know why you want to do that and why it's so important so again pay attention as best you can you know turn off your phone put down your pencil or pan or whatever you're doing and let's take it from the top now i was told by the head of marketing not to use too many memes and you know of course i absolutely did that so my name is eric vanderwaal and i am the head of developer relations and support engineering at nervos network and i'll talk a little bit about nervous later on but for now uh let's talk about why you're you're actually here and that's to talk about community and before i jump into that i just want to tell you what's on the menu so you have some you know understanding of what's going to happen and i think that sort of helps to absorb the knowledge better so what is community where is my cake getting that cake that's not cake and baking together so we have a bit of a mystery meat here but we're going to talk about you know what's community you know why that's important how to improve that and you know what's not community and how we can sort of do that together and so i've actually given this talk a couple of times before and i continue to give this talk because not because i'm lazy necessarily but because the message becomes more and more true as time goes on and in the past i've given other talks maybe like 10 years ago in my previous career and i can't you know sort of reuse those talks in any sort of way because you know things really change but when it comes to community instead it's not so much there's like a fundamental change in our understanding of community but we're just building further and further up on that understanding and so this talk just gets built up more and more and every time i give it i really actually do believe more and more you know this is completely applicable to what we're doing in web three you know and um i you know last time i gave this talk you know like a version of this talk it was called uh if you build it they will come and so you may be familiar with that from the movie field of dreams depending on how old you are with kevin costner uh came out in 1989 so not to date myself too much and in the movie it was like um you know the kevin costner character had a ghost come to him and say you know like if you build it he will come and uh you know it i think it got misinterpreted if it if you build it they will come but the point is here is that like if you build something awesome you have a really good idea you got positive vibes and everything you know your customers your fans your community they're just going to come to you right and it's going to be successful well you know i hate to tell you and probably you know you may already know this you know that's it's just not the way it works right we just because we build something awesome doesn't mean that people come and you know the reality is we're in sort of the creator economy or we've been in the creator economy you know for a bunch of years with web2 and it's become easier and easier for people to create content and now with web3 it's easier for people to create certain kinds of technology and this sort of stuff and the issue is not about the creation so much anymore you know all that of course that can still be a challenge it's about discoverability right this has become a really big issue and there was a study that mail chimp commissioned and it was done in 2019 and they had hired like a third party um company to do this and they you know reviewed 505 small businesses in the us and they had either all uh developed something or launched their business or you know done it within the last two years so they're all sort of fresh new businesses and this you know should probably resonate with our industry because this is where we are there's not many um you know products that are more than two or three years old here and the name of the report was why small businesses should start marketing on day one a mailchimp report so they felt that was the most important part to highlight in their study and i agree right why we should start marketing our business on day one so who's marketing their businesses on day one or before you know they've launched anything before they've done anything well these people are if you don't know what these are these are all video game covers this is you know an example but basically any major media these days is marketing what they're doing long long before it's out you know teasers and trailers and concept art and leaked information and you know announcing celebrities who are going to be part of the project or all this kind of stuff to build up a community a hype and excitement a marketing around it long before there is a project and i think this is something that we need to take note of especially you know where we're smaller businesses typically or smaller projects but we need to pay attention uh at least to sort of what bigger projects are doing and learn from sort of their lessons and their mistakes and even if we're not going to do exactly what they're doing we can you know learn from that so you probably gave me this talk and you're thinking okay i thought you're going to tell me what's community i thought we're talking about community and not marketing but here it is this is a quote from greg eisenberg community is the new marketing you don't build a community to promote your product you build a community so you don't have to promote your product and perhaps this is a little bit jaded like to think of people as uh marketing and stuff like that and you know certainly that's just one aspect of it but that is the aspect that we're talking about today and it is an important one so who is this this is a growth advisor for tick tock you know he was a product strategist for wework and advisor to reddit and things like that so you know he really does know what he's talking about now that we've covered some of the preamble here i do want to talk about what is community and i'm not going to get into this you know too much at a academic level or anything like that we'll go over sort of a few things but i do want to you know talk about it a little bit so we we can get into some more details after that and in order to do that i want to talk about the sense of community theory so this is not new this was created in 1986 by david mcmillan and david chazz and the study of community actually you know is its own field of study it's a fairly serious one for people if they want to go down that path and of course we're all you know parts of communities whether we want to be or not so we've all had also our first hand experience but looking at it from this point of view i think can help us break down some of the details so we can learn where we can do things better so their definition of community is a feeling that members have of belonging a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group as a whole and a shared faith that members need needs will be met through their commitment together so they break it down in into four parts here membership influence fulfillment and shared connection and so while i'm talking about this please step back think about your own products or the things that you're building your side projects your work projects whatever it is and think about the community around it you know whether that's like two people or 10 people or 100 people you know it really doesn't matter it's not the size it's you know the community itself so membership so membership here means boundaries emotional safety sense of belonging common language and rituals influence here is really about the feeling of mattering so you know there's some give and take here you know it can't be one way um you know if people in your community don't feel like you're listening to them then they will leave so you need to have influence on each other this is not just you influencing them but them also influencing you and of course each other so fulfillment here so we're talking here about the fulfillment of needs did they get what they wanted by joining the community and what problems were they trying to solve and this is initially how a lot of people come to communities they're looking for some sort of fulfillment you know they have a problem they need to be solved it could be like a technical one maybe it's a financial one you know maybe it's a need to mint a piece of art for example right so there's a lot of reasons that people come to the community in in the first place and they do need to have that that sort of fulfilled in order to typically stay and be part of the community and what that leads to next is a sense of shared connection and you know um this could be like bonding through shared hardships or uh you know quote-unquote war stories or things like this and in crypto you know often this is sort of the ups and downs of the markets when things get really low and we you know commiserate with each other and things are really good and we're really happy together and you know the sort of the more extreme the situations the more strong that the shared connections there are and because of sort of the strong financial links here between uh you know crypto and blockchain in general and finances and and you know how that sort of impacts us fundamentally it really does build strong shared connections quite quickly so communities have their own subcultures language rituals and this sort of stuff and i almost want to talk about that just so i can put these memes here and it says what if in the future we only communicate through memes and i think the one beside this is hilarious so go ahead and take a moment to read that um so you know we as uh you know a crypto community crypto twitter and all these sort of things even uh discord you know we have a shared sense of language and again sort of our own subcultures within subcultures and our own um you know rituals whether it's saying good morning good night or these sort of things you know these are all uh classic hallmarks of well-established communities and communities within communities okay so we just finished talking about you know what is community and sort of breaking down a couple of the fundamentals of that but now we're going to talk about where's my cake you know and honestly this is sort of like why do we care what's the benefits you know what's the reasons that we want community and we touched on that a little bit but we can get into that you know a little bit deeper so here's another good quote i love good quotes um software is no longer sold it's adopted so if you're adapt developer you know you are essentially somewhat i guess selling software it's a sort of user-facing software it's an it's an end product but it's it's true you know and this is something that uh you know coming from developer relations and i'm talking to you guys as developers you know that software is no longer sold it's adopted and this is true for lots of products right we build our identities around them whether we want to or not and we you know try to resist but it sort of leaks into our culture whether you're an iphone user or you wear lululemon or you're a bmw driver if you're if you're that lucky in life or you know unlucky i guess if you don't like bmws and so again that's like about the community and the culture around it and you know big companies spend like a ton of money to stay up to date with consumer research but as new smaller companies and products really we just don't have the money for this but what we can do is stay closer to the metal right and we can be part of our communities and get that instant feedback from them and have that back and forth without needing to do essentially consumer research which is takes time and it costs money and we can get feedback from our users right away by having a community built around things so essentially you know being a smaller company or smaller product your super power is community so you know a lot of big companies spend a lot of money to try and build up you know a community identity and to directly connect with their community and things like that and that's something that we can do ourselves right from the very very beginning so again community verse marketing here you know community is essentially a much lower cost of commitment here although a much higher time commitment typically and you know communities are based off of spending time with people engaging them rather than you know paying for ads and clicks and these sort of things community at the same time compared to marketing actually can give us a much much uh quicker turnaround time right uh versus like setting up ads and having them go and people clicking and following through and then having to engage with our community anyways and you know potentially a much smaller one and frankly we just don't have the time in web3 right i joke that we have regular time we have startup time and then we have crypto time and we are in the business of crypto or blockchain probably if you're at this talk and we are living in blockchain time right and you know if um you know your five years as a standard developer you know some people are telling you you're still probably a junior uh you know i don't think that's true but if you're five years in blockchain you're like an og right our time goes by really fast and we need to pivot even quicker and having that community as that barometer of change is very important okay so let's get that cake so what we're going to be talking about here is talking about you know some practical steps and things that we can do to improve our community and understand our community and this is a social identity cycle so communities are essentially uh shared social identity and participation as we've talked about and it goes on a little cycle like this so we have identity participation validation and then identification participation validation and and so on and so forth so for uh identity or identification here we're talking about you know they're attracted to the social identity of the group and this is maybe how people come in right and then people take some small steps and they participate in the group in some way now then the group rewards them for their participation and these can be all kinds of different rewards these could be such as financial words these could be like you know kudos they can be uh internal motivations or like i said kudos or external motivations and all kinds of things and then when that happens they more strongly identify with the group which leads to more participation and further validation and it goes around in a cycle like this so for the identification right so they could be just someone who's interested they could be a fan they could be a super fan maybe they're a super community community member and maybe they you know joined the development team or something like that for participation it could be joining a discord filling on a form sharing something on twitter you know becoming a member uh maybe making some infographics or things for you writing an article and this sort of stuff and for validations you know validations can start small like um welcoming new members uh seen by the community as knowing something maybe a kudos for a good meme or an upvote for share um you know people being seen as an expert or a moderator can fulfill our sense of validation so you know from a practical point of view if your community is not doing well try and break it down into one of these three steps and say like okay are people not identifying the community are they not participating if they are participating are they being validated for it and try and figure out sort of where you know these cycles work into your community and how you can build them up a little bit further and as people go through these cycles typically to either fall forward or fall back in this and you can see my wonderful powerpoint art here super awesome and people are you know start off as passive members become more active become essentially power members and they become leaders and you know we can um look at this in a sort of a different way because just looking at it this way is not super helpful for me right and i want to show you this and i believe this was actually created by douglas atkins and this is called the community commitment curve so douglas atkins was the head of community for airbnb and what it is is we can break down sort of these groups of people whether they're passive active and leaders and put on a chart because we love charts as developers we love things to be organized and you know we can even add numbers here to feel like even more empowered but at the beginning you know we're going to measure things through the uh cross-section of commitment and time the more time or the more committed they are the farther they are up on the curve right so at the beginning you know they're just going to maybe read the purpose of the project or maybe check out some of the members profiles maybe they're going to become a member as they become more active or read forums blogs write blog posts then they might move you know past being the active stage into the leader stage and so on and so forth so here's another version of this this is uh you know slightly different but sort of the same concept you're discovering onboarding engagement and leadership now what i want you to do is actually sit down this is the practical part of this and you can either pause this now or you can come you know back to it after but i would really encourage you to actually do this and think about your project and think about um all the different things or all the different ways that they could interact with your project right now right um or you know your side project or whatever you're working on and it could be joining the discord seeing the discord seeing your twitter following your twitter right there's very low stuff maybe checking out the website and these kind of things i want to make a list just like you would if you were doing agile right make all uh you know you can cut out little pieces of paper and write them on there and put on the floor then all the way up to the other side right so this one says like attend a rally but you know you know join your development group or you know whatever your end goal might be or a possible end goal then i want you to rearrange them all based on essentially the amount of commitment or time that it would take and you know it helps to sort of do it on the floor i'm a very tactile person and you're gonna end up having like this big list of things and then you essentially have your community commitment curve now when you're dealing with people in your community and you see them you know maybe going through step one two three four five on this but then not progressing past seven eight nine ten you need to think to yourself okay like why are they not progressing from one point to the next and what's missing in that community commitment curve that you could add that is a step between right that it's difficult for people going to like signing up emails to joining your development team that's just typically it's not going to happen you know there's always exceptions right but people sort of take all these incremental steps to get there and by doing this i want you to look and see what kind of incremental steps are you missing that you could add or create in order to onboard people up this time community commitment curve and i think this is one of the most practical things you can do to see some of the holes in your community and how you could onboard people better okay that's not cake so now that we've talked about you know hopefully one of the most practical examples you can do to build out your community or you know even think about pre-building your community before it happens is i just want to talk about a couple of the pitfalls and like myths of community because i think these are almost as important to think about when we think about what is community we need to think about what is not community and one of the you know biggest pitfalls and myths people think you know okay my computer's a failure because it's not an instant community community takes time to build right and what goes in hand-in-hand with that is its size uh you know doesn't matter the most you know the myth is that size matters the most it really doesn't when it comes to community and we can see a lot of communities that are not um necessarily communities we see this on twitter all the time we see people have a lot of followers right and those are audiences often they're not communities and there's a big difference between having a community and a big following right and with followers typically the information is mostly going one way in one community there's going to be sort of this interconnected web of connections with each other and of course you you know or your product or your app or whatever it is right so there's a difference between audience and community and it is very easy you know in theory um to build up a very large audience to build up a big community is a completely different thing and that takes time and sometimes a community of like 10 20 30 40 people is much better than you know an audience of like tens of thousands of people because it's about being engaged and active more than rather than just listening so another myth is there's a simple hack to building community that's not really true you know the number one thing about building community is simply being present you actually need to be there you need to be authentic you need to be who you are and the community will follow that and for better or worse the more extreme or more authentic you are the more likely you are to find people who are similar to you and again i think we see this a lot in politics right the more extreme that the politician is sort of the more extreme they're followers and the more loyal their followers are so i'm not saying go out there be an extremist but i'm saying be yourself or be the community that you want to see and for the most part you will attract those types of people to community and other people will fall away and something for us at like nerve offices is really important you know to us is you know being there for people being authentic with people being helpful to people because that's what we how we want to be treated and so that's how we like to treat other people right so there's no simple hack it takes time be who you are and you know hopefully that will bring more people so the other one is all communities are successful yeah this isn't really true and um [Music] you know we we sort of went through this uh at nervos and you know maybe we're not supposed to talk about our failures but i think it's important to talk about our failures and for our newest um product is uh evm compatible l2 and it sits on our l1 and we decided to do whitelisting it was fairly experimental at the time and we you know built a bit of a community around that but honestly that community just really didn't turn out the way that i had hoped it would and you know that wasn't on the people themselves but really just sort of the way we structured things and you know not all communities will be successful but that doesn't mean you have to give up and based on those learnings we started another community called build club which has been fantastically successful for us and i'll talk about that after but just because something doesn't work out of course uh you know you don't always need to you know continue down the path you know the sunk cost fallacy here where just because we've invested some time we should continue to invest forever sometimes it's okay to reboot your community into something that's better you know with the lessons that you've learned so another myth is it won't take that much time i think we've talked about this but yeah it takes time and that's important you know you need to be part of your community uh communities are organic yeah this is mostly not true right um we need to go out there and actively attract people maybe bring in friends at the beginning to start or with co-workers or people that were like-minded with and then start reaching out and building the community most communities are not organic that's mostly nonsense that's made up to sell a story after the fact members are there to be sold yeah so this is not true basically um you know we did talked about this before but you know you have to fulfill the needs of your community and you know this really should be a two-way street community is just marketing by another name again um just saying this makes me feel like icky in my mouth but it you know it's definitely not the facts yeah so here's me uh this is a real picture of our team and i'm right in the middle at the bottom um but you know communities building is is hard you think you're going to be at the top of the pyramid but the fact is you're pretty much at the bottom um and you're going to spend a lot of time at the bottom so uh you know a few final parting tips here on the community aspect is you know make community a home make it a place to be accepted and make it a place that you want to be you know if even if you can't stand being in your community for that long then it's probably not a great community right so allow ownership within your community to allow people to have a sense of purpose create rules enforce those rules have daily rituals or weekend rituals or whatever it may be good morning good nights and um you know design spaces that are authentic and sincere and i did want to leave sort of one last thing here one last thought on community and this is one that i feel that's come up quite a bit and again so hopefully this sort of authentic thoughts with you is when it comes to gatekeeping which is an interesting thing and you know there's a lot of accusations being thrown around you know i wouldn't say just recently but sort of always especially on crypto twitter and things like that like you know gatekeeping this and that sort of stuff and you know for communities to grow and thrive there does need to be a certain amount of quote unquote gatekeeping and at first that might sound bad but communities are built around specific topics or ideas or products or things like that and if people are there to talk about other products or other ideas or other things that don't fit in with that community view essentially over time it will start to erode community and so maybe we don't want to call it gatekeeping but there should be you know ownership within the community there should be rules and those rules should be enforced to create a community that is you know safe and comfortable for the people who are part of that community and to keep it you know a fairly high quality so i do encourage people of course to create a sense of inclusiveness but also to make sure that you know people are following you know the general direction of the community so let's bake together yeah so as i mentioned before you know we did sort of a white listing for our evm compatible l2 and i'm actually wearing the shirt here which is god woken is what it's called and you know that didn't work out the way we really wanted to so what we decided to do was create a new program called build club and build club has been you know absolutely amazing for us the response from the community has been excellent and when it comes to you know technology at the building level we are starting to see the fact where you know evms and evms and evm and the underlying technology can be incredibly different and i am like over the moon about our underlying technology about being you know decentralized and long-term sustainable and having like just these great token economics and you know built on top-notch security and all these things that could go on and on but when it comes to sort of the edm layer and things like that and it when it comes to your apps you know you're going to be faced you know head-to-head with competition right where you sort of have a very similar type product and what is going to be your differentiating factor here is the community and that is absolutely true for us for you know this evm layer is that our community that the support that they give each other that they were able to give them and all these sort of things is you know one of the most important things because ultimately you know life is built around community and so if you guys are interested definitely follow the links here join our discord come check out build club put in your application for build club build with us and you know see the difference that a community can make so everyone i salute you for making to the end of this talk and you know if you've made it here i believe that you've picked up a couple of practical examples that you could put towards your work your side project your upcoming dap which i really wish you luck with building and again you know come touch base with us touch base with me on twitter discord build club and let me know what you're building i'm super excited about it and we can chat more about it so until next time guys great thank you um eric's here to take any questions yeah so i got one question here in the chat that says uh as a solo founder wearing a bunch of hats i feel like i'll neglect my community on discord though i do see the value in terms of marketing and feedback etc in an ideal world i'd like to have someone to be as active as i'd like to be do you think the founder needs to always have the presence in the community regardless of size and position so no i think the founders don't always need to be present in the community um you know especially as communities start to scale in size so for example at nervos where a fairly large blockchain company you know we have hundreds of employees and so it's just not feasible for our founders to be you know active in the discord however that being said you know we have moderators that i think are value aligned with our vision and the things that we want to accomplish and that's very very important yeah i was just saying i think it's important to have people that are a value aligned with your your product or your whatever else because that will attract you know those types of peoples to your community so it's important whoever is representing you has you know a similar type of feeling around the community could you please write your twitter halandal again yeah totally so i'll share that um from which platform we have to build community initial project yeah i'm not sure i quite understand this question but obviously discord's the the popular chores here for web3 and you know you only need a couple of people who pop by every day just to say good morning and you know that's you know the place to start so yeah what are the key aspects to take into account when starting your community when you're less than 10 members what's the key aspect um i i think a commitment to be regular on your behalf you know when you're such a small community you have more time than money and you know you need to show up and you need to be president and let people know that you're present so that that community continues to build and you need to fulfill the needs of that community so people come there for a reason typically to start off with and you need to you know help them with whatever technical issues they have or whatever they want to do and then move it out from there people have limited time and attention how do you attract people considering this yes that's a good question um to think about that i'm not sure there's like one easy and right way to do this right so again i think that community commitment curve or sorry not the community common curve the cycle that we looked at before and you know looking at you know whether people identify whether you're solving problems whether people are committing whether they're getting kudos and these types of things are are pretty important and um [Music] you know if you're not fulfilling all of those steps in the cycle then you're going to start to lose people so make sure that you're fulfilling all those steps what's the difference between dow building and community building i would say i'm certainly not an expert on a dow so what's the difference between double and community i think there's not necessarily a huge difference in the sense of that a good dow should be a community and it is just potentially a community with other aspects built into it that you know a non-dow community might not have so i'm not sure if you guys are familiar with developer dao but certainly go check them out they're quite a large builder dow that i'm a part of and i'm there regularly and there's lots of great web 3 builders there [Music] thanks eric we're running a bit short on time but what we can do is follow up over discord if you have any questions and yeah yeah thanks absolutely thank you so much for having me today day bye bye
