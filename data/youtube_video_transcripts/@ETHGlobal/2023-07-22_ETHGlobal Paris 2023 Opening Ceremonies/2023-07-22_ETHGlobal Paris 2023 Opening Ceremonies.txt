thank you good afternoon everybody wait good evening everybody my name is one of the co-founders of Youth Global and welcome to Eve Global Paris this is not a conference if you've been to our events before you may know that Global is known for one thing our goal is to get thousands of developers into the wet 3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons in Summit which makes this whole weekend a hackathon what differentiates this from a conference well our focus is on Builders and not only that this is a place for you to learn get help and just grow as amazing designers product people and engineers and we strongly believe that showing is way more important than telling which is why come Sunday you're not allowed to just talk about what you did and you have to show us what you actually built and we've been doing this since 2017. we're doing it started all in each Waterloo in Canada almost six years ago and we've gone across the world to all different continents and done this to get over 70 000 people into this space and not only that the best thing about all of this is that we're finally excited to be back after all these years in Paris four years later we're back doing our hackathon with 1400 of you in this building that's incredible give yourself a massive Round of Applause out of these 1400 960 are hackers from 67 different countries and 22 percent of them are new to web 3. this is the lowest we've ever had there's a lot of people here in Paris they're in this space and we are excited to do one event where we have so many people who've been part of the secret system for so many years so this is a massive reunion for all of us and for the other 88 percent this is where you're from 78 percent all of you are from different parts of the world but of course they shouldn't be surprising to us that Europe has a very special presence here so many people from so many countries and cities so we're excited to meet all of you and reunite with some of you we haven't seen in years and on top of all those hackers if 270 ecosystem Builders these are all of our amazing Partners the engineers the the managers the product people the designers the founders all of them are here in this building willing to talk to you about everything that they're excited about everything you're excited about and 40 dedicated technical mentors which means if you're stuck you can find somebody to help you with anything with your code or your thought process or your architecture or anything in between whether at 2PM or at 2 am or at 4 a.m or anytime from today till Sunday morning and because this is not a hackathon of conference I am tired today I'll reset give me a sec because this is not a conference 34 workshops and no talks all these workshops has already happened all throughout today and you can see the best part of this which is half a million dollars in prizes are going to be given away this entire weekend so hope all of you are excited we have 41 incredible partners that are giving away all these prizes so I'm going to have you continue clapping and the faster you Clap the faster I'll say all of their amazing names so let's start with LaPlace fintech one inch closest chain follow coin maker metamask Mina polygon Wally connect World coined air stack it coin by economy cortesi cello chain link EES ethereum Foundation hyperlane mantle Mass near neon evm save sismo Stark net the graph Uma unlimited xmtp ZK syncs DK Bob Zeta chain Aragon XLR dfns flash boss late protocol announced out push protocol and quick node all these amazing companies are going to be giving amazing prizes and you can hear about all of this very soon but let's talk about this weekend the goal here is I want to spend the next 10 minutes covering all the important things that you need to know for how to structure your time and how everything is going to work until Sunday and that means we're going to cover everything about this venue how you can get help all the prizes all the topics and workshops team formation stuff a lot of you are looking to form teams and and of course how judging works most important note before we get started do not use Wi-Fi hotspots this happens every time so I have to now include this in all of our slides if you turn on your hotspot Because the Internet is not performing in that corner turning on that hotspot interferes with the internet itself so you make it worse for everybody around you in that area we have dedicated technicians here that are monitoring and actually tracking what the Wi-Fi access looks like in every given spot so if you see something is not working or it's a dead spot or it's just too slow messages and Discord where you are so we can just send somebody to immediately correct this we've already spotted a few places and we've added more access points in the last few hours we just need to know what other spots are uncovered so just turn off your hotspots and just let us know where things are and we'll get to fixing all of these things immediately now we're done with that let's talk about security all attendees must wear their wristbands and their event badges this is a private event which means that we have security at the doors especially as we lead into the night we will be closing down ways for you to enter so without a wristband you cannot come into the building policy is very simple no wristbands equals no entry if you forgot something and you didn't have your wristband on and you're trying to get back in this would be applicable to you too at 10 pm we're going to close the registration desk which means without the wristband you cannot come in or check in until tomorrow morning and if you lose the wristband we will not be reissuing it for you so make sure that you do not take that off or you do not lose it and do not leave your belongings unattended we're not responsible for anything lost or stolen items so please keep your valuables with you we'll do our best to make sure that people who are not allowed to be in the building are not in the building but do not go home with your laptop on the table and keep everything that you value in check with uh and with you at all times let's talk about the venuine activities so we're here on the basement floor this is the auditorium this is where we are today this is also we're going to be back on Sunday for the final closing ceremonies there's a lot of hackers here that you can hacking areas here so you can have 100 a couple hundred of you also sit down there's also food being served on this floor if you're hacking from this side and then we'll go up to the next floor which is the ground floor where you came into the registration that's the biggest hacker area that's also where all of our partners are it's also where food and catering is for all of you and if you want to present to all of your partners on Sunday for the demos this is where you're going to be on Sunday lining up and talking to all of our partners and then on top we have a third Upper Floor that is where a lot of the workshops were today and also there's a lot of hacking spots there and a couple of lounges you can check out the noun Style Lounge or the cartesi recharge station you gotta get a massage hang out with a lot of things happening with a lot of people there and just see and just take some time to uh to relax then we also have some amazing late night Stacks so we're going to be queuing Crepes and macarons tonight at midnight and also tomorrow and today will be craves so come back here in the catering area and you can have some really cool sweet stuff there's also a selfie Booth up on the top floor it also prints the photos in front of you so it's not just digital so take advantage of that get a photo with your team and get a memorabilia for you being in part of this hackathon and most important part one swag item that we left outside intentionally this is everybody's personal coffee press you'll be able to get this and pick this up on the registration tomorrow just come with your badge we'll scan your ticket again and anybody who has not picked this up will be able to collect this so you get to add this to your your swag back collection this is the thing that gets to collapse amazing of course all right let's talk about communication everything is going to be on Discord which means if something is not happening on schedule if something is happening ahead of schedule if something changes if something doesn't change whatever it is we're going to sell uh send that message first on Discord and then walk around and tell everybody about it it's also a PA system in this building so we'll be announcing it too but if you miss something you can just go on Discord and just check what the last announcement was Discord is also only open to attendees that are rsvp'd all the permissions will be given to you automatically from your hacker dashboard and everything else is going to be on the website the website is the source of Truth which means that if something is listed on the website whether it's the time for a schedule or who's coming or what's going to happen who's going to be giving a talk or anything else whatever it says is what's actually happening if something changes we update the website first then we update Discord and then we tell everybody and to make it easy for you you can just head over to eat global.com Paris to find all the details and let's remember you're all here in person talk to each other there's a lot of people here who are from different parts of the world a lot of people who are trying to meet all the amazing other developers and Founders to see what they're up to and what they're excited about you get to just go do that and if you're stuck on something and you really can't get something to work just shout and I'm sure somebody will be able to help you with whatever bug you're facing so let's talk about how the hackathon works officially hacking has started you can start working on your projects and you can work on a project with up to five members you don't have to work with people on a team if you want to do something solo that is totally okay but given the time you have this weekend it's just a lot easier if you have help you have the next 36 hours to hack and submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on Sunday so this gives you enough time to make sure that you get to test things out you get to get any feedback you get to get any help and also please make sure that you get some rest do not sacrifice your personal health or sleep to build something the rules and criteria are also very straightforward everything that you're doing this weekend must be done from scratch which means you cannot extend or build on top of an existing personal project I want to make sure that this is fair for everybody who's participating so whatever you're doing you cannot start working on it you cannot have coded this before today and only RSVP hackers are eligible to win prizes which means that if you have a team and they were added months ago and one of them forgot to actually come or sign up they will automatically be removed tomorrow from your teams if they were not checked in and you have to really make sure that if you are working with the team and they were not listed as your team members at the time of submission or anytime before that that if they win if you win a prize we will not be sharing that prize with the rest of your team members it will only be given to people who are listed at the time of the submission and if you have any other questions or if there's any other edge cases or anything else we missed just ask anybody on the youth Global team come find us come send an email send us a Discord message we're monitoring all those things and we'll happy we'll be happy to clarify everything for you and of course there's a lot of content for so many of you here whether you're a beginner or an expert or been in the space for years we're talking about all the themes that we're excited about we're talking about all the things that we think are ready to be productized all that is what the goal of the workshops was and that information is also on your dashboards and everything was recorded live stream which means that if you came in late today and you missed a workshop that you were excited about you can go to eat global.tv and simply click on any of those rooms and watch and Rewind and pause and zoom in on anything that you want to see that any of our workshops were about and the best thing is that all those people are still in the building so if you have any follow-up questions for any of those speakers go find them and ask the questions directly at their booth and if you are still looking for a team or you're looking for somebody to join your team we're going to be doing the workshop right here after I stop talking for YouTube actually meet each other and find more team members and potentially get started on a project so just stay in this room after the ceremony ends and a lot of you will be able to meet other potential teammates and a quick note on mentorship we're going to make it very easy if you see someone in this jacket they're a mentor if you need help flag a person and ask them any questions that you have they'll be taking shifts so you can find them at any time of the day all of them are here but they're also on the website they're also listed as mentors on your dashboard you can see who they are you can see when they're going to be available but they're also wearing these jackets some of them are right behind me some of them are in the first few rows they'll be very easy to spot we wanted to make sure that happens but let's talk about the most important thing and that is judging and everything about submissions judging is some issues are due at 9am this Sunday and when you submit there's going to be two choices you're going to be given there's a main judging and a partner judging both of these are happening at the same time this is a parallel things you have to really pay attention here for the next 60 Seconds 9 30 a.m to 12 30 p.m these three hours both of these things are going to happen at the same time what is the difference main judging is if you want to be part of the top 10 team for this hackathon but also you also want to win any of our partner prizes if you opt in on your dashboard to just do partner judging you are only opting in to win partner prizes and nothing else that's fairly straightforward on the difference between the two but this is what it means if you are trying to do partner judging you have to specify what projects and what partners and what companies you want to qualify for and you get to do that as you are submitting your project after you press submit the partner will get a notification and they will know that they need to expect you or to review your submission then you get to also go to their booth and present to them what you built at their tables this is simple if you are doing partner judging because you go to any of those partners and show them what you built but if you also select it I want to do main judging which means you are doing main judging and partner judging you have to also go upstairs and present to one of our main judges and then go to the partners so that means you have to manage your time and you have to be really mindful of how you are structuring everything on Sunday the good news is that this is asynchronous and it can be done out of order you can go to the partners first and then go upstairs as first come first serve you can go upstairs first and you can come to the partners doesn't matter what the order is if you see there's a big lineup great do the other thing come back and as long as you're doing that in the window you should be good the other key thing to know is Partners will look at your live demo as in nice to have not what they're going to be judging everything on which means the most amount of information that they have is what you put in your submission so make sure you put a good description make sure you talk about how it works put good screenshots about everything if you manage to record a demo video just in case something goes wrong do that upload all of that which means it's going to take you some time and you really want to put that there because what they're going to look at is all they're going to see and that's how they're going to decide if you have any questions on this come find me I'll be happy to clarify but let's go into the judging rules you have four minutes to demo when you are going to go to a judge that means you have four minutes inclusive to talk about why you built it who you are show a demo and everything about what it is and we recommend that you also record a video in case something goes wrong you don't need to have a video but it's just recommended and really really really do not do this last minute you will need a lot of time to put in all the descriptions you have to actually specify how you're using different protocols you have to do some work on the screenshots and everything about what your project is all these things matter because this is the most information you can give somebody to make your lives easier and help you actually win some of those prizes and all that is also done entirely on your dashboard tomorrow morning that interface will go live and will be visible to you which means that you can see everything they need to do tomorrow and then you get to actually fill those things on Sunday so don't worry you have to memorize any of these things all of this is visible on your dashboard the short of it is make the submission good if that's one takeaway that you can take from all of this is make it really good so that your showcase page has all the context anybody needs that's pretty much it on the judging and submissions all that is also on the info center and you'll also get an email about all this stuff we're going to make sure we bombard you with a lot of information about all these things so don't worry too much and lastly I want to talk about our code of conduct this is an in-person event and as part of that our rules and a code of conduct applies you can check out everything on eveglobal.com rules the gist of it is please be respectful and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated in any form so if you see anybody being treated the way they shouldn't be come tell us we'll take immediate action and also anything that you build here is solely going to be owned by you and equally by anybody on your team so you retain all the IP rights and no partner youth Global or anybody else does not have any ownership of any of your work so you get to enjoy everything and benefit from anything you want to do with it in the future that's everything on the logistics we have a couple of other things that we want to talk about and also when I get to the prizes soon but before that I want to bring on some of our amazing Partners to really tell you what they're being excited about and why you should kind of hear them and see if you also share some of their same values so I want to bring on our very first partner for this weekend it's Kian from LaPlace fintech please give them a big round of applause thank you thank you very much hello everyone um my name is Guillaume I'm the director of La platform Tech defy but what is LaPlace fintech defy so we are in investment Hub situated right here on the second floor during the whole year and we are based mostly for communities so that means like we're bringing together like investors private investors mostly VCS business angels and also cooperates here in Paris like critical to help and build communities and also projects for startups we are not an incubator and we are not an accelerator that's why I mentioned that we are mostly the community build that brings your project where you want to be it so it the thing is like we are mostly based here in Paris and we have the facility and the act that um we uh in Paris for today but mostly We Go Global in the future that's why we are building everything with our partners especially thanks a lot to Eve Global to give us the opportunity to talk today about our project and uh we also have a booth here so if you want to have more information about the investment Hub just feel free and come to visit us and to have more infos thank you very much amazing thank you for us anytime we do an event we want to make sure we get to involve a local community and just actually have a presence in that City so you get to do that with everything that's happening in Ferris all right next up I want to bring on Jax from Falcon please give me a big round of applause hello everyone my name is jinx I'm a developer advocate for Falcon Foundation um today I stand before you wow it feels good to say that on stage I stand before you to bring you a challenge a really wise man once told me that hackers do not come to hackathons for prizes they come for a fascinating Challenge and the challenge I gave you the community gives you is called d-web we hope that you can use the listed Technologies here to further decentralize your application in case you're not that kind of a hacker we also brought prices so the top three teams will receive 300 3500 each and for the two teams that had the best uses of fem with Pacquiao will receive to 2500 each and we also are going to choose six lucky Runner Arps teams so a little bit about the technology ipfs is the largest peer-to-peer file transfer protocol it is also a lively network of thousands of nodes that helps to transfer file requests we also have very busy gateways that handles hundreds of requests hundreds of millions of requests every day filecoin is the largest Enterprise ready internet scale Enterprise storage Network think of it as a Airbnb for hard drives it is going to power the next internet um you already know that you're very experienced hackers for East Global um so we're bringing you something new so some of you might not know that we have a virtual machine recently built it is EVN compatible so you can use the tools that you're already familiar with to build something like a data dial dataverse or a storage Marketplace and and D5 protocols foreign provides decentralized compute so you can build almr or DSi projects on top of that so for hackers I couldn't wait to start please scan these QR codes and get a get to know about these projects and how that can decentralize your application a wiser man once told me that Innovation the idea of innovation is about putting two ideas together to create a new one in cognitive science this is called blending and we hope that with The Primitives tools and products that we provide you can create something new and my name is James I'll be here for whole night come and talk to me about our prices awesome thank you next up I'm going to bring on downstairs to talk about one inch please welcome her on stage hey hey hello guys um so I survived from the ACC week tell me hey if you are survive and you want to listen something about one Niche so erase your hand if you're at least crack on the ethereum global hackathons once show me your hands all right so raise your hands if you are newbies okay I can feel it's amazing because um I want to tell you something about one inch um I was I was actually learning this I have to tell you this now let's go to the one inch one inches the project who was born in ethereum global hackathon back in 2019 and that we are actually happy to support with lots of gratefulness to it's Global we want to project to be successful as we are and that's why actually here so just hack and build um it'll some some numbers about one inch and where we are today uh we are covering 65 percent of aggregation market share we have 70 percent of limit orders market share over 350 billion total volume four for 4.5 million total unique wallets uh we have 150 beautiful contributors around the globe and we raised over 190 million to develop the best device Solutions uh to do the user experience that you or guys love and that's it about the one inch I guess if you want to learn more come to our booth um but rather than that we have also a big community of Builders and we want to invite you to join our Builders community and this is challenges that we have for this hackathon uh recently um in in actually last year we released the fusion mode and maybe today uh you heard the workshop from our backend like Nick and this is actually Bounty that we have for the fusion mode if you have any questions come to Nick come to booth go to Discord we're happy to answer your questions and you have more information about about the fusion not on our Dev portal and about next thing in ethereum global our co-founder Anton book have actually released the token plugins it's really Innovative solution you can check the presentation on their um YouTube but what we want to um hear here it's uh maybe you have some innovative ideas which could build on top of one inch smart contracts and here are the bounties we're really curious be creative uh third my favorite track is an open track but uh this year and this hackathon we actually decided to be more focused on the developer portal and also on talking plugins so we can go to check that what what we released on token plugins also go to the developer portal and see what is it and maybe you have some ideas on how uh and in which way you can do something within the information that they placed on the fertile and token plugins let's build to change and innovate thank you a lot here is the QR code with the Bold bounties thank you a lot and success on the hacking amazing it's one of my favorite moments when somebody comes on and they started by building a hackathon project for fun so it's really awesome to see one interior yet again next up I want to call up Philip to talk about Nelson chain please welcome him on stage thank you hi so quick words about nurses chain hopefully you've heard about us before layer one evm that is based on ethereum okay um so you have the same layout which is a beacon chain and an execution layer um and we're actually quite committed to Credible neutrality and resilience which means that we have um current diversity of course like ethereum so we have the main same clients and it consists of layers side on on the executional side as well we actually have over 140 000 validators right now so you can easily validate come join us it's quite cheap actually so it's fairly easy we also have trust minimized Bridges between our Network knows the chain and many others including minus of course are using CK Bridges and Sashi um so we've been around since 2018 which in crypto years is quite long actually um so and it's run by the community of course with the 140 000 value Traders um right now you can even create saves for free on nurses chain uh so that's a great opportunity to try that technology as well um so we have over 2 billion USD worth of application and infrastructure uh built on top of nurses chain so of course safe hopefully you know about it um but as well also fuel success which attending uh one attending conferences you should also know about hopefully as well as cow swap and uh announced Monday actually uh nurses pay which is a Visa card whether it is self-custodial so it's actually the first decentralized payments network uh so we're very excited about this um come to our booth ask questions uh yeah thanks for listening and happy hacking awesome thank you announces chain all right next up I want to bring on Francesco to talk about metamask and Lanier please welcome me one stage well thank you so much Karthik so are we guys excited about is global parties very well very well cool cool so awesome TV here so hello Builders everybody's a builder here so many designers so many developers everybody is a builder this is exactly why we are here we are here for shift Inspire or recognize your guys are part of a movement right we are we want to go to decentralization about how we're doing that this is we want to inspire and be inspired and speak with your peers speak and Inspire other other people there in in other communities and recognize yourself everybody is valuable especially like after the information you can see and and team up and and speak really with with a lot of with a lot of people 20K bounties we're extremely proud of that we're pushing really the boundary Cocos yeah yeah some Applause here cool based So based on that this time and this is not our first uh it's Global hackathon hopefully like you see a lot of my colleagues around we focused on two main uh main challenges around the linear and yes it's called linear it's not linear so make sure you remember that so Lena and metamask SDK I will run a little bit through I will not bore you how many of you guys know what's linear cool cool I've seen some raising hands but yeah we went a couple of days ago into mainnet whoa this is cool good news good news news but anyway olena whatever you're building and you want to deploy on Linea we are offering three winners for six uh 6K for three winners so anything that that you think about use case or vertical you are more than happy uh to to deploy I will not go through the requirements but important is that you're really targeting utility and and fundability of whatever you're building I will put a bunch of QR codes here if you guys want to get some some girly youth for for testing and we have some girly uh whales in our team so make sure also you reach out to our uh to our booth or just asking Discord and we will come to to your um to your table this QR code is quite cool because he's offering a bunch of infrastructure and tooling lists so whatever you guys building and you think about okay those are the use case and verticals here you can find bunch of infos they're actually quite useful even if you're targeting other stuff this is also an ecosystem portal you can find a lot of open source and partners dapps already deployed on linear it's actually quite cool because you can see and get inspiration and yeah I definitely recommend to to everybody to check this out our second linear part and this is actually for two winner on around 4ks build an nft indexer on linear this is quite self extraordinary so I think I have Max two minutes I will get a little bit quicker this is linear documentation I think is quite straightforward make sure also you read full our documentation onboarding that's also quite forward that we prepped apart actually for its Global Paris and and then metamask obviously like this we're not focusing on snaps this time and we'll be ultra focused on SDK with three mere verticals how many of you guys are game developers or uni Developers okay cool see some ends sounds good so this time it's not just about nft or gaming verticals but we'll push also like defy and social verticals and think about whatever you're thinking about I think you can definitely like integrate fully the metamask in your dap important and this is because we are receiving a lot of submission that has nothing to do with SDK uh just uh we will really check it out so you need to call the npm install slash SDK and uh and so it's not just a normal and easy um ether.js injection cool so uh we'll not bore you with requirements just make sure you have an order repo video record your dab push the four minute submission and also in your repo we want to see a parties.txt with keep calm and love Paris so you guys we make sure that we are reading your your submission cool here's a quick Dev guide also with some example you can see both from like different verticals is actually quite useful if you want to Target that so I'm not alone I with I'm here with like an army of like amazing colleagues and feel free to raise your hand if you're not too shy but uh definitely for the next 48 hours you get support we will be at the booth 24 7 and uh and both IRL and Discord so make sure you say hi and come with with a lot of backs because we are ready to solve them all together so whatever you're doing afterwards and whatever you're building we're definitely here for supporting you obviously in the next uh if Global hackathons and uh yeah both with like connection we also like launched couple of weeks ago a full ambassador program for developers they want to actually build in the entire ecosystem not just with our product always if you want to inspire you're an advocate of this ecosystem make sure you reach out and we will be able to to empower you cool thank you very much thank you Builders and keep focused and get some sleep please cheers thank you all right next up is Angus from Mina please welcome Magnus on stage my name is Angus and I'm here to talk to you about Mina Mina's a ZK L1 blockchain a lot of you here will have probably heard of ZK it's all anyone's talking about I mean as a blockchain that's built using ZK from the ground up to do everything now you can write zero knowledge applications that run on Mina using just a typescript library so you don't need to understand zero knowledge cryptography you can build ZK apps build and Define zero knowledge proofs verify them to build applications or without a PhD in math you might be wondering why I'm wearing a pickle costume the recursion layer of mina is called pickles recursion is super cool so you can take a proof and use it as an input to create another proof or you can take two proofs and create a new proof of that two those two so when you can write typescript apps to create recursive proofs you can do things like voting games or you can make something up that's really cool that we haven't even thought of yet you can take proofs you can pass them around you can chain them together you can roll them up you can collapse them down so recursion is really cool we want you to build stuff we have 200 100 dollars of prizes so first prize if you build a ZK app and enter it for a price track you can win eight thousand dollars second prize six thousand third prize four thousand and we have a two thousand dollar prize pool for people who build projects but don't win one of the top prizes if you build with snarky JS which is the typescript library that's the end of the talk thanks very much to everyone at East global if you want to see us come and see us at the booth if you have any questions we'll be on Discord and also around at the booth so thanks everyone thank you next up I want to bring on Derek from wallet connect please welcome him on stage yo what's up youth Global how's it going um yeah my name is Derek I'm CTO at World connect a quick survey about the audience hands up if you think crypto ux is ultra awesome okay weird um yeah so what connect we are trying to make crypto ux awesome like slowly getting there and we have a couple of prizes and hackathon things theme towards this we just did a big migration if you're like a builder which all of you are and you have any questions like come ask us we're like a big team here and our prizes so we have a couple of new things going on so I think we can all agree here that we want a lot of crypto users the Milestone everybody talks about are one billion users and right now cryptos heavily happening on desktop and obviously that's not how we're going to get a billion users so one of the prizes that we have that's catering to this is our web frame model native track so basically you build a native application using web3 model so native crypto application and um we have a total of twenty thousand dollars in prices and you can get a six thousand dollar prize for web 3 Model native internally we're sort of tracking what we call the flipping like when do we have more native crypto users than web crypto users and yeah excited to see when that's going to happen then we have also six thousand dollars for the Innovation price so like the coolest application of world connected you can come up with can um get a chunk of the six thousand dollar price and we have a three thousand dollar price for our auth SDK so what's the author CK some of you might be familiar with signing with ethereum the idea is that you when you connect your wallet currently when you want to verify that you own an account you have to do two steps you have to connect the wallet and then also sign a message and our author SDK makes it just one step so an important ux Improvement so the best use of the auth SDK can get a chunk of the three thousand dollar price then we have a novel kind of price which is a redesign of our Cloud app so the designers of you can compete with that the expected output is a figma file something like that all the other prices we expect like code to be written and then the last price is a two thousand dollar pool price basically regular and conventional use of world connect model so yeah the bad news to all of you is back in the past you could qualify for pretty much all of our prizes we're just Orthodox usage of the world connect web model in those days unfortunately are over so the bar is a bit higher and um yeah if you have any questions the entire team is here and happy hacking [Applause] thank you Derek we're down to a couple more to go just want to bring on next Tony from polygon please welcome him on stage hello hello everyone my name is Tony Orlando and I'm from polygon Labs I'm in charge of the developer Education team so I just want everybody to take a deep breath in out you've made it you made it to Paris you made it here you are either a hacker or you're here to help other builders or something of that sort but at the end of the day you are here to help other people uh be able to adopt blockchain and my goal here tonight is just to make it very very easy for you I want you I want you to actually go home with money and I'm here to talk about very very simply exactly how you you could actually do that on polygon we have a very simple prize that is targeted at almost anyone and uh using the polygon ZK evm which is an evm chain you could simply submit a very Innovative project so what do you need to win you just need creativity and you need to be able to read documentation that's all so if you're creative and you could read documentation you could definitely be in the running for the first prize which is the polygon ZK evm price but let's say you want to be able to extend the polygons e KVM right well we have the lxly bridge which is like our native bridge and we are asking you to go on we have code samples you have everything you need to be able to look at that and figure out how you could actually extend the functionalities of zkevm but lastly they actually want to tell you the absolute easiest way for you to actually go home with a prize is if you build using polygon ID and dock right so we have a very simple integration that allows you to be able to publish verifiable credentials on chain using doc IO it takes you 10 minutes to sign up you have no reason not to take that money right so please submit thank you Tony next up I want to bring on penrin to tell you everything about world coin please welcome him on stage hey everyone I'm Penryn I do developer relations at tools for humanities supporting the world coin ecosystem so for those of you who haven't heard of worldcoin before we are creating the largest financial and identity Network by giving it to ownership to everyone but as any of you who have ever tried to give away anything on the internet before are going to be asking right now what about Bots we have this wonderful device called the orb that we use to verify that you are a unique human in a completely privacy preserving way uh takes a photo of your iris that it never has to store anywhere uh it calculates an iris code and we can compare those to make sure that you're different from every other person who's ever signed up on top of that we have World ID our proof of personhood protocol which you can integrate into your app to have your users prove that they're unique human help with simple resistance things like that really essential component of digital ID but for us we're not trying to prove which human you are just that you're a unique human only doing something once you can access all of this through the world app uh this is where your world ID lives this is where you can use our fairly simple crypto wallet and just last week we hit two million verified humans and since then we're now up over two million fifty thousand so that number is going up quite quickly which is great and we've seen a lot of different people building on world ID so uh with what like a year and a half now of us uh participating in these Global hackathons we've had over 1400 developers and 350 distinct projects also including ones outside of hackathons build on world ID while it was in a private beta we've had a lot of really cool use cases unlocked with World ID and additionally to support even more growth we just finished our migration to optimism yesterday so if any of you were at pragma you probably heard about that and now instead of just being able to verify approves from World ID on polygon you can verify them on mainnet optimism and polygon so for us making this available on as many chains as possible is really important thing to us and this is a huge step in making that possible and also after three years of building we have finally made World ID publicly available for everyone who wants to build on it there's no longer a wait list um which is super exciting for us it's been a long time in the coming and very very happy to reach this milestone so if you want to learn more about how to use World ID and the SDK you can go to id.worldcoin.org that'll take you to our refresh documentation and then specifically for this hackathon worldcoin.org parish23 will give you information on our twenty thousand dollars with the bounties documentation template repositories everything you need to get your share of those bounties thank you thank you and finally our last partner for today I'm going to bring on tadeo to talk about maker please welcome him on stage hi everyone do I have yes perfect all right uh I'm today I'm devrel at Phoenix Labs part of the maker Community uh now let me ask a quick question who knows what maker is quick show of hands okay that's pretty good okay who knows what's what we'll be building in the last six months yeah expectable okay who knows what's going on in governance at maker there we go oh nice okay perfect okay so for everyone who doesn't know maker is one of the oldest Landing in protocols in D5 uh our principal objective has been to increase the supply of Dye die die being the biggest decentralized stable coin in the ecosystem uh users have been able to do this by providing collateral and getting a loan with a predictable rate and I want to talk to you about that today so what are predictable rates so I think everyone's accustomed to viral rates in D5 uh every block they they can change without a problem um but in difference is a maker that doesn't happen that you we have governance defined uh rates which means through an open and transparent process everyone knows when that rate will change and also what the value of the new rate will be um what is that good well predictability and the important thing here is for the people that didn't put the hands up about what we've been doing the last six months is we've been expanding and innovating the ways that people can interact with die and its predictable rates so a couple of use cases depending on what you'd like to do if you're a borrower you can now borrow die using spartaland our new lending Market you can use eth or any state if derivative as a collateral and main diet a particular rate uh if you're a depositor or you're a looking for a yield you can use uh s Die s die is the ERC 4626 so the bubble token uh representation of the die savings rate module it's a waveform maker to pass on the profits from the protocol as yield to every die holder that interacts with it we also have for Builders and protocols we have conduits conduits are the way for your protocol to have makers the ultimate liquidity provider these are standard interfaces adapters if you like to call them um connecting maker with the rest of the ecosystem being able to move funds around and I'm not going to bore you with my lovely diagrams but then what I really want to take the value from this is conductors are extremely simple to design actually to implement we want to abstract all the complexity of way of integrating with maker leave that to us and for you to be able to enjoy us and our liquidity so prices we have 20 000 die available in different categories main one is maker conduits the winner winning team will get 5000 die the second will get a thousand die and then for everyone else that actually does use conduits or Builds on conduits they'll be splitting a 2000 die reward similar to as die the winning team will get 5000 die a thousand die for the second winning team and then for the rest will be splitting out um a pool price reward upon the people that integrate as I remember it's a 4626 token they can easily integrate in your projects last but not least any project supporting die sorry spark or maker ecosystem for that matter is eligible to win a two thousand dollar reward and if you do something actually benefits the ecosystem it is also a thousand um dive Coopers to be split um so with that I'll leave you thank you so much and if anything please come to talk to me everyone that doesn't know what's happening in mega governance I'm here simulator thank you [Applause] awesome please give our partners another round of applause for all the things that they're talking about you can see all those details again very soon now next up what I want to do is take some time to interview Juan Benet Juan Bane is one of the founders and founder of protocol Labs which you may know is the company and the organization behind falcoin and ipfs we're going to talk about a lot of things so without further Ado let's welcome Juan on stage [Applause] welcome thank you so much excited to be here you've uh you've been irregular at a lot of our events which is exciting because you have so much context about how everything is going so what I want to do for for uh today is talk about a handful of things I want to talk about all the things that you're seeing are interesting let's talk about how do we do things about startups let's cover all the things that you are potentially tell us what are the most interesting problems that you've seen solved in the last couple of years um I thought I was interviewing you um all right uh we'll we'll get there um okay one of the interesting things at least from my perspective is that having been down this over the last six years I get to see what the progress is on the developer side uh the most obvious thing I would say is we have seen devtools just get infinitely better I remember four years ago you would spend half the time at a hackathon just getting set up and now you can click on a repo and it just magically works not just for basic daps I think the best part is um like I think we just kind of saw with a lot of our partners we're actually making hard things easy too like ZK proofs are getting simpler I don't have to know effectively what is happening behind the scenes if I can just remember the guy in pickle costume I get to write stuff in typescript so I count that as a win um obviously a big thing is scalability from just seeing everything getting clogged from the launch of crypto kitties to where we are now with all these l2s everybody deploying on OV stack like we've definitely gone to a few thousand transactions per second Visa is somewhere between 8050 I believe and uh so that's going well and I would say largely the other thing will be overall it is a lot more normal to say that things are on chain these days uh whether it's the convenience or whether you want to call it ux or just how cheap it is I think on chain is becoming common what do you think great job uh what do I think so I think we solved a bunch of super interesting problems uh the from my view the entire space has managed to build in the last few years an entire Financial infrastructure that is self-standing using crypto economic incentives to Now do much more financial processing than the traditional wire Network than the European wire Network and so on and we can now do microtransactions and local payments and micro loans and so on and so we have stood up basically a decentralized financial infrastructure for the world that nobody owns and it's a big now I think that where we haven't done as well is in consumer applications right so when you think about the applications that you use on a day-to-day basis how many of the applications you're using today in your in your daily life are fully web3 powered like probably very few right so when you think about communication tools like chat or messaging or you know things like Discord um when you think about forums or even the tools that we use to produce our software like GitHub and so on it's like uh how this entire conversation is gonna end up in a live in a video platform that video platform is centralized and so on likely so from a consumer standpoint in in our day-to-day lives most of our products haven't yet moved over to web3 and so that's where I think we need to go next which is like we spent the last few years building this really solid infrastructure and financial system now we have to bring Bridget over to Consumer applications so we can get most of the applications on the internet actually using the web 3D Primitives and have like the right right structure okay that's something that's interesting so that in a way okay do you think that contradicts the common statement that blockchains are not databases I hear you're saying everything should be more on chain is that the same interpretation or yeah I think so so I think blockchains are databases but they're databases that have this strong um set of decentralization guarantees about them nobody should control them you should have public verifiability to how you can get something included in a chain um who gets rights to change what part of the of the database and so they're not you know like traditional database that whoever the admins are get to rewrite all the stuff it's instead a public shared database now unfortunately the blockchains that so far have been built um on their extremely tight scalability constraints we're finally starting to open up the bottleneck but it's nowhere close to being able to deal with the scale of use than modern consumer applications require right so think of something like Twitter or YouTube and think of being able to process all of the operations and something like that think of being able to build social network entirely on top of these web3 systems like that's where we're headed but does that mean you're saying the scalability solutions we have are just not sufficient or they are not solving the same or addressing the same problem yeah not sufficient so I think maybe a little bit of both uh there are some problems that the current scalability structures don't quite get you there like when as you many of you Builders are going to try today um and tomorrow uh your hacks will end up invariably meeting a bunch of centralized infrastructure providers in order to pull off the kinds of programs that you want to build and at every moment there I think like oh damn like this is still a web too uh now you have to think about how do you move that into web3 and that's kind of the the missing set of pieces so some of it is think of like the back end services and back-end data processing pipelines and so on we need to build infrastructure for that I call call that kind of compute over data networks and the other part is just the raw scalability like the the entire industry right now is has been pushing really hard for scalability and we're now getting to hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of transactions per second I think we need to hit not Millions but trillions of transactions per second like yeah yeah start thinking in levels of you know all tweets going through some kind of blockchain infrastructure like we need to hit that kind of scalability per second collectively not on a single instance so collectively as the entire industry but I do think you can get to this kind of level in kind of One Tree so if you think of ethereum with the set of l2s as you're starting to form a tree think of that programmatically being able to expand um to be able to deal with the demand of of block space plus you need to be able to do clear transactions way faster than kind of um you know the current block time you need to be able to do operations that are subsequent so think of traditional data centers traditional operations you want to be able to do scalable High throughput database updates basically within a data center at sub second speeds once we can unlock that then you can get you know the broad base set of applications Rewritten in in that web3 landscape so like that's kind of the blocker between where we are today and the free internet that we're all working towards right so this entire movement started with a goal of building these New Primitives new foundational infrastructure to build a better rights oriented human controlled human data preserving um internet in order to get there we need to build that level of scalability so that any developer um can Target the cloud or can Target the web 3 Cloud Target the decentralized cloud so think about it that way I mean that's a it's a very uh I would say Contra not contradictory I would say the Bold strategy cotton let's see how it plays out yes uh contrarian is the word it's looking for uh we don't think about everything I mean even web 2 isn't thinking about having databases be optimized for this scale so uh that seems like a not that explain it I feel like okay this makes sense if you're trying to replace something or offer a built alternative it's got to be at least marginally better more than marginally better and uh in context this this makes a lot of sense how does Computing over data come into play here yeah so when you think about modern Services uh some amount of the operation happens in the client side so think of like in your phone or your browser some operations happen there some operations happen when you submit a request and you know there's some a little bit of business logic that happens a lot of that has been now built in kind of blockchain structures today but a huge fraction of the computation happens machine to machine uh afterwards it happens as part of background processing so think of like if you upload a video to YouTube um YouTube has to like rescale that video it has to post process it it has to apply filtering it has to figure out the metadata it has to update a bunch of feeds it has to um push it to all the subscribers there's an enormous amount of processing that happens behind the scenes and all of that kind of computing infrastructure today in our industry is still happening in a fully centralized web 2 context we need to get all of that kind of stuff to be able to be operating over a normal web3 decentralized infrastructure and so we need to get like The computational Primitives to be able to do that kind of processing what's missing in that primitive is it just having the sure capacitor to set up these pipelines or are we waiting for something to be invented I think one part of it is being able to do kind of like job scheduling or kind of um being able to run uh kind of what normally would be in like a web server um but as services that are blockchain powered and that nobody runs or controls that you can kind of run in the network and that includes a lot of computation so you can't put it in the modern kind of consensus throughput you should be able to kind of job schedule through through that so think of like kubernetes style operation but over um in this kind of decentralized setting so that's one component um I think a separate component is being able to do um just like these large-scale data pipelines so being able to define a job that that you want to run over some data you apply some function over that data you compute the output and you kind of feedback the output into the network so I think those two things are gonna end kind of a broader scalability Primitives are gonna get built out over the next couple of years I think in fact the kubernetes is a pretty good explanation because we know how to visualize that and you can set up all these nodes and clusters and run arbitrary code so that actually will be cool um I mean the more you kind of say it becomes I mean it's clicking to me and it's becoming more obvious that maybe this is one of the reasons why I've been seeing a lot of good consumer apps it's because we get to not fully replace every part of that stack with something that we think is is better in terms of decentralization but what's the prediction on how long it takes us to get to Children's and transactions per second yeah so I think we'll probably have the prusa concept of this uh and the first versions of this kind of architecture live in the next couple of years and then from there we'll probably have the first applications that are going to push like all of their operations on top of these things um kind of in the year or two years after that so I think that within three to four years we might see the first fully native web3 powered um social network or something like that or or game like an MMO or something like that um that can just run completely on decentralized infrastructure so not next year not the after that but this infrastructure is going to come into play Then those use cases will appear and that will push the scalability uh up so I think hitting trillions probably five or six years out but I think the tech will be there in two to three years now that's a bill move let's see if it plays off yeah um okay so we talked about a couple of technical things that you think um could use improvements uh I guess one obvious thing that most people kind of don't realize that a lot of the things that blockchains also enable are just economic uh benefits and sandboxing so um anything kind of that you think is interesting is a theme that people are not experimenting enough with yeah so one of the most promising and valuable things of this entire space is the ability to create new um new funding structures so new governance structures around how humans and groups organize so this means new kinds of ways of organizing people organizing groups and so on and this is where we have the capability of creating new kinds of structures so like Dows are an example of this but we need many more such mechanisms to do things like way better Public Funding public goods funding or network funding or network governance structures that can coordinate us into building way better infrastructure and service and systems for society as a whole so I realized a couple of years ago that if crypto keeps growing and the trajectory it's been it's had it for the last 10 years and we can get some good Public Funding Primitives into the network crypto could be funding science at the scale of nation states so just for everybody's knowledge like some science funding around the world is kind of spotty uh many some countries do a lot more funding than others um the US is one of the countries that funds the most and usually this gets divided into different agencies around the world the kind of funding scale is kind of around you know in the tens of billions of dollars per year um for each of these countries so you can maybe add all of them up and land on something like 100 to 200 billion dollars a year for all of science funding worldwide so if you think of like a nation scale so like single billion or tens of billions per year crypto could do that crypto could actually fund science and r d at a global scale we're just missing the the right Primitives to be able to organize that kind of funding structure and the long-term feedback loop of showing that that impact is is returning value back to the entire crypto space so that that can create a feedback loop so that's the kind of thing that I think is extremely exciting about crypto as a whole like these new kinds of foundational Primitives for organizing groups and all this kind of within the the broader community of public as funding so you might have heard from like groups like get coin or network Goods or um optimism with retropcgf and so on so all of these are kind of super interesting experiments for how do we use crypto native Primitives to build these new kinds of funding structures and I think that's one of the most exciting areas of the entire space no I mean that is actually measurable progress too because we can unlock so much and you can create these special interests groups that care about specific advancements maybe for for the hackers too in the audience is is what you said a request for better tools or we need better economic models it's going to translate that to actionable things so we have a lot of ideas so maybe two years ago we were missing ideas and so um now there's been a ton of Conversation Over the last over a bunch of conferences and prototypes and so on so we now have reached a point where we need to implement a lot of these ideas and test them so we need both implementation of these into tools that we can use to run these kinds of protocols and we need experiments that are actually going to try this and run this and collect data and see how well it works and what are the problems like what parts does it get right what parts does it not get right so we can refine and improve this kind of structure the really cool thing is like we're now reaching um in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars deployed through this kind of public goods funding oriented structures so things like get coin things like the network Goods group and um the retropcs in optimism together collectively deployed I think over 100 million dollars now and so all of that is working yeah and probably more and so all of that is using uh public goods funding oriented structures and so think of that as creating a new new class of of organizational structures that can help us build a better future without having to appeal to like the just the traditional you know private funding routes that one makes sense and I think that's like actually a good way to think about how large groups or even small groups can actually coordinate this a couple things you said about kind of compute and scalability are these kind of things that you believe are specific to the Falcon ecosystem or kind of what's the context here no this is everywhere so I think this is for the crypto now crypto world as a whole uh if we can build these kinds of structures then the whole world would benefit and I don't know like um I tend to not see a lot of the the ecosystems as kind of as fragmented as maybe most people might perceive there's a lot of branding from every different group and so on and it might feel like federalism yeah tribal different communities and so on but in reality most of these groups are extremely collaborative they're in their shared resources and shared code Powers the whole um the whole ecosystem and so there's an enormous amount of collaboration so as an example like the the ipfs ecosystem which sort of like includes the Falcon ecosystem creates a ton of value for the ethereum ecosystem like lipido P which is something that came out of ipfs now Powers ethereum 2 and Powers polkadot and Powers Celestia and a bunch of other networks um and then even something like filecoin started as it was gonna it's sort of like the OG ethereum L2 like the um early on in 20 2016. what yeah yeah so uh we originally wanted to ship Falcon as an ethereum what we call it the time a virtual network uh on top of ethereum uh so like the concept of l2s wasn't around yet what year is this this is 2016 or so yeah wow and so but we calculated the throughput and block space that Falcon was going to need and it was about like 90 to 95 of the entire block space of the ethereum based layer so we couldn't do that and so we had to like uh then create a create a separate L1 but now we're seeing all of that reshuffling and so my prediction is that we'll see lots of chains and lots of systems totally restructure and reshuffle themselves as the the developer experience changes as communities change and evolve and collaborate and so on like what we just saw this week Sello went from an L1 into an ethereum L2 and so we'll likely see a lot of that uh that kind of thing happening uh and I totally agree um I guess on that theme okay so let's say these predictions are are good on timelines in five years we see a trillion transactions per second which means anything you can imagine is possible on chain how should Founders be thinking about building companies and this is obviously the best time to start what's yeah so um this I like thinking about this in terms of maybe a set of stages that uh Builders should kind of think about uh when you're in a hackathon context and this is one of the reasons why I love hacking this as much and where you spend so much um time and thought working with Builders through hackathons uh have us give you this great environment where you can learn a ton you can push your skills you can explore a bunch of different areas but you have a limited time to be able to make your thing complete it and deliver it to um to be judged right and you have to also get good at presenting it you have to some some you have to solve an interesting problem for somebody you have to learn how to sell it to somebody and so all of that forces you to go through the entire kind of like product design validation Loop in one go like in a very fast pace and it teaches you a ton about lots of different things and you'll get a ton of feedback so that's kind of an example stage that Builders should go through so when you're first kind of thinking about potential ideas one part of that is get to being able to build like a minimum version of the product like a prototype or something like that hackathon is a great example for that it'll force you to start validating your ideas now at some point you'll find something that you think is compelling and interesting and you think that it potentially has legs and you're getting interesting feedback from others that maybe there's something here maybe this could turn into into a startup of some kind whether it's startup company or a startup Network or some other kind of project at that point what you want to do is refine the idea and look deeper into it try to validate it more think ahead to what it could turn into think about the who would the users be what are the early communities you could work with and so on so it's kind of a deeper validation step and that will start informing what needs to become your first minimum viable product right so you go from like early ideas early prototypes into something that you think will actually work that's like the key word there is viable meaning some product that you can actually create for users and for whom you're solving a problem and for whom are going to then start relying on your thing once you have that in place you have the trajectory for for a startup and again this could be a startup company it could be a startup Network or a startup open source project or something like that the mode really depends on what the kind of thing that you're building is and at that point you kind of want to start thinking about what's the scale of this thing how um how much funding are you going to require to build this how many other people do you need to work with to to organize this and so for the startup company trajectories or there's kind of fundraising as an option or I guess for all these trajectories there's fundraising it just changes um structure like in open source you're probably raising grant funding in startups you're probably raising venture capital or something like that in in crypto Networks you're sort of somewhere in between and that pushes you into kind of the next stage which is uh formulating this as a as a company or a network or something like that and then raising Capital going through an accelerator or something like that so right now where every all the builders here are I would strongly encourage you to be experimenting through with this hackathon and future hackathons to find an idea and get to validating something that could turn into a minimum viable product you won't get to your full MVP through hackathon but you might get to something that'll let you take that next step and so think about that sort of broader trajectory as someone who's kind of been through the traditional funding route and also the an interface with the decentralized world any uh common bad advice that you think is given out for building startups that does not really apply to badass and it doesn't apply to web 3 companies yeah so the traditional startup ecosystem it has to be extremely competitive and extremely close and private because the nature of those kinds of products are that the all of the AP is very closed and highly proprietary more zero very serious I'm oriented and this whole ecosystem is extremely positive sum oriented highly collaborative most of what everybody's building is open source you can take it and Fork it and try something else and so you you end up with a much more collaborative environment where all of the groups building whether it's like l1s or l2s or services or products or whatever tend to collaborate dramatically more so one of the big things that I kind of see is you want to coordinate and cooperate as much as you can and you want to be very open with what you're doing you want to create a community early on and build a broader community of develop of users developers and and participants that are going to help your product or your system grow and that's very different than traditional um startups makes sense in hindsight um well I want to close off by uh well in this case asking the same question you asked me uh you've been here for in this space for almost a decade more maybe more uh where would you say we're in the space and I guess zooming out how do you think uh we rate ourselves on the progress we've made yeah so look keep it maybe short and sweet here I think that this community has built some of the most compelling and important um infrastructure for Humanity broadly it especially right now the finance stack is really solid but the broader communication stack and the broader internet stack is following and now that all these Primitives are here you as builders get to shape the next big thing the next important set of components so it's really up to you it's really up to what you want to build um and what you make and what you scale that will Define the future so go make it a good one and you know hack on really cool stuff amazing advice thank you so much thanks [Applause] all right last but not least let's just quickly go through all the prizes five hundred thousand dollars in prizes to be given now it's for everybody one inch file coin knows his chain are giving twenty thousand

even sample code to base everything off of and get quickly started so check out eat global.com Paris for all the prize information and you can select which one you're going for as you submit your project so with that pace yourself we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we want all of you to have fun this weekend and this is very much about learning and experimentation so try the craziest thing you can think of that you are excited about and with that happy hacking thanks everybody [Applause]
