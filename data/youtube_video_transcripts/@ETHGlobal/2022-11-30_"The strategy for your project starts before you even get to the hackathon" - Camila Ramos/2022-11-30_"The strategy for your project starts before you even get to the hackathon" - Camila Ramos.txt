honestly my adventure first time hacker starts Way Beyond you even get to the hackathon because once you get here you need to pretty much have an idea and a team or else it's very easy to get discombobulated trying to find an idea trying to find something everyone agrees on so really the strategy starts before you even get here and that's around finding a developer community that you can join and that way you can find people where you can say hey who else is going to this hackathon let's start thinking about what we want to build so that when you get here you already have this really sustained strategy a really good idea and you can kind of skip all the discombobulation that comes with trying to figure it all out here in a moment
