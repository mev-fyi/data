foreign [Applause] [Music] new possibilities newer paradigms and each time we're faced with two choices to accept the tyranny of the unchanging the barriers of the unimaginative and except as our faith any misfortune [Music] or we could face these hurdles head on shine light unto the darkest corners and find others on the same path as us and together Blue World in our image but our Collective Vision makes way for the skies sowing the seeds of the future alongside bright Minds and as we choose to persist progress and prosper we build Gardens of Our Own [Music] how's everybody doing welcome everybody my name is kartik and I'm Nishant we're super excited to welcome all of you to eat India 2022. Sean it's been uh three years since I've seen you last have you doing you know Gothic just uh persevering through the winter with a warm water and the cold wallet and Karthik it's it's also like you mentioned it's been three years since you came to India last how is India treating you well my body doesn't know what time it is but I feel amazing it's 8 pm to wish the whole crowd good morning in the night and get away with it so I'm going to go ahead and grab that opportunity and wish everyone GM gmgm welcome to Bangalore you know most people don't know this but we launched eth Global by publishing a medium blog post on Valentine's Day in 2018. and we talked about our plans to go to the rest of the world and get people excited about ethereum six days after I got a cold email from a person named Shakti gope saying there's a lot of people in Bangalore that are excited about this space and if Global should come and do an event that was the single most hand convincing cold email I had ever received and a few months later we did the first ever East India in 2018. that event was 200 people that was the entirety of that space in the Bangalore and the rest of the country and the year after we came back and we got to 400 people and here we are standing in front of two thousand two thousand that's so that's a big number you know it's it's really hard it was really hard at least for me to imagine what it would be like to stand in front of 2 000 people so you know what I did I imagined a group of 20 people and then multiplied that by a hundred and imagining even that just imagining that was less intimidating than actually standing here today I haven't really been you know Under One Roof with 2 000 people simultaneously but I bet you have since you've attend so many events and actually I haven't this is the biggest event we've ever done whoa two thousand two thousand um you know I think like you said you know with the first E10 there came the awareness of web 3 and ethereum uh into India um and you know people got to know about it and you wouldn't know but it was actually first time for me too during 18 year 2018 when I learned about the philosophy underlying web3 the philosophy of decentralization and dresslessness you know that you can truly create something for the people something that's open source transparent and more democratic than many democracies and whatever I understood from that idea I actually put in a t-shirt that I designed a very few days ago before flying to East San Francisco in 2018 which back then was the biggest one we'd ever done and here we are twice as big twice as big and yeah here is the t-shirt that I designed it is very lovingly referred to my friends and colleagues as the people t-shirt and also as the purple t-shirt buy some severely intelligent people so yeah got like two thousand two thousand verified vetted and young web3 Engineers uh the youngest among us tonight is just 14 years old wow and you know as as we have grown from 200 to 400 and then to 2000 uh web 3 like any other technology has also grown you know through its stages starting from small rooms then smaller offices than bigger offices to hobbyist homes and finally ready to take over the world and I believe we are at that inflection point when we are ready to take over the world everyone is watching us and we are making the moves and if not at that point at least we are very close to it I definitely agree look at look at the 2000 people and you know at this stage we love talking about numbers don't because like we love talking about that there's a two trillion dollar market cap we love talking about the salaries in web 3 is 100 000 and 300 000 and all that right numbers numbers have a beautiful way of abstracting complexity into simple trends like growth and fall and rise and decline Etc numbers are the most beautiful invention and a Bedrock of a society and economy but one of my favorite science fiction authors said that the only true way to achieve artistic wholeness is to create with one human in mind and you might say that's a great quote Nash and but that's for art uh we here are makers of software we make software it's software art and I would say that yes software is odd and sometimes when software works well it is more than art it is Magic unless we forget that the only specie on this planet capable of experiencing magic and availing direct benefits of it are humans and I think if we just keep talking about the numbers we will forget about the people and not only it's important that we keep the people that we are building for in mind but it's also important that we keep in mind the people that built for us and like Karthik mentioned in most part all of us being here tonight owe to one man Shakti GOP the founder and CEO of their folio he's no longer among us and um you know this is the last time that I'm ever going to say his full name because he will always be Shakti sir for me because in a college uh we had this tradition of suffixing Sir at the end of a senior's name I don't know if it's still the case uh someone from the audience uh who was also in my college can clarify that um but I never call him sir just because of that reason I call him that because he was my friend my mentor and possibly the only person outside of my immediate family to truly believe in my abilities and I would have been really happy if it was just me he believed in but he believed in the potential of entire young India the pulsating potential that dies if not given a nurturing Community a nurturing environment and opportunities and that has been our goal from the very first day since we started their folio the first seats of this Vision was sold in 2015 when we organized the first version of in-out hackathon at our College that was just 45 people in one room and the journey from then till now has been absolutely intoxicating um Shakti said was born in um small town of jhansi and he studied MSC physics from nit Surat not by choice but because at that time this particular College had the best one of the best internet infrastructure of the entire country and he really wanted to be there because back in 2011 having fast unlimited internet could open so many dose of opportunity for you and so that is how he found a way to be there to apply for MSC and not go through the Cutthroat engineering exam you know plague the country still he always found a way in the true entrepreneurial sense and I was also one of the participants of the first in out and I won the third prize there and no doubt it changed the trajectory of my life uh from then and it's just not my story it's a story of many many many Builders from India who have come in contact with their folio with East India and everything else that we do and we've seen that firsthand as people have come to us in the last few days sharing this directly yeah and you know Shakti sir was never fond of the Limelight you would have never seen him he was always sitting in the corner trying to put out fires pushing everyone ahead of him and never really asking for attention and he would have absolutely hated the idea of putting this big picture of his in front of 2000 and even more people you know but just for once if we can see I wanted him to see all the people that he worked for and I wanted you all to see the human that worked for you because it's all about people in the end and this is possibly the most naive and non-technical advice that you'll receive for the entire duration of this hackathon but as you are building please don't forget about the people Shakti was a great man and a good friend and we owe a lot of this to him it uh it started with East India where we uh we took this uh typical photo every year behind this backdrop showcasing all the good things that we knew about it this is 2018. This Is Us in 2019. and I can't wait to see what this weekend is going to look like so with that I'd love to get started with ethania 2022. for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is my typical line telling you all that this is not a conference this event is an eighth global hackathon organized by eat Global in participation and collaboration with defolio and our mission is to bring in thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and this is why we focus on building this is a hackathon everything here is about Builders and this is a place for all of you to learn Mentor get help and grow as individuals and we really believe showing is way more important than telling you won't see back-to-back talks here because our goal is about empowering you and increasing your skill sets and this brings us to the third India eth Global has done this is Asia's biggest ethereum hackathon and officially eat Global's biggest event ever we have over 2 000 people from 321 cities and 34 countries in the building today on top of that 44 of them are new to web3 this is an incredible amount of audience that is getting into this ecosystem so please give them a big round of applause for taking the chance to build something that they're excited about we put everybody on a map to see where they were coming from but the best part of it is that for the first time ever we're going to zoom in and see the representation in India this is incredible and I can't wait to meet so many of you here and learn about what excites all of you on top of that we have 317 ecosystem mentors 13 technical mentors who are here to answer all of your questions and 27 workshops covering out all amazing protocols here work and because this is not a conference we're going to do just five talks all the talks are going to happen tomorrow we're going to have Jeremy talk about liquidity pools and defy infrastructure and how to take advantage of what's happening in this space muli is going to talk about how do we make our contracts secure and add formal verification system is going to talk about pioneering RTC and making that more decentralized and Juan Benet from protocol Labs is going to talk about how do we build and raise for web 3 startups in 2023 with everything that's happening in this space now I said five talks and there's only four here so to reveal the surprise we're gonna have vitalik here tomorrow joining in via Zoom answering questions about the future of this ecosystem that's gonna happen at 5 30 on this main stage all talks are here going to be where I'm standing right now and we have 350 thousand dollars of prizes we're gonna give all of that away this weekend and we're going to go into all those details for all of you very soon I want to quickly shout out to the 45 incredible partners that have helped make this event possible so to give them a big round of applause I'm going to have all of you thank them with me so I want to give a big shout out to by economy polygon Quest Book World coin push protocol ipfs filecoin ethereum Foundation stack OS ZK Bob covalent come on keep clapping Cartesian connects infuri ether spot e-y-e-n-s safe hyperlane insta dap le5 Dune live Pierre Mina Power Loom Valas the graph nft Port quick no router protocol australium start on eigen layer revise AWS adaples and coin shift all of these amazing people are here excited to talk to all of you and they're giving away a lot of prizes and we're going to cover all of that soon so before we go into all of this I want to make sure we take the next 10 minutes to talk about how everything is set up this weekend so let's go into what we're going to cover we're going to talk about venue and activities how you can get help for your projects all the prizes of course all the workshops that are happening how judging Works how team formation works we also have an amazing fireside chat here with you right after that so before we go into all those Logistics a quick reminder to all of you about security everybody must have their wristband and their lanyards on them at all times because it's the 24 7 venue we are going to tighten up the security at night so if you do not have both of them on you you will not be allowed to enter either of these buildings very simply no wristband equals no entry do not try to cut this off because we will also not be reissuing a second one for you so please please please keep your wristbands on on top of that this is a 24 7 access facility for the weekend so do not leave your belongings unattended there is a cloak room but there's a clearer process for how you can keep your stuff there if you lose something and you were not attentive about it neither is global nor depth folio will be able to help you or be responsible for anything that you are going to misplace let's talk about value and activities yeah yeah Halls this is the new hallway you're setting it's got the main stage it's got the hacking tables or the partner boots are here the workshop rooms are here too and the most important information of them all is the resting zones are here but the resting zones in Hall one are only for females the hall the old hallway did your check-in has the resting zones for the male males only so again females in the New Hall and males resting Zone in the old Hall we've got more hacking tables there and we've got games food and judging all happening in the old Hall and we've got you've already seen the snack area outside and yes they do accept crypto no I'm just kidding it's all free how much ever you can eat and then we are going to have activities we have kite flying tomorrow right outside the venue four to six pm I suggest you join it especially if you have not flown a kite before it's really fun and then we've got meditation happening tomorrow from six to seven PM a great way to take your mind off coding and you know relax for a bit amazing and let's talk about communication all of you here should be on the Discord that means if you're an accepted hacker or a partner or a mentor or a judge all of you will have special permissions to see the channels that are only visible to eat India attendees you can go there you'll know this because you'll see I eat India sidebar section and you can do that by heading over to your hacker dashboard and connecting Discord and this is where you can talk to all of our partners and get help on any of the prizes or protocols that you're trying to work with and just get those questions answered by everybody that's part of that team here and also let's remember you're in person you can talk to each other just go walk up to the booth if you have any questions or just shout if somebody knows something and chances are you will get that help that you need and all the official communication will also be on Discord which means that when Sunday comes up and we are doing judging anywhere from telling you if something is on schedule to where things are to what things are not on track or us even contacting some of the teams to be ready for some demos we will be messaging all of you on Discord so please make sure that you are actively monitoring Discord and everything else is on the website the official source of Truth is the website which means whatever it says on the website is what we're going to be following so please keep an eye out on the website for all the details and for those of you who need a reminder on what the website is india.co all right so the most common question we get is how does this hackathon work and what can I do here and when can I start well the good news is that you can start hacking on your projects now and you can work with people of up to five on your team you are also allowed to and able to work on your own you don't have to have a team so you can have anyone from one to five people submitting a project you have 36 hours to hack technically 35 36.5 hours which is 9 A.M until until the submission deadline and I want to talk about what all that means and before I talk about how judging is set up and how summation Works a quick quick uh refresher on the rules everything that you are going to be submitting must be done from scratch you cannot build on an existing project you cannot add any features to something you've already done that would disqualify you from winning any prizes and if you are not a confirmed hacker which means that you do not show up on the dashboard we will not be giving any prizes to a person that's not listed on a team or a confirmed hacker so if you are working with somebody on a team please make sure that every team member is in fact a confirmed hacker if you have any other questions you can find me anybody in the deadfolio team or send us a question on Discord or email we'll be monitoring all those channels and answering those things for you and there's amazing content that's available on demand for on the prizes page all the workshops are live streamed and recorded and everything is also happening here today and tomorrow so if you miss out something or you're sleepy you can just go to eat global.tv and just watch all the videos on demand and catch up and pause and zoom in on the code or anything else you want to do we're making sure that you don't get to miss anything because of any conflict and for those of you who are still looking to form a team or looking for team members in Workshop room one which is right behind all of you here we're going to be hosting a team building session right after I stopped talking in an hour from 9 30 to 10 30 and you get to meet other people who are also looking for other teammates or are looking to join a team and they have a particular skill set so the submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on Sunday this is how all of this works at 9am you'll be required to submit all of your projects and give all the details and then we will be doing two forms of judging there's going to be a main judging and a partner judging process both of them happen at the same time in parallel starting from 9 30 a.m and it goes until 12 30 pm once you submit a project you will go to the other hall for the main judging once you get to that Hall you will be assigned a room number and you'll be presenting to our judges on what you built after you're done you get to come back here find the partner and the sponsor that you are applying for a prize and go to that table and demo to them as well this means you have to figure out what is the right time for you to pick which one of these things you do first if you are too late in the main judging process you can go to the partners first and then come back to the main judging or if you are one of the first teams at 9 30 a.m to go to the main judging process you get to go that do first and then come back and do partner judging you also have to do that for every partner so if you picked on your prizes three companies that you are applying for you're gonna have to demo three times to them and then one more time for the main judging so make sure that you are accounting for this time because we have to judge hundreds of projects in that same window to make sure that we are there to the same schedule because people have flights and travel plans so we cannot delay for how does that work everything we're given seven minutes in total to demo of which four minutes are going to be for your demo you can do a live demo of course and we recommend the recorded demo of your project so in case something goes wrong whether it's the internet or a mainnet transaction you can still just show what how it's supposed to work and you don't lose all of the hard work that you've done really really really reminds you to not do this last minute because this will take a lot of time at least an hour so make sure that you are writing yourselves and you can check out the project submission form and get all the things right and you rehearse some of your demos to really take the best advantage of the four minutes that you have all these details are going to be on your dashboard and we'll also be sharing all this on Discord and of course if you forget to specify that you're applying for a prize with one of our partners there is no way that we would know that you wanted that prize so do not forget to select that button because we cannot know that you wanted to apply there and if you go to them they will have no record of you because they will not see your project on the list and that would complicate a lot of things for you and them so make sure you check and triple check all the prices you're going for and just another reminder you can go to the partners before or after the main judging just make sure you are coordinating all the parallel processes that you need to do and lastly I want to remind everybody of the code of conduct the rules of being at this event are fairly straightforward in short please be respectful to everybody else here harassment in any form will not be tolerated and we will take immediate action and kick you out if you are behaving inappropriately in terms of the criteria anything that you build here is going to be fully owned by you and you retain the full IP of all of your work if you have any other questions or if you need any help if you need to report anything please message anybody on the ethi India team and we'll be on it immediately so that's everything on the logistics now I want to invite a few of our amazing Partners to kind of come in and tell us about the things that they're excited about so without further Ado let's welcome Nikki from ipfs and filecoin to share some thoughts on what they're building hi everybody uh excited to be I cannot wait to tell you about the bounties that we are giving out at East India um so this time uh we are going to award bounties for using filecoin fileco and virtual machine fem and also bakalyao um so quickly for those of you who don't know what ipfs is it makes the web work peer-to-peer makes it robust and verifiable come find me at the booth if you want a two second 101 10 second 101 on how this happens uh Falcon is the biggest decentralized storage Network and is built on top of ipfs uh fileco and virtual machine the latest development in our ecosystem it delivers on-chain programmability to the filecoin network which means you can write smart contracts in solidity and deploy them on top of filecoin and do compute over it fevm is in testnet and we are excited for people to build a new new projects on top of it this is the very first in-person hackathon where fem is expecting fvm testnet is like ready to build on what all can you build practically everything data dials nft projects uh blending projects go wild take a picture of the QR code over here to find all resources about fvm there's mentors available around the clock on the sponsor channel ipfs filecoin on e-global Discord so please either find us at the booth or post on the channel there's somebody available 24 hours to answer your questions is a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload so this is distributed compute instead of it being in uh in like a centralized single server this is also a very new project and we are very excited uh to see what comes in now what are the prizes we are giving away we have two tracks there's the storage wizard track you can build anything using web3 Storage nft storage or buckaleau and qualify for this track the second is the fvm track build anything using fevm deploy it to wallaby test net and you qualify for this track we have ten thousand dollars in prizes for each of these tracks it has top three winners two thousand dollars each and ten pool prizes uh for each of these tracks so totally 26 teams stand to win prizes uh we have a lot of Grants and other programs which you can apply to at a later stage uh if if two days hasn't been enough for you to explore all the Technologies um look for mentors on the sponsors ipfs Falcon channel on eat Global Discord uh after the hackathon the story never ends uh we if you're looking for ideas to build on on fvm the first QR code has a very long list of projects you could just pick problem statements that you could just pick and start building on and all the other post hack opportunities can be found on the hackathon's website do go there and we have a booth and we'll always be there to answer any questions you have thank you very much all of these resources are also posted on the Discord Channel um and good luck oops yeah thank you thanks Nikki next up we have Sachin from bichonomy please give sasheen a big round of applause hello everyone and thank you for the warm welcome and it's really great to see you know all of you uh showing up here that shows how well the whole web3 you know developed Community has growing so if you just you know go back in time a bit and see how the whole you know past one year has been for us I mean uh there has been a lot of volatility you have you must have seen and you must have heard about you know stories of crypto crashes happening centralized point of failures and you know people saying web3 is dead or you know web3 is over but that's not why we are here today right we are here because we believe in web 3 and we are all heads down and you know building towards the future and the building is all you know what we are here to do so we are really you know proud to uh you know partner with India as a sponsor uh just to grow the whole web3 developer you know community and uh you know from the past events you must have learned you know until now the importance of self-custody right uh and how important the decentralization is you know they are saying decentralization doesn't matter until it does and it does now so uh but how do you build these you know application uh that has the self-custody and it's really hard to build this application and that's why you know for the past majority of this year you know we have been heads down building this developer toolkit uh which is called by economy SDK that is you know solving uh the problems for developers to build these self-study applications but without compromising on the user experience and the decentralization and ownership so this bichonomy SDK you know you can uh find Solutions right from onboarding until engagement for you know on an application so you can find modules like social logins where you can so you know log in your users using the social accounts you can find solutions for Fiat onboarding and uh then on the engagement part you can utilize gasless transactions cross chain transactions and even the transactions where users are paying gas fees in erc20 tokens so all of these you know solutions from onboarding till engagement all of them are packaged under one SDK which is pyconomy sck and uh we have three bounties you know worth ten thousand dollar uh you can just check the bounties you know on eth India page and uh our booth is there we are all here for the next you know uh two days uh just to help you out if you have any problems if you run into any queries all our engineering team is here you you know who have actually worked on the product so they are the best person you know to help you out and uh yeah all the best you know to all the developers out there and all the hackers and we wish you all the best thank you thank you next up is Rahat from polygon please give Rahat a big round of applause thank you Lord what's up come on man how did I say what's up and what did you say Bangalore what's up there we go my names are hot I am here to tell you a little bit about polygon though a lot of you probably don't need any introduction to it but I'll do a little bit an intro here uh we're polygon ethereum's internet of blockchains here at eth India here to support all of you hackers all of you Builders out here and a little bit about polygon in case you know the 44 of you who are new to web3 uh polygon started off as a scaling solution with this Premier product which was the polygon blockchain built on something called a public plasma checkpoint notes and uh this was awesome this was a great way to make building on ethereum a lot more accessible to a lot more folks all around the world since then though we have become what's called a Swiss army knife of ethereum scaling so it's not just the polygon blockchain that you have now we've got a whole Suite of solutions that you can build with just a little while ago I gave a workshop on polygon ID so if you want to go in learn more about self-sovereign identity ZK proofs and all that that's a workshop you can go back to and uh how do you start building on polygon right the cool thing is why do devs love polygon all of the tools that you already use in the ethereum EQ system map one to one right over the polygon so we already have the best developer ecosystem in all of web 3. that's all of you that's all of that's everyone in the ethereum ecosystem your solidity tools your JavaScript tools all of the amazing tools that already exist are usable right off the bat and we've got twenty thousand dollars in prizes for you today so here are some of the bounties I'm just going to go through them really quick we have four thousand dollars available for best use of polygon ID top four people software projects built on polygon ID will be receiving a thousand dollars each um four thousand dollars for the best D5 projects our D5 team has given some suggestions on different projects that you can build so those are all available uh through the um eating their website and four thousand dollars for best public goods and four thousand dollars for best ux actually they did a ux uh workshop for a previous eat Global um hackathon so definitely check that out to understand what kind of ux we're actually looking for and the final one is four thousand dollars for best developer tools or without Julie so one thing to make sure that you do whenever you submit make sure to include a link to a deployed contract in your readme this could be deployed on the polygon Mumbai test Network it could be deployed on the polygon mainnet it can also be deployed on the ZK evm test Network which is available um right now for you to deploy on so thank you uh really really excited to be building with you all through this weekend I'll be available at the booth and so will the rest of the polygon team thanks just uh yeah amazing well none of you should be strangers to polygon and we'll uh talk a lot more about that but up next I want to bring in harsh and not Richa from British protocol hey everyone I'm Richard what's up so yeah as Karthik introduced I am Harish founder of push protocol let's talk about very quickly what we do awesome so yeah we are going to talk about what why and the bounties and hopefully and under two minutes uh let's get started so first of all why so if you look at web 2 you will notice everything starts with a notification whenever you pull up your phone you have notifications from app and that drives you their users back to them even when you're chatting on WhatsApp you're not chatting you are actually notifying the other person and that's how chataco even if your face timing someone again notifications but surprise surprise notification was not a reality on web3 before push and actually fun fact push was created and started from Eid Global 2020. how cool is that awesome from then to now we have 18 million notifications we have over 100 plus Integrations and notifications are flowing to 80 000 subscribers these are some of our friends and finally the bounties so yeah we have six thousand dollar for push chart anyone implementing per shot gets that not anyone we have for a second third price same for push notifications but yeah we have a very special price eight thousand dollars split among everyone that builds on push thank you very much stop guys amazing it's always amazing to see projects that were hackathon projects and they're now full-blown protocols and companies in this space all right a couple more Partners to go I want to now invite flywheel to talk about worldcoin please give them a big round of applause gmgm everyone uh I'm flywheel uh I work at worldcoin and I'm so excited to be here uh it feels amazing to see all of you building today and uh we're so happy to be here so uh to talk a little bit about what worldcoin is in case uh you don't know and you haven't seen this little thing called the orb uh world going started from the premise that you know crypto is awesome and unfortunately the value is being quoted by uh two percent of the population so what if Bitcoin would have started by giving one Bitcoin to each person of course this is not possible today with Bitcoin so that's why we decided to create the worldcoin token so the worldcoin token is a limited Supply token 10 billion tokens and every human on the planet can claim a free share of worldcoin just because they're humans uh course the very quick problem we run into is how to make we make sure that each person only claims their their share once uh and that's why we create a world ID so World ID is a privacy preserving proof of personhood protocol it's enabled by the orb uh it enables civil resistance at scale so it basically lets you prove that you're a real person that have never done something before like boating uh airdropped and minting nfts and a bunch of other things so think of actual Democratic boating and things like that um uh so this is a fully open protocol fully decentralized we're currently uh live on polygon mainnet uh and you can start building right away go to worldcoin.org India we have a bunch of prices twenty thousand dollars up for graphs in different categories including a prize pool so uh we wanna we wanna get us uh as many of you building on on worldly as possible and uh good luck to you all thank you just because thank you amazing and one more to go please join me in welcoming avilash from Quest book got a fan base here hello everyone uh I'm abhilash uh what is uh Quest Book quest book for all the devs here I'm also a Dev uh Westbook is your best friend before the hackathon after the hackathon quest book helps you get grants you can go to Quest book after this hackathon you can apply for Grants before the hackathon also you can go check out before the next hackathon so that's Quest book so we work with multiple protocols to run Grant programs so most of the grand programs that typically run by committees right now and they have a whole bunch of problems and we came up with a spec uh to fix those problems so grants laws they're typically run by committees and the Committees typically do not have developers so they have huge blind spots they don't even understand which developer tools are going to be important next and so on and so forth so instead like what if we Leverage The Community of experts and what if the grandstander on time is a week instead of like months that is right now and what if the grants are completely on chain full transparency and accountability so we work with polygon away compound and a whole bunch of protocols to make grants process seamless so right after this hackathon you can go to Quest book and apply for a grant with any of the protocols so uh just uh today we put out a grant propose we put out a proposal with compound to disburse one million dollars for Builders so this proposal just got upload today so yeah this uh one million dollars is going to be uh given out in Grants for developer duels uh governance tools multi-chain strategy and whole bunch of these things so all this uh is uh public data you can check it out and once again what is Quest Book quest book is your best friend before hackathon after hackathon if you want to continue
