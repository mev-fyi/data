foreign [Applause] [Music] mask all right almost everyone but the ones who don't have Mana mask please install that that'll be very helpful um the second thing is how many of you guys are back in developers here so looks like almost everyone knows backhand uh or about front-end coding okay 30 40 and what about uh solidity Developers okay so that's about 25 I guess right and that's that's not a bad number actually because I think all of us over here are basically here to learn new things but then you know I think this uh conversation over here will be much more relevant to the ones who are front-end and back-end developers and uh for smart contracts you need to use other layer ones like you know um polygon or ethereum right now quick damage quick quick thing about you know us uh starco is a decentralized cloud it is the world's largest decentralized cloud and you know I'll go through the numbers soon um talk about the vision first right so first of all the way we look at this thing is we kind of challenge the status quo by empowering humans machines Dao's to govern their application infrastructure that is decentralized Unstoppable and extremely easy to use right and by this basically we stand for ensuring we provide a freedom of speech and expression right so that's in a sense what you do because right now if you want to run applications the front and the back end all you have to do is rely on these settled card providers like Amazon web you know web3 um you know Amazon AWS and uh S3 and and for storage and then also comes along with you know gcp Azure you can name them right so that's where stackless comes in as a fundamental mission is that you know we are acrossed infrastructure protocol uh that is basically Bedrock for all the future generations of applications to come that means not just your smart contract layer but also your front end the backend applications can be run on the decentralized web a quick thing about myself is you know I am a finance and international business major from Harvard University you know I came from us last year uh moved here permanently hopefully for some time at least um mechanical engineering about background but you know I worked in the cloud space uh since almost over 12 years 10 years and uh you know I've got patent and cryogenic engines and you know when basically it helped build AWS when during the early days of the start that's 2011-ish so the current landscape right so the first thing is that we talk about uni Swap and uh uni swap is something which everyone knows how many of you guys know uni swap okay that's a good number so but we all know this thing that they kind of delisted all the security tokens from their website and that is kind of very ironical for you know someone saying there's a web 3 project but in a sense they can be forced by the governments and the secs to kind of you know self-regulate or have them remove the security tokens because it comes under the purview of the SEC when you talk about um as apparently equal of parlor so how many of you guys know parlor oh very few I guess a few hands that's it so um how many of you guys know Donald Trump everybody right cool so um so you're probably also knew before Elon Musk came and he was banned from Twitter right and that was because uh of whatever ideologies they had but but in the sense if you think of it this way not really talking about what ideology you believe in but thinking of this as you know a bar on people didn't like what he said so they kind of banned him from there right so um so Twitter kind of you know removed uh um Donald Trump they ended up using they I mean Donald Trump and his community started to use a application called parlor and guess what happened right they use parlor and the AWS completely shut down uh parallel application from the servers right not just that Apple App Store also removed it from their App Store so that's kind of you know you see this is coming more and more uh in this world where when we want to start expressing ourselves there is going to be a complete industry time to you know protect itself and uh that's kind of what we kind of fight for other thing is that why do you think like web 2 has been so successful right but what are the problems right now also I think which comes along so the first thing a drawback of web2 is that the incentive mechanisms are not aligned and when I say that it's basically you know the shareholders of the company are the ones who benefit from the protocol or or their services but not the people who are using it so that's kind of the dramatic changes in this Outlook um you know it is pretty expensive to operate for the ones how many of you guys have built on AWS or create servers and launched there okay so that's about 20 right and you are probably also familiar with devops and you know one of the most expensive engineering domains and it takes a lot of things uh to fall in place to make it work properly so for instance um if you'll get a production environment up it takes about six to seven weeks to get a stable production environment ready right just to make sure everything works fine and not uh nothing really Falls and drops apart so but that being said what really changes things is that uh is that something which we should be worrying about right because first of all it may take you that long but yet we have seen time and time or time and over again that these services do not really even though the production all the secrets are lost you know people get hacked and whatnot uh LastPass you know they got hacked yesterday so that's kind of concerning when you talk about someone who's a security company also can't protect their environment so that's something which is kind of concerning there so again no anonymity right that means if you're deploying let's say on AWS uh you need to first you know give your grandfather's details to Amazon right and uh and that's kind of uh ironical right how do you really work with this at scale um of a something like a Dao can never ever kind of own it because again no doubt doesn't have a grandfather unfortunately right but for people to really run this a community to govern this the only way which we are aware of right now is a Dao and that's kind of an issue which which comes to web 2 and why it can't really uh really be used in a web 3 world now that's that was the question like what we have so far yes the web 2 provides us extreme you know easiness of use it does provide us a lot of these benefits of um you know the great great user experience it has ways of you know ensuring people can access the softwares faster but is it really decentralized if you're using AWS even though front-end layer because all that so far we've heard like in the last few years is we have Smart contracts they call it decentralized but obviously they're using all these Central Services right so as an example of you know a Facebook and how do you decentralize something like that so first thing is just as an example I've just given like one two three four five five pillars and uh you know again there are many more but just for Simplicity and trying to fit something on the screen um what's the presentation earlier that is the UI interface right then you have the data storage layer which has something like S3 or you know databases and whatnot then you have the AI analytics um you know machine learning um again for Integrations also like for communication you require Services which can kind of message and you know you can receive messages be notified when something an event happens and then of course the data sources right that means that you need people to add data to Facebook so that you can actually use it and as a social network so if today if we have to build something like uh like like Facebook on the decentralized web the two things which we have right now so one is the the data layer that is the storage uh that means S3 uh you know you have ipfs for data then you have uh you know blockchains like ethereum and polygon to you know as services and then you have chain link right for any of the others of course but changing all the prominent ones which kind of uh get off chain data on chain right so that's kind of something which we have so far but everything else currently runs on AWS and again I'm not naming AWS alone but I think it's a generational problem right and uh and how do we solve something like this uh in this new web 3 era we're trying to talk about so so that's where stock was comes in stock was as a replacement for all of your presentation layers your AI analytics layer your integration layer and again there are several of those right and you can I'm sure you guys can tell uh what are the different Services you know which which kind of reli we rely on AWS even though we are kind of uh supposed to be decentralized right so here the the real things which stack OS really solves for you first of all uh the high devops cost is eliminated that means you don't require to run infrastructure you don't need to know AWS you just need to know uh like you know any of your normal regular applications and Docker so how many of you guys know Docker here oh that's the most number of hands I've ever seen in the conference so that's amazing right so all you need to do is dockerize your application and and you're ready to go right and I'll come to the details of how it works really um second one is environment preparation uh you know again it cuts down from you know seven weeks to 30 seconds so you can get your application live in less than 30 seconds on on stack OS that's kind of the power it kind of brings to you um again when you're going to build something crypto native how do you make sure that you know we are you can pay without your credit card because again you know you don't want to share your grandfather's details to to get access to a bank account and do what not right in a decentralized web at least third thing the fourth thing is the governance right that is again as a Dao I said earlier that this is kind of what it kind of solves for that how do you ensure that if the community wants a feature to upgrade they can vote for it and agree that the next version should come out right so that's kind of how this thing works now this is an older Slide the new version which we have is probably makes this thing into two steps right but uh first thing is that to deploy anything on stack OS you need to do Docker so dockerize your application right once you do that you just go Reserve compute on uh on stack OS it's just say that you want to purchase uh 500 megabytes of compute uh for for Ram and let's say you know 200 Milli cores of compute and it can be very granular as granular as you want and after that you can just go to the UI you know and you just click a button and it just deploys those things you know on stack OS so that's kind of how easy it is I'll go through a demo of just of that so as I said earlier so we are the category leaders in in the decentralized cloud and uh the numbers talk for itself right but it is the world's most utilized and the fastest growing decentralized Cloud right so we have total about this is 73 it's an older version uh I think uh we have about today morning or yesterday's about Avo hitting at 81 million requests uh website served to the network um you have about 3500 plus applications deployed and we have about almost 16 uh 100 applications running on stack OS right and that's kind of the power of what's what we have in fact we went main net uh we've been working for over six years by the way guys it's not a new project we just came out from nowhere but our main it was last year month of August uh you know interestingly after August for the next five months in January uh this year we overtook the largest competitor and now we're about four to five times larger as they are so that's kind of you know how what our growth story is um keep an eye on the version two that's coming and version two has got a lot more features and you know way to distinguish ourselves we're trying to get it done through before this Ethan there but looks like it's going to be early January so we will we kind of worked it out and we obviously please be in touch and we can talk about those details as well right again if you want to contribute to stack OS reach out we have a booth out there we're really really good and um one thing to do is that you know you can join the ambassador program and also follow us right again this will be recorded and you can always stop by our booth one thing I want to mention is for the ones who are starting up you know we have some really good uh Venture Capital firms as well um so please do go to your desk or I'm not sure if we have forms here filler details then there for that and uh we have some contacts with VCS as well so if your product is good please reach out to follow the seed one of the biggest uh you know one of the best Venture Capital firms is kind of based from Australia is over here Andre is here he was very kind enough to accept a limitation here so you know please reach out and I think we can make some great actions yeah before this now let me just get to the next part of the section which is the next part of the presentation which is kind of just showing you how it is and how easy or hard it can be for you to deploy right so this is the new account so what I'm going to do is uh first of all all of you guys think can you just try to see if you can import that wallet into your metamask you've been able to do it how many of you have been able to import the new wallet which is there okay so uh does everyone have metamask okay I know the cloud is increasing guys FYI if you're not able to hear me please feel free to come in front there is uh your headphones which you can use to hear me properly yeah but do you guys did you all find a barcode in front of you all of you to raise your hands if you have found that barcode on your seat okay so that's a good number of people all right so so again open metamask you know on the polygon Network scan it and that the board will be imported it will have some you know credits to for you to use um you know use them if you don't use them it'd probably be taken away later on but please use them I think it'll be of a lot of value all right so once you have metamask what I would do is you know if I'm if I'm using my phone to log in um I would just use wallet connect and then you can just scan that with your meta mask it'll automatically just log you in right um for this presentation since I want to show you what what's happening here I'm just going to use my laptop to really log in and stuff so um I also have better mask in my laptop I can I'll just say metamask um and I'll ask you to connect to us a subnet I'll pick Authority and once I do that I do I just signed a message once that happens it will take me to the next section where you can basically see that you know uh you don't have any apps deployed but this is kind of screen you will see in front of you right and uh now let's say I want to do a few things I'll just go maybe I'll start with giving an overview of this of this right of the dashboard again all the deployed apps will be shown here and uh you know over here on the on the top left you will see different uh kind of things so like let's say first I'll show you the CPU how much you have bought and how much is being used uh you know your bandwidth uh your memory and your storage right so you can basically pick what you need and once you do that yeah you know you can go to the hardware place to basically show you what you can purchase how much you can purchase so you can actually just click here and purchase resources and then just add how much compute you need right and then you do next and then you are able to uh pay right what I'm going to do right now is it will give you a simple much more simpler example but if you have to go to the App Store you could go to the App Store and once you're there you can kind of um you know you have a set of applications already here right so uh what I'm going to do is as an example uh show you how to deploy an app and without actually paying for it right now but you know or the workflow itself I think it'll work so deploy Custom Image but you know one just uh you know disclosure here and good faith this is a new UI which we have so I hope you guys don't face any bugs here but if you do please report them it'll help us in time to just you know make it well um again the domain name which I probably didn't mention earlier is app dash V2 dot stackers.io right and that's the new domain for for the new version of UI in case it's not working for you or there's some glitches over here there go to app dot stackers.io that is the older UI but so this is the older UI but this is the exact same thing it's just a better experience over here yeah so let's say I'm going to pick uh this image in Docker so yeah so this isn't you know an open source ethereum Explorer so in that when you kind of go down you know you would traditionally run like let's for this example you run this command to run this Docker image locally and get that application running right so on stack we'll just keep in mind that you see is it clear enough yeah okay can you guys read this okay so um you can basically you know if this is the command you run your port 8080 your image name and whatnot um so we just come here and do this exact same thing copy your Docker image name give your tag name there um and your application name so I'll just keep it Explorer next here is where I put the port IDs so this port is what your container port and what do you want to exposed so you say 8080 and then you have your host URL this can be any domain you want I'll just take for now for this case I'll just take this as domain which stack was provides You by default um so there you can basically save a state full set you can basically set a replica account so let's say I want one as a replica account um and then you know if I want straight filter I can fill that up or I could uh you know if I have to pass arguments in a Docker you can pass arguments as well so you can pass arguments if you have environment variables you can just you know um just put up here if you have a command which has to pass at runtime you can do that but in this case with this example we don't need any as you saw already so I'll just do next and I'll pick my compute you know keep this prices you know you don't necessarily need to pay 100 for everything you need a 4 gig uh machine to run smaller applications and in most cases if you don't have traffic you can use less right so that's something just pick low and if you need more credits that's fine please reach out I think you get five dollars worth of Stack tokens and like one dollar worth of Matic so if you need more for your application please reach out to our desk and we'll give you more for this example I just think I'll just pick 100 hundred one GB bandwidth next it's going to tell me how much I need and stuff it's telling you I don't have any subscription yet so and you know what I will do is I'll just try to purchase them on the fly right so I just do a deploy it will um you know send metamask to open and here I can just pay for it now it can take the polygon time to finish the transaction um all of us probably are aware that some when there's a lot of load on the network it tends to become slower so I'm hoping nobody's minting nfts uh nobody's having empty sales in the bear Market um so the transaction should probably go very quickly but it is kind of it's still the cheapest chain so it kind of works out really well there you go right perfect so you just saw this application got deployed I don't know I think maybe Link in five 10 15 seconds so I'll just copy the external DNS so an app is up so that's how quick it is to deploy on stack OS right and I can assure you and for the ones who use AWS it's going to be quite a while to get anything running uh so that's kind of what we really bring in to this to the space now uh let me give you another kind of example here right so I'll just close this and let's say if you want to really see what's happening on the network so you can basically go run a shell um in case you don't do this you can actually you know purchase your Hardware directly instead of going through at that deployment time so um unless I want to do 500 Milli cores of CPU memory next I cannot get the no um I'm lucky to just have too many stack in my wallet um but not everyone will if you will have it so please reach out if you need more so I'm right on what I'm doing I'm just giving a demo of how you can purchase compute you know separately from a deployment right so um okay error but it's fine but but I'm sure it's got already bought you so if you see the 500 uh you know has been bought here all I do is now I can just basically go and deploy any apps right as I want in this example let me just see if I can launch a shell to see what's happening there so I can you know create some credentials and password username passwords to log in and um yeah in fact the shell is just as an equivalent of um what you would as is another application on the net web yep so it's going to take some few minutes tools to start up but let me see if it's already up here perfect it looks like it's there so I can just pass the credential which I chose to to create the attack service and then you can basically see things right so how many of you guys know kubernetes and um commands for that okay decent you can easily just do same thing so all your kubernetes commands will kind of work here get bots right so this is basically how you see um the services which are running right now on on my network so my wallet is my network here that's what controls everything so we would see Explora webpdy and stuff so the other two applications which are running right so you can again troubleshoot if you want to see logs you could do Cube CTL logs this one man um and you can basically see like you know what logs were there and if you refresh the page more times you can see that if you can tail it again the commands are just as um it is the same general commands which you use for kubernetes so it supports that um no I think it's just Dash F if I'm not wrong to do a follow right so when people uh as and when people are serving the website so you just yeah just press the mentors here I'll refresh this page and and you should see that that coming right so that's kind of you can actually see the logs as well as they generated right so yeah I mean otherwise you can go to your app store and you can pick an app from this place pretty easily so for the ones um I'll just show a game like how fast it can deploy if the app is on the App Store you can just click and run it so for this one I'll do hexgl deploy I'll just use the same name I can change the name if I want to but I'll just keep it this way next everything is pre-configured it's saying I don't have enough compute here but you know I will automatically buy as I'm running the transaction insufficient resources okay looks like I don't have enough but if you did you'd be able to see an app here right let me see if I can just delete something and create um without paying so I'll just go here um I'll just delete the shell because it I think it takes pretty good amount of resources I'm not sure if I have enough again still um maybe I do all right so I'll just come here and I'll uh this time to deploy this xgl game and um everything as you see I've got enough capacity available now deploy all right so that game now is deployed on stack OS so you can just copy that domain enter and app will be up in second so this is the internet speed not my fault um in a second it'll probably just load up completely and then it should be pretty easy to run so the entire game right now is you know I don't want to show off my skills of not being able to play properly but you know that's kind of what it is right so this is a real game which is working on the decentralized cloud and you saw how quick it was to really happening and you know I hope you kind of enjoyed what I just showed you uh if there's any open questions you know please ask those questions but yeah uh yeah all right yeah anyone has any questions here guys there's a microphone which is going around yeah okay there's a question there uh so who's running the servers uh is it a group of operators or where is it all hosted yeah it's a good question so what happens is that there are people around the world who can run these networks so they can they basically uh we have an obstruction layer orchestration layer on top of kubernetes right so people or operators around the world who can run kubernetes servers they can basically launch it install our services there and then connect it you know with overall the blockchain network which we have it's a layer one for infrastructure so that's how that communication everything gets handled um we are as I said with the V2 version is much more complex and it's much more powerful as well but that's kind of how it works anyone in the world can basically create an account uh and uh you know with your obviously metamask not taking your grandfather's details but um you'll be able to just you know add your clusters to the network and when people deploying the ideas deployed into those servers and they get paid for on the cluster operators get paid for hosting the applications there how are you ensuring that the cluster operators serve the right content and they're not acting maliciously yeah so that's the question of verification right and there are a few things so um what what has done is that when people are running Services there is another service which sits on the cluster and uh that's its job is to basically verify what's running there and then what happens is it since it's Network I can all the Clusters are connected with each other they can keep hanging to ensure that the version which is there is true version and the moment they detects that there is a malicious cluster doing illegal things they will lose their you know stack tokens and they have some more things in place as a collateral which they guarantee is there for and they just get slashed so that's kind of how it works it's much like the new V2 of ethereum and um you know same thing goes with polygon as well right because if you if it's a malicious actor or a malicious node it just completely removes them from the network and they lose their share of things so that's how you do it um yeah thank you good question actually thank you the last question yeah they never give me time to host this I don't know why so I wanted to know hello can you hear me yeah I can hear you okay yeah sure so I wanted to understand if uh if let's say I have a microservices architecture and you said like we have pods yeah so if I wanted all of the parts to be you know one particular cluster yes in a specific region because I know my users are coming from us so I want to have it in India can we do that yes uh the concept of V2 which is coming actually Vita makes it more easier right now it's kind of distributed um but with the V2 what happens is that um you can create a subnet so people don't create clusters really they create a subnet and that can that could be for uh you know for purposes more than this for example for gdpr compliance with the ones who know who want only European regions to be deployed onto so you can have a custom subnet serving a specific problem let's say for example gaming right a new one high GPU kind of servers and clusters you can add a subnet for that specifically right so that's kind of the feature which comes with V2 right now uh you know you basically are kind of distributed so it's random right now it is yeah it is it is right now but you know I think in January it should be uh like more proficient that way but um talking of it from just this point of view I think that's how we kind of work work right and once that subnet is basically deployed is it like only my applications are going to be in the subnet or is it going to be everybody's else like it will be shared across other uh not mind Services as well or is it like private to me so your application is always private to you okay so the way it works is that any application when you are signing with your wallet it ensures that there's a separate isolation of your network just for you okay so even though right now it's you know it's sort of protected that way but it kind of extends it even more further right because um if you want to deploy actually that's a good follow-up call you know also an answer to this as well is that let's say you have an application which requires backed and two different back-ends right let's say AI I'm saying as well the database as well so what he can do is that you can give environment variables for the endpoint within the Pod So within their you know as a part so the front end can or the back end can talk to your let's say database all internal to your network so your wallet is your kind of a special Network just for you but you know allows internal communication right so that's how it works as well if you want to build like a two applications or three three layer architecture yeah cool thank you very much guys you know you're asking me to step down but uh please uh sorry um so please you know uh you know come to our desk and uh you know just ask if you have any questions we'll be happy to answer them we also have Discord Community you can join and ask your questions there so uh thank you very much for hearing me out and I hope you enjoyed this morning
