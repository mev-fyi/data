foreign [Music] I'd like to call up Jason from airstack we're going to see what airstack has been up to for the last little while and then we'll go to our final interview please welcome Jason on stage [Applause] thank you all right so first of all uh we're gonna do this entirely live no slides uh ignis on my team is in the back he's running the computer I'm going to show you some things from our website and then we're gonna actually do a live demo um I'm Jason Goldberg from airstack I'm here with my co-founders Depeche and sarvesh and ignis we've all been building an ethereum since 2016. and today we're going to try to show you something that I don't think anyone's showed you before so we're going to show you today natural language search of blockchains we're going to do live real-time searches of blockchain data very complex searches across projects and that's part of what airstack is powering so really excited to show you everyone this today and we're launching this here for the first time today here at eth Global pragma and the hackers at the hackathon this weekend will be able to use our apis to build all sorts of amazing new products using airstack so before we go live to show you the product and to run some queries I want to talk about why we're building this so as I said we've been building in ethereum since 2016 and one of the things that we found uh over and over again through the years is that it's very hard for developers to build applications without having to run lots of infrastructure themselves if they want to query any aspect of on-chain and related off-chain data so you think about the hackathons and the bets that we've been to Across the year so 2017 2018 2019 2020 21 22 up until today increasingly it's gotten better and better for developers so at first we were all let's say you know using inferior we were all running nodes ourselves then we started using protocols like the graph to build subgraphs and index specific individual projects then more recently there began to be some some web 3 apis that we'd call on to get say fire hoses of data but the problem is devs still need to run lots of infrastructure in order to integrate this into their applications so today before airstack if you want to say grab all the on-chain activity of your users who just logged in with a wallet and show all the nfts that they hold are there any ens names or their recent sales transfers and transactions you would need to call several apis from on-chain data download fire hoses of data set up your own back-end databases store images and S3 do all sorts of resizing all of this stuff to query data that's not part of your specific to your app more about just broadly blockchain data with airstack we want to solve all that for devs we want to enable developers to be able to Simply query query the query a query air stack to get back any data they need to connect both on-chain and off-chain data and bring it right into their applications even without requiring a back-end system on their own side so literally ones that developers available to just query the data they need and integrate their front of their applications for end users so they can connect their apps to the web3 ecosystem now I want to show you what this means we're all about show don't tell at airstack so let's just go out to the airstack website and show you what we're launching today it's live for anyone to be able to use on app.airstack.xyz so the first thing to show you is when you go to air stack we've built airstack at the very beginning to be more than just apis it's also a community so it has a multiplayer system built into it whenever someone runs a search a query on airstack and they get the resulting API they can also publish it to the community where developers can help each other to like you either Fork someone else's query you can edit it remix it ask questions to developers the idea is that as a developer in this community we're not alone we can build with each other and help each other build better products now if you look at we see one of the queries here is to get all uh token holders and their ens names for the nounsdale so Ignus let's click it on that one and see what this query is all about and here you see that someone has we're now in the air stack graphql Explorer and we're seeing that someone has uh let's I think we're not connect to the internet let's try one more time this demo might be really short hmm all right um let's try there we go okay all right so someone so the left-hand side of the graphql interface uh English almost had a heart attack just now um on the left-hand side of the graphql interface what you see is this is the air stack schema this is our apis there's various apis for everything from uh token transfers nft data to wallet data identity apis we'll talk about more in a minute in the middle you have the query construction which is this query that the user did to get all token holders uh and their ens names for the Downs doubt and now we're going to run this query and we should get this back very quickly and you see here this is combining data from both our ethereum nodes as well as from ens to get back the ens addresses of the holders of nouns Dao token so let's actually go and run some queries from scratch using the AI generator so this is really cool this is the first time we're seeing natural language search using uh Chachi PT style so it's actually using gpt4 we've trained it on the airstack engine to enable natural language searches of blockchain data and to combine data from different sources all in the same query in response so the first search that we're going to do is let's look at the board yeah 48 Yacht Club bayc and let's get back all the token holders the images of their nfts and if they have an ens address so we're gonna see the AI do its magic here so you can see now that the AI is now searching airstack for both our on-chain sources so our ethereum nodes as well as off-chain sources like ipfs it's now creating the query so it's actually learned how to construct our graphql queries it can do nested queries as well so query within a query within another query so it's now getting the token balances of the bayc nft collection it's also getting the owner addresses primary domain is ens domain name token nfts content value images and it's getting all this and it's ready to go let's press play bam all right so we have now combined in this query data from multiple sources in a very fast query including image resize the developers and just plug this right into their applications so whether you're building a wallet a messaging application a social network whatever it might be and someone connects to your your network with a wallet you can immediately show all their tokens also show their ens Etc so let's do a different type of search uh our next speaker is Balaji let's look up biology.ens so this is part of our identity API you can look up any user on ethereum on polygon by their ens name let's look up biology by his ens name and let's get back uh let's see all the tokens apology is holding um and let's also get if he has a podcaster username so we're going to type this into the generator and it's going to think about this and it's going to spit out our query which is here we're saying the owner is biology.eth so it is going to look up his ens it's going to find the resolver address it's going to get his token balances nfts all of his social profiles we have forecaster today we're adding lens in a couple weeks as well and now you can see with this query you can see here's biology's nfts and his forecaster address in that response thank you we can also start a query sort of like this but from a different direction so let's go back to our query generator and let's search for the founder of farcaster dwr let's look him up by his farcaster address um so his forecaster username not even his address and for the data for the forecaster username dwr let's find his most recent token transfers on ethereum so here you'll see that the AI engine and the air Stacks apis themselves know to put in the forecaster name dwr and it runs all that to his connected address on ethereum and then is able to get the most recent token transfers of the user using the identity apis that way and here you can see the most recent transfers from uh Dan Romero the founder of farcaster okay one other use case we'll show you um so one of the common use cases we get for people who want to use uh developers who want to use airstack is for uh Dows so dowels have people voting on proposals participating in the Dows and a lot of Dallas say to us what we really want to do is we want to get more information about the people in our Dow let's get their ens name let's get their forecaster address what they have it their nfts so we can look at what nfts they have in common so let's go to the orange Dell orange Dow is a funding Dow the AI is not smart enough yet to know the address of orangel but it'll be trained on that next week but what we're going to do is ignis just grabbed the address of orange Dow and it's going to look up sdai to look up the rest of the information using airstack and there we go the AI is figuring this out and it is also making coffee at the same time no Chuckles no laughs okay um uh here we go it is uh verifying the address it's getting the token balances of the owners of downstow um and it's going to be a pretty detailed query here token balances owners addresses domains socials grabbing everything for the holders of the participants of nounsdale um and there we go it is generating the query and there you go so here's the ens names and nfts and all tokens held by the owners of nounsdale so prior to air stack if you want to run a query like this you would have to use several AP either the Run nodes yourselves use indexers grab data from multiple subgraphs let's say and combine them or you'd have to run multiple apis and download the data into your backend with airstack very simple you can ask the AI generator your question and it will search Air stack and grab you your response in a single API response so we're really excited to be able to roll this out to folks to try to try immediately if you go to airstack.xyz it is available today in a open Beta it is free to use um and uh we encourage everyone to try it we have a telegram group to give us feedback on it we're going to be at the hackathon this weekend giving prizes to developers who are building on air stack and this is just the beginning over the next few months we're going to be adding right now we have ethereum in polygon we're going to be fully syncing polygon we're going to be adding more chains to airstack we'll also be adding more projects as I said we're going to be adding lens Co-op other projects to the identity API over next few weeks and we really want to build this with the community and I can't wait to be back at the next 8th Global the next 8th Global the next e Global to show everyone all the great things that developers have built to make better more data where applications using airstack thank you everyone appreciate it [Applause] amazing thank you so much Jason and with that that was four interesting and amazing product announcements we get to see how you can use all these tools almost immediately into your day-to-day and just the opportunity that's out there for making a lot more seamless developer and consumer applications
