okay we're good the stream is out awesome well i said before thank you to everyone in the room today for joining us uh thank you to juan um i i i know we're all excited to sort of see how this goes but i'll give you a second to introduce yourself you want to take it away this is the official hack fest brainstorming session yeah awesome well hey it's really great to be here with everybody uh what i think we ran in one of these brainstorming sessions uh a year ago so really excited to generate a bunch of ideas together um it's fantastic to have another hackathon so what i'm gonna do today is um we're gonna spend most of the time uh in this kind of generative session just um brainstorming ideas and in order to do that we'll look at a bunch of other ideas from the past will actually pull up the old document that we generated that a lot of us generated a year ago with a bunch of cool ideas and we'll add a lot more and hopefully that will help kind of percolate some interesting opportunities for for people and uh uh yeah by the way look i don't know if you wanted to cover anything else i you told me to introduce myself and i didn't introduce myself i started jumping in so let me know if you want no that's perfect okay um all right cool so let's see i will share my screen and uh yeah so like the the goal this session is to kind of make it uh super interactive um and i'm gonna go through a few um things first let's see let me know if you can see that which screen can you see you can see both right now so i've got your desktop and the uh slides let's see um one second so you can see this um with a browser right that's correct great awesome so i'll uh just quickly go through a few slides just to kind of like set the set context a little bit um cool so uh i'm just going to kick off with a bit of inspiration i'll try to give a lot of tips for the hackers uh and uh i want to talk a bit about something i get a lot of questions about which is how to start up in web3 um this is just going to be a super quick summary of another topic given at another global summit called i think web3 weekend and so it's just going to plug for that you can kind of watch that talk to for the full version but there's a few nuggets here that keep coming like up again again again when i talk to people and then we're going to spend most of the time in this kind of open-ended brainstorming brainstorming session uh cool so just quick inspiration um it's really useful to in when you're setting off to build uh something and kind of entering one of these hackathons uh i find it really nice and and usually kind of step back and think through why web3 matters and we're all here building uh building what we're building and kind of how to use your super powers as a as a builder as a as a developer as a designer as a product maker um uh as a speaker and so on uh to kind of make an impact and so you know i really see web3 as the next generation of the internet so the internet has been um coming in in multiple ways uh over time and what three is this um big uh big next next wave and you know it's kind of breathtaking but in about 80 years computing has completely changed our species uh what we can do nowadays with our superpowers uh kind of with you know our super computers and our pockets and this massive connectivity that brings us all together um it's just fundamentally very different than than what our ancestors were able to do and you know you don't even have to kind of think back 500 years or a thousand years or 2000 years um to just kind of uh just even 80 years before the rise of computing um people operated very differently and so you as a human today have just vastly more uh capabilities because you're you have this uh kind of set of superpowers that are that are um delivered to you through through this uh this computational medium and what i find most exciting about this system is that you get to contribute to it too as you can think of you know humanity today as not just um you can think of human today as like living through this integrated system with you know trillions of computers so you can think of everything that billions of humans can do plus uh their uh leveraged um well-applied efforts uh mediated by trillions of computers living and working together in this sort of massive integrated system and you know every single facet of of um what we do as as humans tends to be now affected in one way or another through by computing even if not directly um just indirectly through the effect of computing in our in our uh in our systems and our in our economies in our in our larger kind of intersubjective systems and uh you know at the end of the day all of what computing gives us is this um super open platform through which you can craft a superpower and deliver it to the world so you can think of the internet and the web as a super power crafting machine where you get to create a spell you know you use kind of like this arcane language craft you use this magic craft a spell um and then form a superpower and and deliver it to uh billions of people worldwide at near zero cost it's not zero but it's it's near zero cost and that's just uh absolutely uh you know breathtaking in terms of our capabilities as a species so that means that over the last 20 years um we've been kind of radically improving ourselves through through systems like this uh with all kinds of super powerful components and the really amazing thing the thing that i find most promising and optimistic about this entire outlook is that this is super um uh open for innovation uh it is very easy for uh you know an individual or even you know a small group of people to uh put their efforts into making a thing and deploying it to the to the world and you know if it's something that a lot of other people resonate with and want to use and so on then it'll get traction and grow and and so on and so you know just even in the slide you can probably see a lot of different kinds of systems that have radically uh changed how how you operate and so on uh i think the collaboration tools are just this phenomenal set of sort of superpowers that you can usually kind of do all kinds of things i'd love to see a bunch of these things so even in the screen most of the stuff not all of it but most of it is web 2 stuff and i would love to be able to over time just kind of start swapping out uh all of this for for work through web3 powered power things um and i think we're fairly close uh fairly close to that uh you know it's also worth mentioning for everybody here that you know computing has a lot of other kind of revolutions that are coming ahead and some of them in parallel and so on there's many kinds of interfaces that are coming so ar and vr uh very much interfaces and different kind of ai systems um so you know when when you think about sort of the computing timeline 80 years back and eight years in the future it's really unclear what's going to happen um over this this trajectory so um you know really encourage you to stay at the uh forefront of of computing and you stay kind of um aim for good good features a lot of this technology just you have to remember that technology has this um great powerful capability and that means that people can use it for good or for bad um and you know even that is kind of like hard to find because what's good for one group can be bad for others and so on but i think that there are a lot of things that you know interest objectively like for most people on the on the planet could be things you can aim for good or bad things and so really the powers in your hands as builders to craft the future that you want to craft a really good feature so uh over time um use hackathons like these too uh to build to help triple chip add building the future that that you want to live in let's see um so now in web3 uh you know i think it's really important for folks to uh think through the values of web three so uh we come from like the read write interactive web uh sort of like the web 2 world and we've been adding kind of verifiability and trustlessness and so on to through web3 and i tend to think of this as you know this kind of set of values of being able to kind of um create these notions of writes and bake them into the into the network this is a uh uh i'm starting to see sort of the blockchain systems as like a jurisdiction within within the uh within the internet and like that's a totally different different kind of thing like you can think of blockchains as this kind of legal system in a box and web3 is uh you know really changing every single industry that you can look at um there's all kinds of systems that are being developed um you know it still hasn't uh a lot of our products and applications haven't really uh permeated the uh the mainstream and so web3 has uh is sort of kind of slow um slower than other another uh revolution's gonna spread so i think like mobile and social networks ended up being way faster um but you get every single industry segment is getting getting radically changed by web3 by the way the the reason why i think all the stuff is slow is that the infrastructure web 3 is fundamentally very different and we've had to do a ton of infrastructure build out plus what tends to happen is that a lot of teams end up getting distracted but a lot of teams have set out to build really high quality consumer products end up being distracted and sucked into some important infrastructure project or um into some financial project and so that means that a lot of the things that end up getting built out of what three are either infrastructure or financial products um and i think it would be fantastic if that seems you know if you go and hack on something that is a consumer product you know really stick with it like really help um because at the end of the day most people use um these superpowers through some uh end user consumer product that um that has like some you know nice interface that people can can use and whatnot so all of that will get better only if you as a team stick through through things like that and build those kinds of components uh you know one thing that i'd love for you to keep in mind with all this is that software is eating mechanism design so that's kind of what all of what three is is uh um is really about is it's just that you can create incentive structures and deploy them out into the world and and um and and if they make sense in there and they can uh have like a like a they can scale and so on then they'll uh all kinds of things will will change through the thread and you know just to convince you of the the power of these these mechanisms you know the bitcoin network um is a good example and like always a stark reminder of just how powerful mechanisms are uh this enormous amount of hash rate and and all of the bitcoin mining efforts in the world are yielded by you know a few mechanisms uh and and you know the popcorn network is another good example of this where um just a few mechanisms uh deployed into the network uh can cause like the world's uh you know one of the largest storage networks on the planet uh to emerge in like a really you know short time so uh falcon isn't even a year old yet um in terms of you know one minute launch uh happened and already uh it's one of like the largest storage systems on the planet um and you know this is uh the capacity of that point now is just in kind of about i think even this graph every time i like look at this graph i have to get out get a new new snapshot um we can now you know just to put into context how much and it you know when we hit 10x provides um you know this is like a like an estimate of the size of a bunch of different uh different kinds of data sets and what they might how big they might be and um you know kind of the systematics on using publicly available data and then kind of estimating the growth rate and kind of looking at what that might look like but you know all the things kind of highlighted in blue could just entirely fit in in this kind of storage uh cool so i think let me make it through so the the and i had a slice here because you know what what um i how i approached the question of web3 and and kind of changing the network was um i looked at a lot of the pieces that i thought were kind of broken about the internet and kind of tried creating some projects um uh to help with them so one of them was uh kind of around networking and uh said hey like you know building things with peer-to-peer uh networks is really difficult like it could be really amazing to kind of create a composable framework for um uh for being able to kind of write peer appear to your systems and you know we kind of emphasize that as a hacker if you build something that's composable and and that a lot of people can build on and that is open and open source in the first place um then a lot of people might might end up using it and you know with things like ipfs and falcon like uh it's it's about changing the nature of how data moves uh and putting certain people's uh people's control uh first and foremost in in the distribution of data cool so some quick tips for for hackers so um not a lot of people know this but uh i started off building a lot of things through hackathons so in fact i started my um first set of projects by working through hackathons and kind of i always kind of was really excited about building things and getting to hang out with a lot of other people and and um uh being able to to talk about what what i was building and what i was just interested and so on and i just learned a ton through it so i think my my first tip is use hackathons as a great excuse to build something that is going to teach you a lot and and through it kind of explore some domain explore some area of things and so you know don't be don't be shy about um building a thing even if uh you don't see kind of like a a long-term future for it uh you might learn a ton and all of what you learned there might might feed into something else uh you know tip number two is like sometimes uh you know one of those projects that you'll build in a hackathon does have a ton of potential to to grow from from there um and so you kind of you know as you build things and you participate in hackathons over time um you know kind of timing and maybe one of those things uh might be really compelling uh and sometimes it's not even um a project that you started sometimes you'll find a project that somebody else started and um out of a hackathon and you'll get really excited about it and you'll be like oh wow that's actually really cool and maybe you can join that team and go take it somewhere uh you know another thing that i think is really important for our captains is keep things small and simple so it's always kind of really exciting to when you're building something new to just think of adding a lot of different kinds of things and making the thing you're making um solve every problem and the number one thing to remember is you have a very limited amount of time you know even even a month is a long time but but you know it goes by really fast and um your limited time is going to be best spent by uh by getting the core functionality of the thing working well enough um and just kind of polish that that piece so kind of like the typical uh yc advice is just make something that like a few people love and that's way better than making something that a lot of people might like a little bit um and so really kind of like focus on solving one problem for somebody um and then uh you know that that small simple thing can then grow from there uh one really cool thing about web3 uh that you can lean into is the composability of of the um of the web3 stack it means that you can create simple things that are just kind of some composable piece of software or some composable set of contracts on the chain or something like that and then that in a you know itself can then be built on by a lot of other people um so it's it's a you don't have to build a lot of very complex things sometimes the the more complex platforms and systems don't succeed and it's the simpler more composable primitives that end up taking off i think the the recent successes of um of d5 and nfts are a great example of this like the platforms that uh aim for simpler more composable things ended up having a much larger impact than i think um platforms have sort of sought to kind of encapsulate everything um and yeah i think like uh throughout the hackathon just kind of ask questions uh lean on on folks uh there's a ton of material and content out there that you can you can look at a ton of stuff on the web a ton of stuff on chat um you know really kind of don't get blocked by struggling through something um you can lean on asking for help and or searching for resources and and stuff like that uh cool so um a few thoughts on like you know starting up in in web3 a lot of people uh come to hackathons and build things and eventually kind of want to take one of their hacks and turn those into kind of a high impact project um and you know for those people um a lot of people tend to ask me uh what it's like to to to start things up in in this ecosystem and so on so kind of want to boil it down to three points and this is something that i expanded on another uh talk um and so you can find it online so just very quickly give a summary of it here but you know you can watch that talk for a more expanded version so you know point number one is that the opportunities in web street are truly massive uh point number two is that building web3 is quite challenging or can be uh it's getting easier every year but it can be pretty challenging and point number three is that we're here to help so a lot of groups are super um super friendly super collaborative super um able to kind of help save you time and i'm really excited to do it because people have helped them in the past and so everybody's sort of paying it forward it's a super collaborative community and so kind of remember remember that uh you know kind of like in terms of the opportunities being massive you know remember software's getting law and in terms of the challenges um you know there's a ton of complexity and you know the also the the space was extremely fast so if you kind of stop paying attention quickly like the world moves really fast um all kinds of challenges and yeah like we're we're here to help so you know that a lot of the communities putting um this kind of resources that i'm sure you've you've encountered in the past a lot of platforms that make it easier to to get started um and uh there's a ton of orgs that that are you know especially devoting a lot of resources to helping others get started and and you know build things in the world of web 3. um you know really kind of want to make sure that uh over time you feel super able to kind of reach out for for help uh yeah so i think uh and for the folks that that uh want to go on and take the project that they that they build uh just sort of like my recommended pathway um try building things through hackathons um until you feel like you have like the kernel or something that could be that could be fairly large and because there's a lot of hypothesis going on all the time so you can you can probably kind of um try and experiment with them over time and then once you have something that like you feel like it can grow fairly large there's actually a lot of funding available in the in the web for ecosystem to get started so there's things like prices that come through hackathons there's next step grants there's accelerators and then investments and grants beyond that so there's a whole funding funnel that's been set up that once you feel like you have something um pretty promising you can um you know you're able to find a funding either you know grants or investments that can help you be able to kind of work on your project full-time or help help you hire other people so they can they can help you work on it and so on and you know i highly recommend taking a look at how web3 is changing teams so a lot of different groups are now instead of kind of forming companies and so on uh building bows and building other kinds of uh internet native or crypto native team structures and those are super interesting super exciting um and yeah i would say the other component is a lot of groups offer um at least a lot of people at uh pl play but i think a lot of other folks in other organizations are starting to do it too a lot of people offer office hours so that kind of stuff can be super helpful where like if you're stuck with product questions or um technical questions or uh you're trying to think of like some kind of like economic flow model or mechanism design or something like that office hours can be a phenomenal way to kind of get some hands-on help thinking through some of these problems so um if that's something that would be interesting um this is something that that uh uh folks from jail and from other orgs can can probably help help you and there's a lot of workshops that will happen over uh the whole hacker class um set of sessions so definitely lean into those um but i think yeah office hours can always be useful to kind of plug into into you know kind of direct uh help for what you're working on cool so great let's get to hackathon ideas so what we're going to do is we're going to open a shared document that we used together last year and this comes from a session going to send a link to everybody so you just open that link and you'll you'll hop into this chat together sorry into this uh yeah chat chat to documents um and this is the brainstorm session document from a year ago like almost to the day i guess a little bit a little bit over a year ago um yeah i guess i'm up uh and i'm gonna go over the rules a little bit uh in a moment of kind of like what the the session is gonna um it's gonna be about and then we're gonna go through kind of this whole um we're gonna have some time to kind of put in a lot of ideas and so on as a group and then we'll we'll take some time going through each of these sections um kind of adding and looking at some of these ideas and the whole goal is to kind of treat this as a super generative um discussion uh and you know now that i've spent like 30 minutes like lathering at you um we're gonna uh they've always gonna make this super interactive um and uh kind of work through a bunch of these these categories to just generate more ideas and so the goal is to kind of over time build this like really nice idea base um and you know it's really cool that a bunch of the things here from last year ended up getting built some of them turned into into full full-on projects that that are live now and some of them have a ton of users and and so on so it's pretty pretty amazing to see um that growth and a lot of these ideas remain um super viable uh today so uh pretty interesting that like we started hitting on a bunch of like the audio and video stuff like nfts weren't as much of a thing it was like a little bit of a thing but you know definitely not the the big um boom hadn't really hit yet uh but yeah we'll get to that in a moment so i'll um uh yeah actually if folks are around if you can turn your video on that'd be cool like it could help us all like see each other and actually participate and and whatnot cool how's it going great to see you sweet i am not just speaking into the ether and speaking with people uh cool so the uh i want to go through the rules so first off yes and uh who can explain the yes and rule of brainstorming i don't want to give it a go well anything you hear you first say yes without doing any judgment and then add on to that what else we can do that's a standard in the improv type of scenario exactly um awesome very well put and and why is it important to be uh to say yes and and degenerative again you don't want to block your uh block that thought you want let it percolate yeah yeah so the um yes and uh it turns out that in highly uh technical settings um it tends to be that a lot of the sort of engineering mindset tends to be uh more constraining it tends to to want to figure out why certain things are not gonna are not gonna work so a lot of people that build uh software and so on tend to come into discussions and brainstorm with a sort of bias towards figuring out why it won't work and right away a lot of people kind of race uh when i hear a suggestion racing to thinking about why that thing isn't gonna work and um they tend to say no that won't work because of x and but what happens is that when somebody says no to a thing when somebody proposes something they suggest an idea um it's kind of like a leap of faith and in a room or a document with a lot of people um that suggestion um when you hear a no it sort of like shuts down the creativity uh and so hearing no from other people and so on tends to be like a like a creativity creativity killer so if you if any of you have i love that you mentioned improv and this is where the rule comes from um if you haven't done improv highly recommend you do and in this setting you can usually uh improv classes will show you a an amazing example of what happens when in a scene where people reject each other's ideas and say no it just like completely becomes dead and uh not interesting and so on so likewise in brainstorming sessions with a lot of groups um very much be uh yes and oriented regenerative uh come up with more things and and you know don't be um yeah like like uh copy remix um you know look at other things uh and then if you can think of like something that's slightly different but it has an interesting twist to write it down and and so on uh who knows maybe you doing that will bring attention to somebody else and and they'll they'll make something cool uh great so before we jump into this set of ideas and we'll kind of like go go through them i want to kind of run through some i want to flash like some images at you that i've been collecting for a while the last time i presented these was at a hackathon i ecc a few weeks ago i guess last week feels like forever ago list from a long time ago uh so in this in this list i talked a bit about storage markets data data and computation infrastructure and then and there was a lot of interest in nft so i had a bunch of stuff on a notice there uh so i'll just go through those uh uh pretty quickly so think of um being able to have uh storage markets with a lot of asks and bids on both sides and auctions and live orders and so on um think of a there's a thing called sort of like the dataverse that people are coming up with which is um being able to kind of add smart contracts and articles uh with data data that's large and starting to kind of compute over uh over the data stored in in uh in in source networks there's a bunch of different kinds of markets that could be involved in the storage of data so things like um auction houses and marketplaces and so on there's uh you know connections and bridges to other networks and other chains um you know think of like a marketplace like airbnb but imagine if this was showing you not a place you're going to stay but a place where your data is going to stay so imagine kind of like a marketplace with pictures of all of the different facilities that search providers might be might be offering um this one i'll kind of talk a little bit more about because it's probably my uh my favorite idea and i think something that i think is could be super super valuable um so turns out that right now um filecoin has like this really unique incentive structure uh that that creates a um a condition by which you can drop the price to zero or turn it negative and i think uh i think there's folks already uh at texas i don't know if you talked about it uh yet but like i think they're seeing this in action so it turns out that you can um if you auction uh because there's a lot more capacity than than storage so like the the block reward of five points incentivizing a lot of capacity build up and the the clients are sort of starting to take off but like they're the amount of store data is lower than the capacity uh while that's true uh and that can be true for a while it could be many months or years while that's true it means that you can turn data storage um you can make it free or potentially do negative storage pricing so you could cause source providers to offer storage either for free or paying some of the clients and like that's a phenomenal interest super interesting uh incentive searcher that's available and my sense of like what's missing to be able to to uh to really kind of do that in earnest it's like um the the tooling for options is now uh exists now i think texas has been building it uh and the tooling for um auctions and nfts exists because there's a lot of nfd auction houses what doesn't exist yet is something that puts these things together and says what would happen if you kind of auctioned some very large-scale deal that was like really valuable um you know imagine kind of like some really important data set like this kind of this weather forecast data that that might be extremely useful to uh uh for a lot of people that you know might be really big um and then some organization came to uh sell the right to store that data to the pipeline network to minus in the falco network and falcon miners kind of applied to like bid on that on that deal you know decreasing the price until kind of like it goes negative uh and then suddenly kind of inverting the the flow and suddenly paying for um the right to store that data so i think this is possible and so there's kind of like one really high quality option house away from just this kind of incentive structure that might make um a lot of organizations that have super valuable precious data that the world really wants to store uh be able to get funded by the value of the data they generate which is super interesting um so i would love to see kind of like you know if there's like one thing that i'd love to see out of this hackathon is storage auction houses and you can think of like you know coupling to that like all kinds of requirements that clients might have around certification for the storage or something like that uh there's another kind of interesting idea around data dials which is um if you have daos um could you create the stewarding of a data set through a dao and kind of over time collaborate on and decide on what you keep what you store and so on and kind of curate data sets through on-chain governance i think a few people are experimenting with that but like i don't think it has emerged yet and you can you know think of also coupling this with a lot of the um governance tooling that that is emerging in the in the network uh think also uh like and use really nice and user products things like um slate which is a kind of a tool for gathering a lot of content from the web and being able to to display it uh think of a ton of photo archives you can now store all of this kind of stuff in in activepresentcoin through and through things like web3 storage and whatnot uh think of uh social apps uh and you can finally build these things like this has been the the one of the grails of webster for a long time like being able to kind of build uh uh social media type applications in web3 uh there's a few out there that are kind of getting going but have always kind of struggled now that you can store all of this data for free or potentially being paid for it um i think this stuff is much more viable you can think of stock photo or video archives um think of open access science platforms where all the data can be um backed up and replicated for uh for free um and so on and then you can get into interesting kind of uses of computation alongside the data so you can start building things that enable you to attach some computation close to the data so think of kind of passing um adding since a lot of commanders out there have a bunch of storage plus a lot of gpus so imagine being able to kind of um sell some of the computation that uh sell some computation over the data that people are storing there's some hard problems here around making it very viable but i i think that even at the beginning there's all kinds of use cases where uh you can ride for a while on on um on kind of uh reputation systems uh something useful is also going to like think of your favorite set of applications things that are like a good website alternative and you know go through like how hard would it be to build uh something like that on on web3 and then as developers if you're really into kind of developer tooling think of all kinds of things that might be um that you might be able to might want to store or replicate or distribute through uh systems like this so you know package managers containers vms all of this kind of stuff could now be sorted this way uh potentially this stuff could be could couple well with with uh with nfts um i know people have done that but like package managers were like each package is amenity i don't know i don't know that's a good idea um cool so some interesting thoughts about nft so i think the you know one of the things that hasn't really happened yet is that um nfcs are not yet a productive asset um and that's because nfts don't give the rights of um of the art and so owners of an nfc can't really kind of uh use the art um but the thing is kind of like a misalignment of incentives i think if people um uh if people made uh nft rights transferred with the nfps then that would kind of put the onus on the holder to make that art productive and because of the nfp payment flows the artist would also get compensated so i think something like that would be potentially really valuable um it would sort of make a lot of the nft work artwork um likely much like much more likely to be productive and so that means that the value of these of these assets might go up um also i think like we're starting to see dynamic nfcs uh but uh the stuff is pretty basic still um i think over time we're gonna get kind of like full uh full kind of like 3d environments um as an eps themselves so a lot of people are already building 3d style worlds but what if you could create composable rooms so imagine if you could build um a 3d room as an entity itself and potentially that could be a gallery in which you host other nfts and then you would be able to kind of compose those rooms with other rooms and so you can start kind of building the metaverse over time in pieces so i think i think the meadows has begun already it's just kind of all in pieces and it'll be sort of put together room by room and then stitch together into galleries and museums and then houses and so on yeah i think of like level editors and whatnot and think of like thinking of that as that composition as itself as a ft uh there's a video now you can do video and media other kind of media things as nfcs um the folks at videocoin have made like this really cool video nft uh structure where you can now do like all of the transcoding um to deliver really high quality uh web video through um uh through uh video coin and and blockchain and they've kind of like then done a prototype uh auction house too which is super cool and so you know imagine being able to use that stuff for all kinds of like video style apps so think of like tick tock or vine or things like that and make them kind of web 3 with your native you can also do kind of like pay-per-view media this is also something that that a lot of folks are uh working on already but i think there's still a lot of open open possibilities there and and also think of like uh all kinds of social video applications where you can maybe store the video or like edit the video in some way or you know transcode it or translate it or you know that kind of stuff but it would plug them how to huddle was a heck of a team so that's where they got this started it's pretty pretty awesome one area i'm super excited for is science and a piece so a lot of scientists are starting to kind of think about energies as well and kind of their it's beginning with selling selling the science artifacts of science as art but i'm more excited about treating the actual individual pieces of science like the actual things like the experiments or the figures or the papers and so on as actual artifacts on chain that you can reason about and you can sort of start propagating value flows through so propagating value flows so um the mirror team created a thing called splits that you can use to kind of split the value that goes into one and a half which means that you can start deforming uh networks of splits and you can there's a project called split stream that's focused on um science and nfts uh where you can kind of think of funding the the contribution graph um through kind of splits like this which i think could be could be really cool and just think of like all the different uh artifacts that are part of the scientific process um as something that could be could be put together into a into a um into a network uh and then you know if you start putting together these contribution networks over time in the larger scale you can think of kind of attribution over larger and larger uh components so things like subscribe and so on could be uh could be involved so think of like the nfc um i think there's not enough tooling right now for for all this nft stuff it would be really cool to be able to kind of create distribution graphs for um all of the parties involved with the production of an asset or or uh maintenance of an asset and and kind of like be able to reward them as that asset trades hand so think of like not just one artist but like all of the you know i think like the art school that helped that artist get started or if it's a scientific work all of the authors or the citations that they make and so on um and yeah i think a certificate of impact is also like a really interesting idea that i think it's now doable through nft so i would um this is one of the things that i think could have the highest impact um out of the entire nft market right now i think if somebody did like a really high quality implementation of a certificate of impact asked nfts and made it like a really valuable market it would allow the kind of funding in the future of super valuable super valuable work um you know this is kind of like a used crypto for good type of type of idea and then of course with vanities all kinds of games are viable now that you have a lot of storage you can create entire environments you can look at all sorts of open source games that are out there that have a ton of assets and add them to add them to things like i prefer some falcon and then address them to be able to kind of use them in you know in a website game um or think of kind of creating you can create a virtual world so there's a few around but like i think the you know if you think of the world of games in the world of like games in web 3 it's it's you know the web 3 games are like very few still there's a ton of possibilities that are super wide open so uh if you like games uh definitely like a time to to play with all this stuff um and so i think you know really kind of like metaverse type things are gonna be uh super interesting cool so hopefully that was that jostled some ideas uh nezla let's go through this stock together so i'll give um i'll just kind of like scroll through this briefly and then we'll give like five minutes for you to kind of find an area that you find interesting and just write a few ideas out there um and as you drop something and you see some other people kind of working through this um yeah feel free to comment on things or plus one things or add hearts if you find it valuable i think comments could be could be really useful because then other people might get ideas and like come back to it'll like flag an idea for them i'm hearing some questions so uh possible to get access to this presentation by chance yeah uh i will um send the the keynote files afterwards um now somebody looking for team uh yeah i think uh other folks probably on chat uh might find you um can i elaborate on the certificates of impact from implementation perspective yeah totally so uh certificates of impact are this idea um from a few years ago um from the effective outreach community uh that says that you can create a imagine that you do something good for the world and you create a certificate of you having done that good thing for the world and imagine that you could now uh sell that certificate in a market um to sell the credit of having done that good thing uh what that means is that you can now fund retroactively fund good works so usually good works can only be funded ahead of time so think of grants or um kind of like charities and so on like all that kind of stuff is a way of funding good works ahead of time before they happen but sometimes you don't quite know what will be good or really valuable until after it happens and it would be really really useful to be able to kind of fund and reward good works in the world after they happen and so certificates of impact are an idea for being able to do that which is imagining being able to kind of create a an nft that addresses a um some kind of impact and then the idea is that the person who did that good work describes that good work in a certificate um and then kind of sells it now this kind of raises all kinds of questions around verifiability like spam like what happens with kind of a lot of bogus good works like how do you know that it really happened and so on um you know for for like really big things it might be pretty pretty obvious and the spam problem might not be not might not be high um and in some areas it might be very viable so for example if people sell certificates of impact for planting trees as an example uh that might be something that people could go and verify um so it's kind of like carbon credits you can think of carbon credits as like a specific implementation of a certificate of impact um and a certificate of impact being a much larger more broad kind of thing um but if there was kind of like a very large market for things like this then this would be a way of kind of coupling you know using economic tools for achieving a lot of good good in the world in terms of implementation i really think like what's missing here is a super high quality auction house again so if you look at um you know things like foundation or variable um and so on like what makes um i think what made nfts work is that you had like this kind of a really high quality experience in a product um that you could go look at and say like oh wow like this is really awesome um and you can share it around and propagate it to other people and especially people being able to look at this in mobile um and then you know people being able to kind of see the bid history and so on um then this might cause this might be kind of like a newsworthy thing in the sense that like if you see this and you're like oh wow i can't believe like somebody is gonna pay 2.48 for this uh you might tweet this out and so then that attracts a lot of people and whatnot so i think like there's something about making the art visible and maybe making the auction itself very visible in a high quality way that made the nft market work um and so i think well that was interesting um so i think in the same way um i think what kind of certificates of impact need is something like that that makes these kind of things visible i also think it's probably the case that a profile that collects the certificates of impact that you've generated or or hold and so on uh might be really valuable the same way again i think the nft auction houses are doing this for art but certificates of impact might do it for good works uh cool thank you that's really helpful uh yeah uh somebody uh alexandra asks can we talk to it uh do you wanna talk yeah yeah if it's a if it's okay um so actually i think like look we'll understand why so it's like i totally like spawn what i was going to be doing so i'm a rookie i'm very green at all things dev um so but didn't want to take the risk after reading an article he kindly shared about like tips and recommendations what to do um although i didn't write a line of code for my last idea i think i would just leave that one aside and what else can i do with what's in this one so and so i i i actually i was like blown away between like like the soraa like also from last year i just discovered earlier today like the uh poly rap and i was just like wow like that's awesome so it's like because i was already thinking how to not to be very ambitious but i may be able to do something even more ambitious just because that's already set up uh but what i mean with that is like i was thinking like live here um like live auctions so it's like have a like motion of the artist um i'm a degenerate lover not in art but in just unlocking and having the payment system like with superfluid so and i was going to do it alone it's my second hackathon um i i i'm kind of like oh i want to build something so but we recommend that i do it with a team what's best oh i mean it's really up to you um i mean i think uh um i think you can have a lot of impacts by uh either building something sooner with a team that is more skilled and like kind of building a thing or by taking the time to learn so so don't shy away from learning so you can take one hackathon to build a thing for yourself by yourself learn a lot through it and then the next time around or when you start a new project or whatever you you'll be that much closer to being able to do it so it really sort of depends on on uh on kind of what you want out of it if you if your goal is to kind of towards the end of the hackathon have something that's like working as a product for for people to use and so on then yeah we probably recommend like working with a team but um if you if the goal is to learn like then then just do it by yourself and or kind of share what you're doing write about it so um i think that people learn a lot is as they're um working on things and they encounter challenges sometimes they kind of like write down their own notes either for themselves or a blog post and kind of help that helps them process and um distill learnings from from that yeah i think uh yeah anyway thank you for for that so it's like yeah i want to learn because like for me right now it's like okay i want to at least do that front and back if i don't get to the back end at least if i do front-end development i'll be like oh yeah i did it yeah totally and you know think of all of the artifacts that you make as really valuable right so think of like the design of the front-end that you do as just like a mock-up as like interesting and valuable think of like the translation of that into into code and css and so on is valuable think of the connectivity as valuable and so if all of that stuff you kind of post out out there um then other people can build on it and and then they might make it make it into a thing or you might return to it later and and so on and you're learning from it other people are learning from it and it's more likely that people will um that you or somebody else might might feel something like that more time so thank you luke and i haven't slept much because i had to like be thinking and learning all the others but thank you for the article and thank you one for the advice as well all right cool so other questions any thousand ar filters using nfps a platform where you can create trade and use air filters using your keys that's super interesting yeah probably add that to the list somewhere um where might there be cool stuff around ar yeah i don't know the r's in here now yeah so cool just add it somewhere yeah cool so let's go through some of these um yeah let's start from the bottom this year uh so hey social media um and let me know if this is true i should increase the font size probably shouldn't be processed so social media apps are always like super interesting for people and by the way this meant to be super interactive so as you come up with thoughts or ideas don't be shy and like jump in and talk through it we're all working through this again marketplaces the centralized app store yeah that would be super awesome so i think like right now it is um you know kind of there's hard distribute like it's it's hard to distribute um web3 and crypto oriented stuff uh to users because there's no kind of like proper web free app store um it'd be really really cool to have a decentralized app store um it also might be really valuable long term because today the world is sort of controlled by two two app stores so like all of the super power that you might think of deploying to the world have to be agreeable to two companies in some specific jurisdictions and if they don't like it you know it's too bad uh and that really sucks so might be might be great to have a centralized app store and you could do all of the distribution of the content like the assets the the binaries and so on through throughput coin nft for art on iphones and xlr and platform nfc should provide ownership of a file yeah super cool discomfort discovery has a gamified collaborative platform and it's used to trace and document real world assets example use case would be cars vehicles and so on yeah totally i think i think there are a few things like this i think um i don't haven't seen any that have like really taken off yet um i think another one that is probably uh going to be really valuable is uh real estate so like nfts uh for real estate markets you know like when will be like the first uh nfd auction for houses and stuff like that i don't know maybe that happened already and i missed it by the way real estate markets i think it's going to be a huge thing for uh web3 um i think there's a scenario where like it's super not developed yet um and it's super open for a lot of people to uh to develop stuff and there's a lot of countries in the world that really need better real estate markets where crypto might be super super super helpful option data storage random things offline first medical data yes it's something like medical data can be pretty big um you just have to make sure that you encrypted really well because um you know medical data is super super private and and personal and so on um so make sure that you get the description right is this a open discussion sorry that's the medical data was my thing so 100 all right cool um i actually have like a small powerpoint but i'm just going to not go through it for you it's too much thank you uh that's it posted uh in the chat somewhere for people and added this link so you can you can add it as a link here oh yeah yeah yeah i need to upload it then but um yeah so basically i've been um self-taught and i've worked data scientists and look at radiology images uh basically the infrastructure in medicine is really fragmented it's different from like let's say the west coast uh california has its like own internal system compared to like chicago or new york and um this has like a lot of um problems for like let's say you develop ai because i worked with data scientists they want to develop machine learning for computer vision images data version control was a big problem for us you know they used google drive to upload images and then images were missing from you know the ct scan so there's like um basically i for a year i hacked in other challenges where i'm trying to develop a platform of open source microservices to just handle uploading data for users or like a healthcare system could like pay into the platform to upload data in like a microservices structure but storage is really a big problem is that you know a medical image um every year can be hundreds like just hundreds of terabytes and the cost is really high there isn't like uh i would say like a pipeline of developers really building that infrastructure out so like i i focus on the infrastructure part a lot but like the idea itself is just like really i'm writing some javascript and python to query data and put it into like web3 and that's it really so like that should just be the simplest idea but um yeah i don't know it's a discussion if you want to say yes and to something yeah so it would say like um yes very much yes and like there's a this is one of some of the most important and valuable data that people have and right now the platforms around it all kind of suck in that super hidden from users and so on um and this varies a lot by country because there's different regulations into kind of like what um healthcare systems and healthcare healthcare providers to do with data in some countries it's like the patients don't have access to it and only the hospitals do in other jurisdictions is the opposite like users have control and whatnot um i think this is a perfect use case for web3 it it uh makes the storage of that data very viable and and um you can decide who to share with and so on and encrypt everything out of progress and whatnot but it's kind of a hard project to get right i would strongly encourage folks to think about um doing the stuff in pieces and make it composable so i think where you know one thing that's different from web32 is that um in web 2 kind of like big platforms uh were more successful and like if your platform did more and so on you ended up kind of like um kind of growing faster and winning and whatnot um my observational on web3 is the opposite it's that if things are small and composable and can be coupled together with others then those things end up being more successful and grow over time um and so if you get like a robust component that other people can build on because it's all kind of like everyone's building legos and so on um yeah i highly encourage you to kind of think through not like a full platform but think of like something like core component that could um be useful and valuable um especially if you can unlock some economic mechanism there like that might be super interesting because economic mechanisms is you know you get access to that in web3 um and so yeah yeah that's why i want to do like a composable docker image and just like keep it simple as possible and then throw the mit license so people can like pick up and go because to like let's say read hl7 data or dicom files in the medical system it's like it's too much it easy you know more interesting idea i might just be thinking about the certifications associated with medical data and make those accessible in web3 through like nfts or other kinds of verifiable claim tools um because all that stuff is like stuck in paperwork and it'd be amazing if you made that computable and you can turn that into oracles and turn that into things that people can like work with in smart contracts i don't know any certificates so if anyone here knows what that's about talk to me i'll try to help you program it so yeah that's all i got that's medicine hey uh you on uh can i jump in yeah i am prc um i am a big fan of you so pleased to to finally talk with you uh online um it's uh i don't know if you remember i built this song a few years ago uh it was the first uh sound platform using ipfs and i am here to build the new data layer for the song i picked the a small chunk as you said and i want to build something to um to any social media so it's it's like a small protocol to enable people to just uh build social media for uh web3 i i wanted to i didn't want to to talk about my project because it's not the goal here uh um i i would like to talk about nfts for intellectual property yeah because i really think it's very important and uh it's out of the scope for the second one but if no if no one takes it uh maybe next year i will be here developing that uh i think it's really really important for uh for the market to have something that musicians can rely on and they can receive the values that they are owed by music by the music they produce and from my experience in the music industry which is uh a little bit um i really think that nfts are being used the wrong way for music and if this should not be the music uh the way the way i am planning to do that with this sound is uh music is like like a um common for everyone anyone can listen anyone can do whatever and rights to use that music in other products or publishing or synchronizing with video or uh show using that music in a bar or something like that that's the the monetizable thing uh or merchandise like a cd a cd is like a something that you collect right so that's the collectible right uh not the music itself and that's the that's something that i want to bring here because there are a lot of people creative people around this uh this this call and uh if if i can bring this idea further and someone picks it up it would be really cool and i would use it on this sound um because i really think it's very important that people stop using nfts and arts as the the integral part of the nft no nfts are collectibles and they are used to monetize fan bases not to monetize the content itself okay um i i wanted to learn about your thoughts uh around this this this topic yeah i i i um yes and i i think of the this sort of like what i was getting at with the nfts as productive assets you you need to be able to kind of pass along the right of um using that piece of work um and ideally kind of have a royalty structure where you know again like if the if the thing is used in a lot of other works than kind of like the royalties flow so here's like a few ideas right so one is um if you create like a like a tool on the web where you can kind of upload uh samples and all of these samples are are nfts like audio samples and someone kind of like remixes a sample there using those nfts mints that as an nft but you preserve the connectivity there you can start building networks of um of value flows and royalties with that artwork right so imagine kind of like making the first composable audio nfps that could be where you can remix the the audio and trace the the contributions over time and i think that's how we build you know these kind of like economic flow um flows across all of all of these uh um all these things uh i'd probably also add that uh this might be relevant also in the um visual end of these two like think of um being able to create like the thing that i was describing around you know creating like a room with art inside of it either 2d or 3d art that's kind of similar so think of like an audio track that has includes a bunch of samples similar to a room that includes a bunch of free objects um and that these kind of kind of trace the have like the nfc graphs as well um and kind of like trace the royalties and over time build like this these networks of of collaboration um and i think part of what's uh what's going to get there is kind of like establishing that you do move the the rights alongside and so doing some of the legal work of figuring out like what license should that be and you know mark some nfts as not just providing this collectible associated with the art but actually providing the rights associated with the license um and doing the work to figure out what that would look like and maybe creating a platform where like you can remix audio and fts and you know when you you imagine having like a like a playground where you have a bunch of samples and you can you can use one of the many open source tools out there for remixing audio and then you and you say publish and you publish back to the platform and that kind of like makes an ftd for you with the audio and the modified audio and then tracks the contribution graph like that i think that'll be super cool like an entire kind of authoring and publishing structure with like this all this royalty structure built in um uh could i add something really quick yeah go for it hey so uh yeah prc i actually um was uh dming you in the discord about this so i guess good to meet you but uh uh this is actually what i'm working on for this hackathon i was telling you all about it um so i mean if anyone is interested i'm still looking for people to work with um on the kind of nft ip like music ip idea so definitely reach out to me i can drop my discord in the chat um and uh yeah i would love to get like maybe any uh react developers um any designers that are still looking for a team or anything like that would be awesome yeah max and and as i told you uh if you want some some input from me just go ahead and uh ping me because uh that's that's something that really interests me and uh i am willing to help if not i'm i cannot join your team because i'm doing something else but uh of course i can get some input from my experience great yeah awesome so yeah i'll drop my discord for anyone else looking for a team still i think i see a few hands so i think uh uh i'll keep a stack so huxwell uh shannon and then jose so huh um yeah so you went a bit through our id earlier it's discovery so we had this idea where we would build a platform that answers to the answer that answers to the question you get a lot of the time that is where do i start my web free journey or as a user where do i start my crypto journey and so we thought about a platform where projects can collaborate with content creators to create courses um but as you mentioned that it would be best to have something composable and build small pieces um our first step is building this collaborative platform where the official members of our protocol can like review content from a content creator so i came up with this idea of using a git book and creating a github action that uploads all the content of the course um to file coin and also i'm generating um an nft uh based on those files plus the the commit and then the plan is to reward the the contributors of a pull request and also the reviewer let's say um so i'd like to have a bit of feedback regarding that if we should more focus on this specific part for the hackathon as i see that like collaborative uh tools are are having a lot of interest or rather focusing on the an end user uh app i think um these kinds of tools are super um super useful i think there's a lot of i think you'll probably find users on both both sides um i would maybe prioritize getting to like a core simple product that you think people can like use end to end and kind of ship that and whether that's kind of like more on the collaboration side or um or not it's kind of like up to you to sort of figure out um and i think the the uh yeah i think the idea of kind of rewarding writing uh running contributions i think could be could be super useful um also think of like you know the idea of hypertext for the web uh you know came even long before the web many decades before the web through um nelson santa do and even before that like the mimics all of that was about text and uh tracing the relationships between citations and text so it came from like weaving somebody's writing referencing somebody else's writing and kind of figuring out the graph of attribution um and being able to kind of jump from one document to another kind of through some computational medium and like that's what gave us hypertext and then web and so on so think of like yeah that kind of stuff is still uh there's still a lot of ideas there that i think could be could be super interesting and valuable um yeah i think uh especially if you have find really good ways of rewarding um contributions to uh to creative works i think uh that kind of stuff is like um there's a lot there yeah and not only it could work for uh like a git book repo but any any code repo basically because we're just uh grabbing the files and generating an nft based on on the file so it could uh reward any open source open source uh project yep sounds good so uh thanks a lot gonna go for the next person i think shannon shannon was asking about is anyone working on contribution graphs uh do you wanna see more hey sorry um i mean not too much more context than that i was just curious i came in late to the call and heard that being referenced um my team's working on a dow discord bot um that's trying to help communities identify and manage information that's relevant to good governance and obviously reputation lies behind that so i was just curious yeah if other people are thinking about that yeah that's awesome um i think i think this is super timely i think uh there's a lot of uh projects or there's a lot of ideas a few projects on in this kind of area but i think a lot of it is still kind of tinkering around nothing has become super widely used yet um i think i don't know how many other folks in hackafast are working on this stuff but i'll mention a few um projects uh around solution graphs uh one of them is source cred which is a project to for helping communities measure and work value so think of being able to track a lot of contributions through a bunch of different kinds of things so think think like uh github and discord and so on um and there's a lot of tools that the social community has built over time to kind of ingest the contributions from all these different sources and then kind of come up with like some scoring um and then they also have kind of ideas around uh being able to kind of construct uh value flows over those contribution graphs and measuring them over time and so on as a super rich community with a lot of um a lot of ideas that you can you can kind of look at and another group i think like the mirror community is doing a lot of really cool experimentation on this um you can go to like dev.mirror.xyz i think it's the uh the website um and you can see a lot of the stuff that they're doing um with the public and it's kind of like a publishing platform plus nfd auctions plus writing it's sort of integrated to help make it easy to use um a lot of like really interesting components and so on are coming out those should all be kind of usable more broadly than mirror i hope but you know things like splits are just a simple structure that like allows that kind of contribution graph split stream is is you know cascading splits through um kind of the scientific publication graphs and and so on um and what i really sort of want to get to is like whenever you know people are minting nfcs with creator addresses and so on that should really be pointing to like some large distribution of of work um so that large distribution of like all of the groups that have been kind of involved with creating that thing um yeah super so i think with a lot of this would recommend um again building kind of composable primitives that you know maybe like just a simple tool where you can describe a um kind of like a like a group of people a collaboration and kind of like who all the collaborators and make that a composable thing that people can weave into other contracts that's super cool yeah awesome i think the next one was jose one second i i i need to can the next one can go because i got a little museum hi hi everyone uh so with respect to ipfs file coin accessing directly is there any way uh some extension or anybody working on it uh from the browser i know that we can access through flick or you know the textile or other bridges that they have but in terms of onboarding and making that dumping that content in the ipf this file can be smooth is there some extension from the browser side or we need to build a proxy server and do some kind of authentication there yeah so so um you can uh look at so ipfs was designed to be able to be run within browsers so if you go to js browsers so first of all i'm running brave which ships with uh go ipfs node in it so if you're running brave you can look at content um so i can do like i can go to like um io i think this should work let's test it yeah do you see the address here the address is like did you oh did you put it in the chat oh all right go gotcha yeah ipn yeah and so like that's working so this is pulling from from an ipfs um address uh let's see so it says use local node or use mobile gateway so let's use the local node it's installing let's see how it goes we're doing it live um i have a yeah this is a different oh no bug okay let's try using a public gateway i'm running like a different different profile so maybe um maybe it's a profile issue and so yeah so i think this is using a public web uh web gateway but it's kind of like um so like resolve the link um let's see if i can open a different window and try one more time but once i post it i can view it but i'm saying to be able to post first right and this is to be able to view content which is already there but i i want to talk about i'm talking about just being able to post it into the ipf ipfs yeah so i think you can you get to use an api uh so and and by the way you can go to json they worked the second time so it's great um if you go to this this website this is like the full implementation of ipfs in javascript okay um and so this works within the browser and so like here this is like using javascript to you know kind of like run some of this content and so you know i can say like hello hello hockey pass um i run that and that gives me a different hash and then i should be able to like look at it on the web let's see will it and this is supposed to connect to my browser sometimes like that if i'm behind in that it like won't work that well yeah i think it's like not connecting but um the yeah this is the content discovery it's like a super annoying problem and that's plaguing a lot of the applications that's getting better over time but um this this is using ipfs within within the browser tab and uh you get to kind of construct all the objects here and then kind of push into the world i recommend taking a look at proto school which kind of goes into any sort of yeah let's see oh pro that's cool cool and you can look at this you can look at the tutorials that have to do with ipld and ipfs and these will tell you these are all built with ipfs directly on javascript and so you can like um change stuff directly directly on the web yeah i think that somebody also commented slit also enables uploading from browser yeah that's true okay thank you cool awesome all right jose uh are you are you ready now sure yeah it's just a perfect thing yeah thank you juan um yeah sure so i'm currently working on trying to tackle the angle of social media and right now the challenge that i'm currently having is whether i should be just using something like smart contract to index the contact directly um or whether it might make sense to use something like ipfs and the challenging users of doing ipfs for particular content comes on on you know what layers should should i interact with right so should i do something directly like an ips public gateway or maybe leveraging some of the existing projects that are just doing something with ceramic um there's textile there's web storage right so it's it's hard to identify what is the the best base layer on interacting with an ipfs so any any particular recommendations based on your experience of what you have seen in previous hackathons i would say that a lot of these tools are um so a lot of these tools are have active developer teams and so they're building them now and improving them and so i would say if i was familiar with any of quite a bit right now and and improved so i i guess you can kind of like try them look at the demos that people are showing and then try using them and then see how they go um and it maybe depends on what you're trying to do right so uh for example uh anato storage is kind of tuned for helping you store entities and so if you're if you're going to like store a bunch of nfts mgos might be like the easiest way for you to do it um and kind of like that's kind of tuned for nfp app apps and platforms and so on um if you uh are gonna store kind of like simple uh kind of like files and application data and you want like the simplest possible api to to you to use it um you know through the storage movie might be a good fit um if you uh i like that launched now like launched like this week for for hunter fest um and then i think you know things like ceramic can be really useful when you also start wanting to create documents that will be kind of like shared with other folks and you want to carry identity and be able to kind of reason about the who's editing what um also want to plug textile threads for this kind of use case as well textile has a ton of like really awesome tooling for uh for doing this as well um and there's kind of like some amount of integration between between these um like in the in the lower level data structures uh so i would just encourage you to kind of experiment with a few try them out um and then kind of like see what's like easiest for your for your service and for your application and then um kind of like use that and stay nimble and like you know this can the space will evolve over time and um you know you can kind of repack your things over time and there's why you have a whole bunch of others that i'm mentioning like there's you know i think fission and um fleek and many others uh right awesome perfect thank you everyone okay can i uh bounce on that yeah uh so like for in our example uh what we are planning to do is for the files of the courses let's say the videos that last more than one hour or something we are planning to upload them through web3.storage but then we are going to compose an object that contains just the urls for door files and we are going to store that object on nft.storage and then we have kind of our main data storage layer where we structure things and we use ceramic for that at least that's what we're planning to do now but i feel like there's still um kind of a layer missing that that would make the link between some entities like uh having some relationship or something like that but i guess that's something we need to figure out uh along uh while we're building those tools yeah that sounds sounds good to me all right i have if you can so uh let's see uh can you hear me hello yeah yeah okay so i just just coming back on the original rule that you said about and yes and i just want to get your opinion on on the usage of nfts i mean there have been people talking about uh the right way of using nfps and there are like certain ways where you have to have build metal verses and asset to a particular song or something so the inherent idea of energy being that this could be sold or this could be monetized in some way or when we are done but um and and just my idea is something on creating some kind of a review so that you could like give a review about a website the kind of content it has or any kind of like a software um something something like on that on a decentralized network um posting that as an nft so do you really feel that this uh publishing anything as an nft is like uh is a good way to proceed with things and then tinker out how this pans out and then or or do you feel like it's an overcomplicated way to record some valuable data just because you can create an empty should you really do it in that way but there are multiple ways to kind of approach this um i mean i think uh i think a lot of it sort of i think it probably depends on the approach uh and that you want to take i don't know it's a little kind of like product specific um so um if somebody else kind of like jumps has like a like a good idea and like a good response like happy to take it i would um think of approaching it in a few different directions sorry i'm like my my brain is not super useful for you right now um right i mean i mean just uh trying to get a hold of like there are certain ways uh there are certain uh use cases where nfps are the best use case but are there certain use cases that you've come across which don't um seem like a best way of usage of nfts are there any that you've come up with come across that we should like avoid while we are designing our solutions no i mean i think look i think at the end of the day all this an nft is is a an unchained record of or like a certificate of something on the chain right like that's think of it as like um internet native property right it's like it's a way of defining some piece of property on the web and there's a little bit of information that describes the property and that's it and nfts only have value as long as people agree that they have value similar to kind of property in the physical world right like the idea that somebody owns land is really just kind of like a convention that people have come up with and agreed upon and written down into legal agreements and you know they're it's enforced by laws but you know like that's you know physics has nothing to do with that and so with similar with nfts it's just a record and a certificate on chain that represents something so they're super flexible and they're super usable for all kinds of things i think the thing you want to be wary of is right now chain scalability isn't amazing yet um people are working on this i believe there's a lot of groups working on helping the chain scale and be a lot cheaper to to deploy content to so i think a lot of the really exciting nft use cases will appear once chains scale much better when you can like just publish you know trillions of nfts and kind of like record assets for all kinds of things um and you can weave them into all kinds of components but i would kind of like not yeah i don't think there's any kind of like necessarily like wrong way of using them i would just say it's a certificate like any other and it kind of like matters what you put into the certificate like what are you kind of really certifying um so for most nfts right now it's just it's a collectible that you you get to kind of have but it doesn't confer any rights um i think these will this will change over time similar to how when you buy a painting uh you don't buy like an image of the painting you buy the actual physical object and by buying a physical object that means that you get you get to like display it in a gallery or give it to a museum or like move it around or something like that and i think that'll that'll happen with it with uh with digital entities as well um it'll just take some time awesome um just uh a really quick um or just a really quick answer i would like to have one there i think there's one more use case where they're talking about archiving content the web to content uh just like websites or uh any um uh asset which is on the web to web3 like they could have like archive.org or something like that um so i just wanted to know like when you are archiving this in an automatic fashion um also uh using a browser extension of some source like we are also trying to do the same thing um other like certain ways uh or certain certain checklists that we should be careful of like uploading or archiving something which is like authenticated or maybe something which is owned by a particular user and then now it's been published or you you have something archived something which was behind a paywall and now it's open to everyone so yeah we should so you should be careful with with content licensing so yeah great that you bring that up so um a lot of content on the web is open access and you can move it around as you want some content on the web has specific licenses that regulate how you're able to make copies and so on um and so i would just be careful around content like that and so check check the licenses associated with the content that you're looking at um not all content is clear and obvious um a lot of it sort of depends on the platform um but there's a lot a ton of content out there that is totally open access so we just kind of recommend so first of all reward openness by building your apps over open content and like encourage a lot of kind of that that distribution of content um but also um you can you can use non-open content or like content with different licenses and you may may want to think about representing data entities and so you know you can think of like creating nft templates for like the different kind of um licenses associated with this or creating platforms that respect those or something like that and i would say like be careful with anything that is super sensitive private information so a lot of the web3 content um because the net the chains are so public and uh and it's such an open environment um a lot of libraries and so on are not tuned for super private content so if you're going to handle super sensitive private data just make sure you get the encryption of that right or like do your demo without kind of like anyone with synthetic data not with like any anybody with actual data until you get that audited super carefully because you don't want to accidentally publish somebody's private super private information and make it like really difficult to take down make sense thanks cool now uh morgan hey how's it going just want to say uh really really really big fan of what you're doing ron uh code magician over there and uh running these sessions i i align a lot with the values that you exposed the rest and uh just want to say really happy to be here um thanks a lot and thank you for being here i think like all of us are our good magicians so yeah yeah building the future all together um yeah i posted an idea concept that i was exploring in the uh in the page there underneath um i guess for the starting starting point what you were mentioning related to the welcome uh yeah i put it under uh daps and then dabs for legal jurisdiction or ritual for paper jurisdiction i don't know if it's the right place to put it but um i just i guess at the start just wanted to say the concept of these auction houses providing negative payments to people is like a really really cool concept up to a certain point just curious uh if you had any examples or like an easy way for that to occur whether it's just like a straight nft transfer and then like all those that own it as partial owners and then sort of start with assets or like funds being flowed to them i guess that's just like the sort of the space yeah i mean i think look i think um at the moment i'm very sorry because i think i'm getting some background noise from um so the the idea here is like because right now the file coin network's capacity um and the sort of verifiable storage that's in it um have a large gap between them it means that you can kind of flow um negative pricing and so i think that this could be used to fund all kinds of organizations that do really valuable work protecting safeguarding data so i would almost like the fact like we know that this is possible means that we can go and create a product and maybe tunes for um giving this like super valuable resource to groups that really need it so think of like creating some platform for helping fund um groups that collect and safeguard data uh that is really has important value to communities um and think of like that negative pricing as a way to fund the the active maintenance of that data and follow the people that usually do a lot of this work um and you know tragically underpaid right so tons of like important valuable data commons work just goes unrewarded and so think of like this negative pricing as a way of like at least for now while this this structure exists uh be able to flow some of the some of the platform dashboard over to to um to those users yeah that's really cool the uh the concept of exploring is a little bit of an experiment not so much feel but from personal experiences i've found that uh doing types of meditative or ritual experiences as it relates to using frequencies as a sort of sound path or a way to let's say align a person's mental well-being it's something that i'm looking to explore and the concept is trying to i guess build like a really small use case almost like you think of it like flash cards for like gestures that people can contribute to and all kind of start to align around um i guess the same type of rhythms and um sort of techno spiritual uh representations all aligning together um possibly all connected using brain machine interfaces and i'm wondering if um using this would be like a good use case for the auction house example where let's say like you have a starting point of like people begin as a sort of starting ground and then as they start to invite other people you can then start you know aggregating people together in a way that then can sort of facilitate free storage of whether it's just like brain computer interface data flows or um i guess just like snapshots of people you know all together like for example all of us together on this on this call it's like taking a snapshot at certain points and then selling that as like proof of participation on like the polygon network or something like that yeah i mean um i don't i would i think there's a lot in what you described i would encourage you to either create some kind of prototype that makes it i don't fully kind of um struck what you're describing um i would encourage you to make a prototype or something like that through the hack or or think of like some components like it could be that some of the components could be done so for example you could think of creating a 3d environment where you place a set of people together and you're able to kind of have some shared experiences over over the network so right now i think um most uh experiences on the web are split between kind of like 2d interaction mostly through text and a little bit of video or fully immersive games and there's kind of like no in between and like there's no good way of like hanging out with people online in kind of like a 3d environment and it could be that like nfts plus a 3d environment that you can decorate plus really high quality multiplayer audio streams is all you need and once you kind of like allow people to create a for example here's another idea like it'd be really cool to be able to kind of design a 3d room and get some nfts and decorate my space with like those digital artifacts um and then be able to kind of invite people to hang out in that physical space so think of kind of like spatial plus like highly uh decorative environments i think a lot of the platforms out there that have done a lot of this ar vr kind of work have struggled to make really high quality environments because they just don't have the approach that game studios have of crafting super high quality experiences and yet uh the nft world has managed to produce some extremely high quality art because it kind of like rewards art better um and so maybe these things can be coupled where like imagine having like a like a an environment i think spatials are probably already doing this with um letting you decorate the spaces with nfps or if they're not like they should totally be doing it um and but but i think like still spatial is kind of like a full platform it's kind of difficult to get into and whatnot i would love to be able to kind of create a link create you know mess around with kind of some voxels and construct a room and then add some objects into it make that as an mft and then be able to invite people to go hang out and experience that environment together like i think that would be super super cool and once you have that as a composable primitive you can then start coupling rooms together with like portals and doorways and whatnot i'm gonna build the building metaverse that way i think that's really cool i actually wanted to use the connect xbox one uh vigil camera as like a starting point as like a proof of concept for just like an actual virtual or physical space and go that route as opposed to going from the metaverse like sort of like starting physical then going to the metaverse as opposed to going from metaverse to physical so um yeah that was a thought super cool yeah good good luck with the hack cool thank you very much yeah thank you yeah thank you so john from my side and you got pretty accurate on the description of what we are planning to do for this hackathon personally so we are exactly trying to bridge this gap of the art galleries of the physical world and artists of enfts and what we see as a potential opportunity is that there are a lot of art places physically in the world which would love to extend their galleries to their vr exhibition for example but they have the lack of know-how or the lack of technology or both sometimes so that this is we already developing quite a huge push within the uh nft art itself but it's not exposed to the majority of people and we want to enable the art galleries to create something on their own through the through our platform either creating as a vr space or even as you had a great idea of providing also the vr space as a minted 3d object which is sounds super great and we'll explore explore it on that topic but what i wanted to ask is is there anything else that comes to your mind when we are speaking about vr and web3 distributed networks is there something missing because i see there might be a lot of potential on also distributed storage as 3d spaces might wait a lot or is there something else as an as a topic that we can look at yeah i mean so the 3d so so think of like um this is kind of why we built nft storage and and went through the storage because um it's kind of like a sim like a useful aggregator service that's tuned for nfts um and can do all the heavy lifting of backing all of it up and kind of storing in background and whatnot um and that gives you i think it's right now it's 32 gigabytes per nft and if you run into like problems with that size i think they've talked to the team i think that they um you know like 30 gigabytes says a lot right like i don't think um that's kind of like enough for like full length movies and high resolution and so on so um that should be more than than you need for 3d spaces unless you're like minding a massive world um so like you can probably do like whole like minecraft levels in that size um so by the way minecraft in like uh so i think cryptobox is a really cool cool idea i would love to see kind of even more composable versions of that like start constructing like make it super easy like construct objects with mock cells min patterson ft and then pieces together into larger and larger and larger environments yeah thank you for the take on uh just one more question do you think uh we are on the stage where uh we are on the level of development where we should enable everyone to create their own like visual spaces for the galleries or it should be more of like an art direction where someone takes it as a leading role for the designer and then we give it as a full solution to the customer of a gallery for example i think right now um the space is evolving so quickly and a lot of things are being tried i would encourage you to kind of have a good end-to-end solution quickly and put it out there to see what people make out of it and make it composable so whatever you do make it something that like it's not like necessarily a full platform but it's something that other people can use to build on and i think that's going to make it more more likely to be be part of something larger um so for example if you can like construct a gallery um you can you can separate the components of designing the physical space and creating the kind of like 3d environment and make that like a tool or a product and then a different tool and product uses a 3d space and allows people to show up into that 3d space together and have like a shared experience because you know art is a lot about experience and and experiencing that art together with other and so creating that in the web like doesn't quite work yet and i think it'd be super cool to do it you know the art pointed away or something like that um and you can think of that like it's a separate application or product that kind of like you compose the you can like plug in like the specific rooms and whatnot um and then you can think of like the you can think of like being able to hold a public event at this gallery that has been composed and being able to charge admission for that public event and use that admission price to reward all of the parties that have provided that put art in that gallery so imagine like you have um a bunch of nfts being displayed in like a 2d gallery space like you know 2d art or 3d art in like a 3d gallery space that you can view together you create like an event and you can charge the mission and you can then have move the economic flow of all of that to reward the creator of the space the creator of all the art and and then you know kind of like and all the holders of those those nfts and so like you can create those kind of flows and i think you can go from those galleries into full-scale museums and then you can have like like a full experience of kind of gathering and experiencing art together online and rewarding that creation of your heart over time and and also the curators are gonna select which art piece is going to what what pieces and by the way like one big part of art is installations so it's not just about the 2d piece or the 3d piece but it's how that's composed with other pieces of art and how that room plays into it so imagine rewarding that part of the art process as well so like all of those components i think are but again i would encourage you to like think of pieces and make all of these composable things that you can do separately and like that because you don't know what's gonna really take off and what's gonna be composed with something else and the space is just moving so so so fast that i encourage you to like do something smaller and simpler put it out there make it usable and then build the next one perfect thank you a lot for that just a small advice request for advice if we already see that there are solutions that create this visual gallery should we go with them for the first time or we should we also try to replicate it as the solution is not open source or i cannot use it as a yeah it's a good question um i mean it really depends on the specific group like if it's not open source that's kind of frustrating it depends on like how much work it is to replicate um i tend to be very strongly or using kind of open source software and and so on uh because that makes it much more composable with other things um software that's kind of licensed in a way that where you can't when the thing you make can't quite be used with other things like that's that kind of harms your software so i would just be careful about that um it really is a trade-off it depends on how much time you have maybe start with start using it if that's easier for you and then later on think about replacing it perfect thank you a lot for the insights thank you and don't forget about the music as a dj is a very important part of an art gallery absolutely absolutely well thank you to juan and i want to thank everyone else for joining us today it's been an excellent session i want to encourage everyone to continue the conversation in the discord but we're running up on time right now be respectful of everyone's time and uh you know good luck taking these ideas and putting them into practice i i know i can speak for all of us and that we're really excited to see how things are going to be built this this time around so thank you again to everyone we're going to be closing the stream here um again thank you thank you juan thank you everyone thanks for sharing your ideas and thoughts plus with me
