okay and we'll get kicked off there we go all the attendees are just coming rushing in welcome everybody feel free to drop your your local time your local place in uh in chat as usual there will be a tweet with you tagged alexis if you want to you could just use global one yeah no i just boom there it is there it is and i'm watching myself on delay now writing this tweet beautiful all right so it sounds like everything's good and up um so yeah let's maybe just get this thing started um cool well uh thanks so much alexis for being part of this um you know for everybody else who's just joined um alexis uh you may know him co-founder of reddit co-founder of initialized capital he's the host of business dad podcast um and of course that's right most importantly an armenian brandy aficionado there we go we all we all have our accolades i was i thought you were going to say most importantly father of alexis olympia ohanian junior well of course this too she and my armenian brand are basically neck and neck in terms of you know things i love the most there you go no love she's she edges out the brandy for sure but yeah and i'm so happy to be reunited with a bunch of y'all who apparently are ogs from the hack the north days i've got a lot of fond fond memories from waterloo uh i mean it was i mean back to back to back i don't know if i went three maybe four years to various events every year usually is around tektoberfest which you know is a pretty special time of special place but the the hack the north event is uh just just legendary uh so it makes sense that you've got this community of builders and makers and doers now um you know all participating in real time across the world building just awesome stuff so kudos appreciate just getting started super fun journey so uh yeah awesome it's been great to have you kind of as part of all this so far so um yeah maybe we would dive into some kind of questions around crypto product that sort of thing sure we'd love to kind of get your your id on this so i know you've been in in the space as an investor for for quite a while now uh maybe i'll let you name job some companies if you see fit um but uh what what excites you the most about crypto like what like what have you been thinking about and um why do you think this is a big opportunity well so only because you asked me we were early investors in coinbase a long time ago um and and continue to watch in awe as they've really brought so much of this to the mainstream um and that's been exciting you know brian and and fred were there so early and with such high conviction that it was it was kind of easy for gary and i to get excited and want to invest and gary uh my co-founder initialized gary tanda his credit has been really obsessed with the space ever since he started seeing the the first maybe was well i don't have to ask him when his first but it was definitely a top post on hacker news that turned him on to all this and um you know i want to believe that maybe it was satoshi's white paper but regardless i i i want to believe that this is something that that he really saw early and and i i mean frankly i just know when when brilliant people that i know uh brilliant technologists that i know get really excited about a new technology i i want to pay closer attention and and over the last few years in particular you know we've we've caught very deliberately avoided um a lot of the unfortunately just scam your icos that were happening and all that garbage and really tried to optimize for backing teams that have the exact same things we look for in any software startup um like product discipline engineering discipline um and and really evaluating them as if they didn't even they weren't building anything on a blockchain uh really trying to think about just like a boring software company that yeah if it works has massive massive massive massive potential and um i'm trying to think i mean uh actually horizon uh uh rock and ethereum um is bringing to life a magic the gathering where you actually own the cards digitally of course but we're seeing different applications that actually make sense for the specific technology so not just doing it for the sake of technology but doing it because creating that kind of scarcity with a digital good is really interesting because it allows for uh it allows for increased value and then allowing free and open trade now brings to life the things that a lot of us grew up with you know trading uh game cards for instance or playing cards or any of those and uh and and collecting and saving and having real value attached that you actually own right you're spending real money on that fortnight skin uh you're basically burning it um which i've done which i do i will continue to do um until the better system takes over and uh and that that resonates with us coming like bison trails providing the kind of infrastructure that folks actually need to get started a lot of picks and shovels type businesses those are the things that get us excited but like first and foremost it's it's founders who are solving a real problem uh and not just trying to run around with some cool technology looking for a problem to solve and uh and that's that's where and i think anyone involved in this too needs to realize and at this point this is what i like about this time because we're out of the the crazy boom period um people who are still building today are genuinely interested in building real things and so i think the the future for crypto has never been brighter because we just continue to see amazing technologists amazing product people willing to devote their life or at least the next decade to solving some really hard problems and building really great technology um and that's that's what's going to make all the difference um but frankly it comes down to it comes down to user experience it comes down to user interface it comes down to the basic like product things that don't uh they don't require world-changing white paper they just require you to follow sort of best principles um for for modern software design uh and and creation and really just solving a real problem for people yeah and i think like specifically for sky weaver like i cling to my cards so much uh just because like you know some day those could actually be where something they're resellable it's just a straight up you know step function improvement over uh other kind of collecting card games right so much and and a genuinely fun game too yeah i mean they architected it the original pitch was like this is a proof of concept but the more time i spent playing it i'm my username is just alexis ohanian i'm very creative in case you ever want to challenge me in sky weaver um increasingly it was clear that the proof of concept is actually just a really good game uh that is also you know does a really good job flexing their underlying tech but it's actually just a super fun game exactly um what is it what is it with the canadian uh energy around uh crypto i like it i mean i'm in toronto we actually share an office with the sky weaver guys so yeah um yeah loved it but but what i i'm genuinely curious about this is there something going on is this all just the waterloo grads because obviously i mean you all have a strong connection to ethereum but like what what is it yeah i don't want to share my bias too strongly there on the waterloo side but yeah i mean i think it's just you know we've got a you know the early community a lot of it was here just because it's where a lot of it got started i think yeah and yeah i think it's just that community stayed really strong you know like the toronto medal group is still one of the biggest ones uh lots of really smart people take part there obviously you've got a lot of you know good schools feeding that talent pool um and yeah every time we go back to waterloo and run on east waterloo uh it's it's been huge so uh yeah special place in our heart too um awesome yeah so i i want to highlight uh you know everybody's here um most of the people in in the chat but maybe not watching no that's for hack fs which it's a hackathon where we're kind of uh helping build the foundation for the decentralized web um you know a couple cool things that we've seen so far is you know fully decentralized unstoppable blogging platforms i think gary would probably like that um you know uh an app to like have exactly um you know verifiable climate change data uh for the for the paris accord that would be really cool um archiving original videos so that they can combat against deep fix uh also a pretty cool problem so lots of really cool kind of fully decentralized apps coming out of this um i guess like what are your thoughts on kind of the kind of larger value of the decentralized web and decentralized internet and that kind of movement away from centralization why could what people would be building here be important towards the future well um we're looking at a world that is increasingly more balkanized this is very different from what i would have expected 10 certainly 15 years ago but maybe even 10 years ago i and i look at heart i've spent all of my adult years traveling like i have i've been effectively a remote worker for my entire professional life like i've i i've both you know thanks the fact that i've just started companies on the internet and that i've just always loved to travel and then you know i made i made some money when i sold reddit the first time and so i could do it a lot more comfortably than i did when i was in college and you know traveling and backpacking through youth hostels and stuff so i was like oh this is travel was great before it's even better now that i don't have to share a room with six people um so anyway at my heart i really love all of the just i i i've been an i i was an addict to all of the creativity the discovery all the best parts of so many different parts of the world and i feel like i binged on it and loved it and drank it up and so i find it especially heartbreaking that i think the next 10 years at least are going to be one of much more isolationism of much more balkanization we're seeing you're seeing it between china and india right now with the banning of dozens of chinese apps um i think i think europe is going to carve out its own uh and it probably builds primarily around privacy expectations its own sort of form of internet i think canada is going to benefit tremendously from america's xenophobia and anti-immigration policies so you'll see a ton of innovation and value creation and job creation so god bless i wish we were getting it um and and i think even within the united states there's increasing tribalism uh that's not gonna stop so okay so if i see the trend for the next 10 years much more about isolationism much more about sort of looking inward focusing word finding one's tribes um then ironically at a time when the internet connects us more than ever we will actually have more and more either government regulations or just sort of personal motivation to be looking more inward and there are some benefits to this i think because it does allow for specialization like i could see a universe where i mean even already so like germans uh sort of um both cultural and political focus on privacy and obviously there's a very good historical reason for that um i i could see becoming a kind of competitive advantage almost from a brand standpoint like i mean in the same way the the germany released the covet app a contact tracing app that like a material percentage of the population downloaded i think germany's like 80 million people i think was like 15 million how many people downloaded german kovid we're doing it live app uh okay first link i'm not substantiating this well at all but here we go what do we got what's the percentage uh i was going to make a point with this but i still want to make sure the number was good uh find the virus thank you hans okay blah blah blah okay let's say i don't want to make this up someone in the chat is going to find this better uh okay 42 at least said that they would use it um i got six point five million downloads on great shoes you're better at this than me all right so that's ten percent uh let's say it's ten percent of the population now um the i mean we can't even conceive of that happening in the united states right now because there's just such distrust of i mean there was distrust when people were talking about google facebook doing it there was distrust if the government were to do it like basically nations are going to start to i think be able to specialize in a way that will actually be good because it will assuming that we can still have access to those technologies um i think that sort of renewed focus will create more innovation because it gives sort of tribes their reasons to sort of focus and specialize which has not been the nature of the internet thus far um but the very obvious downside is is you have you're going to have multiple internets over time and the beauty of the web was and i i still believe is that that notion of all bits being created equal and and this idea that it was a level playing field for um for ideas the technology was and uh so what does that mean i think i think the value of decentralization in a world that looks like that the next 10 15 20 years goes up massively because as humans we still want we want this really this keeps coming back to like a user experience question we want the best user experience possible it's not even about politics or culture it's about user experience it's about making things that people love and users at the end of the day individuals people on a decentralized internet will have a much better opportunity to sort of be in control of their own destiny and the things that they want and the things that they expect and if the user experience is as good as it can possibly be then in in a lot of cases not all cases but in a lot of cases the decentralized version should be materially better than the centralized one all other things being equal from user experience standpoint and um so yeah so i think actually the the macro trends towards balkanization and and sort of isolationism actually play in favor of the decentralized internet um because if anything it almost creates it creates more demand for alternative it creates more demand for more choice and uh and so i think that it's it's pretty uh the future is pretty bright there oh and hate colombia maryland see someone in the comments it's where i grew up oh awesome gotta make sure to ask the quake quake question after two yeah i'll say that one okay um cool and and i guess maybe on that note you know uh a lot of people actually are building you know some sort of decentralized social networks of some kind uh or communities spaces for communities um you know having run one yourself obviously uh a fairly prominent one um you know like what do you think kind of changes running from like a centralized to a decentralized aspect you know what are some of the gotchas to look out for um just sort of like uh kind of what do you think kind of the differences are uh between running a centralized versus decentralized big community small community well so when it comes to the community platforms and this comes back again i look at all through the lens of like if this were any startup like let's get rid of the crypto hype and all that other let's just say like okay well what is the user experience like that's materially better i for me if it's a community platform or a social network there is this there's portability which feels like a 10x better feature potentially where if you can if one platform can really get to the critical mass and provide enough value for people that they want to switch and it needs to be the last time they create another account [Laughter] um i think portability becomes an interesting feature now it's a it's an extra challenge for you as the creator because you're basically from day one saying i know this is going to be so good that i can make it trivial for you to be able to to leave and that won't affect us and so be it um or of course you could try to build the layer that sort of connects all the future things and that sense of um quote-unquote identity um i i think the biggest gotcha or the biggest opportunity would be and we've seen right steemit was a version i think it's still around uh i've read it um i i so i deeply actually wrote this in our year-end i wrote the year-end letter um for initialized last year talking about the value of attention in a world where there is infinitely i mean there there's in there are infinite alternatives that will continue to get better and better and so being able to capture and hold attention because we all just have 24 hours in a day and that's that's never changing i i don't expect it to change um at least not materially [Music] that means you have a tremendous responsibility to to make something worth capturing someone's attention and us holding it and so the the value of attention is one that has not really been properly quantified before but i could imagine could be and so the way that i would think about that is like you have all these platforms and i think steam was an interesting approach i i would argue that and there's a good book on this um drive i would argue that getting people paying people to do work they normally were volunteering for devalues it it'd be like someone volunteering in a boy scout troop and one day being like here's your 20 every month or whatever and they'd be like this is weird like i don't do this for money i do this for the community and i do this because i love it and it gives me it gives me joy and like there's no amount of money you could really pay me because either you pay me a stupid big amount and i'd wonder like what's happening here this feels disingenuous i don't deserve a million dollars a month for like is this a drug front what um and then if it's any other amount of money it just doesn't feel like enough and so it's like well why did you even do that and and it can really mess with the decisions that one makes because they're no longer doing work for a greater good or for a community they're doing it for pay so i think you have to think about it especially when you're talking about posting content um because there's already so much i mean there's already so much happening behind the scenes with third parties trying to pay for promotion and whatnot that i i think the the better way to look at it the better way to go after it is capturing the value in that attention that time spent and where it's being spent is really really valuable and finding a way like historically content sites would do this through advertising we know that model is screwed the new wave that i like better that's not just like click bait you know cpms is how do you build something where you get someone paying a recurring subscription sub stacks a great example this patreon which is a portfolio company's another one um and i think that's really good i think that's a huge leap beyond click bait ads for revenue i do think it still sort of misses the mark because what we're really talking about is like attention right i could you and i could both pay 10 a month to an amazing artist on patreon or an amazing newsletter but i might read for three hours every week and devour it and you you know for 30 seconds and and and we're not properly being valued in the same way right and and there's different ways to spin that there's different ways to think about that but i i'm waiting for something that has an amazing user experience that can re-imagine the model of attention and content um and this is again this is like a big idea and if i heard this pitch for me i'd be like come up with a wedge like come up with something that actually is working small scale and and go so uh oh interesting steam is not around anymore awkward okay anyway um okay awesome well uh yeah maybe i think this question maybe prompts coming up with that wedge a little bit but you know i'd be curious like you know we have um you know i mentioned this before the call started you know i think a lot of the technologies are starting to align um we're starting to get to a really good point where uh you can really build anything in a fully decentralized way and uh you should be able to take that product to the world and have it run with it um like from what you've seen like what do you think is kind of missing from the kind of web 3 crypto space right now that's kind of preventing it from achieving that sort of mainstream escape velocity um or maybe put another way like what would you love to fund in the space or what would you like to see come across the email pitch or or whatever right it keeps coming back to user experience and um no disrespect metamask but like a pivotal moment for uh sky weaver was when like we didn't have to use metamask to log in when you could just create an account and go and the average user the average gamer like doesn't even need to think about oh is this like a crypto thingy like there's it it is it's about creating a user experience that feels truly seamless as as as almost as mindless as creating an instagram account like that is the bar and and that it comes back to user experience where we now i think it's important we now have a critical mass of folks who are excited who are early adopters who want to be a part of this and are willing to install a chrome extension or do this or do that but to really break through it has to be something and this is well look this is what coinbase saw during the that insane run uh over thanksgiving i don't know how many years ago that was now everything's a blur two years ago um wow was that three years ago this is this is quarantine life okay so right 2017 a bunch of people went home for thanksgiving saw a bunch of older people they never see and everyone had heard about crypto and they were like tell me about crypto sonny and and you know chunk of america were like yeah here grandpa just open a coinbase account here you go click click click okay okay this looks kind of like my wells fargo and uh and and that's like that's literally what happened i mean not literally but like that that is when a product crosses over and that that cannot happen if it's all right grandpa now first we're gonna go to installing a chrome extension called metamask download it here yeah i know i know you never installed extension before hit accept yeah hit okay okay great wait for it to download right like it that's friction and that's just this is just user experience 101 now when you're dealing with something as super ambitious as the decentralized web it is going to feel kind of crazy when you're talking to a regular person and so like i'll give you an example of a very successful chrome extension mainstream wise um oh goodness honey right grandpa coupons you like coupons these are coupons on the internet okay right like don't need that that's an easy that is an easy story no one's getting scared about like the fed printing press goes burr like there's no it's it is from a user experience standpoint really straightforward and so that is what it is going to take for the like real real adoption of of so much of what we're talking about um but the good news is we're still in early enough days that you can be building the picks and the shovels for developers for the the sort of the builders who are or the miners or the the people who are doing the work to bring this to the mainstream you're still not you're not too late for that but you really need to know what you're building and you can't do something in the middle you can't fool yourself into thinking that it's it's going to live somewhere in the middle there it either either has to be squarely aimed at the mainstream uh or or not um and so like i'm not trying to tell my grandpa about bison trails because i don't need to that's not who bison trails doesn't want to talk to my grandpa but like yeah i'm gonna tell my grandpa about coinbase because like that's that's i mean grandpa's a a very late adopter uh but uh but you catch my drift awesome yeah so i guess for everybody who's gonna be starting their companies out of out of hack fs think of grandpa think of do you really want to deal with grampa i mean grandpa's too extreme but like my dad my dad sounds just like my grandfather so that's the same simple there you go awesome well uh you know i think that's what's saying you know thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us alexis of course you know i think a lot of really interesting influence here um and and and yeah like really appreciate you uh coming and sharing your your advice on that product and ux and just your thoughts on crypto in general my pleasure and folks i i re i retweeted this and if you're watching on twitter right now we're right here in this box that i'm talking about um and y'all are welcome to just at me in the comments for stuff you're working on or ask me questions and i'll follow up there in the comments and uh it's just at alexis ohanian on twitter i'll put it in the zoom chat so you have no excuse uh and that's okay say hi awesome well thanks again so much alexis and uh appreciate you coming up yeah and uh catch everybody else pleasure fast rock on all right be well jacob thanks everybody
