do you hear me that's amazing how is everyone today right New York I love that song I love that song so second you didn't hear that all right Eve New York give me one more time big round of applause for yourselves for yourselves actually you know we're gonna do really quickly here we're gonna do something special we're gonna take a selfie that's right all of it take your badges put them up see everyone here say Eve New York that's right awesome awesome great how's everyone feeling after that a little tired right once more how's everyone feeling after that that's right this has been amazing so many hours hacking late at night I want to spend a special thank you to the volunteers who were here overnight I don't know if anyone realized but they're volunteers that just came in the evening and just stayed here all night long and they're actually not here cuz they went home to sleep but let's give them a big round of applause because without the volunteers this really wouldn't be possible so as you know I'm Denison Bertram I'm developer advocate at Zeppelin I've been your MC this weekend I've seen a lot of you around working hacking come up ask me questions most of which I had no answers for I was just like go talk someone else but I hopefully was helpful in that regard anyway this space has been amazing I don't think I have ever been in a hackathon where it was so beautiful where you could just be together all night you had meeting rooms you had places outside to hang out to eat really fantastic so this this event in particular has been our most experienced field of developers ever oh yeah right she'd be very impressed we went over that in the beginning how experienced everyone is and we've really seen that we have 500 plus total attendees that's 300 hackers 62 projects submitted 62 that's huge there's a huge number of projects for Agathon we've had 40-plus amazing talks 15 judges 2,000 plus meals served and I want to point out with those those judging the judging for those 62 projects we saw all those projects twice you pitched those projects twice that was amazing 62 hackathon projects so our five finalists that we're gonna go through in no particular order these are the people who we've really seen and we've been really impressed with where you want to go through we have if you're in the project if you're in the room which I hope you are I'm gonna ask you when I when I say your name if you can sort of line up over here just to be ready for your demos so we have defy assurance do you fight your hands around the lineup over here ultra light beam also come over here I don't see anybody over here yes takoyaki I don't know if I'm saying that right takoyaki F TDP nice and either X X 8 Dow or Exe Dow or executable Dow wasn't one of those so so come over here and line up over here because we'll do the presentations in a second yeah everyone how are we good glad okay good yes some people are awake so what's up like oh I should introduce us we're defy surance I'm Andrew this is Daniel this is Veronica and this isn't a meal and like most of you all were really excited about decentralized finance but the reason we haven't all closed out our savings accounts and put our money on the blockchain is there some risk involved with defy right like alright contracts can have bugs they can get hacked and so it's a little risky and so what we want to set out to build is essentially FDIC style insurance for decentralized deposits and that's what we did so the main challenge around this was how do you price this kind of insurance right you have these new protocols coming online the risk is is a bit unknown and so we're using augur under the hood right so I am developing a new protocol let's say and I want to ensure my users deposits and so I open a policy on defy surance and what this does under the hood is it essentially opens up a prediction market I saying and I'm betting that my protocol will get hacked or that a bug will be found and so what happens is that in that if there is such a catastrophic event my users will be paid out so let's let's take a look at how the site works a little bit so who is defy sheron's for well there are sort of three categories of users there's just general in users who are putting their money in these protocols there are the protocol developers themselves and then there are also investors since insurance is a two-sided market anyone can invest in the insurance pool and assuming there are relatively few hacks you'll earn sort of a steady dividend on the money that you put in and occasionally the value of that of what you've put in the pool will go down in such an event when a claim I needs to get made so let's walk you through that now so when I log into the site as a user I see all of the defy protocols where I have money invested on the right side here you see sort of the level of coverage that you have so for example this is of course all dummy date well not all dummy data but 0x is not fully ensuring their contract yet although you know if you want to come talk to us please do but so that's an example of sort of a Paul an investment that's fully covered but I'm noticing my eleven ethan compound I only have about fifteen percent coverage on that so if you tap on that you get this nice slider and this allows you to readjust your coverage right so you can buy you can buy more coverage tap the button we're gonna get a transaction confirm it and just like that now you're the money you have locked in that contract is covered in the case of sort of a catastrophic event on the other side of that is the investor pool and so if I want to earn some money on my on my crypto I can invest in the pool and what this does is sort of what we've built so far is this basically will give you sort of a weighted distribution of all of the insurance markets that are out there kind of give you some diversification but later what we would hope to build is the ability for those that are knowledgeable investors to be able to go through and pick contracts that they feel better about and what this will do is it'll help better price the premiums on the other side and also be a signal to users for which con protocols are safer for them to be using and that's defy insurance thank you guys [Applause] [Music] [Applause] next team hello hello lovers so hey I'm Alex and this is Tom we're from flex taps but we have created the feline term deposit put a portal wherein you can earn interest on your crypto kitties so we took the most Mimi things in crypto we took the two most useless things crypto kitties and stickers and we combined them with the most useful thing defy to allow people to stick their crypto kitties on a virtual stick a wall and then make returns from compound finance because why not so here are my crypto kitties at the bottom and you know I can I can rotate them you make a move spin around I can make them a lot larger so if I want a phone to flex my bags then I can do that and I can stick my my sweet pirate Kitty on the wall this is main net this is all live this is actually going into compound right now one transaction will wrap the eath deployed like to pose it into compound and then I'll just start making returns and I can withdraw it whenever I want we like to call this little box the regulatory sandbox because we don't know how legal this is but teach you kids how to invest with the crypto kitties so one last thing so austin pointed out there's a really interesting example of just the permissionless nests of this space like we can we can put money in compounds through some arbitrary front end so this is using pixie j/s we didn't know how to use pixie guess so all we've made is this kind of rudimentary stick a wall you could have some really interesting interface that allowed you to access to centralized finance so have a think about how you can use other people's smart contracts and build funky daps on top of them because you can do whatever you want thanks [Applause] everybody I'm rape over author of the idec's hybrid decentralized exchange contract this is Matt's he works with terminal this is uh Dylan as DK consulting and where did Lewis go Oh over there all right so really excited about that cryptic eighties app gonna be using that a lot we are exid al not exit dow so your phones are safe and to prefer to think of that joke alright so what we have to show Oh get a VGA cable up here so we can I guess we're not well yeah go ahead get back there take your time so we'll talk a little about what we made we made a new kind of proxy contract that actually accepts a compiled contract as input as transaction input and it will dynamically rewrite the byte code and sanitize it so in case you have a complex permissions model on your proxy contract considering you might want to do multi-sig or have some kind of advanced ownership model of who gets to use allowed to control the funds control by this contract we sanitize the s store operations delegate call call code basically anything that could allow you an untrusted user to S store and overwrite the permission system so this might allow you to do things like execute multiple atomic transactions if you're doing arbitrage between maybe Fork Delta or 0x or what we have in our demo which would be very happy to show you is going to be a simple example where we just deposit some ether on the contract and we vote to send the ether out to some address oh here we go things are turning up I'm still thinking so yeah so basically what this does is heavily written in inline assembly in solidity and it's going to load the input contract into memory and it's going to allocate a new memory segment that it will then just start parsing opcode code and passing over push instructions to make sure we don't sanitize anything we don't want to and it's going to rewrite the contract into something we think is safe and we will run and trust almost there so we have a demo - it's pretty cool all right and so this might enable you to do things like if you have a if you can do your validation in your proxy contract you can express this as a bytecode transpiler then you might be able to sanitize arbitrary transaction inputs and make sure nothing you don't want to is going on in against whatever contract back end that is trusting this proxy contract or you could do things like but our example is we have a simple example of a multi-sig wallet where we can execute arbitrary inputs and just make sure that no one is taking away permissions from other owners at the multi-state contract or anything like that still working on this VGA but it's a nice demo you can take my word for it thank you thank you sir okay we're gonna point a camera at the screen and that is going to that's basically our stand-in for a VGA cable tonight hopefully the camera works the camera doesn't take VGA hopefully no I don't see anything well we tried oh it's black that's different very optimistic there we go is that a camera screen oh that's your phone okay probably pull it up on the phone maybe all right well that's okay thanks everybody [Applause] we're gonna see if there's a VGA cable somewhere in the house and then if we can find one at the end we'll have them come back up and show it to us because it looked cool I saw it next yes we do have used to be see we're good I mean we have most cables hello everyone so I'm Richard this is Lu we did takoyaki it's a lot of weird little things all glued together so we'll try I think what we're gonna do is we'll do the quick slide show thingy hope you have some questions Oh was it not thingy yeah yeah I'll do that a second a good point doop haha but now my notes disappeared okay anyways then we'll do the demo cuz the demo takes about a minute because I actually some I not much stuff on the blockchain and I look there's kind of a complicated thing I need to explain so I'll gloss over during this and then I'll explain afterwards while we're seeing that our takoyaki mine so the idea was I really want my notes anyway the idea was to make a ns you know what I'm doing the notes anyways so you get to see my notes as well so the idea was to make NS fun and simple so if you use NS today basically what you have to do is there's two transactions you have to place a minute at least a minute apart the longer the delay the better this means for example two interactions with the ENS contract and you have to sit around and wait for word and kind of boring so the whole goal is to make eNOS work sighs used and also to provide a random source of data for games like crypto kiddies that's more reliable than just block hashes so the problems are I think it is stated like requires two separate UI transactions NS is tedious to wait for I'm just reading notes at this point so let me just get to the craft so the first part of it is basically when you buy an NS name when you buy a like a Rick mood takoyaki eath you actually get an NSC token and so this is kind of like crypto kiddies it slowly like you get an actual token out of the out of it but unlike crypto kiddies where you you pay for your kitty and twelve or twenty blocks now you get your cat once this cat or this cat this octopus inside this little like ball of dough this delicious is being slowly like decided what type of traits its gonna have so you can see by the time it gets to this one you can tell what color your takoyaki is gonna be and by the time he gets to this one you can see what type of eyes is gonna have and by the time it's over here you kind of the idea of what type of mouth it has what colored slaves are all sorts of stuff so it's it's more engaging so as you're waiting for this minute long process you actually something to look forward to you're like excited because you know this next block comes along and boom look at oh I got the round eyes who's a super exciting so that's like step one of the thing so the other thing we wanted to focus on for usability so that was just to help you know waiting around for the transaction to fin it or like the the delay between yes so you need to commit to what you want to buy and then wait some time and then reveal what you actually committed the reason for this is because if you don't in I see you're buying like McDonald's dot eath I can jump in and steal that name from you if I pay a higher gas price so the idea is you commit to buying McDonald's but secretly and then later you reveal you were buying McDonald's and now it's too late no one can jump in and steal a name from you so this is the thing I'm going to explain while the demo is running because it's kind of complicated but basically we use a technique that has keyless COAS a neo a is an externally owned account these are the only type of aetherium accounts that can actually execute transactions and so normally if use meta mask you need two for E and s you would need to commit one transaction and then wait a minute and then commit a second transaction so to UI interactions so the this was really just reduced it down to one and so yes we'll explain that in a minute so the other thing is because of this if people are familiar Randy Aranda was a system for producing truly random numbers it has a commit face and a reveal phase which sounds very similar to the ENS we just described we have a commit phase and a reveal phase so we can actually bootstrap reliable random numbers from ENS especially once we have a scale and there's ENS entries coming in all the time we can generate actual random numbers so these are this technique works entirely fine with top-level domains as well we just did it with the takoyaki ENS name because it's cuter and an adorable adorable yes Oh demo yes let's do the demo yeah welcome back to questions lit so I will explain what's going on for the how do I make this thing bigger haha so okay so this one's already been available so because we've been testing you can see the address display so this one is available it's a new NS name that you could purchase so we're just gonna click on the button buy me exactly one interaction I have to make this contract so yeah so basically you notice that meta must only pop up one time I'll try to explain this might be too low level for some people might be too high level for others we were asked a few times by people and it's a bit complicated on how it works but basically you can so if you think of how a normal transaction works on the blockchain you have a private key so you generate your transaction and you use that private key to sign that transaction which gives you a signature you then glue those together and give it to the blockchain the blockchain an important thing to realize though is that a transaction doesn't have a from address what the etheric network does is it takes your transaction you gave it and the signature you gave it runs easy recover and now knows who to charge for that transaction so what we want is a system that doesn't have a private key oh I see his little purplish head is showing through so what we're gonna do instead is we're going to use the contract to produce a gerund so we still build our transaction but rather than signing it with a private key to get rent get a signature we're going to true choose a provably random signature now obviously there's no funds sitting here because it's a completely random address that no one has a private key for but that's that's the only thing really stopping it from being a real transaction so you can just send money if you ready Steve you cover on that transaction you'll still get an address so if you send money to that address that's now you valid a transaction that you can drop on the network and it'll go off to the races and so you can see his eyes are showing I was going to say he's got the round eyes we only implement one type of eyes so it's not that impressive of a feat but yes so that's it in a nutshell yes yeah thank you we found a VGA cable so the rack it'll take us a second a second up everybody bear with us a moment well we got our antique PGA K work or working night yeah so we're gonna show you guys two things we're gonna show you a brief snippet of the part of this segment of the code the assembly code that will be rights op codes and again we're replacing certain unsecure op codes with beavers and then next we are doing something you can actually only do with inline assembly and a solidity since you need a full fully written contract in your code for this solidity compiler to use the create op code so we are just storing it at some base offset the output contract we writing and we are deploying it with the create op code so we're to take a little look at that and then we're going to demo the application we made very soon all right exit Dow Oh all right we've got our VGA cable holder in place shout-out to him all right so don't let's pull up the code first and just take a brief tour oh do you close it not there it is all right oh no this VGA is over 100 years old might need to VGA cable holders one for each side oh we do need to be GI gold holders powers green hold the clutch it's gonna be worth it trust me No there we go all right quick look all right so we have a little snippet of code we we call the called data copy get our input contract and then we we go over opcode by opcode passing over all push up coats and we want to rewrite the s stores call codes delegate calls and just make it over we can we increase the size Dylan how good of your Google Chrome skills there we go a little more a little more how're we doing more how's that legible all right I heard some more maybe a little more all right there we go that's real close all right so we have to shift out get the opcode outs and we want to just do it brief switch statement and make sure we sanitize those insecure inputs and let's scroll down a little bit because we see the sanitation and we want to a little more we have a and that is an example of how to use the create table go with just a raw pointer and you can you could pass in any dynamic contract you want and then we immediately delegate to it and in our template contract we self-destruct it so we've gone over the applications this so let's take a look at the the demo now yeah so we need to hurry up so you guys can find the demo on dev post or on github okay so we have a dial here that uses this contract and we're going to just create it real quick so you you gonna make the dial you provide the list of addresses that are owners of it that can vote on proposed inputs and then you say what the threshold is for like how many people have to approve it before it will run Cody provide I have to go off screen and confirm this with a mask okay so we now have created the contract I'm going to send a little bit of ether to it okay and so now the men mask that having this other browser is already part of the douse I just have to load it okay okay so we have like a template contract here so you can just write some lines of solidity and not have to give the entire contract and then it'll just kind of pop it into the template let me compile it if we check the status real quick it says that we need two votes before it will be able to run and so I'm going to vote the first time on the left now it says we need one more vote and then I'm going to vote on it again to confirm it okay and now executed and if I look at the address the code there just sends a little bit of ether to another address and I'm at a mask and so if I check on here we can see a count one has two ether and this is the address that we put in there [Applause] I promise the laptop was worth it thank you next thank you thank you sorry but we're gonna have to set up we have a lot of computers so you guys wanna know how we like scammed our way here right cuz like it's Dean who led him here yeah so we're ultra light beam oh oh yeah sure I'm not plugged in yes yeah perfect so yeah so we are approach is called ultralight beam essentially what it is is a MANET network very similar to kind of a mesh network except we relay like arbitrary data across and it's completely over bluetooth in this POC but basically the vision of it was we're going to be over the next like we are to actually develop a protocol for it so that wallets can essentially have an offline mode with the idea that like for instance like like Zig status or burn our wallet could essentially be offline and relay like eath transactions amongst other offline nodes through bluetooth and then find one that's actually online which will then broadcast messages upwards yeah yeah so I think there's a [Applause] yeah I don't know how we did it okay so I might get the eath transaction wrong cuz I'm like hacking the Nantes but all right so weak so basically how it works is my device will be off on Bluetooth there's there's a so there's nodes which is mine and also Dean's phone which we might okay we're not gonna use this phone and then basically this computer here is running as the relay ER so the relay er actually has connection to the internet which can then broadcast to other relays to basically update the message it's essentially a giant IRC for like messaging and then the etherium transaction it's like first-come first-serve the first relay er that it gets it takes it consumes it and then just like doesn't pass along the transaction that's what they don't like no double spend a temple you can spend it but same nonce so are we are you live cool so yeah so these guys so I'll send this yeah this is like kind of tough to this we need like four screens but basically as you can see I'm oh damn can we switch to the other one oh she got something wrong knots - yeah so basically what happened right here on the connecting part I don't know why it's backwards but essentially I discovered the Bluetooth device over there connected to him create my a transaction sent it to him and then he sent me back the actual transaction which should be on Gurley and he didn't get it cuz like there's no reason to publish that to the whole network that'd be a huge waste of bandwidth and yeah so it's actually included into the block which is kind of cool and then the other half of the demo which would be like the arbitrary message passing I think Early's broken we built that that's a problem oh yeah that's my private key it's a dummy don't worry and this would be like arbitrary message pass so I I sent a message to him sort of came in and it's gonna be on a ping so you can see I'm pinging and receiving now I'm only sending right now but this computer is actually getting my messages and it's basically Bluetooth to bluetooth then through the interwebs to his computer and Dean's phone can do the exact same thing that my computer did just he didn't write half the Xcode stuff so you know bad iOS developer that's our demo hopefully in like a week we'll actually of a protocol for it and we can actually start like forking onto burner and whoever else has a wallet that actually wants to try and test this out because this will be like useful at conferences or you know just anywhere with we need to talk to people and a large group of people area when you have no cell service Burning Man excellent let's get a round of applause again for our finalists so as you know also we have our sponsors and they have our sponsor bounties so we will have our sponsors come up one by one and talk about who their has won their bounties if all the sponsors could sort of like line up over here just so we can go through it one by one and first up is new cipher new cipher don't do this to me man alright I guess we're gonna have to come back to new cipher and scale alright what a weekend that was fun okay we have six winners I'm Jack by the way from scale Chadwick from scale ok so let's get started all right we have six bounties the first five are five for 500 I the first one is a simple and fully decentralized search engine with sorted stocking order using the fast finality of scale to enhance the end-user experience blockchain name service great work second one is a ballot creation mechanism for current token holders using scales decentralized file storage to store a Merkle tree root hash goes to e rc 20 voting app nice work third one is an either payment button for websites and apps with an incentive system behind it using scales fast fun init finality for great user experience the aptly named the collusion resistant up vote button for locusts fourth is a fractionalized asset investment that lets multiple people invest in assets that would otherwise be too expensive using fast finality and cheaper transactions on the scale platform investor the fifth one is a ultra simple NFC wallet that even a child can use donors convert Fiat into dye using wire and dye is converted onto the scale chain using s die and used for an awesome seamless user experience an ailing smartphone in NFC to transact s die for school meals for children let's hear it for tapi the grand prize winner for 1000 die is a three player capture-the-flag meets minesweeper like game where players collude to reach the center place and reveal minds be the first to center and claim your prize collusion all right great work everybody it's fun Thanks [Applause] he's a newspaper here Thunder core just as a little overview we're just gonna say the the winners but you don't have to come up hello thank you for everyone who hacked on thunder we're gonna be around seeing two or three different winners so we had actually our first winner won both best game and best combination of stacks we have robot rumble thank you that's awesome guys congratulations and then we had instead of awarding a best tooling and a best privacy we we had a tie for privacy wit between I vote you and ERC 20 voting app both get a thousand Thunder each next up seller seller hi this time we have two bounties and for the first point is C gamer the Ponte goes to Cujo Kojo is the application that you can put your cute crypto kitties together and let them fight in a state channel and the second prize go is the second bounty goes to my project a tomb which is a cash like application that you can send instant payment to merchants and enable this kind of micro payment the financial transactions and the purchases all right so that's from us next up the graph hi I'm uni from the graph so I loved vitalik stalk on Friday and we had not one but two teams working on collusion resistance so if anybody's thinking about starting a cartel and making things closed y'all are about to get out engineered we're doing $5,000 in prizes we've got five winners their web 3 bindings I vote for you right sorry I vote you smart piggies Cygnus and your C 20 voting adapt thank you so much [Applause] err sup hey guys first thank you very much for is global and all the icons for making the trip are swap is based in New York so great to see it is a big gathering here we got one prize today for 1000 die that goes to Caspian Tradex for building on top of decks index and allowing arbitrage searches between different exes Congrats dapper hey everyone we're super excited to be here at Eve New York but before we announce the winners as I always do I would love to hear the loudest meow from this room so when I count down from 3 to 1 giver 3 2 1 that's weird week not enough sleep I probably let's give it another try 3 2 1 great so we have 2 bounties I'm gonna announce the crypto kitty kitty verse ones and then I have Lynn announced the dapper ones so in second place the winner is Cujo they built a game that allows your kiddies to battle as you heard in the last announcement the first place winner is kitty Phi they built a they basically took the the opcodes from Pokemon game and the sound bites they actually linked it to the genetics of the cats so each cats are now have a voice so we're really excited about that project and for a dapper I was a smart contract while we have feline term deposit sickness crypto bingo and kitty Phi congratulations to all of our winners Matic hi everyone this is sandy from Matic so we have four teams which we are giving bounties to these teams use dramatic plasma enabled pause side chains which ensure fast finality while having the security of plasma for the assets so the first team is 0xo which created a you know app for shortening the URLs the second team is discord button wallet which you know allows you to send ERC 20 tokens why you know within this coil or you know telegram also and then there's one more team which is cash Lutz which created a game for kids and then the last project is project genie which allows you to make wishes on the blockchain yeah finance labs sup guys this is tag from various labs we have three winners of our fellowship grants the first is to this discord button wallet team they're building an easy-to-use wallet on discord second winner is finance pay they made a wallet this has a very easy payment UX for physical retail and then the third winner is Cappy Z which they made a tool that makes it easy to issue tokens undermine and chain congrats guys thank you boom everyone really excited to be here just fun also add foam has been based in the new lab for the last two years so it's been really amazing to see the etherium community come here and utilize the space in such a way we have one winner for our foam API prize of 30,000 foam tokens and that is French toast Kitty this is a new way to interact with your crypto kitty in the real world and it integrates with torus crypto Kitty's chain-link and foam so essentially you can give your crypto Kitty a geospatial address and have it show up on a map and it also then uses chain link to get the real-time weather so you can now learn what the weather conditions are where your kitty lives and then it uses the foam API to filter what points are in the area that are worth going to based on the weather so if it's cloudy all the outdoor places won't show up so now you can take your crypto Kitty with you and see what the weather is on the phone map so that was really awesome to see Thanks and congrats to the team are we've okay hi thanks so we have one price for $1,500 and it goes to the slice of Dow team so essentially what they did is they built a kind of system for bootstrapping a company with no ownership so when you start a company and you don't know who's actually going to end up doing what then essentially you just get tokens for what you end up doing and then you create a sort of cap table based on this and it's really cool and because it's stored on the our weave you can never lose access to the UI so it's always going to work Thanks ENS guys we have five prizes of two hundred dollars each and there's no particular order first one is one-inch exchange they yep which provider created toka swap congratulations and number two natural files which provides an decentralized ipfs file tracker not your files congratulations and so I want a takoyaki which you know congratulation they've demonstrated a great technical knowledge and the love for ENS and we said is s3 right and yeah force wines or cerium integration yeah which provides the web to login flow for aetherium special mention that they to demonstrate the integration with tap they actually integrate with a kickback which is another project of mine then demo which is awesome and did I say force so the last one last not least is I don't know how to pronounce s tollgate store gate which has a long description of open the portal to the Tor network register your hidden service onion address on the ENS use meta mask to export all directory from your search bar what just use our search engine a special mention to this team that they just not only demonstrated they actually raised a pro request to post meta mask and the dns manager which can be integrated Taurus hi guys I'm from tourists and we do distributed seamless login to adapts we have several prizes to give out to those who integrate us thanks a lot for everybody who did so our first prize is to the most innovative DAP and that's to exe dau our second prize is to the DAP which best fills the industry needs and that's to frappe and our third prize is to the most seamless DAP which also goes to the slice of dau and our best app goes to def I sure [Applause] as stuck hi guys i'm tom from aztec we saw some really cool use cases of our zero knowledge proof this weekend and we were particularly impressed by one team who took some really cool strides towards doing zero noise salary streaming from adapt and so we decided to award this team 500 dollars and that prize goes to salary so congratulations [Applause] UNICEF hi everyone I'm Christina this is Betty I'm announcing the prize on behalf of UNICEF France for reducing the digital divide and I'd like to congratulate the hack Packers team for building both the ability for a donor to fund a specific region to bring connectivity to it but also to monitor the connectivity and manage the relationship with the ISP so congratulation TAC Packers we actually have one more we don't have the slide for in fury' give it up for euro all right hi I'm Danny from Fira we gave out to API bounty prizes today we just told you guys to build cool things and connect them to a theorem using in fira so our two winners are takoyaki and Cujo congratulations we also have a prize by uma clap hi so we had a prize for the project that we thought would bring the next hundred ethan to defy because we want to grow this whole space so the project we're awarding $3,500 is the feline term to term how do you say it term deposit portal which you all saw earlier whoo [Applause] thank you everyone very much I would like to call up alright we're going to go through the sponsors these you've seen everybody but we want to give a special round of applause so I'm gonna go through our sponsors we have new cipher and

ecosystem eat New York is our fourth event of the year and we're so happy that it it's the way it is right now the excitement that we saw in the crowd on Friday on Saturday today all the amazing projects that came out of it all the amazing sponsored projects and in the interest we've seen it just constantly amazes me so we we want to wrap the the event up as you know and I know a lot of you are tired and it's been a long three days for all of us so want to just spend the next few minutes thinking a handful of important people that kind of made this event possible these events as you know are free for developers and a lot goes into making these events happen did that months of time all of us have kind of put in to making sure that you have the best experience here ever really deserves a special recognition the best thing about these events is that you only realize that the amount of work that goes into them when something goes wrong because if something is going smooth people don't even notice so this is our opportunity to think everybody that kind of put in all the hard work and time and dedication to making these events possible and I'm going to hand this off to Andrew to kind of kick this off all right thank you Karthik yeah cart you know I'll make this quick there's almost too many people to to thank you know there's so many million details and little decisions that happen over weeks and weeks and months and many of these people have been on long phone calls late at night making decisions about how many banners and how much coffee and where we gonna park oh we have no parking so I can't run through them all but there's a hard hard core team I call them like they're they've been working for months and months and a whole list of organizers here I want to make special thanks to James wah simona pop daniel soryo brian Ison Bach Victor Bunin Dennison Bertram and Megan NAB these people have been working so hard a lot of thanks to them and also to key people

heather jacob josh and liam from the youth global team so the real question is we just talked about all this stuff and and what are the finalists actually win we kind of saw five people present on stage 62 different projects the best thing about these events is that we don't structure them as competitions there's no objective for a second third ranking these are supposed to be collective events where we just get to show the cool stuff that we've all worked on over the past weekend so as part of this in kind of the tradition for keeping these either global events consistent all five winners are going to get $500 worth of eath to every team member on the team so this is great because every time we do these events and and so far we've done one every month starting February we've yet to see come but somebody come to us and be like and ask us just what are what are we going to win and how do we kind of win the best prize we don't publish these prizes online people don't kind of bug us we don't get any emails and really kind of speaks to the actual excitement and effort people have been wanting to learn and experiment and we want to just keep on doing that so congratulations to all of you winners and we'll kind of reach out to you all the sponsor winners all the finalists and everybody else over email with the next steps on how to kind of move forward from all this so thank you so
