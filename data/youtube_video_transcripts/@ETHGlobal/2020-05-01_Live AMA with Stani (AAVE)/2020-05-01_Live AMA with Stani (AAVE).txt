welcome everybody who just joined thanks for showing up all right it looks like the we got the live stream on twitter and hopefully the youtube stream is working as well welcome to everybody who's uh just joined and is watching on live streams we're very happy to have you uh we're gonna get started in maybe a few minutes we'll give some time for people to join the stream or join the the zoom room not too long though so stay tuned feel free to drop your uh your local time in the chat it is early morning for me not really really see yeah jacob and i 10 am okay you got some evening folks 10 p.m i think 10 p.m wins all right pretty much uh i'm just gonna say we've got every time zone represented we got them all great is a global ama i think that's that's that's so cool like if you think about this hackathon how how usually it's it's uh it's a bit burden to travel across the globe and you don't have the chance to do that and you're basically we have like actually a chance to participate in something like this and across the globe that's that's pretty nice for sure looks like we still have some people joining so maybe wait a couple more minutes as they filter in yeah yeah so someone said it's a bit of burden but a lot of fun it's i mean the old saying goes uh there's if there's no no pain there's no gain so enjoy if you're just joining feel free to turn on your video um i know we're all online and we all know we're online but it's good to see some faces you know because i'm i'm just used to seeing if you're in hack money i'm just used to seeing handles it's nice to see faces you know well a lot of geek looking [Laughter] aren't we all a little geeky stani yeah i i think so yes we are on your video instantly insulted everybody turns off video it's a compliment so cool how are we doing looks like we have about 20 people in here which is great there we go as i said it happened the final joiner cool yeah i think we can uh kick it off if you like jacob sounds great um yeah so everybody thanks so much for coming to stanley's ama um just to give you a little bit of a sense of what's going to go down um we'll do a quick little intro with tommy get a sense of his background we won't go as deep as childhood but we'll you know we'll hit the some level um after that there's a couple questions we got um from people who couldn't make it due to time zones or otherwise didn't want to make it so we'll go through some of those um and then we'll open the floor up so um get thinking about what questions you have for stony because you know you'll be able to ask them directly over the zoom call so so just keep that in the back your mind and without further ado um i'd like to first say thank you uh to stani for taking the time to to do this ama with us um and of course for obvious support on this event um obvi is actually a 2020 partner um for east global so we're really happy to have them on board um and they've been really essential in in our year so far so um happy to be working with them again um and happy to be working especially at hackmoney uh where we're really excited to see what people can build um on top of ave and on d5 so cool welcome to tommy thanks jacob um yeah and definitely nice to nice to be here and and i i've been in um participating and mentoring and and um in in the previous uh hackathons um and i i think it's it's very very unique at the opportunity um kind of like i will go a bit of the my background in a moment but just just to say a couple of words about the the global i i think it's it's a rare occasion where you actually can you are basically in a universe that you can build anything and there's like no restrictions because like when you look in the current system that that we have for example finance or um whether it's related to privacy you have different kinds of uh kind of like you're trying to uh you're maneuvering in a in a field where everything's uh not compatible so you're kind of like restricted on on these different layers and i think once now when we are in this kind of like uh composable ecosystem you can actually just do anything and like these hackathons like in it global and especially like the the dfi one which which which is something that's that's related very much that i'm i'm doing myself uh it's it's pretty cool because there's no nothing like stopping you on developing uh something that helps a lot of people without actually having a lot of uh issues with the uh capabilities and and compared for example if you will build some sort of like a financial application on top of a banking system and you have different kinds of layers and of course banks don't want to talk to each other because on a retail level because they want to safeguard their customers so that's like pretty cool and my background is interesting in a sense that um i used to do development myself programming i started to i think it was 13 on 12 years old i started to build things on on basically php so the very uh classical programming language and got very interested actually into ruby and and follow that community and i actually ended up going to study uh law because i i really loved rules and and kind of like uh programming made a lot of sense there's a lot of mathematics uh involved and and and it's it's very easy to uh to get kind of like uh outputs from inputs and and law was for me kind of like very difficult to understand because uh there's so much interpretation like what's like what's right what's wrong and and it's it's very subjective and when i was uh studying in college uh in in in the nordics in helsinki uh one of the things was was uh for me interesting that i went into one of the events um uh about basically it was a kind of like a technology event uh where startups and investors meet and it's one of the biggest ones called slash and there was like a year where like blockchain was on like very um high level there introduced so it was 2000 i think it was 2015 or 16. i think it was uh 15 and and there was a lot of discussion about uh basically ethereum and and now what you could do with smart contracts and and when i understood like you have this like immutable technology so uh first time you can actually uh build things and and that particular piece of code will not change so so kind of like i was thinking that that's something that is very intriguing and how you could use that in in in a way in different kinds of uh legal uh applications so i tried to find different kinds of things there but uh i i've been always interested in finance that's something always like i always kind of like like the the idea of uh money in a way that not necessarily like in a materialistic way but but more of like how it's used as a kind of like a note so so like um in different ways and you know you have money somewhere like earning interest you have money somewhere where you're paying interest and and and that it has interesting kind of like dynamics i think the dynamics is the right word that that basically i i was interested in and i saw like actually that there is like a lot of cool things that are up applicable to finance and what you could actually solve with smart contracts and immutable code and that was uh 2000 i think um uh 16 where we started to think um what if like what if you're trying to do a financial transaction that is a bit more complex than for example uh yeah php rocks so that is more complex than than uh just the basic transferring fonts from one uh one address to another one and having one some condition for example there something that actually represent a financial transaction from the uh financial markets for example and one of the like not to make it too easy we try to think like how do we make this transaction uh trustless so the two two counterparties when they do this transaction they don't need to trust each other and and and we picked up a loan transaction and that was the time when when basically the uh erc20 tool gets started to gain more value so so actually there is a secondary market so you could actually start to use them as a collateral so this whole like over collateralization thing came up from there and and basically we did our very first uh uh landing landing protocol that was actually launched on ethereum called eat land and and basically that's that's where we started as like a proof of concept to see like uh what this technology could allow us to do and i think after that it's basically like things started to move there was stable coins were coming up uh pooled models landing pools uh liquidity pool started to come into ethereum and and things started to get layerized so so basically now that the the oldest financial applications are uh in the video and they started to talk to each other and and that that was where the actual like hacking started to happen like like the stuff that you you build on the the the protocol level uh it's kind of a bit boring in a sense that you you're providing like a platform to others to hack and you have it it's even boring today than it used to be because now you have to build that layer and then you have to like overly focus on security and making sure that like of course in all the layers but in especially this layer like the the liquidity layer focusing on security and actually when when things are happening on on this like in between all these kind of like different hacks that is where like the the like money hacking comes and yield hacking comes and and what's like things that are going to uh come from this hackathon so that was like our story and and uh we we launched uh of the the uh learning protocol on january a few months ago uh reached roughly 50 million market size and the growth has been very interesting because like i i think most of the like liquidity comes from actually different kinds of integrations for example from curve iron and so forth so like you see actually that um the focusing on focusing on the composibility it actually is a very good network effect so the more you share the more you let people to use your liquidity and and the more you use others like other providers liquidity the more the ecosystem grows and i i think this is like very difficult to understand if you come from like traditional finance or not even like finance but like like kind of like a business logic that that kind of like you are competing against everyone and that's like completely reverse like here you're actually like complimenting whatever you're building complements like the whole ecosystem and that's like the the the like a super fascinating part in in the uh ethereum ecosystem so that's it's great i mean you touched on so many things that that i want to dig into and they're related to a lot of these questions um that we got ahead of time too so um maybe just to start you know you mentioned uh you know uh ave the company itself like made a transition from the original product which was ethelene which i think at the time was like probably one of the earliest if not the earliest um like lending dap right is that true yeah yeah yeah cool the first one yeah awesome yeah so so you guys were sort of like almost pioneers in the space which is really cool um so so what what did you learn from from kind of the east land proof of concept that that ended up becoming you know core functionality in ave and and maybe if you could touch a little bit on on what what makes ave different like then than some of the other things in the market oh that's that's interesting stuff uh well what what we learned um i i think kind of like the biggest thing we learned in in during eatland is is basically that uh kind of like you need to treat the liquidity as a as a network effect so so kind of like uh to get liquidity um you need to have some kind of innovation and then it comes it's it's kind of like you're well you have like this like electricity grid that you're plugging in your your uh innovation whatever it is basically is it lending is it is it basically payments related or insurance or or whatnot and and like that that innovation will actually get that network effect and and drives it and i i think that was the very first thing we understood that also kind of like when you treat liquidity you need to always understand how it it moves so you you can't like fragmentize it too much so uh back in in eatland for example you could uh we had over 150 different collaterals you could use and there's a different like uh uh liquidation discounts there and and we kind of choose the model of this kind of like an otc very wide marketplace because uh the liquidity in general was very low uh in the um uh d5 space but today it's it's kind of different because like if you look at the the uh uh the uh from d5 pulls for example the the locked value in into space it's it's somewhere 600 700 800 depending on the timing uh million which is which is still small compared to traditional financial markets and these instruments but uh what is interesting is that it's a proof that the liquidity is there it's sitting there and it's basically just looking a place to be parked and it's now parking those protocols and also the pro the the protocols and things that are hacked on top of them for various reasons one is the security one is basically the the yields and and and that those are the kind of like the drivers that you need to attract but also there's other things that doesn't relate at all like uh financial uh mechanisms for example like brand i mean like deepa is also kind of like a brand game and like a game where uh the uh the the subjectivity of the team is is valued as well and i think like in our community uh we'll see that because people who build on top of ave they also kind of like like they they can relate to us we're like very uh uh down to earth and try to trying to help developers being with them uh like solving solving different kinds of problems like in terms of like implementations integrations at 2am in the morning and those things are just because like that's how we have built always and that's how that's how like uh people can relate to us so that's like one one thing like that we learned and a bit of like what makes difference and of course um in terms of like uh what we're trying to achieve with the protocol is that we are trying to package uh risks and and different kind of uh uh collateral models in into different uh pools so we all know that we have like for example one lending pool with with uh pre-selected assets there that you can actually borrow against uh or deposit and earn and like we understand that at some point in the d5 space there will be basically hundreds and hundreds of collaterals that are very liquid and if the tokenization of different kinds of assets continues uh we could expect kind of like a future where uh every asset has some kind of interest rate on on chain and then you could use that as a collateral and and uh what you can actually do is that you can package this different kinds of um collaterals into different kinds of pools and and one of the things that we are for example launching next week is a pool where you can use uni-swap liquidity as a collateral and the idea is there that you can actually provide different kinds of different kind of a risk pool and also try to with that different kind of risk attach a different kind of uh uh reward which is basically yield and get uh more liquidity into this system because the thing is that we are not only com like we are not like competing or or like uh sharing the liquidity that is is already in d5 but our job is also to bring new liquidity into the space and that's basically what um those like d5 yields usually have been doing uh when when they have been like high up when they're down then like people don't talk that much about dfi and and it's kind of like uh goes uh back and forth makes sense um cool i mean i mean one of one of the other things i think that strikes me about ave that's that's pretty unique is is obviously your use of flash loans and that sort of thing um you know maybe i'll i'll grab the armpit i don't know if you want to unmute and uh ask your question about flashlights so that's something that you can do or trunk can do there you go um but yeah sure so okay no you're good go ahead yeah so one fine day i wake up and then i'm checking twitter and then there's this really uh brilliant idea about flashlights right so uh it took me like a day or two to dig into it but it was super interesting so i was like wondering what kind of conversations or discussions led to it like how did you guys come up with it yeah actually that was that's that was a pretty interesting stuff because like um what we noticed when we uh we were looking at different kinds of uh protocols on dfi and also uh moderate modeling our own liquidity we kind of noticed that uh there is like a lot of assets there that are actually like we need to deposit into dfi uh and and usually those uh reserves are fractional and fraction basically means that some of the liquidity is not used and and not allocated and that's basically means that it's a bit of uh less efficiently allocated and we were trying to figure out like different ways that how you could actually uh how you could reuse that liquidity in in or or like in any shape or form and one of the things that for example uh we do is that we we take the liquidity when you deposit you get a interest bearing token and you can use that elsewhere and probably at some point in the future you can uh deposit that interest bearing token to another protocol and and and so forth and so forth you get these layers and another thing is is basically we thought that why don't we just basically let people to flash borrow uh on one transaction from the pool uh since there are there are use cases where you could actually uh use it and flashlight itself it's not a uh it's not like a concept that we we invented by by itself like we have our own implementation but there have been previous implementations and some of them haven't been basically used previously and our goal was just basically uh before we implemented we were thinking like what kind of use cases you could have and uh one of the things that we wanted to do is that uh we wanted to see how flash loans will affect the compressibility so how flashlights will be used in the whole d5 ecosystem and started to think different kinds of use cases and i think from all those use cases we came up with arbitrage and and basically uh i think uh a couple of other ones uh can't even remember what we did but uh but after we launched i uh i think in total there was um over a dozen different kinds of use cases and some of them just came when uh i was brainstorming with a a developer who was thinking like uh kind of like asking help in a brainstorming in different use cases and suggesting ideas and and just came up with uh pretty fascinating stuff and one of the interesting uh example is is the collateral swap uh i i opened a uh a cdp and and i noticed that actually if i want to change my collateral which is practically your long position i need to close my cpp and i was thinking like why why can't you do that uh kind of like on the run and and then of course you can do it but you need to return your capital so so the value means you need to return and then i was brainstorming with mariano conte and asked like why don't we use like flash loans so instead of me returning like if i have a long position on bit and i want to switch my collateral to to eat why don't i basically just uh flash borrow and close the cdp and open the eat loan and still i have my uh my die somewhere or i have already spended it i don't need to return it back for a while and and then i posted a tweet about this uh that can someone built this thing and and and uh david one of our uh team members uh well our one of our developers uh who is actually here very active in in hack money he basically uh look at they took a look at the idea and started to build and he basically built this kind of like uh application which is called collaterals i mean it has even a site like collateralswap.com and you could just uh swap your collateral position and uh well david is basically now uh working at ava and doing pretty interesting stuff but that's just that's just an example like how you are using ave and then you're using at the same time uh maker as well to do different kinds of things there and there's other things you could do you could actually refinance your loan you could instead of like swapping your collateral uh on on uh maker you could actually refinance your loan dialogue to usdc to compound switch the collateral from uh bht to eat at the same time and you can have like automated system that swaps your uh currency all the time to get your best trade so i i think like the compressibility factor was was like the key thing and the reusing of the collateral uh the the the the most uh important things that actually led to the flashlight implementation and uh because we were like very unsure like what kind of like a security risk that could be i mean after all the diligence that we had we basically added a re-entrance regard there so that you can't use our flash loans against our own protocol yet so we kind of wanted to take a very [Music] slow step into this direction thank you cool awesome thanks for the question armpit um i mean also a question in the chat that's you know sort of related to something that i saw online as well which which is um i know there was a conversation in the ave channel like maybe five or six days ago about yield hacking and you know i think um even though it's been years in the industry for me like there's so many terms in this industry that are just novel all the time and i was wondering if you could like kind of expand on what yield hacking in is and and how that has to do with like i think it has to do with like redirecting interest and that sort of thing um so i i'd love to know a little bit more about about what you define as yield hacking and obviously you're excited about it so so why it's so exciting for you yeah for sure like i i think like what's cool about like yield hacking is is like you're trying to basically [Music] uh a bit of like break the current yield system in in d5 so you're trying to innovate in a way that you actually uh bring more yield to the depositors so as as i basically went through the uh we see a bit like the the liquidity as a network effect and liquidity comes when there's hills so let's say it's it's kind of like a water who uh which which basically goes to the direction where uh there's more water and and so forth so so the idea with yield hacking is that um you're trying to build something that gives even more yield to the current system and at the same time you're utilizing the current system or not but in the like sake of concept composability you are doing something uh very on top of the the current system and uh one of the examples is is uh in yield hacking is that you're using you're depositing into one place for example in one protocol to earn interest and and then uh you take the interest bearing note and you go to another place and use it as a collateral there to do something else and uh from there you do something else and something else and one of the things for example uh i've seen is that um let's say you you have the normal lending protocols for example uh uh abe and and someone builds on top something else for example uh curve curved at five so basically it's stable coin swaps so people provide their liquidity so what what curve does is that they take that liquidity and deposit into uh into ave to get the the interest rates and also when people are trading stable coins back and forth it generates more trading fees so the liquidity providers are actually grabbing not just the uh trading yields but also the uh avid interest yields and you can just build block by block all the time and you're just hacking and hacking and hacking more yields so actually what happens end of the day uh or end of the cycle is that uh those uh landing protocols that we we have at the moment for example are they compounded and so forth um they will not even give you the best trade like there will be like so many layers on top that actually provide you a more and better yield but end of the day your depo you're depositing on here and it goes all the way top down into the landing protocols or or uh liquidity pools like unit swap or or balancer so that's like the terminology and like that that's just like how you get the liquidity like that's like how you you basically feed feed your your uh your your innovation and the interesting part is the actual innovation like what are you going to do to get more yield and how do you hack and you can do a bunch of crazy stuff you can just look traditional finance and what you could build there um one of the examples is that you could actually build an options um uh kind of like a derivative where when the writer creates an option you put there a collateral that collateral whether it's die or or whatever it can go uh it doesn't need to sit in that smart contract but it goes to to to ave for example and and then you're extracting yield there and then also the writer gets paid the premium that the person who buys the option and that's just example of yield hacking there and i i think like the i like coming up with this idea and brainstorming with someone like that's the the coolest part and most of the yield hacks that i i've seen so far it's just like it just happens like from some kind of like brainstorming discussion um yeah so that's like the the terminology and and uh one important thing about yield hacking is that you also like um before you go to mainnet or anything like that you should really like be cautious on like how secure your code is and all the deletions because like some of the yield hacks i've seen is pretty awesome but then like then again if you are not expecting them to take off you never know like how much liquidity that will be tomorrow so they can go from zero to 100 very fast and it's a kind of like issue in d5 as well that like if you build something very very awesome like you can't stop it if you don't have any kind of like a kill switch just there i mean limitations in your smart contract right um makes a lot of sense excuse me um yeah i i mean i saw mention in the chat you know this when you have increased yield it becomes of a higher risk um maybe we'll jump into another thing that i saw um from ahead of time which was uh you know obviously one of the things about d5 is that it's still early days right and we've seen a lot of kind of interesting um exploits or kind of like uh ways of people having different attack vectors on on defy and and otherwise draining contracts and that sort of thing so you know especially recently we've had a couple kind of high profile hacks uh what are what are your thoughts on on i guess maybe the security of d5 do you think it's like people aren't taking it seriously enough or is it on the users or you know in general what are your thoughts on the later the latest attacks in the space yeah i mean like the whole beginning of the year it was pretty um intense in terms of like i think there was um the the bcx event it almost became like a sport of lacking hacking and kind of like the interesting part is that uh it just it's a kind reminder of how uh mission critical software we're building so i think once what's good to understand in this hackathon is that uh when you go to mainnet uh you're kind of you're not just pushing a piece of code out uh you're actually putting something there which anyone can interact and anyone can participate like the very uh cool part also becomes a bit of a responsibility even in define like we we tend to think about like um it's there anyone can like verify the code and see how how it works but uh it's just basic the mainstream users or the like mainstream everyone aren't developers and if they are they probably will not see everything that uh might be there uh in that code that that might lead to very uncomfortable situations and it it just it it's just very important to understand that uh when you are going to put something that you want to actually scale and and kind of like you want to continue building it it's just very important to try to get as much as diligence there or some sort of limitations because as i said like you might be building something small which is very interesting but tomorrow like if you put it on the main net and becomes like very popular it can have like a millions of dollars locked there in and and then it's kind of like a very difficult situation if something happens so like that's that's something important to understand and also i haven't seen any uh this is kind of weird but i haven't seen any like projects coming to mainnet and just putting this kind of like limitations like how much capital the smart contract can can bear or how much you can deposit on uh one address or like even even like small limitations there or like forced uh insurance purchase or something like that like i haven't seen anything like that but i'm pretty sure like if someone does something like that it gets like a lot of exposure and and that's like uh that's a good idea to to keep in mind oh jelly swab has put limitation that's nice that's cool yeah i think they might be the only ones yeah and they integrated all the day so i might i might go and see how those limitations work the only one i can think of is the the maker supply cap and but that moves very slowly and it's not like it's not like a newer project that's uh trying to decrease risk it's at the opposite end of the spectrum one of the older ones yeah exactly and and the thing with what maker has in our way is kind of like we put a lot of diligence into into the or into the auditing and security in general and and the the the building process and that that's like also very difficult part because like the threshold entering like into d5 is is kind of like uh growing so kind of we all know that smart contract audits are expensive and and kind of like those are something that you need to go to maintenance so it's kind of like difficult thing to cope but uh i i think like healthy limitations and and uh risk disclaimers those those might be very beneficial and i i think like if someone comes up with more that kind of stuff i mean that that's a lot of respect that's a lot of respect from from the whole whole community i would say yeah when i think about um at least like centralized or or like traditional finance like you know it's not unusual for those types of companies to put limits on your accounts in some way right i think anyone who's tried to buy crypto at their bank might have seen that your bank is not so happy with that risk profile half the time right so um what i guess so some of them like some of the limitations are super silly of course like some like super annoying even like that that's the thing like um like like indeed fights it's pretty awesome like like liquidity moves very nicely then when you when you have to go back like i think like crypto people they kind of like suffer of this like when they when they have to go back to interact with their bank or the old banking system or um old platforms like they see like how painful things are and like when you see like how things actually could be done like how d5 works it's like far more efficient and and usually like uh for example i i flew from from our office uh to visit my my family to finland and for some reason my my card was locked and i could pay like my uh uh my uh uh taxi ride so that's that those kind of things happen and you see like it's it's basically limitations don't wrong and and like sometimes it's kind of like uh very annoying but i definitely agree like there's there's like a long long track record and also like uh fraud is a big thing uh like it's not like there's fraud in uh in crypto ward and fishing but it's also like it's very big in the traditional finance and it's just like something that happens to every financial institution and they kind of have this kind of different things and and sometimes the limitation doesn't work well but i think at least we have the chance to build like a very uh good ones like that doesn't like uh uh limit like your actual good usage awesome do you think that um d5 will inspire the traditional finance world to otherwise be you know more competitive in that regard like you know will it be a situation where you know like because there's such a high pressure from the liquidity and like the ease of use of d5 that you know centralized finance and traditional will have to adapt or do you think that d5 is just going to totally eclipse centralized finance and take over yeah i think it really depends how quickly they are like on board because let's say if if d5 can grow in the current like uh way to let's say to 10 to 15 billion like without too much of a uh interference then deep might be like in a size that it's you can't you can't basically minimize it by by putting like regulation that's kind of the upside of the idea of the movement of dfi and especially if like there's more and more institutionals as there are already that are coming into d5 and finding like comfort levels there i i think then it has uh a very pretty good chance but it really depends on the people like how much they will see like but because the only thing i see in in the the old fi i mean the old traditional finance is that it just becomes more difficult than difficult like even even if you see better user interfaces uh let's say like you have money transmitter meters and and or in europe electronic money kind of like service providers and there's less legacy banking system there but end of day the whole system is built a bit wrongly and it suffers from like not like efficient systems so they they can't they can't compete with that kind of technology with a with with what we are doing in d5 so i don't know what's going to happen but but the flipping the the flipping happens when uh those uh all five people will come to defy and start doing the old fight stuff in dfi so let's say if it's uh if it's efficient to trade options features on on on basically centralized products such as oil and you can do it with way larger amount of counterparties without fearing that uh you have to move your collateral or uh fill tons of papers to to join a trading venue under a trading venue i i think then we have then we see a bit of flipping that that people will come from that word to here and i i think at some point um it it might happen even and i think in this hackathon i already saw a few projects that people are building that actually might have the potential to to uh get that kind of audience here and i and i don't blame them because the the way they could actually uh trade or or or or uh interact is way better and with where you transparent market more efficient so i i think that will happen at some point but um i don't know when got it um sorry i think you had a question in the chat do you want to ask it a lot there you go looks good hello okay yeah hi uh stanley uh like uh how do smart contracts really play a good role in terms of like uh black thursday events that happened uh with maker dao and there is no liquidity among uh you know every every uh uh protocols like ibus wire parasite and one inch okay so no one was unable to you know purchase at very low prices and uh keep hold uh keep holding that particular cryptocurrency with them so how do you think like uh smart contracts will play a major role to mitigate these kind of issues when it comes to like uh traders who really love to purchase that low and want to sell it high yeah that's actually interesting uh question because the uh the the black thursday was a kind of like a market stress test for for the d5 protocols and and and kind of like um i see now the way that you you can actually why people are taking like where they're liquidating positions is basically that they get the discount and and then they um they liquidate uh those collaterals in in for example kyber uniswap and the the thing is that uh even though there's liquidity uh there isn't there isn't like enough liquidity so like deepa is heavily reliant upon centralized exchanges so if i will be a liquidator and i i will not be able to liquidate just by uh using fiber or using uniform i would have to liquidate in in a centralized exchange and and the very uh funny thing is that uh in black jersey the gas prices because everyone was moving uh eat and and and do doing transactions on ethereum so even like centralized exchanges had issues because um like when you send their funds i mean it's still in in the ethereum ecosystem and when you're trying to withdraw them and get the liquidity get get back into the liquidation game so if you basically liquidated some heat and you're sending to an centralized exchange to get back some dye or uscc and get back to liquidate your kind of like circulation process uh basically stopped because uh let's say binance also uh throws transactions in certain gas levels uh and and then you basically needed this gas level um cost to to do transactions so uh it was basically an example where you see that um those liquidators are relying on centralized exchanges as well and and even though there's like you could get good discounts but like the system wasn't just efficient because everyone was relying on on automate automation and and no one was expecting that for example the gas price jumped very high and and capital is stuck in different places so in black tourism what was funny kind of like a well i couldn't say funny and but interesting is that um the liquidators i was talking they were basically saying that i want to liquidate i want to get this those like discounts but my money is stuck like in in exchanges and i just can't get out of them and i'm tapped you know i don't have any more like funds to liquidate and i can't go along because they need to sell sell them that you can actually uh get those like discounts so uh that's the centralization thing it's it's it's already very part of it but um i think the real way to get rid of that is just to grow the uh dex economy and and and basically at some point if it's uh big enough like we will like reach us uh like a point where there will be more decentralized liquidity than centralized and i think that will happen soon because uh there will be probably a lot of layer two solutions as well in terms of trading uh i know a lot of um trading um protocols that are actually now looking into layer two because you can get like the the transactions uh to another layer but then you have the collateral in the main uh main main net and and you can basically do efficient trading and still handle the the collaterals in that maintenance so you you're not like burning the whole network so i i think just like the only way to solve this is just to grow the uh d5 economy and it's it's growing pretty nicely i mean uh uh even like a year ago um the the uh kyber for example uni-swap they were pretty uh small in terms of liquidity that there are today or year and a half exactly completely agree but uh but uh like major factor that that will uh stop all the transactions is the gas stream right so due to the gas fee only the uh decentralized exchanges were not able to uh take the new orders or like uh liquidate the orders so uh can you please comment on uh gas free terms like how can uh you know uh we we we be able to build a protocol with uh you know traders uh like uh you mean if you have to hold the asset for a long time yes yes yes so only only thing that is uh that is uh restricting me uh to purchase that cryptocurrency is the gas right so if the if the gas fee was very low then then the transactions will go through and every system will work very fine but uh i don't think like uh both centralization and decentralization uh like or failing uh when it comes to a very volatile market yeah on this yeah i mean i i don't agree that gas is is um something that is is basically reducing the the purchase the the only thing i would say that um that basically when some of this like liquidation happens you just need to ensure that there is basically enough of the discount so if if you pay gas to move things uh whatever you're getting in in this liquidation event you basically get more and i agree that there's an issue in terms of like uh if the gas cost is too much and the loans that you're liquidating basically it doesn't cover the the gas cost it's not worth to liquidate and i see those kind of loans like hanging sometimes and the good thing is they're kind of like uh small loans so as a bigger like uh comparison to the the whole protocols that that this kind of like on small underwater loans are uh it's not a that big big issue but i i think it's this is a question is of like how we get more people into it but i i would say like the the one solution is to get the trading activity into uh layer two so that we have less things going on in layer one and i think that will happen thank you um i we also got a question on the youtube live stream um for thomas uh so i'll read it out from him since he's not here um so i guess sort of also related to things that we need to do for the flipping to happen and overall from for d5 to gain more and more liquidity um do you do you think that i guess two-part question one is uh do you think that right now what we have around erc20 is like do you think that that's enough um for us to kind of get to where we need to be from i guess both the usability perspective and just just the actual protocol itself um and then kind of the follow-up is like do you think that there needs to be a a universal standard of like what a d5 protocol looks like um that's like sort of already audited and sort of like a template that everybody else forks to build on um or do you think that what we currently have where everybody has kind of their own bespoke solutions um is enough and i guess what how do you feel like for both of those things do we need to change them do we need them to adapt for us to really hit um sort of the flipping point yeah i uh that's uh that's the first one is quite uh quite something because like uh the the thing with the rc20 is that um uh you basically have a a is something that everyone agrees upon so so that uh it fits everyone's uh kind of like a needs or or fits their system so it's compatible that's very important otherwise like um if you can't agree on let's say traffic lights and how they should work it's very the result will be very uh not good but uh the they also the thing is that uh i don't think that in in in some level you have to have standardization there like that that basically the liquidity can seamlessly move but i also think that you really need to have like the the innovation is is so important that you kind of sometimes need to go beyond that and try to innovate different kinds of things and and uh perspective and and to get actually like uh new things created and i i think in that way like uh we we definitely like need more standards and also kind of understand like what could be the the very benefits and also have more kind of this standard pitching because it seems that we we do have quite a interesting amount of standards but then there is like not that much pitching around it because like i i think users they will use whatever like you have to use that you can actually interact with different protocols but like for the uh ecosystem like people need to people need to kind of understand like if if you adopt some innovation like what it will mean in long standard and not like argue about like okay is this like is this uh like like how this will differ from the old standard or like is it compatible with the old one or like we should think also like the innovative side like how we could change like the system that we have and and i think that's where the standardization is important and agreeing upon things on the second question like agree agreeing upon things i i think that's something that's that's missing uh there is isn't just like uh any centralized body i mean that could actually like agree upon or anyone hasn't like come together and thinking like okay uh before you go maintenance you have to have this and this audit for this amount of time or but i i think there will be like i've seen for example the consensus um the uh the codify project they have the defy score and they already have some some kind of like suggestions like how like how the auditing process should go like how many auditors how many weeks um and that based on that they give you actually a device core to your protocol so i think there's already tendencies and i the the more we come together and decide things like as a as a big group of people uh and there is this kind of like a soft law the less kind of worry that will be from regulators if the system works but if the system stops working and fails uh continuously then uh the system will get regulation and the regulation will mean that uh you're subject to the same thing that uh basically we have in the uh current financial system and it's basically the ball is on our hands now like do we want that or do we want actually innovate and it requires just everyone everyone's uh effort uh to choose and i think we want to choose but it really wants really needs effort to do this it's gonna take a lot of time and exactly unfortunately i think there will be like mistakes along the way that will force people to learn right yeah and mistakes mistakes are okay because uh we should try things we should like try it and it's part of the innovation as well i mean some things will not fly and so will and we learn more and those mistakes are very valuable lessons maybe um since i don't think there's any more questions in the chat um maybe we'll we'll do one more and then we'll end on a end on another note but uh i guess related to this you know what are your thoughts around like governance in the space right like you mentioned that like you know codify exists there's sort of like a centralized unit for judging um you know d5 scores uh obviously maker dow is sort of by definition um you know a dow compound just released their uh their their protocol around this you know what what are your thoughts around around this sort of thing and do you think that that's the way forward to like proving to regulators that you know we are self-regulating that we are you know thinking about the right issues and that sort of thing yeah yeah i think um especially when you're building like open source software and when you're trying to when you're in an ecosystem where where basically uh everyone kind of has control and and there isn't like trust there's there's need somehow to change things or or decide upon things uh and it's not just like changing code but just basically any kind of like a sentiment and i i i think the governance is is the way to do it i i think the uh token token based governance is is something very uh workable some people think about it that it's kind of like not democratic because there's a lot of whales and i definitely agree upon that it's not democratic but it doesn't mean that it's not working in terms of uh governance because like i compare like more like d5 protocol governance to let's say uh uh stock board like well let's say like um governance of companies we're basically governed by shares and and the board and and so forth and and the more people have like stake in the system like the more they they actually want to govern the system as well and that's why we basically have this kind of like um big stakeholders but i i think um if the system is is based that there is always like this big stakes there it's kind of like a difficult in terms of like dynamics where you actually want to distribute the uh the governance and even non-token based system have governance if you think about for example uh bitcoin and and also i mean ethereum miners like the the system is built on decentralization right but uh by design by practice you basically have a lot of centralization there and the way that like capitalism works that um the more you put funds into the system whether it's like the capitalistic system of where we're living like actual living or this decentless systems you basically get more uh power power out of it kind of like as a compounding uh interest all the time so by nature like uh it's extraction of uh value from a small group of people to people who have large stakes in in the system and it's it's a kind of like a problem but uh the good thing about uh in d5 is that because the systems are transparent you could actually limit this kind of a flow from uh small like like when you have very decentralized system and and small stakeholders large groups small stakeholders going to that way you can actually make conditions that that this kind of a group who might be for example active users that because of their activeness they actually uh they also get that uh particular power and they get the power power to govern and then you can basically stop this like massive movements of of capital to big stakeholders and i think not many uh protocols have yet understand that but uh i i i think not many have done it i think everyone probably understands it because like we obviously know that there is whales around everywhere like in the ecosystem but i think the first protocol that does it uh very well we will see like actual very very democratic governance even though like you're governing something that resembles uh financial governance like uh company governance and that will change a lot of things in a good way cool um awesome great so just to show a bit basically that obvi is coming also with a uh token based governance and and there's going to be some interesting mechanics as well so those who are uh interested in in governance and following uh what's happening now in d5 like really recommend to stay tuned awesome sorry for that uh cool um yeah so i think that's basically all the questions just have one more to wrap up on um but just before that um you know in general some some stuff about for hack money um just that everybody uh watching right now has has an idea of what's to come you know uh most importantly right now is you know next week we're gonna be doing a demo day so if you're working on something very cool and you want to kind of show off your halfway progress so far awesome opportunity to do that and then of course next week we'll be doing more check-ins with all the team members to make sure that how your progress is going and you know connecting you to relevant people like if you're working on ave for instance with wistani or anybody else from their team um so that's that's the kind of what to come um so you know with that you know study thanks so much for your uh your participation here and your thoughts you know i i really enjoyed this conversation and i'd love for if you could end on maybe you know what what is maybe your favorite project in the space that's that's not ave or maybe a small project um that that you don't think gets enough credit like what do you what are your thoughts on you know maybe some of the up-and-comings that are that are working on really interesting problems right now yeah so this is the moment i need to shield someone yeah this is the shell timer yeah um i think one of the um well there there's couple one i would say uh pai dao is pretty interesting so basically you can trade indexes that's something like they i i showed them not that much about like just just for shilling but but basically because they have very uh sympathetic theme and i i think that's even more important like i because i know that someone will always build the the the stuff that's that needs to be built someone would build ave and the next other and and so forth but it's it's the people who like are important like the human compassibility you know like that's that's the like that that like i really uh uh respect uh so definitely that's that's something and and those guys are pretty uh pretty amazing in terms of like what they're doing and and also like uh when when you talk with them so they they get all the credit uh then i would say other interesting stuff would be well i really like uh pull together uh token sets i like them a lot uh i like compound a lot and and from other older protocols yeah not much that yeah i i think everyone is doing like very important stuff um but uh yeah awesome yeah that's that's that's that's my shows for for today sounds good all right cool thank you so much johnny and thanks everybody who came and attended this i'm looking forward to seeing what you guys build um and we'll catch you guys all on discord thanks thanks everyone thank you stani that was awesome thank you see everybody in discord
