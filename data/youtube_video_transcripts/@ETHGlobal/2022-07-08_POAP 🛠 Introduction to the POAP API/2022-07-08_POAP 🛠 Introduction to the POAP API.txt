[Applause] [Music] welcome to the next workshop in hack fs um if you're joining the pull up introduction to the pull-up api workshop with nisita tapata you are at the right place um this is a 30 minute workshop um it's streamed onto youtube and recorded there later if you want to get the content afterwards it'll be posted shortly after feel free to enter your questions in the chat here or we can make this interactive and you can just sort of chime in on your audio if you have a pertinent question you'd like to ask as the workshop proceeds again it's 30 minutes and with that i will open it up to nisita to begin okay thank you really appreciate it uh super excited to be here and share a little bit more about co-op and you know um hopefully looking forward to some really cool ideas coming out of this um the way i wanted to structure this conversation today um is you know just talk about generally what co-op is and kind of work our way through and you know if there's any questions um obviously feel free to chime in there so in terms of what co-op is co-op is a digital collectible minted um in celebration of life life's remarkable moments you know co-ops are really gifts from issuers to collectors and issuers could be each of us individually it could be teams it could be organizations much more um i think most folks might have interacted with clubs if not i would highly encourage you know giving it a try um just to understand the mechanics and that sort of stuff um i'll sort of go into the you know how does it really work behind this uh behind the scenes and you know i i like to break it into like two parts in my mind and you know part one is there's two key main personas or um yeah maybe let's talk about a personalize um one is an issuer whether it's an individual or an organization who generally is the individual or entity that creates and distributes the collapse so basically these are folks that would say hey i'd love to be able to create this plot because i want to be able to celebrate this whether it's because it's a birthday it's an event it's a concert it could be any number of things that are considered really precious and memorable and that's really um how you know i would think about an issuer in terms of that persona and the second one is a collector um i think most of us well at least i would hope that everybody's had a chance to be a collector at some point um we're usually on the receiving end of it um in that you know where they're uh gift procedures or the co-op receivers and collectors um generally it's an individual well not generally mostly it's an individual a human being um that's kind of the easy way to think about it and how i think of it anyways and part two and this kind of gets into the details i think of it like behind the curtain view of like what exactly happens um when somebody decides hey i'd love to be able to create a collab or create an event and all the way um in between to someone being able to get receive a pull-up at the end of the day a couple of different pieces and uh i hope you're going to be patient with my creative little drawing um i was trying to figure out i'm like what's the best way to explain this i figured you know a doodle is always helpful uh and a little bit of chicken scratch to go with that so first of all an issuer would create an event that would be an individual or an http however that is and the events can be created in this case because we're talking the api specifically actually you can do that through our api um the second piece would be you know that what happens once that request gets question is um it actually you you would be sorry the request then gets to you know our plots curation body um who actually receive uh and review each of these requests and to make sure you know okay this is aligned with our overall ethos and values and a couple of other things and then they'll make a decision once that decision is made and that review is complete um provided that it's you know it's approved uh the issuer being you know let's say you or i that that would have created this event would get an uh response with you know here's a bunch of co-apps that you can now just read to your friends and family or community or you know folks that you want to share this memory with um that's kind of the cyclical nature of how i think with it and that's when once the issuer gets those lists of prolapse they are then able to share that with the collector as almost like a gift and there's multiple ways of how you can or how one can go about distributing these um and we'll talk a little bit about that in the next one so whoops ah there we go so there's multiple different distribution methods um the simplest way i generally like to think of it is i like to break them into two main buckets one is you know an ability to really be able to distribute each of those collapse again think of it as a gift like literally a box that you're thinking okay who do i want to give this to and you know every person that walks into my birthday party um and i met them and i said hey you know i've greeted them whatever the case is and i would hand them a goodie bag almost like that because you're a couple of things are happening when you're doing that you're a validating that they were actually there before you give it to them so that's the unique and single access bucket i think of it and the second bucket is what i'm calling you know the general axis um to think about that a little bit we'll kind of jump into the next slide so this one i think we saw the first one which you see the images of you know individual people with boxes giving it to individual collectors um that box back to them oh so it's a one-to-one relationship as opposed to the general access the analogy i like to think of is like you know accessing a factory of course so let's say i have a factory or a room uh full of plaques and or gifts or you know goodie bags and i'm then saying okay you know folks everybody that came to my birthday party if you go to this address and you enter this pin number in you can go in and kind of self-serve like you know pick up your your your goodie bag or your gift and you can go on about your very way that works in some cases and in some cases not so much depending on the you know the trust of the community you're dealing with because in some cases let's say for any number of reasons i decide hey i want to share this information with my friend what happens then is although they weren't actually at the event although they weren't part of this memory and this experience they can still get one um so that that's not really in line with i think the type of experience we want to have so i um i wanted to call those two different distribution methods because it'll sort of come up at a later point in terms of you know thinking about quality of how do we do this in a in a thoughtful and a mindful way that sort of pieces but i think it's always important to kind of starting with the basics and we can kind of build on top of that so that's my uh general i'm going to say you know presentation from this perspective and i'm i'm kind of going to go over and talk through most of the next bit of stuff so if anyone has any questions feel free to it's a great time to um there's also a bunch of links that were also provided so i would also highly encourage reading those um kind of getting a little bit more specifically into the api um so our api if you're interacting with the api honestly you don't need to worry about if you're compatible with a specific chain or not or any of that it's very straightforward at least i like to pick that and i'd love to get feedback in terms of that's not the case another thing i would say is as we were talking about events and pull-ups i think one thing it's there to call out here is what is the structure so when there's uh an event so let's say that birthday event i was talking about so the relationship between one event is one event too many co-ops so it's a one-to-many so if you're trying to build out certain use cases example being you want to do token gating as an example then you you probably want to token it at the event level because then it allows you to be able to token gate for all of the the individual collapse within that collection that's kind of how i would think of it um and i'm trying to go through my notes real quickly another one i think it's fair to call out is and you'll see all of this in the api documentation uh but i'll call it out anyways is the token ids are a six-digit alphanumeric um aspect so i think just be mindful of that because you once you get a return of the event of ids you probably are wondering what the heck is this so we also call them like your hashes that's also another term that's used uh to refer to these token ids in our documentation and a couple of other things in terms of distribution because i think generally again contextual not specifically the api necessarily but i think this is where there's an opportunity um is as you're thinking about the different use cases or ideas you'd like to build out distributions is one of the things that i think is equally important like all the different parts within the ecosystem primarily because how you distribute will also deliver you know are we being mindful are we being thoughtful um are we just kind of giving people access to that general factory approach are we you know thinking through um hey this individual was actually there and we're validating that and then we're sharing that so there's there's some opportunity there to play with in terms of you know examples are maybe you know um or certain examples we've seen i should say are uh like a discord bot or like a twitter bot that validates okay you know person a was actually there and because they did x y and z and therefore you know we're going to be able to allow them to have this this pull up as an example so that's on the distribution side of things and some other ideas just a one to share to get the ball rolling so to speak is um new token delivery methods we just talked about you know distribution whether it's um on whatsapp or telegram or signal or any number of communication channels really so it would be really interesting to see something like that or real-time on-chain analytics um activity that would be really cool as well um another thing would be like the social charter explorer so for example finding people with similar co-apps so in my mind i would think of it as um i don't know let's say i went to x y and z events in in the past on whether they're real life and or um you know virtual exercises and let's say i collected x number of um co-ops i would love to be able to meet someone that actually has been at the same place at the same time whether it's virtual or in irl because think about like the chances that you and another person or you and a group of people were there but never actually had a chance to connect with each other and would you be interested i mean i personally would be really really curious to kind of get to know them and you know because maybe if if we've already had so many things in commons maybe there's a quite a high likelihood i might actually like this individual and would want to be friends with them right so i think those are some that kind of come top of mind um you know other plugins any sort of things a couple of other things that come to mind is like treasure hunt so whether that's um like gamifying certain things and being able to offer things or you know location aware system so if it's a nfc approach or bluetooth wi-fi other things that you can leverage to be able to identify you were there to prove that you know you're actually there not just because you clicked on a link but in addition to clicking on a link you were there because of x y and z um i think those things are kind of interesting and neat to explore a little further um distributions also within the metaverse i think that's a pretty broad um kind of category in itself there's lots of options there but obviously there's tons of room for more i'm gonna pause really quickly to see if there's any questions okay no questions awesome and no questions in the chat at the moment but everyone feel free put them in the chat okay all right there they are um yeah i mean you could do a plot for a workshop like this because you were part of this exercise and i mean it you know that's a great example uh what will we find in api um so it's documentation.collab.tech so that's the actual url or you can if you go to the po app discord page it's also there it's listed there it's also listed on the um global like the events page or rather the i don't know what the right term is like um where it actually shows what the prices is in the structure and all of those pieces it's also there as well so currently uh collects are minted to like one contract i don't know if that's what the question is okay any other questions if not i can kind of go into a little bit of describing what the uh document oh well can you expand on that in terms of uh can we have cross chain collapse so coops are actually minted on gnosis today however you can actually migrate them to mainnet i'm not sure if that answers the question i have so if not please do help okay awesome thank you girl can we actually say absolutely yes thank you that was actually one of the things i wanted to uh so in order to access our api we oh actually you know i think i can type here so uh documentation.lab.tech sorry not docs um there we go that's um maybe the other one will also direct folks um can we access the api for hackathon yes so the way we we've set it up is so folks need to have access or folks need access to an api key to access our our api and the way we're going to do this is um once folks have registered for the pull-up x hackathon or the club's aspect of it within the poep channel we'll actually distribute the api keys there so then folks will have the api keys and you kind of run with it but i would encourage if you're if you're kind of curious and will want to get into it um take a look at the documentation because it you might have other questions even after this workshop and if so please feel free to engage us and you know we're happy to kind of dig a little bit deeper um and share more information one of the things that also it's probably worth calling out within the documentation is you'll notice that there's an area within the documentation that basically says something to the effect of like popular flows so that actually shows you step by step of some of the use cases that you can really use almost like a in a step-by-step way obviously um so it'll say hey you need an api key or if you need something additional it'll talk about it right there it will also say here's the exact point you need to use for this specific type of use case but by by all means you're not limited to those use cases feel free to explore all the other use cases under um api references in the same documentation on the top right uh part because what that will give you is you can go explore all the different things you'll probably come up with a lot more use cases that we were able to think about today and that's what we're really excited about any other questions if not i will talk a little bit about so api also has the public keys as well as a few of them are private um so the public sorry not public keys so api has public endpoints and protective endpoints or secure endpoints so the the public endpoints are the ones that you will be able to access using the api uh keys that will be provided from the discord channel um in order if you find that as you're exploring your use case and your idea you find that you know some of the end that you would like to use and those are protective endpoints just honestly reach out to us because we can help uh provide you the authentication tokens which will help you then get the bearer token to have access to the protected endpoints because the protected endpoints are are have some sensitivity associated to it so we we sort of have them as like a separate category almost in order for you to access that we we just need you to have access to the um auto gains that will give you the better token and this is also documented in the um so there's an example within the our documentation of how like once you get let's say the client id once you get the audience and once you get the client secret how do you actually then get a bearer token there's an example of that as well our protected endpoint api and public documentation yes they are um so there's actually no delineation in once you look at the documentation there's actually no delineation that says this is public or protected but one way you can find out is there is a uh there is a part on the right-hand side once you're in the documentation that allows you to do um like a trial sort of speak and then that's where it'll say what you need if it says you need a bearer token that's referring to that endpoint being a protected endpoint and therefore you would need to request for odd tokens what is the minimum criteria to be eligible for the price it's a great question um i think um it depends on which price because there's multiple options um i think the criteria is there is a working solution that we're able to test down and you know that's kind of the starting point but obviously i think we can probably share more details around that um in the discord channel uh is pull up open source yeah it's it's completely open well uh the public endpoints are completely open today and you can pretty much go in and you know play around with the api github repo that's a great question let me actually follow up if it's okay i'll follow up in the um the discord uh sorry discord channel with uh with that but we have found that you know um most of the information is available within our api documentation but i'll definitely follow up on that one specifically just to make sure we're providing that any other folks okay this is a very cooperative crowd i really appreciate it folks thank you for your time um i'm trying to think through if there's any other cool things that we've seen um so when you go into the popular use cases that's that's a really interesting place ah somebody found it thank you ruben save me tongue i appreciate that um i think in terms of the popular use cases obviously those are pretty straightforward but i would i would generally say you know go for it try like your wildest imagination you possibly can things i literally can't even think about that's what i'm excited to see and honestly i think it'll be a really really interesting thing to see how it sort of evolves and what sort of ideas bubble up yeah absolutely i mean you can you can share the questions now but later works completely financing uh so happy to um my dms are open as well and or within the uh co-op discord channel we're all there we're happy to answer any questions any other folks one maybe topic worth kind of calling out is um so we do have a fair bit of like challenge i think this is generally everybody not just specifically with farming and bots so if there's any ideas or anyone thinking about that actively because this is the thing that like gets you excited and you're super passionate about we'd love to see those as well because i think there's there's a lot of room to find really cool ways to you know not just a captcha or you know the the stuff that we've seen for a while but things that you can creatively think about that would really help us ensure the quality of the ecosystem i think that would be something that there's a little bit more to explore in that area look at the next question so how does the co-op ecosystem generate revenue if they're free to mint and exchange from what i understand i have a few from events and i barely know what to do with them okay um step one what to do with them so once you i mean i think the initial starting point just like myself i think most of us here collect collapse because there is um like a memory associated to it really um as opposed to like having a monetary value assigned to it i think that at least that's why most people um generally collect them because they're really cool collectibles um having said that the other really cool thing is um some of the applications that are well call it like applications call it something else but basically there's more fun and utility that's actually enabled once you get your co-op so i'll give you an example um so let's say i went to uh support my favorite artist who was just starting out i was on you know i was there to support them on their day one sort of exercise and five years later or maybe a year later or maybe even two months later they they blow up and you know they're completely um at the top of their uh trajectory so to speak and they're you know doing some really really great stuff but they might decide hey i would really love to be able to um support and or you know reward the folks that were there on my day one because you know like we like it was a journey i i'm just grateful for the folks i've been supporting me all the way through to get to where i am today so they can actually do that because they can in theory token use it so let's say if this artist was doing um apparel for the sake of the conversation and what they can do and let's say they i'm just picking a random platform so let's say they have a shopify store for the sake of the conversation what they can actually do is they can set it up such that um anybody that has that pull-up from their like you know early days if they've collected it so cat some of the cool stuff that you might have collected um you know that maybe two months from now or at some point but actually enable you to get like 15 off on their merch store i'm just using that as an example by the way um or it might actually give you access to like seasons passes for something again like it really depends on how an artist or a community or a company might want to be able to reward their communities um it's a really cool way to you know stay engaged and stay involved with folks and your community even after like you know some point in time has elapsed because having a co-op what it allows is it actually lays the foundation for an individual to be able to uh have access to a continuation of that moment because i was part of this on a specific point in time specific time in place and that means if i was at a concert maybe that's it that's an example so i was at a concert and you know there's an extension of it there's an after party um and they're completely in two different places but if i got a pull-up at this concert when i go to this um this after party all i need is like my my app to show because i mean there's proof of attendance it's proof of attendance of this concert as an example i would you know that would allow me access whether it's directly uh walking in or whether it's uh being able to uh download an invitation how whatever that looks like you know that flow could be different but it fundamentally enables you access to a continuation of that moment that you've already had and that you were part of hopefully that's helpful okay uh i'll quickly dip on um um so i'm gonna read this out so then i'm not just looking quiet uh cool things for the response haven't looked at the docs um but are the plo apps searchable by looking at these wallets do co-op addresses have unique identifiers they're they're on each wallet absolutely so if you um so another cool thing i will call out is if you are searching for let's say somebody's wallet you can search for it by their public wallet address or their ens and you would be able to see the co-ops provided that whatever platform you're on allows you to be able to see products so if they have an integration already an existing integration and i'll name you know name drop somebody uh so rainbow wildlife is an example they allow you to actually see uh native co-ops within the wallet so once you have your um each wallet connected you can actually see your pull out collection which is really really neat so there's a couple of others out there that do similar things so yes absolutely and even in terms of um awesome one other thing i'll call out so if let's say you have someone you're trying to get um to get a pull up so you they don't even have to have a wallet on like you know when they're trying to actually get on board to use it or collecting a pull-up because you can do that using your public uh wallet address or you can do that with your uh enf and or your email address we understand that you know folks are at different parts of their journey and we want to make it easy we don't want to add too much friction to allow people to still be able to collect a cool collectible that they have a memory association to so they can definitely do that using an email however at any point in time they're not actually minting it using an email they're just registering it using an email and once they at some later point in time whatever that may be or whatever that may be they decide hey i'd love to be able to actually you know now set up a wallet and they can totally have all of the uh co-ops they have registered to their email go into their wallet they can totally do that um next question do you already see a qr code in a pull-up um i'm not completely sure what that means but i'm gonna guess and maybe you can type up a follow-up if what i'm thinking is incorrect um so if i'm trying to provide or offer a pull-up to uh somebody because they've met me or you know we were part of some experience and i was the issuer then can i do that using a qr a qr code the answer is yes uh i think it means the qr code inside the r image oh interesting i've actually not seen that just just to scan and verify someone reached a place for instance yes so let's say in order for me to distribute a co-op absolutely you can just have a qr code there's actually two types i would say there's the static qr code which i mean as the name sounds static um so you can scan it and like you know the they cure sorry a pull-up from it or the other is the dynamic that one i would generally recommend more so and the reason i say that is because even if somebody wanted to you know like i scanned my first uh or let's say there's three of us in a line and the first one scans the qr code and by the time the second person comes there's a new qr code and the second third person comes another one pops up because it just expires it's almost like a rotation well it's not rotation but rather it's a cyclical thing so then you it's a net new uh qr code that just gets generated for every specific mint but i have not seen a qr code maybe some of you folks seen it in the pull-up itself but i imagine that's kind of interesting to expect that okay explore awesome um well there you go yeah one thing i will quickly call out with regards to artwork is we love unique artwork so feel free to get as creative as you would like and your imagination can take you because that is part of a collectible you want it to represent something meaningful for you at the end of the day so thank you thanks charles i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly um i'm also excited about the collab project that you guys are all open to being part of so very excited to get to know everybody over the next two and a half weeks and kind of see you know what are some really cool ideas that you know a lot from here all right i think that puts us at time but um thank you very much nisita um and again you know the plot team can be reached in their own um channels and also in hack fs in the discord so reach out always consider this the start of conversations and interactions and questioning um good luck to everyone uh during the hackathon and thank you very much nisita for a great workshop thanks everybody you
