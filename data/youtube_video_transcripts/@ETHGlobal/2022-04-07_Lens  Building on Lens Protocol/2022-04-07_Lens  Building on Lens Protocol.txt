our dow hacks workshop day one uh we have david here from lens we'll be doing a workshop on building on lens protocol so david will be taking questions in the zoom chat so if you have any drop it in there um and he'll try to answer them throughout the call but if not um he'll definitely address them at the end of the workshop and with that being said um i'll hand the mic off to you david awesome thanks anna uh so my name's david i'm a product i'm a social product product manager for social products over here at ave companies which includes lens protocol uh and super excited to give you guys an overview of the lens protocol as well as some ideas on things you can build with it and how to work with our released recently released lens api um so why did we build lens protocol i think before we can even understand what's going on in the system we need to know how we got here uh we all know that web 2 social media is broken you know we're trapped into using these platforms that we don't really necessarily like they they have all of our data they're selling it we're not really getting much out of it and there's three kind of big problems the first user data is not portable i can't bring my videos that i've posted on tick tock over to youtube or instagram reels or any other service i'm kind of locked where i'm at and if they choose to kick me off a platform i can't then take my audience take my content with me that's a huge risk for creators networks are selling my data and i'm seeing zero upside for facebook you are the product you're not the user they're their users are advertisers um and that's kind of who they design around first and foremost and lastly the data is centralized uh when it centralizes controlled by a singular entity uh we've all seen how that's turned out um tons of hacks and the last thing i need is more spam email uh to to go through and so with web3 social we're bringing the power back to the users we're empowering creators uh and and we're doing it uh through lens protocol it's a new protocol to allow developers to build social apps tools and other applications uh on a composable decentralized social graph that allows you the developer to focus on user experience and building a great application rather than user acquisition and building up this graph the lens protocol for the for the creator side is going to empower you to own the links between your community and this is going to be able to bring your content from platform to platform allowing you to monetize everywhere now i think this is really key we're going from companies owning data to users and creators owning their data and having it interplay with the rest of web3 you can bring all your nfts you can connect out to all the d5 applications and everything else that's yet to be invented and the way this works is our social protocol ecosystem revolves around an nft infrastructure layer uh we make heavy use of nfts this isn't like the board ape nfts these are nfts as powerful smart contracts we have a profile nft represents your profile uh it looks pretty similar to working with ens or unstoppable if you've worked with the of those before i'll have my profile nft let's say it's at david um it's got some metadata that i can put in so i can say you know this links to my twitter this links to my youtube this is my ethereum address but it's got two kind of unique things to it it's got a publications array that gets dynamically updated it's append only with new publications publications being content um that can be text mp3 audio visual a podcast anything uh lens doesn't care where this is stored it can be stored in ar weave ipfs ceramic uh or again storage solutions yet to be invented um additionally you can control your follow logic with a follow module we're gonna get into what that is later following builds the social graph and we represent following by follow nfts so if i want to go follow uh if i wanted to follow anna i would you know do the transaction and if that follow succeeds i'm going to get minted a follow nft that's going to say this is the end of follow nft i'm follower number one so i have id one um and uh it might have other metadata i might say that this was uh created by this specific app along with a signature to show authenticity it might say that this represents a bi-directional follow something like a facebook friendship compared to a unidirectional twitter follow uh you have other data in there this is a premium follow um you know represents that i paid for it as opposed to a free one um this follow nft contract also has built-in governance power with delegation uh this allows me to plug into ave governor uh open zeppelin or compound governor or snapshot to build social dowse and social dao strategies um so as a creator i can pull my my following um you know one of our engineers josh does really great solidity content on youtube videos you know he could poll his lens audience and say should i be making more videos on on odd iv3 or should i instead go over uh stein said go over the um go over the uh you know maybe alchemix v2 and he can take a proper download or conversely you could actually have uh you know no need to do a social token to organize a group we could have uh the profile nft live inside of a smart contract and a dow vote occurs and it grants somebody the ability to follow that dow that profile them joining the dao so we can have these kind of on-chain social now organized around a graph and interaction as opposed to a social token lastly we have post comments and mirrors um so we can uh you know we can um there's three types of publications a standard post that's just a reference to some content uh a comment which is the same data structure as a comment as a retweet with quote um so that would be i'm referencing another piece of content and creating my own on top of it and the last is amir which is our version of retweet which is just a reference to another piece of content all of these can be fully monetized so if i post a great image let's say of my last trick to london um i can say hey this can be minted 10 times into its own nft and if you mirrored it and you got somebody collected it off the mirror minted it off the mirror there's a referral fee in order to you know encourage good creation uh curation uh there's a question in the chat about why we decided to make only uh profile and follow nfts as opposed to one for each publication a publication can turn into an nft if it if it's collected uh but the idea is that all publications live inside the profile uh so the profile is your entire feed and and all of your uh all of your publications are there you know we don't necessarily have nft zoning other nfts but we allow publications to be minted into nfts standalone entities using a thing called a collect module and that actually flows really great into how you can extend lens on the smart contract level uh so i spoke a little bit about modules and we have three types and i think they're really powerful uh modules allow you to bring in arbitrary logic into lens the first one is the follow module this is attached on the profile so i'm david v.e the wallet and i own the at david profile and i may set a follow module a bit of logic that will run some program and return a boolean answer zero or one and if it's one the profile nft gets minted if it's zero we revert the transaction um what are some things i can do here well i could have the basic situation the freemen anybody can mint unlimited number of follow nfts uh from for my profile uh i could have a paid version so i could say you have to send me five matic um in order for me to mint you a follow nft um i could say mint me five matic take thematic deposit into ave and then put the a tokens in my account and then mint the nft and then the last one is a true one that somebody in our community built as follow logic charge 5matic for the follow figure out the amount of gas being used convert it to carbon credits buy bct from toucan and retire it and then send the five the remaining matic to my address making the entire action carbon neutral um arbitrary logic is arbitrary logic you can plug into d5 or any other smart contract and that's just for follows uh reference and collect are going to live on the per-publication basis uh reference is if another post or publication wants to reference a given post i'm commenting on your post or mirroring it in order for that transaction to succeed it has to clear the reference module linked to that post um the a way to think about this is if i publish a tweet today i like to use twitter as an example we're all familiar with it if i publish a tweet today and i can set who's allowed to reply to it think of that as your reference module i can decide who is allowed to comment on my tweet or retweet my tweet my publication and again i can do any type of logic with people who say i can only comment on this post if i hold two board apes where i would hold these specific board apes number 62 128 and 4072. um i can say that you have to have more than 32 fwb in a comment on my post to be a member of the community um again i can also do payments as well um collect is the mint functionality that's what turns a publication into a standalone nft so here's where i could define any arbitrary mint logic i could say here's the white list of who's allowed to mint my posts into standalone nfts here's how much it costs i could do a bonding curve i can do an auction i can really do anything and i can also specify what happens to the output funds a really cool example that a developer in our community did um you know 99.9 of all nfts are sold in stable coins uh us dollar stable coins or eth um they created one called alternate currency collect so if i'm a creator in europe i can specify that i want my uh i want my uh nft or my publication to be for sale for 50 usdc and then as soon as the mint occurs it will use the 0x api to auto swap into euros and put that in my wallet and you can actually even cause the price on the sell side to be variable given the exchange rate at a given time so that's collect and the overall goal with lens that i like to get at is we're really trying to foster a broad diverse and evolving social ecosystem everything is fully composable and transferable on chain that means that more than just us being able to plug in through these modules to existing ethereum you know existing evm data other applications can plug into us um can plug into your social following um you know i can say you can only access this stat dap or this dao if you follow the dao or uh if you've engaged in a certain positive way or we can start doing snapshot strategies that reward contributors and dows for how they engage as opposed to necessarily what tokens they have and we can now have some quantitative means of of doing that on chain as i mentioned follower nfts have built in governance mechanisms uh and that that can be really interesting in terms of building these new social dials a special interest here for for dowhack users can take their graph to whatever experience they want to engage in uh i can take my content between any front end built on top of lens i can take my following to any front and built on top of lens the ecosystem builds itself we called it lens after the lens clearance plant which fertilizes the own soil it grows in to encourage other plants to grow around it and that's how we view lens apps each one in the ecosystem helps the ecosystem at large by bringing in more data and more integrations and more ways for you to share your content and as a creator for you to have more distribution and for developers the key sale here is you can focus on the experience on the front end and leave the network effects network building up to the protocol there have been so many times we've seen great innovations in social tech only for that company to fail to capture the market due to not having a strong social graph we can even look as recently as the past couple of years clubhouse walked so twitter spaces could run clubhouse couldn't grow fast enough um we can go even way back in the day uh and say that you know meerkat walked so periscope could run so that twitch could fly um we don't really remember those previous two experiments as much because they couldn't capture the graph the same way that later ones did more than just that we also have an api um we built our own api it's the same tools that we actually use internally at ave when we are building a front end that we've said we're with that is coming um why did we build it well social media is a long game and and we want to make sure that the developer ecosystem has the ability for people to build who don't know solidity uh i i think that's that's pretty critical um you know we've exposed uh lens protocol itself is going to be open and decentralized um we want to make sure that people are going to be able to build anything they want on it um with it with a with a more familiar setting um so what is in the lens front end uh api you don't have to worry about indexing or querying data or reorgs or the speed of fetching data we're built on polygon it's a must much faster block chain you have to deal with deal with reorg sometimes with the 200 blocks in depth um you know the graph is an option but the graph isn't necessarily the greatest at real-time query and for a social app you need to have that real-time responsiveness we have an api to help with that you don't have to worry about pre-filling contract data or validating it especially if you're using with sig functions to do meta transactions or a cleaner ui ux um we're using a web 2 style interface to allow people interact with the protocol so if you are familiar with a regular graphql api something like maybe twitter or facebook's you're going to feel right at home with the lens api the entire graph is queryable our documentation at docs.lens.dev is super great and all of our backend devs are regularly checking the discord and we'll build new features on the fly if you need them and the key thing there is there's really no huge learning curve just focus on what you want to build and you can build it really quick no need to know blockchain or solidity it helps but at the end of the day you know if you know how to use the facebook or the twitter apis or another graphql api building with lens is going to be really fast and that's part of our vision is to let people build applications um they're going to use the power of blockchain and the power of web 3 to create great features that an app should be able to win on its feature set alone not just marketing itself as web 3. and that's really what we're trying to do here with the lens api ideas for things to build uh you can build great front ends if you're looking for inspiration the community manages a front end at lenster so i think that's alpha.lenster.xyz that's a way to play around with the social graph you can make extensions to the protocol think about different ways you can use modules to build on top maybe you want to build the ability for subscriptions that would mean you know send the follow nft to a smart contract uh that you know has some has some logic uh requiring a recurring payment um maybe you want to integrate a defy app you've built uh into collects so uh you know incoming creator money can be deposited and increasing your tvl or really kind of push this experience of social dowse what does it mean for a shared profile to exist how do we do on-chain governance via a social graph and really really think about moving away from the current model of we just have a social token that's an erc20 um i think those are some great areas to explore and i'm really looking forward to what you guys end up building and the last thing i want to add you know i think stein says this a lot the biggest thing we learned when we built the ave protocol is you're never building a loan you're building with an ecosystem with a community lens is on testnet and we've kept it on testnet for a while because we really want to hear from the community we really want to hear the feedback what features do you want in the contracts what features do you want on the api you know we're hoping to obviously freeze and go to main net the next month or so um but we did a hackathon you know we just had a hackathon previously with the global we're we're here with this next one we actually entirely revised large parts the contracts and launched a brand new test net for those features based off feedback we got from hackers in the previous hackathon and we'd really love to hear from you especially if you're building on top you know what are we missing what should we add and where else should we go if there's any questions i'd love to take them if not happy hacking everyone feel free to come off me if you want to ask your questions live i would i could add a few things i guess key places to find us uh lens.dev uh kind of has the overview docs.lens.dev has some incredible great information on how to get building and if you go to the discord uh tons of different uh places to get help um our developers are always there uh the url mentioned for where to get a uh to get it to get a look i believe it's alpha.lenster.xyz is a community run front end um keep in mind we just relaunched uh testnet 3 literally last night based off a ton of feedback we got from each global hackers and we'll probably do another test that based off the feedback we get from from you guys in the community to make sure that we're really building something that works for everybody not just uh not just the suits you know what we're building cool we'll give it another minute for any other questions that you guys might have if you guys have any questions on where i think we're a bunch of us are in the uh the eighth global discord i'm at davidev dot eth um same on on twitter and on other means of communications happy to answer questions or provide help in any way um happy hacking everyone awesome well we'll end things here then thank you so much david for taking the time to do this uh workshop with the dial hacks hackers and yeah definitely excited to see what you guys build especially with lens um and with that being said we have a idea brainstorming session happening in about an hour so if you guys are free definitely join that if you want to help get some ideas for this weekend's hackathon and otherwise i hope everyone has a great rest of your thursday or friday depending on where you
