[Music] [Applause] [Music] you you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] attention everyone the closing ceremonies for each Singapore will begin in the metro room main stage in just a few minutes so please make your way to the Metro room for the closing ceremonies thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] welcome to the closing ceremony hello how are you guys feeling you all look very fresh tired fresh beautiful actually I slept here I haven't left Suns getting here so I sympathize very nice uhm I think there's act like it there's a there's something we want to do before we start we did this last time in San Francisco we're gonna do a little selfie with the audience sorry and then I'm gonna tweet it because Evans not allowed on Twitter anymore we don't we love web - all right I think maybe you guys can put your hands up and make some noise because you'll see that on the photo one two three yeah there we go nice thank you guys all right so you've made it to the end this event was wonderful I don't know if you guys enjoyed the food as much as I did I really really liked it thank you to the caterer men um eath Singapore effin amazing very very cool as mentioned I like this graphic I promise not to offend anyone this time with a badass bomb yeah all right so Southeast Asia's first aetherium hackathon that's amazing 250 attendees actually we got more like 300 27% was students and 20 amazing sponsors now out of that there have been 44 projects submitted and we got to see some of them today and lastly there are six finalists six finalists so judges looked at all of the projects today picked six finalists it's in no particular order but we're gonna basically say who you are if you can get ready to come on stage we're gonna actually get to hear presentations from these finalists so here they are yes starting off hash edge let's give them a round of applause [Applause] snores m'a very nice name snores moe stretch Vietnam decentralized in fira I go head and Dai Li or Dai ly salsa daily that's Dai Li its controversial right before we have our finalists come up and present Scottie coming up Scotty from get corn is going to tell us a little bit about what they're doing today thanks so much Dana how's it been doing somewhat rested probably not before I get started we get started here I just wanted to thank everyone for all their work the submissions were absolutely amazing on top of the amazing prizes that you're already going to get from me Singapore myself and SAP Tech wanted to just give you guys a few extra prizes so we have these physical get coin kudos trophies each of these trophies represents a genuine compliment from us to you guys based on your work this weekend each one also has an actual 7:21 which you can represent on your get coin profile with that I'd like to pass it back to Anna to present the finalists and thank you all so much for all of your effort this weekend so first step is hash edge are you guys around here are you ready yeah come on up guys oh we will be quite strict about time so you have four minutes each finalist has four minutes to give your demo tell us what you did and then we will cut you off with a big wooden vaudeville hook yes welcome guys and congratulations [Applause] it's not what is it snores ma can you guys get ready to come up after cool all right everyone welcome to hash edge the Expedia for generalized crypto mining so the current concentration of mining on a few coins in a few hands poses a significant threat to the foundation of our decentralized world we believe in the value of giving millions the access and the freedom to choose to mine the coins of their choice and also providing effective standardized hedging tools and additional source of capital to crypto communities across the board by generalized mining we're referring not just to POWs but POS depots any decentralized network that specified by protocol that can be abstracted into financial contract backed by smart contract and we're here just standardized and tokenize it and this is why in the past 30 hours we created hash edge ad Sentra's marketplace for issuance and trading of generalized mining derivatives with a crowdfunded automated market maker to bootstrap liquidity and this peer-to-peer marketplace miners can issue tokenized 30-day in 90 day contracts etc within just a few clicks and posting margins and investors can trade these tender contract tokens with limitless liquidity and we do this with the amazing yuna soif we modified yuna swap constant prada formula to suit our purpose to do an initial unit swap offering which incorporates a Kickstarter for the quiddity so instead of seeing or seating a project you're effectively seeding is liquidity and getting a share of the transaction fees and yeah so let's just walk through the demo please sure so before we dive into that we can see on the Left left-hand side we have three major features while staking the other is trading and service my portfolio and let's head back to staking so so we can so we'd like to issue a new contract so you can see all the major components of issuing a new contract so we're issuing a Bitcoin mining contract for the purpose of demonstration we actually were actually doing a call contract setting us setting a strike price total supply and click Submit so pull up meta mask and now we've created a new contract so let's move on to the staking stage so so we can see from the bottom of our page that a new contract has been created but hang on I said uh-huh so we can actually take a few a few amount of money and cooking rest the staking function works we I guess we don't have time to show the trading so basically in the trading page so basically the trace happen you accrue transaction fees and that goes back to your staking and you can see it in my portfolio as dividends so thank you [Applause] great congratulations hash edge up next is snores moe and on the on-deck circle so get ready to come up when they're done is stretch the MS ting Jana stop hi so today we are going to talk about how we did a proof of proof of concept for a side chain that does not prove to do verification of batch transactions to hopefully improve scalability right so some of you may be familiar with very white hats roll-up that basically it allows people to send transactions of chain to an operator who then batches these transactions into a snart proof and so all the operator does on chain is verify the snart proof and so this is a scalability solution all right so while in town show us a bit of the a bit of a demo I'm gonna dive into some of the motivations behind this so in tongue does a bunch of class my work I've been interested in sticky snacks I'm just a beginner learning how it works so we came together she showed she looked at baby white hats proposer and saying hey why not we do this in a weekend so I said okay let me let's find out if we can do it and we turns out there's a slightly out there called circum by identity which has a bunch of prevalent components such as eg DSA signature validation person hashes and other things which we in theory we could piece together and make a side chain yeah so what's happening right now is that with user test I've just sent three transactions off chain to an operator to the operators database and these are the deposit transfer and withdraw transactions which are the three state transitions that are interesting to us and on the other site well that's all in my computer but on the other side the operator is listening to the database and basically picking up these transactions and running them through a state transition logic so you can see here that the operator is checking if it's a deposit or withdraw or transfer and carrying out the relevant transitions for each type of transaction so yeah reading in transaction one it's a deposit and it's legit meaning that it pasts all those basic checks like the nonce is one more than the previous one the account balance is more or equal to the amount being sent yep and so it's legit and therefore the operator puts in the transition puts in a state transition and generates a new merkel route yeah right so these three components we completed ich this weekend would be off train transaction validation a database layer the bachelors transactions which would later on be sensitive to the contract and also the generation the rotor circuit that can do EDD as a signature validation for some sample transactions so moving forward we will be looking into how we can complete the soaker and do the marquetry Moka proof validation using a secure stuff and I also want to give a shout out to some of the other plasma projects that I was looking at like I saw one that's called plasma winter and one that's plasma flow or plasma cashflow and I thought those are really cool so I just wanted to give a shout out and like email us or whatever yeah alright thank you so much thank you guys and also very white hats work good okay so next up we have stretch VM and decentralized in Fura if you guys can get ready to present next Hey hello everybody we would like to present our project we worked on a fork of the VM that we call it a stretch vm stretch is kind of part of the Casper ghost friendly family and the idea is to be able to support sharding and messaging across different charts so the main kind of like why we did it kind of what inspired us everybody's talking about scalability people looking to charting there's a lot of research around it and we felt that there's not enough or we didn't find any kind of standard implementation that allows the passing of a message from shard a let's say to short B we did it in a way that is kind of let's say non intrusive so the current VM that we took we fought by a VM we're going to talk about exactly how we did it but let's talk about the why the intention is to have a layer that allows different protocols that would like to work with sharding to actually send messages that have been persistent moving around and you can see it in the chart how Sharda has a message in block zero and goes to shalt be and basically you see like the send messages received messages and then there is event that actually affects the state in the next it's kind of if I can create quickly like another option was conclusion I don't know you yeah I don't know why oh yeah so another option is actually to also call a contract so I can call a contract in shot be just by sending a message and the main idea was to be basically keep the EVM consistent be able to kind of work with the existing kind of workflow and the main work that we've done there was to keep the design kind of in place so if you look at frontier Constantinople they all had a similar structure we try to get the applied transaction and everything working as it is without changing much so we will show you exactly how and what right now like hey guys so we took Byzantium virtual machine and we basically four PI EVM and built off Byzantium virtual machine and we added some stuff to the block headers which is like a shard ID a sent message route a received message route this is in the block header the block bodies contain the sent messages and receive messages and when a user has to send a transaction that crosses over to another shirt you package the transaction add some bookkeeping information for shard routing and put it in your center log someone picks it up from a validator from the other shirt picks it up puts it in its received log and the transaction is like applied each time you put something in the received log the transaction is popped from the message that is received and applied to the state and we did it for normal each send transactions and naturally we can be extended to cross call short contract call because all it does is the function call is like encoded in the transaction data so it naturally works so we demonstrate two things ether send one channel to the other and Coruscant a call from one shot to the other and Barnaby is gonna explain this image yeah just to recap a bit so you have the blog structure here you have two shots and a zero is sending a message to be zero which is receiving the message and as I detest it really well this is really the most simple case that I think we can treat and we're really looking forward to developing more extensions and it's made even more easy by the fact that all of this is developed as an overlay on top of IAE VM so let's do this just quickly what we're planning to do next is basically to fix the serialization because we do this very kind of last minute as a hackathon next thing we're going to do is have like a message kind of control where we don't have to go to update the routing table every time from every shard and of course the main point is to have an upstream pull request to PI VM so they can support charting as we made it thank you [Applause] [Music] while symmetry thank you stretch p.m. decentralized in fira and in the on-deck-circle dico hedge get ready to come up high so we're all smart contract auditors and we recently audited a project where it was a decentralized exchange but they were using and oracle eyes to a centralized web to api and we were thinking that's terribly unsecure because if someone hacks that server then you can buy Bitcoin for one cent which is not something you'd like to happen in your exchange so our goal for this project was to create a new version of a semi decentralized system which accomplishes as many of the goals of etherium in a scalable way by stripping out some of the guarantees so that you can take a web to server easily port it easily ported over to a decentralized medium so what we've done is we've located a UNIX file system in ipfs then we've created a communication system which allows you to communicate the route hash which will point to all of the information contained in ipfs in a way what we've implemented here is proof of authority though we're going to scale into some others forms of soft consensus mechanisms like signed updates between communities of validators and potentially even avalanche consensus so those two things together allow you to build a client server which by knowing the root hash can then process all of the data locally and thus function as an API so our project has a server which does some of the things that an fuhrer does in a more decentralized way for example we've put up the block data so that you can get methods like get block from your localhost in a way that's super easy to integrate into your project as is so this was just a simple POC for a decentralized web 3 provider we have a local host server that allows you to to interface with the decentralized web 3 provider just like you would with a normal one so all you need is an API endpoint we've implemented several of the web 3 functions one of which is the get blocked by number you can actually also return the transactions by a block by just not putting leave in the API so some of the implications of as we like to call it transparent computing are that you could have trusted servers in the future so the way that this would work is that transparent servers would operate on decentralized file systems like Paul discussed so once you have the route hash you could actually determine whether or not an executable on the transparent server had changed so if the route has hasn't changed then you could be sure that the server's code hasn't changed the way that we like to think about this is that data on your computer should be private but data on servers should be totally transparent because it actually has a large impact on our lives as well it's mothering that the paradigm that we're looking here is that so on Alexes in here the client developer a user side is exposed to very simple like HTTP interface but on the back end it's communicating with a pub sub room and my computer here is running an authority or the the actual authority in this network and is just publishing block numbers and block number data so that people that yeah the client will go and request the latest block number and can essentially derive the entire file system just from repeated requests of you know consecutive four dashes so future iterations of this technology will include the ability to request things from the pub sub room so right now we're processing a lot of this data on our computers but in the future you'd be able to put something like get blocked by number into the pub sub room along with the block number and we would implement a either a soft consensus layer or have the authority returned a proof of the correctness of the data so that you wouldn't necessarily need to process the data on your computer but you would still have guarantees that it's safe all right cool thanks guys next up we have psycho hedge and I need you guys get ready to come up soon all right take it away hi everyone so basically the app that we have sort of it's not map it's an extension to an app so what we have built sort of X off from what existed already which is the khyber network a decentralized liquidity network and the vault a dico platform so the deficiency that we are trying to address is that when you have a dico contract the funds are locked into the contract and when you lock in aetherium into a contract for long periods you are exposed to market risk so what we want to ensure is that you are able to sort of reduce or increase your exposure based on your market view within your smart contract without needing to withdraw the balance out of your contract and the way we are doing that is by becoming as a we make our dico treasury liquidity provider on the khyber network and when we do that we allow the user to either off load or unload amounts of ether based on their targets or we can allow them to seek some sort of balanced ratio between a stable coin and a theorem for the purposes of this demo we are using die but personally I believe we should be using a basket of various stable coins to diversify the credit risk so the first two modes that we allow so when you are a reservoir Juran khyber you are able to update your base rates the rates at which you are willing to buy and sell and you are also able to modify some imbalance constraints meaning that if you reach certain amounts of buy and sell until the next upgrade then you simply sort of stop trading so you just enter these parameters on these windows and then everything happens in the application and then it updates your parameters if you are happy with the exposure that you have and you simply want to be a liquidity provider and make markets we have a third mode which does not change your exposure but it is intended to provide a bit ask and to make some sort of passive income so Chet Ania will walk you through how the whole process works and how integrating khyber sort of broke our dico code and how we stitched it back see some of the already deployed contacts because it takes a lot of time to deploy them so if anyone is familiar with khyber they would already notice that most of the contacts are part of the khyber network and you can see that the I could tokens are separated out here that I could run in crowd say in the pol battery poll Factory is nothing but the Treasury so the Treasury is responsible for managing the finds in the dico so we wrote a couple of scripts to basically explain the tenets of a teiko you can see that the first script basically conducts the crowd sale and it assigns the token balances to people who have sent either to it okay the second one would be the die-cut poles so every dico usually has a tap pole and a kill pole so we deployed a certain amount of poles and then we asked certain users who were assigned some token balance in the to vote in the pose and we say we achieved this current consensus amounts next is we since the Treasury is also a liquidity provider of the khyber network we just enabled and we just enabled it and we send some transactions to the khyber network so the transactions are all swaps basically you can see that multiple swaps are happening at this point you're basically left with 22 either now what we did is we basically withdrew the entire ETS balance of a contract which essentially resulted in the contract getting zero balance of etherium but it still has some dye balance the next would be to kill the project we basically set some limits saying that if they're like aw reaches 80% consensus kill poll consensus then we would kill it so you can see that before returned before we fund the ether balance balances yep so to use after the kill user tokens are burnt and his token balance becomes zero you can see that the user balance is not update only the dye balance is updated because the user was made 0 that was some good speed running I'm impressed thank you thank you take your hedge and up next dai Dai ly the last one yeah so actually there's a backstory to our idea so we were wicked ah happy hour event on Thursday so basically they were giving away five free died you just enter promo code on Microsoft website and they were low level web account with token they can suffer fire and their son it does though the inside right so the problem with saws a lot of people have troubles understanding how to send one die to get a free drink upon craft beer all right one dollar for $15 beer very worth it all right so uh you do that inspiration to build something for payments we stable coin die right so what we built is our it'll us our payments will die so that you can make these payments daily right so you can see here I though I bet so if you guys want to check it out is we have a building / diony so this account is actually a term wallet with no it ETA zero and we want to send it to a any address yep so you're keying like how much all right so I'll leave to my home to explain how this works so I share how this was because it's a meeting across the network so so basically what I mean says just account we just saw is account I just as dialog it has no ether in it so why pay is basically the user science to transaction but it delegates off to a true our servers a person who has a separate account was willing to something the transaction on behalf the user to pay for the cash fees in return if you can click on each scan basically the token transfer you can see them just this way for it to load but basically the main you know payload of the die you know amount that you want to send to the end users still get sent by essentially a small fee in the indexable coin die will be sent where we redirected back to reimbursed the guy who helped you pay the fees to some transactions so essentially this die amount will likely cover any amount of ether that the guy paid plus some form of no service charge for things like that so basically any form any user can send stable current without needing to have get the gas fees required at council why is this powerful because I mean any advanced user orbit even probably will no maintain your own gas balances for enough ito-san transactions by thing for even for separation of concerns so if I just want to pay my wallet no I don't really wanna think about no maintaining two different types of SL tokens no one to pay and want to send transactions all the time so maybe this will be a good way to drive adoption for amount the common people for payments yeah so this is built on top Yoshi 865 and we believe there's a huge potential for non crypto real world adoption so where it's um that your access a white label for your applications or payment network all right so any companies can create thousands of accounts without having to a drop with 0.01 eater all this SF that you new maintain inactive accounts to get back right so with this you can just create a comfort then and actually pass them custody without them knowing right they might or might not be interested and just set out your own data gate service or rely on the party networks yeah that's all yeah so if you feel free to check out our support questions thank you Congrats to all up next we are going to have the sponsor prizes again like sponsors make this amazing event possible so thank you to all of them and we will kick it off with our first sponsor prize which is b0x do you have 30 seconds hi we're Visia bzx and the winning team for our prize was they called it t bzx it's a telegram bot integration of our protocol so it lets users do peer-to-peer loans mark margin loans and too short and take leverage positions all from telegram so congrats team [Applause] so up next is Khyber Network yeah right so hi everybody so for Khyber we saw total of 16 submissions it was pretty astounding so after much deliberation with my CEO and a few others we decided that crypto 9 is the official the API prize winner so they built a simple swap interface that also allows you to do advanced trading orders like limit orders and stop orders right so you also have other winners for our other bounties I'm just gonna read the names of the teams and we reach out to you so the depo set a depo set is our joint party reset protocol winner so yeah we will get in touch with you we also have that trading view type was your ex really dico hitch and crew so next up is maker we had seven submissions we're splitting first place between two projects that use zk snarks and put them into practice one was around privacy and one was combining it with plasma and so those two teams will each receive a thousand died and there's two teams they'll split five hundred died each one is the daily team that you just saw another one is it a person who made a very cool status extension that allows you to when you have either you can send died it'll use Khyber network within status to swap your duck either for die and send that to someone so it's an easy way to send a die around thanks guys [Applause] and Raiden hello we had two prizes we had a most innovative use case on top of Raiden and we had best user experience and the most innovative idea is Rado which is basically an advertisement marketplace build on top of Raiden so you pay per second that you advertise something and potentially other advertisers could also pay a higher fee and have their advertisements shown instead and the best user experience goes to crypto grannies which is like simple way to use NFC cards to pay with Raiden so yeah our congratulations and please find us afterwards we have set hi I'm Richard from set so we got a couple interesting projects building on top of us one of them we have a joint API prize with Khyber and that's deposit so they built a one-click app to buy a set using kai.berlick quiddity and it all does it all in one transaction so congrats the guys and we have a couple other interesting projects we'd love to talk to you guys after to talk more and the ones damn [Music] so the winner for our bounty was David Mahal we had four bounties out he actually tackled two of them he basically built a better UI for our current beta net protocol and he also worked on making the the JSON basically the the report of the audit report nicer which was up until now just like a JSON blob so congrats to David and thanks for this wonderful event so we had two awesome prize winners who were able to extend status with their own features the first prize winner is Dow to go and they built a set of extensions that allows you to interact with the aragón Delhi session nice work inside status so you can vote on a dow and you can also create a new one using status messenger and then our second prize winner is the awesome weasel team and that's the team that actually built the in chat die sending feature where you don't need to own die but you can send your friend die thanks to Khyber die and status so congratulations guys [Applause] there are gone parts of this trip coming for the crowd hey guys yeah so for argon we had two prizes 1st place in a runner-up so 1st place for the best use of argon protocol goes to project grunt who made a UI and a smart contract that worked in the argon protocol 2 after the model of slicing pie so it's like to help startups have an objective and transparent way to fund different groups or different contributors a really awesome project and runner-up goes to whose status introduced the doubt to go so that you could use status to actually vote and anyone can just use the messaging map it was really cool there is that you could have people in a chat room participating in governance in a more social way can I also do giveth his next up yeah and so giveth is looking for the best social impact project and that was definitely a chair teeth so nice work with charity they made a and an easy way for people that donate tokens without having to worry about it affecting the market they use a set protocol to find kind of OTC traders that would so people could donate their tokens without having to worry about somehow affecting that price of the token so thank you guys nice work thank you to all these sponsors and their prizes up next is seller Oh everybody I am NOT Madhan from cellar mode on could not be here and he asked me to do this the winner of the cellar API prize is shaky-shaky which is a use of the cellar API to trigger micro payments when you shake your phone shaky-shaky so congratulations they've already been found I'm mo thank you cool all right now we thank our sponsors once more we're going to read them out again like these these events can I happen without our sponsors we are super grateful to them for helping do this yeah so bzx hyper Network maker new cypher consensus status set Quan stamp Oh music oh Raiden seller a combi and in fira silica him I am token alpha wallet open token Matic Network Aragon neutral blockchain attend to you the bridge this location aetherium Singapore long hash wxy group SG innovate crypto briefing coin market cap and kinetic it's have a big hand for our sponsors alright and up next so this event is put on by eath global and we're very excited to invite the eath global folks to the stage - uh yeah - see you guys out so [Music] [Applause] yeah what did you think of the hacks Liam uh yeah no I mean I've seen like a lot of different hackathons over the past like several years of my life and from surveying around I cut you maybe saw me going all the different judging rooms and kind of get a sense of what's happening this has been like one of the most phenomenal events with regards to like technical output of like really high quality things that are gonna be useful so I'm good it blows my mind in what you can do over a weekend can't wait to see more um actually yeah I want to say a little bit uh how many you guys know what eath global is like generally speaking okay okay a decent amount how many know the backstory or like why we do any of this stuff no one perfect so yeah I guess I'll just give you like a bit of Baxters of why any of us are here a few years ago I guess like five or so years ago Karthik and I and a bunch of different friends that we had at the University of Waterloo in Canada started this hackathon right when kind of collegiate hackathons were starting to get popular in like the States and in Canada and the general idea we just get as many people as possible that wanted to kind of just you know do something different than just like you know maybe like a school project or say going working at some company they won that is get into an environment where a lot of people that are similarly as you have motivated and interested in technology as they are can get together for a weekend and just kind of have fun right in the same way that you know you know art is a creative output technology programming is similarly just the same it shouldn't be something that's just like you build and then you get paid and then it just something like that it's much more of a creative aspect and so you want to be a part of a social group so we started at Agathon several years ago with that kind of in mind and we saw it as a massive explosion of like great products that were built people that you know became you know met built massive kind of friend groups out of it and ultimately you know I you know several years later now we've seen an enormous amount of impact from it in terms of what companies get started from it friend groups kind of spiral into their own startups or different groups within companies and it's just been massively impactful and so you know personally I'm not really liking an events guy but what we saw is this particular style of event led to an incredible of output for our friends and for people like us that is care about technology and having fun and building stuff you know is our creative energy so a few years ago I as two years ago are you and a half ago as a theorem was kind of really starting to get a lot of interest from the developer community we put on an event called eath Waterloo which was the very first if their hackathon and because we built our hackathon in Waterloo we had like a massive advantage where we got to kind of took the whole playbook from building that event and we just kind of repeated it and changed the logo to be aetherium related can I got all the best kind of a theory on people industry to come to Waterloo and and a lot of amazing stuff happened a set protocol is t-shirt I'm wearing and he's now sponsoring this event literally came to that event built separate a call at least the beginnings of it are the specifications and a bit of prio see of code and then launched a company out of it and now you can see they're like thriving in terms of they've built a great community around themselves and they have a technology that all of you can now build on top of because of an event like this all kinds of other stuff have happened along the way crypto kitties and a bunch of other stuff so eath global is just an initiative that us and a great team I'm going to talk about in a minute just you know out of our own interest in creeks pushing for this kind of ideology forward want to give to the etherion community so yeah that's Youth Bowl but we hope that it's is something positive in the community and that people can get a lot of value out of it [Applause] and part of what excites me about it global is that the stuff we're doing now we won't actually see how that actually pays out until a few years from now so the super exciting part of this is that we're just in the very first beginning of what this could be and we have to be a bit more patient and wait a few more years to see what actually comes out of it and that's to me super exciting so with that we wanted to thank a handful of people that kind of made this weekend possible yeah so I guess kind of going in order first of all with the judges so you know the really fun part about this space is we got to get the absolute like really amazing like top judges and industry leaders in this space to come to the event and so um you know these are all the folks if you're on this list and you're judging in this room a lot of them are kind of scattered about but can you guys stand up because we don't agree major shout out to you come all this way to actually go and see appears kind of building stuff on top of technology that it's why we didn't built by yeah yeah Lane Yuriko JD Kelsey Zi Wei Ming Anna mo wedding was on a plane eg fit Ehrlich Dean Cassandra Yao Cree Evan Erica Xiao Wei Chris Ava Wow thank you very much and separately one of the cool things is we thought but we get to go to find local teams across the world that are as motivated by if they're him as we are and we get to partner with them to put on these kinds of events so this event in just been a partnership between us but with a large part a lot of great people on the ground from Singapore so yeah if you're part of the core team visit Singapore if you're in the room again they're always running around you guys stand up so for the livestream nobody's in this room and it's just how hard it is yeah Alex Bernard Clarisse Dean Heather Gervais Nick pH Windsor Xavier you long you long spent a long time working you guys with the past's months four months four months yeah and this officially this is actually gonna be in July I think when we moved it forward a bit but anyway thank you you guys as well and lastly or not Lassie the volunteers so again I mentioned I've done a lot of hackathons the volunteers are the massive wildcard occasionally you know you get not a great group of people but in this case that's definitely not that's it's not the case the whole weekend was like super streamlined I know maybe you

stand up there in the red shirts highly recommend on your way out you say thank you and then lastly our core team so yeah Andrew in the back put on an enormous amount of effort throughout this whole experience with logistics Heather I think I told Heather to be here she should really be here but she's probably that's they're always doing stuff Heather spent an enormous amount of time also logistically you know you probably seen her like helping out along the way Jacob who you know sponsors especially have been interacting with handling all the logistics of making sure that you know people building on top of sponsorship API prizes or in generally coming this event having good experience as well and Josh Josh just generally just does everything across the board and everything I've been involved with so yeah shout out to you guys please you deserve a massive round of applause yeah and they can continue the gratitude train also thank you to all of you this has been like an amazing event and it's like you've mentioned several times it's not a competition we're not here just to like network and we're here to like build cool stuff make friends and just generally have a lot of fun with the technology that we're all so passionate about so yeah thank all of you as well let's not forget our amazing MCS having an Anna that have been doing a wonderful job keeping everybody happy so the finalists so we saw 44 projects this weekend and our judges did all the hard work of kind of figuring out who the top teams are and you kind of saw the six demos on stage what's unique about these each global events is that these are not set out to be competitions there's no notion of for a second third you're not when like a rank or there's like not a high school type of submission process we want these things to be places where you can show off the cool stuff that you can build over a weekend and continue to work on it and to kind of bring it all back the six finalists that came and presented on stage were actually also our winners instead of being first places or second places third places all of them are equally the winners of this event and I want to thank and kind of get a round of applause for all those six teams who are now our winners for this eight Singapore and as part of being the winners the prize we're gonna give out for these teams is that every team member will get 5/8 and we hope bottle we hope you HOT also but congratulations to the six teams and being the winners of eat Singapore so today is this is the last sort of few minutes of eat Singapore which is also the last thing we're doing this year and I wanted to take and we do this every time I and I'm like super guilty of talking about the same thing every time but I'm gonna still take two more minutes and talk about this which is this is the last event of our year and this year this makes six events that we've done over the course of 2018 starting from Denver going to bow nazar is going to India and to Berlin to San Francisco and now we're at Singapore and the progress and the outcomes we've kind of seen from just this year alone have been absolutely amazing what I really wanted to do was summarize what has happened in just the last year since 8th global has been around we have seen over 550 projects that have come out of these Agathon's over 3800 people have attended this our original goal was to get 2,000 people into this ecosystem and have a thousand of them be first-time developers we well exceeded that at the end of this year and not only that we've had people come to these events from over 65 countries and he still blows my mind that we were able to get this done in such a short amount of time and I'm super proud that all of you in this room are part of how this has happened so thank you so much for making it global happen in 2018 [Applause] and with that I am going to talk about one more thing which is the next event which is our first event for 2019 its Denver it's gonna be on February 15 to the 17th it's going to be one of our biggest events of the year over a thousand people will be here in Colorado so if you are around or if you would like to attend please apply to each Denver and I know I said one more thing but I'm gonna do this again and probably maybe one more time I can't I can't promise that so we're right now figuring out how do we scale up each global and as a result we looked at all the things that have happened this year did the reach we've had and and all the the places everybody has come from and the projects we've seen we wanted to do something that we didn't do originally this year and as a result what I'm really excited to announce is we're going to be doing eath Cape Town in Africa on April 19th of 2019 this will be our first event in that geography and we can't wait for you to attend eath Cape Town to find out more about both of these events you can check out either Cape Town calm or eat Denver we're gonna give out more details soon and with that one more thing I guess the after-party so this slide officially concludes each Singapore we're going to be kind of wrapping up this event and in making sure we clean up before before before leaving and kind of take all our things and make sure that you haven't lost any stuff and we'll be going across the building here to savor world where we're going to be kind of celebrating for the next three hours so from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock and we can't wait to kind of talk and chat with all of you and learn more about the projects that you've built and we really hope that you keep on building these projects after today thank you so much for coming they would not be possible without you actually let's let's do this we'll take a one more
