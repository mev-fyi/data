hello everyone and welcome to the gnosis builders Workshop building on gnosis chain the what why and where joining us today is Olu who will be taking us through this session and with that I'll pass it over to Olu to get the session started hi guys welcome to the session um yes um I'll be taking us through this um very few brief session on uh building on Moses Jane what you need to know about Mrs Jane um where you need to get informations and how you could go about it um questions it could be tapped into the chat and I'll I'll get to them thank you so this is um what the talk is all about um what's the why and where of building a nurses chain um we're going to talk about what is not exchange why you should consider no 16 how to build a musician and um we are going to talk briefly about nurses builders so what is Mrs chain um nurses chain is an L1 POS based evm convertible chain uh basically what all this mean is that it is compatible with ethereum and you could build on it same as you could build on ethereum um it's operates with a drawer tracking system we have one talking for guys and the order for staking um the extra is used for gas and the GN of stake in the um XDA itself is expect uh one to one with the US dollar and it's derived from the guy on the ethereum um what this means is that transactions are very very cheap on this exchange with um a hundred dollars you could do as many as 100K transactions or even more depending on the type of transactions you're doing so and um the reason for uh having this dual chopping system is also so that um staking can also be done very easily as we'll see um later on no system itself is excuse me it's Community part and developers focused and anyone in the world can become a validated on the chain and it is pretty very easy to do so what's the mission of Mrs J um no system aims to be the most decentralized blockchain um we have already tools that we use to measure decentralization as you see later on and um why Mrs chain is more suitable in making this connection because currently there are over 115 gig validators on innocence chain and screen and the entry to becoming validator is just one Geno like I said earlier um this is the reason why we have these two talking uh system the gno is used for validators and you need just one of it to become a validator it contrast that with ethereum that requires 32 Health to run a validator now um I said earlier that the chain is compatible with um the evm so how do we achieve um this one gno to 32 Earth um expiry what happens is your one gno is converted to something called mgno and one gno is 32 mgno so the mgno is basically what is used for validation and that makes it compatible with ethereum request um no system also strives to become accessible for all user tribes through straightforwards or importing and developer experience um the onboarding uh for nurses chain is very easy very straightforward um converting your gno to mgn or becoming a validator you have tools that could help you do that um with just a few clicks you don't need to have any advanced knowledge of how the internet's work could be you we provide tools for you that you could go do a few clicks and you'll become a validator so what's the um key priorities that those exchange strives to achieve one of them is decentralization like I said we want to be the most decentralized um chain um we also uh prioritize validator experience we have an intuitive violator experience dashboard that you could use to basically become a validator without having to go through a lot of stress um for example if you're using stadium.net with just a few clicks and a few minutes you could become a value a validator and everything is set up very easily for you um user onboarding as well is very seamless and accessible and we have a very robust and growing ecosystem um there are a lot of Da rules and dabs that have already developed and deployed on the music stream so why should you be interested in all of this this once you why should you want to build on this Exchange um like I said decentralization is very key um with about 115 validators hypnosis change is the second most decentralized chain um accessibility is also very important whether you're a developer or a user um getting started on those exchange is intuitive is Affordable it's easy um another thing is speed transaction time or not 16 is about five seconds which means you could do lightning fast transactions it is also cheap um with 0.01 x that you'll be able to make hundreds of transactions and um it is stable stability um uh paying for um transmission using X style which is uh basically one to work with the US dollar means that um your transaction fees are predictable and they are not subject to market for Italy uh volatility okay so this is um the current state of Windows 16 you could see this info on nosysmetrics.com um we have about 27 000 active accounts um in the last 30 days about 1.6 million International processed about 3 000 X die have been paid in fees for those 1.6 million transactions about 115k validators um the total value of um USD deposited is about 12 million and the current yield for validators is about 15.2 percent so all of this info can be seen and more if you go to the transactional active accounts gasmetrics.com so what was the short scenario on why you should consider Mrs Jane it is user friendly we have a strong ecosystem we also have a grants program so that your prayer that you're building you could apply for Grants and there's an ecosystem that's you know and a deal that works around that and helps to support public good projects yeah so you could receive support for not just for uh grant money you receive support for marketing of course liquidity you produce support for networking and so much more funding this is so where do you start from um first thing first you have to connect your wallet to the chain you could use the RPC endpoint chain ID at the quantity symbol that's displayed um alternatively you could just go to the chainlist.org and go to the slash chain slash Android support and your wallet should be automatically configured for you and I mean again this is all very easy and iterative and straightforward you don't need to have um special knowledge or anything to be able to do this and after you've connected your wallet um like I said it is 100 evm compatible basically this means that you could use all of the web development tools you use on ethereum or no system without changing anything you could take a smart contract or a project built for ethereum and deploy it under 16 without much answers in fact most of the time you don't have to change anything you just deploy one to one with so what this means is all of the tools that are available or on ethereum can also be used with no 16 easily um your remix your adults your truffle whatever tools you used to develop on ethereum you could use those symptoms change apart from that all of the libraries are also 100 compatible you could use any open supporting library or any other library that you're familiar with um on your system as well so where are the you know resources you could you could get started with um the first place I would recommend to go is nurses.io this is the main website it provides a very quick overview of what no systems um it also provide overview of the grants program and how to get started on that um the next point of call is docs.nosischain.com this is the entry point to all documentations for nurses chain uh for um whether your developer validator or you're just reviewing this is the best kind of call but if you are a developer and just want to start development right away you could go to the slash Developers is also a good resource here you could see all the available wallets um that um are supported on no 16 and you could um easily click to um and select your preferred parameters and you will get um links and you know documentations and stuff to do wallets that fits your Preferred Choice um access to faucet is also very important so we have nurses for sale.com where you can get a small amount of X die that you can use to start building immediately and deploying transform the United States chain um if the extra you get from you know 647.com is not enough you could also visit buy xdi.com we have a lot of resources there to show where you can get eggs that easily either you want to buy with a credit card either you want to swap it on chain or you want to bridge it to the Ethereal nurses chain we have a lot of resources there for you and with just a few clicks you could get started and if you want gno you could just go to the slash gns of part on by xdi.com and you'll be able to get gnm and finally we have um validated notices.com also very simple intuitive interface to guide you um if you are interested in becoming a validator on versus chain again all of these tools are very very easy to use you don't need a lot of specialized knowledge to use them so they might just click throughs and you get some simple easy to follow guides on how to do business so um finally I said we're going to talk briefly about nurses Builders so what's this experience nurses Builders is an ecosystem team for uh you know system we are basically a community that um build for nurses chain um you could visit our website to find all of the various tools I'm talking about um and you could use all of these links to get in touch with us as well we have a developers program in Mercedes builders.com developers we also have a users program you could check the validators and if you want to see all of the events and the other community that will support you go to the slash economics supports so also you could reach us to us if you have a project you want us to collaborate with you on or that you want us to support you could reach us from mrsbuilders.com as well and um yeah we also on Twitter we're on Discord we're on telegram you could reach us easily on any of this Daniels and that is it folks thank you awesome choose Thank You Olu um does anybody have any questions we had a comment uh that knows his chain is the only evm chain compatible with ethereum at the Beacon chain level by Ethan yes thanks it's on yeah that is very correct I guess if anybody wants to ask a question feel free to type in the chat or take yourself off mute uh Gavin asks gnosis has all same pre-compiles then yeah yes um so um like I said it is 100 evm compatible you don't need to do anything whatever it is that you do on ethereum you could just take it one to one like that and deployment was exchange without doing anything yeah can you talk about the hackathon rewards um okay I don't have I don't know is is itan here eaten from um I can also try finding um stuff from from the site in the in the main meantime uh Ethan I can get back to you that um the next question was is the nose is safe anyhow related to the gnosis chain is um a wallet that is that you could use to uh to multi-signature so it is not uh it is not related to nurses chain uh but it is also a very good resource you could use if you want to do a multi-signature wallets okay and is Nurses compatible with polybase I'm not sure what's polybase is so um I can't really answer that um Associated if you want to take yourself off mutant maybe clarify or you can type in the chat as well [Music] um in the meantime we can if not we can move on um I'm not sure is there a rocket pull Fork already on gnosis um not that I know of oh uh let's see it says uh so yeah guys we have a second part uh if you don't mind because we have just 10 minutes left uh we want to present one more product and then we we continue with questions in the end yeah that sounds good um can I share my screen or follow uh you have my presentation yeah no I just stop sharing okay cool yeah so I want to yeah to introduce Hashi so it's a project by agnosis Guild um and in the hypnosis ecosystem in general this is very very new um so I want to introduce this guys to you because they're relevant bounties around that so um yeah what is Hash exactly so hashibri means bridge in Japanese um and we aim here to define a standard for cross-chain communication um with the main differences that we we want to be based on additive security and multiple inputs we call them oracles more on that later um at its core uh Hashi is a header Oracle aggregator and the ultimate goal here is to basically distribute um trust for Bridges but on the security mechanism level um yeah if I can use just one phrase to to describe that uh what has is doing like why would you choose just one Bridge security mechanism when you can have all of them right um and next one is why why how she was created so in 2022 we had more than 2 billion uh in in hacks uh because of bridge issues and uh on on Rec news leaderboards all the top projects four out of five are related to Bridges so what is the summary here is like no Bridge security mechanism is 100 secure um all designs have uh trade-offs right so um so a couple of principles around uh Hashi the way it was designed so uh we want to standardize uh at the lowest possible level and this is the block header it's not like on on transaction or on tokens but it's on the Block header level and the goal here is to to diversify uh this cross-chain communication uh by different implementations so different kind of bridges right um so we we assume here that no bridge design can be considered 100 secure um so we will basically check uh multiple bridges for the result they're giving uh to uh to validate a specific block header from another blockchain um and and of course when we Max my security um over latency so here uh the the whole design of the system basically makes the makes it slower um but we have enhanced security so a couple of uh yeah main components of this system um so imagine we have we have the applications right so applications are a token Bridge a government Bridge an nft Bridge any kind of uh Bridge you you can imagine and then we have the locator oracles which are the actual Bridges so here there can be Bridges you already know um for example Wormhole or the gnosis chain A and B or whole protocol or connects any any breeds basically um and then we have the core contracts which I'll present right after uh the main one is called Hashi which is a the aggregator um giri giribashi and other Japanese I don't know if you have any Japanese speakers in the audience uh this basically is um taking care of governance so uh which oracles will be added and and thresholds and so forth um then another component is the storage proofs um we need basically a proof on this concept that a specific transaction is included in a specific block error and and this is uh um this is done for example with a project like Axiom um but there are other Alternatives that we can explore and then we have the reporter contracts and the relayers which are basically um helper components that will initiate the message transfers and listen to events uh cross chain um and yeah I think this is the most important part to understand uh Hashi um is an architecture overview so it might look a bit uh yeah uh difficult to describe in a couple of minutes but uh um I want to focus here so mainly let's say we have to change that we have ethereum mainnet and we have no such change so these are the two main contracts I just mentioned before uh the hash in the gitigated Bashi uh and and this um this year are the bridges basically right so uh the examples I mentioned before you have a and b this is the agnosis uh Omni Bridge maybe you've heard of it uh Wormhole telepathy is a solution by System clubs ZK breeds any kind of bridge right and then we need to build adapters for all these bridges that feed into hashing right and high level what is happening here is that um we are asking um from like on the application Level so here it took as an example a token Bridge um we are asking through this helper components here um a specific block header from ethereum mainnet to be transferred by all of these Bridges right so the amb will transfer the blocker the Wormhole will transfer the block header and so forth and on the other side Hashi will get the answers from all the bridges and it will compare them and uh this is the gearbox is about the governance so you can say okay if two or three out of five or five out of eight whatever you want to set agree and give me the same answer then I can be very very sure that this is correct and this connects to what I just mentioned uh in the beginning that uh here we don't trust any one of them 100 we we basically ask all of these Bridges to give us the same input we ask them give me a block error from the other side and if one of them is compromised let's say telepathy or A and B is compromised and and they give a wrong uh result that is different by the majority then we know these are compromised but their system is still intact right so that's the thing the main uh the main lesson for uh for Hashi that we want really to uh to create additive security and aggregate all possible um Bridges and to be as secure as sure as possible that we have the correct result um yeah and and this part here is what I just what I mentioned before about the storage proofs right so uh this is a quite complex I'll I'll maybe explain a little bit later is um we need a component here a contract that basically will check that a specific transaction is included in a specific block header right so this uh will will give a block header and here you have to check oh the transaction that I initiated here is it included in a block here and then you can say if it is included then you can make sure that these actual uh token Breeze transaction on the other side happened right and and yeah then that's basically it the token can be breached um what can you build now with Hashi um that goes to the hackathon and connects to to many of the prizes we have there you cannot write an adapter for another Bridge um so similar to the one I do the ones I showed uh you can write this contract this miracle blue um that proves that basically specific event um or a transaction is included in a specific block here then you can look at the uh the governance contract we have and improve it in any kind of way it's uh kind of at the moment it's very um I want to say simple but it doesn't have a lot of complex use cases yet and you can also of course I mean this is quite hard at the moment but you can try and build a end-to-end application that will make for example a token transfer super super secure by a three four five different Bridges um and yeah to help in that these are the resources we have so far so the main one is uh the repository uh you will see there that they already adopters implemented for three um Bridges um you can add more and if you want to play around with the or even interact with the contracts we have already on testnet these are the addresses so we have a girly and Shadow at the moment which Shadow is the test net of an assistant and and yeah I think I'll stop here and maybe we can check is there any questions because we have three minutes left um yeah yeah there's a good amount of questions um Sky scrolling back up to the top uh let's see is there a rocket pool Fork already on gnosis um rocket pool uh fool I'm not sure about that uh by the way guys for any questions you need to uh you can you can I think there should be a channel indeed Global yeah yeah I'll get that link and I will monitor that because there are different teams like the Hashi team for example the builders and then we can uh if you have for example Hashi related questions I will jump in for other projects some other person will jump in um and uh what what are some cool projects on gnosis uh cool um I think I already respond to that we have quite a number of projects that are on messaging I could quickly share my screen to show you a slide um so these are some of the projects that um you've been able to put together that are almost exchanged you could see we have the file we have about tools and sources we have infrastructure projects we have daos nft games not providers so and this list I think is a bit old um I'm sure there are other projects that are copied up as we speak yeah I'm sorry although I just saw that you responded to some of these questions so just go into ones that haven't been responded uh Manu asked what are the more important things you were looking for in projects in the hackathon um I can't really say because um what um first and first forget it needs to be interesting is to solve a particular problem it needs to um there needs to be value you know some sort of value that is in added to the community or to the chain in the project so yes okay and uh wouldn't have she be very slow to reach consensus yeah I was just uh answering that uh so yeah it depends so the main point here is that hash's super modular and configurable so uh it depends if you want to make it super fast you can use these two oracles with some two multisig Bridges and that would be super fast but if you want to make it super secure uh what we want to make for example for Hashi ideally at one implementation that will combine a lot of ZK light client Bridges right together with multi-stick Bridges and that will be slower but a lot more secure okay and are the deployed contracts and Docs um actually no because I think we deployed them yesterday but uh I think they're not in the Ripple but feel free to ask the questions there um and I I'll provide you an information you guys need and the ERC 4337 entry point contract is deployed on tenosis chain has anyone building out bundler infrastructure for 43.37 on gnosis none that I know of I think that's all the questions right now and yeah if if people have more questions than I posted the uh the Discord link there and um tenosis so I posted again here please feel free to reach out to them um at any point and they'll deal to answer anybody from the team will be able to answer any other questions that you may have but um if there are no other questions just I think the team for the great presentation and thank you all for for being here today um and uh yeah have a great rest of the day and happy
