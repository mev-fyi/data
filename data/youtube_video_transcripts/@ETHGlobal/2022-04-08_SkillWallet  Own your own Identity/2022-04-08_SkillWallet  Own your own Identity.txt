awesome thank you all for joining us on this friday afternoon evening saturday morning depending on where you are um we are on day two of the dow hacks workshop um we have melina and alex here from skill wallet who will be doing their workshop on own your own identity any questions go into the zoom chat and melina and alex will answer them as they go and with that being said i'll hand the mic off to the two of them thank you so hello everyone hey so thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in skill wallet uh now before further do let me share my screen and i have a presentation for you now uh skill wallet lets you hone your own identity and uh we do that especially as a membership tool for dows the the the main value for this is that those themselves are the backbone of up three as we know it today and decentralized communities are per se a completely new brand new webtree native way to interact and collaborate the issue with that is that they're still using well let's say outdated tools and they are still largely based on reputation made up of let's say governance tokens and other tools that are based on their initial capital now um this generates multiple problems for example the way to allocate value within a community that needs to be self-sustainable as a let's say as a as a business in order to let people coordinate and create projects that make sense to them and can realize their vision as well as for example many members of the dao being guided unable to actually understand what to do or starting to have a parasitic behavior just to attack to track possible airdrops or things like this now what we do with skill wallet is to tie an identity with the community that members join so that first of all there is a more efficient and transparent way for members to interact to contribute to the community and there is a value alignment as well as replacing legacy tools so for example you can directly create a bridge between web 2 and web 3 without disrupting habits that the community has and the culture that they created and also reflects social dynamics because itself a skill wallet contains someone's skills and someone's roles so that you know again as uh in every aspect of our society and all the communities that we know from you know hs club to university to even a startup team uh everybody has clear rules and knows exactly what to do also our suite of products allows you to uh create a dao as well as a complete set of tasks and milestones for your community without uh the need to be a tech expert so you can create something that really creates impact in the world follows your vision and involving others with that without you know again being a tech wizard uh we have five main products in our product suite the the first one is the partners agreement that's how all starts you can easily deploy a doubt that works exactly like every other dow in the world plus on the top of it has this role-based native governance module after that you have a mobile app that allows you to tie directly your identity to your mobile device to increase civil resistance and it lets you also see what is happening in your community so the open tasks all of your experience your commitment as well as the rewards that you are going to receive the the most important part of the skill wallet product suite itself is the decentralized authentication system that basically works like google so you can use your unique skill wallet led to login in every protocol in every dapp and platform in the web space just simply logging in or scanning or scanning your code the the most operational functional part let's say both for the founders of the community as well as their members are the partners dashboard that lets you basically fly on a deck so you can immediately create tasks uh see at glance how our community is doing the health of your community and all the different members members and roles that are available there and the discord board so you can integrate your discord add our discord booth to directly in your server and shared tasks that exist on chain as well as for example polls for governance and voting directly on discord record reactions on discord and reflect this direct launch chain now um going a little bit uh deeper into that again as we said uh skill wallet ties identities and dows so that we unlock rule-based governance so each member of each community directly has a role at the registration as well as uh for example letting you choose and customize very important things in your tile so for example the market you're active in or whether you want two or three roles what are these roles and the commitment that you expect from each one of your members from the member's perspective again you can immediately login as the traditional experience of connecting your wallet and together with adding your your avatar and your nickname that are very familiar experiences and full epsodonimus you can immediately pick the role and the commitment that you want to have in that specific community so that really represents you and your you are identified with basically what you do instead of you know your location or your full name um the the last but not least important part uh is the partners dashboard to do set and from here you can really do anything that is related to your community invite your members invite your corporate team as well as creating and sharing tasks or expanding your dao adding decentralized tools on the top of it what we've been trying to build is uh stamping a complete infrastructure that really expands the personal freedom of individuals not only three but we're starting with this and is based on a fully webtree native and modular architecture so that we really tried to create an identity lag that focuses on the individuals that are the let's say the core of each style that aims to be fully decentralized things that we know are possible and we would like to see are for example the let's say sweet spot between native governance and non-channel analytics so profit sharing and now without further ado before leaving the world to milan i will share my screen and show you some very interesting ah wait let me see where i place this i'm sorry just the pleasure of life uh okay so we have it uh now without further ado i will show you our documentation so that you can have a glance anything that can help you to to start off and what prices we're focusing on now this is our notion page you can find it at docs.kelvola.deep these are some of the possibilities and very simple things that you can achieve with skill wallet in few minutes uh well how are about nothing relevant there you already know about us and this is a intro video with a tutorial for integrating silvolt as a decentralized authentication system and claiming the first sql world also a link to our youtube channel where there are other tutorials now for this for this icon we set quite a nice price mostly for something that is active in the air of public goods as uh as we mentioned this is our main focus uh our main focus and things like activism with or without an age and social issues are definitely something that can be achieved or can be tackled using our technology or at least what we would like to see there are some judging criteria most of these integrations do not require particular skills mostly we're interest to see what you build on the top of it there is also a very basic uh pool price you can get 100 usdc's just by integrating skilled wallet or doing anything with it that may take two minutes and is mostly for letting newcomers in the space to explore our technology and try out new things and a few ideas i mentioned you already about profit sharing and other anything any creative solution that is really focused on creating social impact using roles absorbing identities and anything that would build other things you can read them by yourself and want to take too much of your time so let me see there are a couple of elf questions uh so okay um i cover them yeah thank you milan all right uh so i guess we are on time so maybe milan would you like to to share something and go to the dev site i'm i'm gonna share my screen that's what i'm going to share hi everyone uh let me know if you don't see my screen otherwise um what i'm aiming is to walk you through creating the community for for your for your product whatever you're building uh show you how to integrate the web component um in your app and then walk you through the dashboard very uh very briefly um since we're short on time we're not going to do everything um we're not going to do all the integrations here uh i've set up some things so this is the partners agreement and this is the very first step for integrating the ski wallet here you customize your community and very importantly you customize the roles for your community we have two different types of membership within skill wallet we have court team members and uh community members and here those are the roles for the community members the core team ones are predefined by us um when you scan when you sign this you're going to deploy two contracts um under the hood we deploy it it's the partners agreement which is taking care of everything related to tasks integrations etc and community which is basically your membership um contract so after you deploy this you're going to get this uh very nice partners key that you should be very careful not to lose because you need it for integrating your um the web component in your app i have done that i already created a partner community for us for this tutorial and now let's see how we integrate it um can i move this okay you don't see this but i have this very annoying zoom thing so this is our uh this is our uh npm package and here are instructions on how to how to integrate with react angular view js and if you have any issues or you want to integrate in something some other framework you can let us know uh so i have here this absolutely empty let me move this uh this absolutely empty react app and what i'm going to do now is to integrate our skill wallet i'm installing the library i will copy paste here this example i'll add a few imports oh here we're missing this and here i'm going to change this key to the one that i use i got after i deployed our testing dial and since we are on polygon we are saving use dev to true now let's start great so this is how our web component looks like and again this annoying zoom thing and uh since i created our i already am a member of this of these partners of this partners community that i created for this workshop let's see if i can login yeah that's the correct account um [Music] yes so this is how you log in now by clicking here it's very nice ux as you can see you could log out and if you want to create new user you can i should change now my account because i already have a skill wallet with this one let's change it to this i'm again injecting my math mask introduce yourself i'm a hacker i will upload a picture and this here are the member rows uh now if i continue with this flow i'm going to join as a member of as a normal community member now let's see how we actually manage the core team membership so in order to do that uh i am going to log in here with the account that i used to create um [Music] to create this community and this is our dashboard now here on the right we see core team and community if we go to core team this is um this is how i um i set up the data with the nice hacks logo uh here we can see members it's quite a ghost town here because it's only me um and now let's see how we actually invite and how we how we gain like core team members so this is the core team white list and before your core team member creates their skill wallet you should first whitelist them here so let's white list alex please not alex it's just another metamask account but that's fine um great and now it should work but it's a live demo so who knows here we pray okay great so alex is now a core team member and alex is actually this account that i'm using here so let's see let's see what changes now for us i'm once again injecting i'm alex now uh and here now we can see the core team member roles and this is important because this is how we actually have core team members and once someone is added as a score team member they can actually access the partner the partners dashboard um let's set some commitment level um and now we're going to wait for a bit to upload the nft metadata in ipfs and all of that we confirm the transaction and we're going to see a qr code that we can scan with our mobile device in order to activate the account so okay now we can have core team members um looking around and doing stuff with our dashboard and now let's see what this dashboard can actually do um [Music] that's the qr code okay i'm not gonna scan it now we're still short on time by the way if you have any questions uh oh actually there are some um no nothing okay um if you have any questions um drop it in the chat um so uh a few a few configurations that we can do with our partners dashboard uh if if we're using skill wallet on the mainnet then uh our web component is actually going to check if you're integrating it in the in a domain that is um verified by you and this prevents me from stealing all of your keys or whoever else stealing your keys and integrating your um your authentication system your community and their websites on death this is um this is disabled so because we are hacking and doing stuff and we want to be flexible um so this is one thing that we can do this here tomorrow is going to change very nicely to and you will be able to add your web hook for a specific channel of your discord server where the our um where our app is going to post messages uh whenever you create a task um so stay tuned as you can see we're also hacking around this hackathon and the important part is our events so we have three different types of events and we have released one of them because the other two rely on our discord board that is going to be uh released in the next few weeks one hopefully uh now we have open tasks those are the tasks that are that core team members can create and can um can take and finalize and with by doing so gain interaction counters index um and this is a very nice way to um actually measure value so when you create a task you can select if it's for community or core team let's go for core team you can select for which row uh and how many members should participate let's select all then you just describe your task which is going to be um submit your work for oopsie a bit too much um let's go to submit your don't forget to submit blah blah blah and you create a task again this is live demo and we hope we hope that nothing is going to fail but you never know um now those those tasks are entirely unchained and um there is a little state machine dealing with them you can read in our documentation but basically one core team member uh creates a task and another one can take it and then the creator should finalize it and this way they approve that everything went well and all of that now here is the step well we actually send a message to to your discord server if you have configured your webhook this currently sends it to our discord server uh and now we can see all of the team tests this is one i created earlier and um another team member can can get here and be like yeah i'm going to do that um then they can submit their work and finally i would be able to finalize it we don't have time for this entire flow um but this is basically how the task management uh work within the core team members um on our dashboard and um that's pretty much it for the important part uh the other things that we you can see here is members very nice list of them those are rows currently again it's quite the ghost town um and yeah now we are open to any questions you guys have so thank you milana i i've already answered quite a few questions in the while oh okay i'm sorry i missed one thing i missed one thing if you would like to um we have this api that basically the only thing that it does is to make queries to our contracts and gather a little bit more information about the the skill wallets uh so if you would like to use use the api for displaying something on showcasing something on your app you can see it here you can also find it in the documentation but yeah this is a very simple swagger um and again sorry alex for the interruption it's yeah that was a good one so thank you for interrupting me it was a useful one uh yeah so you can find this uh at uh docs.s uh it's just a simple link api documentation i answered quite a few questions in a while mostly about how to rescue your skill wallet if you lose your device and how to integrate it so uh startup regarding your question i think two days are much more than enough uh all what milan showed you can be done in like five minutes so you can deploy your dao very quickly and that's mainly up to you just to think about what you want your doubt to be so it's more the time that you spend just to write a description to really try to align your values and what you want to share with your community rather than the integration time also as as we mentioned earlier um we designed the the application the top like the dap on the top of our protocol so that anybody can actually create something of value something that really resonates with them even if they are not tech wizards so again like our goal is to bring maximum possible value hiding the the complexity behind it so any other question feel free to take yourself off mute if you want to ask your questions live yeah please any questions welcome well i'm hoping that we are just very very clear [Laughter] we had quite a few questions written once so maybe you know maybe they are just hacking on skill wallet already you know they don't want to hear us anymore right let's show a small quick question can we deploy the agreements partnership and programmatically or should we go only through the dashboard everything that you can do from the dashboard you can also do it by calling smart contracts and the only thing is that it's not currently in our documentation it's not very well documented how to do it outside our dashboard but if this is what you want to do just ping me on discord and i'm going to give you super good instructions okay thanks no worries thank you javier also milan we have another question from jeff is there just one instance of smart wall skill wall okay good um yeah basically with every with every partner's agreement that you sign you deploy a community and the partners agreement contract the skill wallet uh the skill wallet contract is only one it's a nft contract it's erc 121 which allowed a lot of functionality except for being an nft also it's not transferable yes uh your squad is tied to an address basically the address owns the the nft identity maybe i should read those questions before answering yeah so also um well you can read more about this in the documentation but we have quite a few of the upgrades planned for this so it will be more flexible in the future but anyway the the main the main goal of this and then i leave to milana to answer this last question uh the main goal of this is uh to make sure that your identity can grow with you so uh it keeps track of all your reputation uh all the different contributions to make to the different communities and so on without you know switching it many times or being able for example to create infinite wallets just you know to basically uh attack a community or having a random behavior that's it so elena i let you go with the last question and i guess our time is up um yeah so the question is how do we randomize the token ids for the nfts and the answer is that we don't we don't randomize them we start from zero and counter plus one we did not see a reason or value in randomizing them rather it's actually a nice feature because you can see the progression and sometimes also that there are a limited amount of members that the community can have so you can see at what time someone joined and what is the progressive number so whether they were the first in the the alpha the last one very last spot so we made it feature any last of the last questions we we read a lot of questions from you yeah okay okay thank you savarov best of luck with your heck i think there's one more question um that was sent in the chat just now are all data is all the data public um yes all the data is public we have no sensitive data we we try not to steal any data from our users so all of it is public yeah also i mean is the full pseudonymous identity so basically it's just built based around your skills your communities your commitment your work so there is nothing to steal there right so i'm and i think we are done yeah awesome i'll thank you so much alex and melina for taking the time out of your friday evening your time to um host this wonderful workshop for the hackers um as uh alex and elena said they are available on discord um so feel free to reach out to them there and they will be available all weekend they want to give like a like 100 support for all of you um so thank you so much and for the rest of you we do have a team information workshop starting now so check your packer dashboard for that link um if you don't have a team or if you're still looking for members for your team definitely recommend um going there our team member luke is facilitating that call and he's awesome so have a great rest of your fridays or saturdays depending on where you are and yeah thank you thank you bye bye heck
