[Music] good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of the global and i'm excited to welcome all of you to hackfest so you're also watching all of this thing on eatglobal.tv this is what we'll be using for most of this event and this is where we'll be coming back in a few weeks to see everything that came out of the hackathon so all these summits and today's kickoff along with all the event information will be on youtube.tv and stream live so hack fest is organized by eth global and for those of you who are joining us for the first time if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running two things hackathons and summits and this event is going to be no different i'm going to kick us off right after this to our incredible hackath summit for 2022 which is going to cover all the amazing things that are happening in the protocol labs in the decentralized storage ecosystem and following that we'll begin our multi-week long hackathon and all that will also be here on the global.tv so let's go into the hackathon which is what the next 20 to 25 minutes are about and from there we'll just kick right into our first set of talks for the summit this has been an amazing event already we have over 830 acres from 76 different countries spanning 16 different time zones participating all throughout july so it'll be quite an incredible thing to see what comes out of all of this from being able to kind of look at all the hundreds of projects you're all building i'm gonna put everybody on a map to see where everybody is uh coming from and it's so incredible to see so much diversity and representation from so many different continents and and i can't wait to meet all of you um again and reconnect with some of you again in person and also on discord in addition to that we also have 17 incredible ecosystem partners and over 50 mentors who are going to be here hanging out on discord helping ensure that this event is successful for all of you and that you get all the help that you need and to top it all off we're going to be giving away 200 000 in prizes so we're gonna go into some details of what these prizes are and kick right into some of these talks [Music] so let's get right into it the first and the most obvious question we have asked been asked and we want to answer is what can you build this is a fairly common one because this is a very beginner friendly event and some of the ideas and the topics that we are all excited about are as false you can do so much with nfts and making use of decentralized data especially in web3 there's a lot of ways to think about new ways to build social networks and make more sovereign data applications identity and access is going to be a very big theme here for this event and of course this is a general web 3 focused event with a emphasis on decentralized storage but you can build so much around tooling and utilities for everything that you see in the broader web3 ecosystem and to kind of help you get anywhere from the right ideas to some of the best work that you can leverage without kind of having to start from scratch with some amazing partners so i want to quickly thank ipfs and falcoin polygon fluence the graph ceramic covalent lip protocol nft port poep sonar spheron table land orbit valus xmtp labs hyperdap radius and secured finance these are all some of these amazing protocols that you can use and save yourself a lot of time in getting started because they're building so many useful utilities that will plug right into your hackathon project all right so let's go into what the next three weeks are going to look like the goal for the next 20 minutes is to cover how everything from team formation works to how you can get help we're going to talk about all the prizes all the talks and workshops that are happening how judging and submission works and also then we'll blend right into summit with our very first talk by juan binet and speaking of logistics let's talk about communication everything that we're going to be doing will be on discord which means that if you are a hacker attending this event or a mentor or a partner you will be able to see the hack fast 2022 header on your discord sidebar and these are channels that are only visible to the confirmed attendees so please make sure that you have access to these channels and if not go back to each global.com login to your hackfest dashboard and ensure that you connected discord so that you can see all these permissions and on top of that this is also where all the the ways you can reach everybody to get help is which means that they're dedicated channels for getting support there's a mentorship help channel you can ask any questions technical or otherwise you can get help there 24 7 and there's also going to be a channel for every protocol that's out there to actually be able to get help for that specific protocol and on top of all that we're also sending a lot of calendar invites for talks and workshops so that you don't miss anything and the entire schedule is going to be on your dashboard and also on the hack fest website we really want this thing to be as asynchronous as possible so anything that you're able to attend you're more than welcome to join live but even if you're not able to do so with the given times or any other commitment uh you'll be able to catch up by watching the recording and for just a quick reminder the website is fs.global.com all right let's go into how the hackathon is set up officially you can all start hacking now uh you can work individually or also with up to a team of five people you have the next two to two and a half weeks to hack and submit your project and submissions are due on july 24th at 3 pm eastern we'll kind of have ample reminders and all these things will be appearing on your dashboard so you know exactly what to do when but this is the gist of how everything qualifies from the rules speaking of specific rules we want to keep this thing fairly simple fairly simple which is everything that you're going to be doing must be done from scratch which means that you cannot build or continue a pre-existing project uh if you are calling want to qualify for any prices submissions must be related to decentralized storage and must use ipfs or falcoin or any of the relevant ecosystem technology from your dashboard to qualify for a valid submission and only rsvp attendees are eligible to win prizes which means that if you are working with a team and your entire team is not individually registered to attend this event and they do not show up on the team section and you win a prize we will not be able to give you that prize for that team member so please make sure that your all the individual team members are listed on your team dashboard and of course there's a lot of things that we're not going to be able to cover in a short amount of time so if you have any questions obviously feel free to ask anybody on the global discord send us an email or if you're on the global.tv right now feel free to ask those questions right away the calendar invites for all the workshops will just come directly to your email that you use to sign up for this event let's quickly talk about check-ins so check-ins are something we're going to be doing for haccfs and the way they work is fairly straightforward every week we're going to ask a few basic questions on how things are going because this is a multi-week event and you just have to fill out what the check-in asks you which is a are you stuck on anything are you in a position to be on track with what you said you'll be able to accomplish this week and do you need help with anything that is not going well as you kind of do these check-ins you will end up getting closer to the finish line and all of this will happen through your dashboard there'll be two check-ins for the course of this event one every week and we will be able to make sure that nobody is in a way just basically stuck and we're able to help you succeed as part of this hackathon and as we kind of roll into those two check-ins we will get closer and closer to judging which is going to be to the submission deadline which is going to be two and a half weeks from now and that is again as a reminder on july 24th the sunday at 3 p.m eastern as we kind of passed the judging submission deadline and judging officially begins and judging will be a one-day event on the 25th of monday and there are two ways to go about it there's a main judging track to qualify for a finalist prize and a sponsored judging track which is asynchronous on the main judging you'll all be invited to a zoom call where you're going to be able to present what you built and do a demo of your project to our judges and that's gonna happen from 12 to 2 30 p.m eastern all these details again will be available on your dashboard you'll have the ability to understand and specify various different pieces here whether it's the prizes you're going for or some time zone related issues or anything in between and if you pick a price that you're qualifying for for one of our amazing partners they'll just be able to look at all of those things on their own and ping you if they have any questions so all of the sponsor pieces and the prize related things from a partner are all asynchronous quick notes on judging the you will be given four minutes to think about preparing a demo in this event the demo is only allowed as a video submission which means that you will have to record a up to four minute video of what you built and this is what everybody will be using to review what you did so that's our are judging as well as our partners for for sponsor prizes and this is what's required so we really kind of encourage you to not do this thing last minute it takes a lot of time um to make sure that everything you do is able to fit in a four-minute window so please make sure that you submit and all this ahead of time and prepare and leave at least two hours for figuring out anything that you need to do from a submission ready and all of this will come in on your dashboard as well and we'll have references to how you can make a really good video from showing you past examples and details around how all of this actually works and of course we really know that this is a lot of a lot of you are here hundreds of you are here kind of are starting your website journey for the first time as part of this event so don't don't worry there's a lot of things that we have planned for everybody whether you're a beginner or an expert there's a lot of talks and panels and workshops all of them starting today and some of them already started yesterday we do of course have a summit right after this thing that's going to cover some of the interesting things happening in this ecosystem and more details about how the events set up anywhere from check-ins to judging to submissions to best practices to learning resources all that is also on your info center which is the notion link available from your dashboard and of course if you are in a different time zone with other commitments that's all totally okay because all of the content here is recorded which means that two minutes after any workshop ends you can go to youtube.comglobal and watch that whole thing again on demand [Music] and to see where all these things are and when everything is happening you can just head over to fs.ethglobal.com all right let's go into prizes so when i cover some of the amazing prizes that we have here for this event i'm going to start off with a quick message from ipfsn falcone hi everyone and welcome to the third edition of hack fs my name is lucas and i co-lead the builders program for ipfs and filecoin super excited to be kicking off this event with you today let me start with a super brief refresh on the tech that i'm here to get you excited about ipfs is the interplanetary file system and it's also what puts fs in the name of hackfs it's a new and revolutionary protocol to address and route and discover content on the internet and what's revolutionary about it is that it addresses content by what it is instead of where it is and we call that content addressing now instead of asking one central server for a piece of content you can ask a whole network of peers for that piece and any of them can serve it to you it's kind of like a better more resilient and distributed version of http filecoin is a competitively priced crypto powered network of over 4 000 storage providers across the world and it uses ipfs and the beauty of content addressing and then leverages the power of cryptographic proofs and economic incentives to make sure that the content addressed files and folders are actually safely stored it's kind of like an airbnb for storage where the protocol allows you to make a storage deal with any number of providers which is the replications here and then also for any length of time right so you can step stack them sequentially over time behind one another now together these protocols really form the foundation of things built in the web3 world at the same time they're also fundamentally hard to interact with that's why before you run off hacking i'd love to encourage you to consider using one of the storage helpers that abstract away a lot of the complexity and let you focus your time on where it matters the most solving real problems for users and other developers there are many already of these storage helpers and maybe you'll build another one but we still need a solution for video storage for example i'd like to call out two specifically that exist already one is nft dot storage and and the other is web3 dot storage please check out their websites to learn more it really makes it a lot easier to interact with ipfs and firecrane and you get all the benefits of content addressing and persistent storage cool with that i'll leave you to it please check out the challenge statements and prizes to get inspired watch our workshops to learn more about our tech and talk to us in office hours on discord etc to really make sure all your questions are answered and then finally hack and submit a project we have a hundred thousand dollars up for grabs and i'm excited to see how you will um help us make the internet better thanks so much amazing that was a an awesome overview of what i'm going to go into details for from lucas so from ipfs and falcon there are a hundred thousand dollars in prizes being awarded so let's jump right into it there's a lot of different categories of how you can make a really cool integration that leverages decentralized storage which is through ipfs and content ids so for the storage wizard category the first place winner is going to be getting fifteen thousand dollars and there's going to be two ten thousand dollar second place runner-up prizes and then two five thousand dollar third place prices the exact specifics of all these things are on the price page which is also listed on your dashboard but i'll just cover the high level categories here there's a storage uh other category which is 20 000 divided between top 30 projects as a pulled price so 30 teams that are winners of this category will be splitting twenty thousand dollars equally on top of all of that they're really kind of interesting categories that you can make sure that your hack and submission can touch and be uh can leverage so the best use of web web3 storage rnt storage uh protocols and apis will be receiving twenty five hundred dollars three to three teams there's gonna be three other teams for the best gaming metaverse and dow related hack uh there's a category for the best daily use hack that you can build to also receive twenty five hundred dollars for up to three teams there's a category for the best social good hack that also is going to be giving 2 500 and a category of being able to import something to web 3 so as long as you qualify for building that web three yet act uh you are also eligible to win up to three plays a three-part sorry up to eligible to win 2 500 the exact specifics all these things on what qualifies is going to be listed on the price page and we'll cover all of that at the end next up we have polygon and i'm going to bring on steph to share more hey hack fs gmgm i'm steph rapilia and i'm a developer relations engineer at polygon polygon is the leading platform for ethereum scaling and infrastructure development we have tons of different solutions you can build on top of including polygon pos which is our proof of stake blockchain solution we have zk solutions polygon edge which is a private blockchain and we've also just announced polygon id and identity solution that you'll be able to build on very very soon we also have tons of data availability solutions to check out in our docs polygon is built for developers by developers if you're already a solidity dev building on ethereum amazing you're also already a polygon dev because all of the different tooling you're used to whether that's remix hard hat truffle it all has a one-to-one mapping so you can use those same things when you're building on polygon one of my favorite things about building on polygon is scaling so you get all of the security that you would have with ethereum but you get even faster transactions and up to 10 000 less in gas fees amazing so when you're building you can either deploy on our polygon mumbai testnet or the polygon mainnet and you'll be in good company because over 29 000 daps have already deployed to our main net and we've also had over 1 billion transactions and over 1 million recorded addresses so during this hackathon we are giving away fifteen thousand dollars in prizes uh and you can read more about those on our website you can also post in our sponsored channel on discord if you run into any issues raha and i would love to help you out or you can find us on twitter at xerox polygon devs or if you tag on polygon we'll see that and repost that can't wait to see what you all build good luck and to kind of go directly into the polygon prizes there's a lot of money being given away for all these amazing categories which boils down to the best products that are actually deployed on polygon that also leverage web3 storage or just in storage in general so the first place is going to get 5000 the second place team is going to get 3 000 and the third place will be receiving 2 000 and there's going to be five one thousand dollar category uh runner-ups uh that are going to win these prizes from polygon now again let's jump into the rest of the prizes here so we have fluence and the best use of fluents for off chain compute we'll be receiving 3 500 and 1500 for the first and second place and the best p2p protocol submission that uses fluence will be receiving 3 500 and also 1500 for the first and second place then we have the graph so the best use of an existing graph sub graph and for on the graph explorer we'll be receiving 3 500 1 500 for the first second third place price and if you want to create a sub graph so the best subgraph submission that leverages and makes the best use of your new data and application will be receiving also 3 500 1 000 and 500 for the first second and third place next up we have ceramic so for ceramic you can win 2500 for making the most kind of innovative application that leverages the ceramic sdk to win 1500 you can make a really interesting tool that leverages any of the sdks that ceramic is offering in addition to identity and if you are integrating ceramic with another prize or another sdk for another partner from this event you can also win one thousand dollars for that best collaborative integration then we have covalent so covalent is offering a full price of five thousand dollars which means that anybody who is using covalent apis as long as you're using it in a meaningful way all teams that end up using that will be splitting five thousand dollars individually amongst themselves next up we have lit protocol so the best use of key pair apps and tools that leverages the sdk will be receiving 2500 and the best application that brings on private data to the open web will be receiving 2500 as well then we have nft port and nft port is also offering a pool price which means that any team that is making meaningful use of the nft port sdks and and the protocol will be splitting five thousand dollars equally next up we have poap and the co-op prizes are going to be given for the best integration of the poep protocol so the first second and third place winners of this team of the sub prize will be receiving 2 500 1 000 and 500 respectively and there's also a pool prize category of 1 000 which means that all the other integrations will be splitting 1 000 equally amongst themselves next up we have sonar and the sonar prizes are for second and third place for twenty five hundred fifteen hundred and thousand dollars and the category qualifier is the best p2p integration of decentralized identity in your project so as long they're using sonar for that identity related application you're building you can win five thousand dollars here in total then we have spheron and zeron is going to be offering two hundred dollars each to the top ten projects who use round to host their web apps and leverage decentralized storage next up we have table land so tableland is offering one thousand dollars for the best integration and use of table land and a pool price category of four thousand dollars which means that any team that is using basically a relational database that's web3 native uh uh in a meaningful way we'll be splitting four thousand dollars with them equally then we have orbit and the best project utilizing orbit will be receiving one orbit star which is currently at 4 8 then we have dallas this is an amazing one because this also actually is a project that came out of hackafest two years ago and actually last year and became a company and the best projects that use the publishing sdk for vales will be receiving the four projects will receive each in a pool price category of two thousand dollars which means anybody who uses values sdk will be able to split three thousand dollars amongst them equally then we have xmtp labs and xmtp

well and the best hyperdap integration of the d5 app will be receiving 500 for this category so these are all of our prizes and to learn about the exact specifics of what qualifies to get the documentation or the workshops or anything you want to know about each of these prizes you can head over to fs.deepglobal.com prizes all right and finally before we jump right into our summit i want to make sure that uh you all really take the time to enjoy this experience we really want this thing to be fun for all of you we don't want this to be exhausting this is a reason why it's set up to be multi-weeks this gives you the flexibility to really understand what's happening in the space and learn about how everything is moving into this new direction and the goal for these events is very much to be about experimentation and learning so please face yourself and if you have any questions there's hundreds of people here on our discord to help you learn and be unblocked and really want to make sure that you have a good memorable and fun experience getting into web3 and with that happy hacking you can all head over to our discord by going to global.com discord and from here we are going to jump right into our summit so welcome again to everybody joining us for just the summit piece we just finished the logistics of how the next few weeks are set up for the hackathon and this brings us to our hack fest 2022 summit this one is super exciting for me personally because there's so much happening i'm going to give a quick overview of all the talks we have planned today and then we'll jump right into our very first amazing talk so we're going to kick off with juan coming on talking about how we do really good coordination at scale um nba regen then we're going to jump into a panel with juan and kevin from git coin about how do we actually think about the state of public goods funding right now and how do we make that better then we have david and chris talking about how we actually automate more things in web3 whether it's thinking about it as identity or serverless functions or just ways to do more things asynchronously at scale from a computing standpoint then we're going to bring on some amazing previous winners from hack fest to talk about their journey post hackathons who are now continuing to build their projects and turn them into company companies and on top of that we're going to bring on lucas again from the protocol labs team to talk about how you can get support if you are interested in pursuing more and turning your process into more than just a hackathon project then we're going to have ali talk about falcoin's vm and retrieval market a lot more so we're going to give a future look into how everything is evolving in the falcon ecosystem and then karine and alvin are going to talk about estuary and how they're able to manage so much data at scale and anywhere from how it works under the hood to how you can leverage this thing as you continue to build on this ecosystem and then danny's going to talk about decentralized trust and web3 as a built-in primitive and then we're going to also do another panel with lucas ian and thanks about how do you actually make this interesting and if you're looking into advancing your web 3d career how you can actually think about solving and building towards just some existing really well known and tough problems in this space and some frameworks to actually help look at all that so that's a lot of talking from me and on the overview so what i want to do next is really welcome our very first speaker on stage which is juan bane the founder of protocol labs and he's going to talk about how to be a better regen so without further ado juan welcome back and excited to have you again thank you so much uh really excited to be here uh in the third hack fest right uh this is so awesome uh i can't wait for uh so many to have some anymore uh really great to be here with everybody um what i'm gonna talk about today is um why uh being regen matters uh in in our space and i wanna suggest a bunch of strategies for how to do that and how to build tooling that can solve extremely large scale planetary problems by breaking down some large swath of of things into smaller smaller smaller problems than how to use uh measuring of the world to derive some data and then use that data to put it into things like ipfs uh how to then use that use a smart contracts to uh incentivize positive action and therefore creating a regen loop uh to a solve that problem and b create value that can then help solve more problems so i'm going to share my screen let's see let me know if you can see that everything's good great awesome so the um the title of this talk is uh in general um if regen whack me else and gmi and i'll go into detail as to kind of why that why that matters um and i'm gonna be talking about uh these concepts around uh regenerative crypto economics and prioritopia and a lot of the the the ideas and memes um from the green pill movement um and so here's a the cover of the greenfield um uh book from kevin owaki uh who will join us um a little bit later and uh you know uh i'll be using a lot of illustrations from uh from that book to go through uh some of these concepts and then i'm gonna go through um and kind of make it really practical in terms of um what are the how to sort of approach building a region application or regen system um that can solve some large problem in in the world and uh uh as we bring a lot of that will have to do with you know how we grab data from from the world and we feed it into uh into these systems and how we create um incentive structures to cause those actions uh so um this roughly the the outline of the talk um we're going to go through regional crypto econ we're going to talk about how to achieve prior utopia first of all what it is and why we want to achieve it and then how to um we're going to go through a few examples uh one is around climate change um another about uh kind of how to accelerate progress um and then going to leave you with some ideas and um you know how to um how to get involved in the region movement uh like i mentioned before uh you know highly recommend um checking out uh the greenfield book and checking out the podcasters but there's a lot of really really good uh conversations uh happening um this uh super uh promising movement um and i think it's it i'm basically as excited about regen crypto econ as um as i was excited about crypto in the very beginning of like 2011 2012. um so i think this is going to grow into something super powerful uh long term and you know this is still uh very early uh and we're already seeing some some really promising things so uh uh and a huge kudos to to um uh the book uh to kevin and the uh the amazing designer i uh forgot their name but uh amazing designer who who um uh created these amazing illustrations uh or rather i don't know their name i need to find out that name so i can create them properly uh because these illustrations very much help convey the message so let's take the green pill together um the tldr of the book is that you know first and foremost humanity is faced with this massive scale uh set of coordination failures and these coordination failures create massive risks to our um to our society and our lives and pretty much everything we care about so it's all about coordination at the end of the day and it's coordination failures that cause these problems so when you think about things like climate change or things like um uh just hunger these days or uh lack of shelter in in for many people around the world um or just certain problems not being solved fast enough like um not having cures to certain diseases and so on all of these problems always come down to some kind of coordination failure because we have this enormous amount of potential and capability um as a species and it's just how do we coordinate our species to um cause significant action against those problems and how to coordinate our solutions so um the kind of general um broader macro thinking about all these issues is that everything's broken and everything sucks and it's basically kind of a dumeris perspective and in the region movement we sort of reject those narratives and instead um replace that with a super grounded and optimistic and really kind of um thoughtful perspective that if you break those problems down into smaller and smaller bits you can often solve them and coordinate groups of people at the relevant scale to solve those problems and you can bootstrap those solutions into larger and larger solutions so the broader web3 world and especially blockchains and and cryptograms and so on can be tremendously powerful to be able to um to coordinate groups of people of arbitrary sizes you could coordinate small groups of people you can coordinate large groups of people you can coordinate groups of organizations you can coordinate entire large-scale communities uh you can coordinate uh across many companies or organizations you can coordinate nation states uh potentially like we can probably get to you know a kind of scale like that and because of that you you this moment is super special that me this means that you have a tremendous uh opportunity as you're um learning about all of these systems uh as you're learning about um how to build uh crypto economic structures and how to build um systems to incentivize action and by again people in small groups or large groups or organizations so on and so your opportunities to be able to take these tremendously powerful primitives and use them to create um these uh regenerative structures that can have positive externalities that can create that can solve those problems and create value for uh people around around the world in all kinds of um kinds of ways and and so usually you'll sort of orient towards some problem that you really care about and if you um think about that problem in terms of a coordination problem and how to coordinate the relevant people involved to solve the problem um you can use region cryptogenomics and data gathering and so on to incentivize collective action against those problems so in the long term if we can do this right we could create a tremendously powerful movement that can solve uh planetary scale problems and i think it's it's a super exciting um set of possibilities uh and it's i think one of the best uh ranges of applications in that all of the web3 tech and all of the crypto con um that we've built over the last um uh decade or so uh can can really give uh so at the end of the day it's all about coordination so let's uh so let's now define a lot of these things kind of more completely so what is crypto economics economics is a kind of blend of different fields of study across uh many different disciplines so think of things like economics and game theory and law and ethics think of computer science and cryptography think of optimization and control theory think of systems engineering think of all of these pieces um together uh with which are often like highly technical subjects with the kind of social sciences of governance and political science and community management and commerce management and so on and break bring all these things together into a field of study that can blend uh important technical mechanism design with uh achieving some social or economic or or um group goal and and the goal is to kind of build these structures by you know think of being able to create these mechanisms and deploy them out into the world and have them as sort of freestanding structures that people can interact with or groups can interact with or organizations can interact with and be coordinated um coordinate with other parties through uh the medium of these these mechanisms that we deploy into into the world uh and so you know uh to be to be able to kind of create crypto economic systems you that this means uh you're designing economies but those economies are social systems and they're highly complex systems and so on uh so there's there's kind of a lot of um this involves it is fundamentally multidisciplinary um and it touches a lot of things and uh the the uh the bad news is that they're we're not sitting on kind of decades of um thought about these subjects so there's no like tons of textbooks yet that they kind of rigorously describe everything but we're building those now and and we're a lot of the knowledge about crypto economic systems uh is findable on the web it's final financiable through blog posts it's findable through talks uh through books like this one um and so on but but just bear in mind that this is a super green field and not just green in terms of regen uh but also green in terms of um it's very new and and that means there's a lot of theory to to figure out still and a lot of theory to put into practice and and so on it's a great time to enter the field uh but it'll be a lot of kind of um relating across what many people are doing and staying abreast of a lot of a lot of changes and so on um so think of uh current economics as kind of not being directed in any way you you can think of that you know different economic structures that you might make might be extractive or or might be um just sustainable uh or something like that or you often we talk in economic structures about building resilient systems systems that can absorb shocks and recover um but but now there's a there's a another kind of kind of system there which is which can be regenerative that over time um the particip the actions of the system uh coordinate the participants to create more value that over time build more and more resources and this is a key distinction that i think a lot of people often miss about these kinds of economic systems you hear a lot of a lot of the world be very focused on sustainability and and that tends to be about you know moving away from extractive or or um extractive systems or depletive systems that are just kind of uh destroying things over basically spending resources down um and they said there's an emphasis on on getting to a sustainable point where uh you can re you you can create um as many resources back into the system so you kind of find a good equilibrium but we're talking about here is creating systems that are not just uh sustainable in terms of um being in that in that spot and i'm not just resilient in terms of being able to absorb shocks but instead systems that um are able to to take some fraction of those resources and generate more resources over time that means that there's some economic activity that is creating value over time um and this is a super key point that you'll see again and again which which is what enables this um this amazing scalability if you can if you can build a system that solves some problem and over time is generating more value along the way um you can then scale that solution uh to solve larger and larger and larger problems uh so what one worth uh one thing worth describing is you know think of um the the coordination failures and and as the sort of like great pill of hey everything is kind of uh messed up and it's really difficult to fix and and these problems are so big that nobody can um can solve them and whatnot and just remember that humanity is tremendously powerful in terms of our capabilities and when we work together against these problems and we coordinate well we can achieve tremendously amazing things and so every kind of amazing uh human achievement over the last um you know thousands tens of thousands of years and so on um you can break down into some large-scale coordination often involving lots of people often involving people across centuries or thousands of years but at the end of the day it's all kind of broken down into systems of of action that coordinate sometimes down at the the level of a single individual so you can take on these tremendously complex very difficult sys problems and create coordination structures that organize us to to solve these problems uh and so this is this is a there's a a meme around moloch uh i won't go into detail here but uh somebody more on mall which is sort of like the demon uh uh of coordination failures and so on is it it's useful to kind of visualize the the coordination failures as a specific uh enemy that you have to fight and you can think of using cryptoeconomics as sort of like the weapon that you're using to to fight molok this is part of the the uh narrative of of the regen movement which is uh hey like there's a very concrete uh enemy in mind here like coordination failures are not just um uh abstract things like think of them as like a concrete thing that you're gonna fight uh and then your um your tool of choice your weapon of choice is this uh regional crypto econ that that you can use to organize uh lots of people solve those problems uh there's also this like really awesome part of the um of the kind of um broader like greenfield movement which is that um we there's like this amazing loop where uh that kevin has pointed out in it but anyway all of what i've said so far and like all the pages here um huge uh credit to kevin um and you can hear it from him in a little bit uh because i'm probably getting uh some of the stuff wrong but um there's like this there's amazing kind of feedback loop where as um people come into web 3 and crypto the volatility and the system and the booms and busts in the crypto world with like the summers and the winters and so on create this structure where the um the volatility sort of ends up drawing a lot of people which initially start in the degen camp uh where people are just kind of very focused on uh financialized use cases and or overly financialized uh structures and kind of the potential and ability to to make a lot of money draws a lot of people into into into the community but then over time as the volatility plays out and so on especially in downturns um uh those people are now have learned a lot about about crypto they've gone through the activation um uh problem of having to spend a lot of time and effort to learn about crypto and but now they're in the community they start interacting with a lot of other people in the space um they learn about a bunch of other problems and they start realizing that they can coordinate with each other to solve those problems and usually there's this kind of pathway of going from being a dj all the way to to becoming a regent and eventually you get to the um the the whack me uh perspective that you know wagner for those of you who don't know it is we're all gonna make it and and here's uh how we're gonna get it get there uh so the the uh i'm gonna pick a piece here uh because now that i've sort of established the core concepts i want to get to um you know very practical but very practically how we how we work on these systems um but a few more a few more slides of concepts so think of um think of classifying the the the range of of problems that you interact with and so on either as an individual in general there's many ways of classifying these things or as groups and societies and and the whole planet um as being about ultimately some some set of uh ultimately being able to build the structures that um can support you as an individual or support you as a group um and and create value for you as an individual or you as a group and so on and a lot of the times you end up with these these uh structures that are uh shared resources from communities uh often that are um fundamental to achieving uh many of the critical uh things that people need so think of physiological needs uh from like the traditional masters hierarchy uh as relating very closely to a set of public infrastructure that we think um all people in the world should have things like shelter uh things like food and water things like um being able to just exist and and survive and um and thrive and and so on and then you can think of even things like safety and um being able to have access to resources to be able to to do things or being able to um uh orient towards uh working on problems that you care about and so on uh as being uh also reliant and on many kinds of public infrastructure uh and so on and you can keep keep going but at the end of the day there are individual kind of private goods that that matter here uh but when you kind of zoom and which often get talked about a lot uh because usually private goods have to be sold in a market and so they tend to relate to marketing departments and usually there's all kinds of private goods that um have lots of people involved kind of marketing their their use but when you zoom way out like most of the things that you interact with on a day-to-day basis and that yield your current state and that have created value for you are actually public goods they're goods that you have access to because civilization has created fundamental infrastructure to enable you to enjoy the benefits of those goods things like roads things like access to water things like um clean air things like um a supply chain for food and and so on so these kinds of systems at the end of the day uh end up being these these broad-based civilizational scale uh infrastructure that is that there are public goods but in general public goods tend to not have a kind of group that is um uh benefiting or profiting or incentivized to to kind of grow their their access and so you end up with in a world where public goods don't have a marketing department and so you don't you don't end up not thinking about them as much and they don't even show up often in measures like gdp and so on but but in general most of the value that that humanity has um has gotten to and has been able to create is tied up in in public goods it is about um republicans so i uh the the world of startups is often so focused on private goods because that's the easiest and most straightforward way to get to get to a market but i really encourage you to to take that regional perspective to take the um the view that um creating value for um a broad swath of society and for the artists of the civilizational scale often relates more to the creation of public goods as opposed to the creation of private goods uh so uh what is the distinction here so think of private goods and public goods as you know um private goods are things like things that you might buy and that are under um um on a store or something like that and the goods that are uh usually the definition tends to be around being excludable excludable and rivalrous so things excludable means that when you use it um uh somebody else uh uh so sorry uh exploitable is that there's a structure where um you can exclude whether or not people can uh can use a thing so think of um being able to get a specific piece of clothing and and you have it and somebody else uh does not have access to it um think of also as intellectual property intellectual property idea of ip is also kind of um is a way of creating excludability and non-excludability in in the use of ideas and that was a very intentional mechanism that was created centuries ago for a for purpose um and uh uh and then think of rivalries and non-rival as just dividing whether or not um uh having the thing prevents somebody else from having the thing right so if you eat a piece of food or something like that that means that somebody else can't eat eat that food uh but that's not the case for say uh parks or air or or information and so on now of course like there's ultimately matter and information involved and so on so there is some like capacity constraints uh but for the most part there is just some um you kind of end up in this plentiful bountiful spot where just um you can generally see something as just not really rivalrous because um everybody can have uh can have some of it or or all they need without kind of infringing on somebody else's need for that thing so we kind of want to be in the in the in the bottom right right quadrant where you you're in the kind of uh non-bridal or non-excludable uh environment where you can create something that everybody can benefit from and where you can't quite you can't it's not oriented towards excluding people from from use uh the problem though is that this non-excludability makes it really difficult to gen to create um value capture loops or not capture but value harnessing loops that enable the value creation in that quadrant to flow back to that quadrant so to give an example um when you create a private good uh you can go and sell that in the market and you can charge money for it and somebody can pay you money and so on and you as the creator of that good can now take that money and if you made some margin you can deploy that margin into making more of that good so you have a very straightforward feedback loop between creating a thing selling it in a marketing market making a profit and being able to sell more of that over time and it's really difficult to do that for public goods um public goods tend to be paid for by communities or governments or things like that because there isn't a straightforward way to create a um a regenerative loop in there or is there and that's the key point is like can you create economic structures around public goods that by using those goods and by um by participating in those communities you can create a positive reinforcing feedback loop of value creation within that good itself and if you can kind of create a self-sustaining system like that um then you can just create a public good uh create a financial structure around it that then um enables the greater production of that open good uh that public good so think of it as kind of being able to um uh using regenerative crypto economic structures can um work around public goods in a way that creates a financial structure that allows them to succeed and over time create more and more and more value for more people so i mentioned ip or intellectual property um in a moment and so this is where centuries ago uh people realized that it was actually quite difficult to incentivize the creation of knowledge and the creation of devices and so on or or even um the the creation of like creative uh food it turns out that one of the earliest uh notions of intellectual property was around uh being able to prepare uh food dishes so in greece in a specific city i forgot which one um they had like a rule that if they if a uh if a cook came up with a very like delicious dish uh that like the community um uh thought was like worthy enough uh that they could get an exclusive license to just uh to be the only people to be able to serve that dish for at least one year um and then you know eventually after that everybody could could make it and so that was an incentive to cause people to um have that one extra year of being able to profit from the creation and the invention of that of that knowledge and then share it with everybody describe how to use it and so on um uh and so but that license was a a mechanism that that community came up with in order to be able to create a profit loop or a kind of self-reinforcing structure to enable creative uh uh people to be able to make that creative uh food uh the problem though is that that shifted something that could be a public good which is the recipe of how to make that thing uh and shifted that into um added excludability it created it turned it into sort of a club good where um uh only the the person only the inventor of that food was able to profit from knowing that recipe for a period of time in a sense this is kind of how patents work if you create a patent around some piece of knowledge so think of a piece of knowledge as a public good and if you create a patent your shift over the uh that public good into a club good only if you have the license um afforded by the patent or whatever do you get to use uh the technology and so this kind of way patents are really like bad for knowledge and bad for um creative distribution and so on it's because they exclude the broader broad use and and that includability means that it's difficult to build with them and so on uh now there could be alternatives to to these kinds of structures we could find an economic structure around knowledge generation and invention and so on that is non-excludable that anybody can use the invention um but it's not um and it has a built-in financial structure that enables the regeneration of that of that uh good but it um it doesn't shift it over to this club good structure that suddenly becomes excludable uh so that's possible um uh there's you know somebody said a lot of other people have proposed um potential mechanisms for this uh but this is kind of like an unsolved problem in general this there's no good solution for this sort of thing yet um however maybe you will come up with something like this um and if you uh want to explore things like that uh this this this hackathon and many others uh to come our gray down great avenues for this kind of thing uh cool so um the the last thing i want to leave you here with and in this section is that at the end of the day um web3 is a a shelling point for hopeful people who see the potential to solve all these problems and want to use um uh mechanism design to solve those issues and web3 has sort of attracted a lot of people from from many walks of life to um build with these super powerful uh components and tools uh to be able to you know tackle these these problems uh so uh great i'm gonna uh move forward through through some of these uh here let me uh the one thing i wanna wanna um have as well as one thing i wanna mention is is we i mentioned mechanism design multiple times uh at the end of the day um this is the so this concept that comes from economics and game theory and so on uh a mechanism is a um structure that changes a certain financial or economic mechanism is a is a structure that changes the nature of some game uh and so think of a game as um so the word game isn't it's not ideal but like the sort of like intricate game theory here is that um we use the word game to describe a system where there are agents that are participating um in in a structure with some resources and they have some set of actions they can take and when they take those actions they either get more resources or lose resources so that's a very general definition but you can think of that as a as a game of chess or where uh each there are two agents and the agents are playing pieces and deciding what they move and so on and they either get more points uh because they capture pieces or they might actually win the game uh by by um kind of uh checking uh checkmating the other player or something like that that's an example of a game but you can also think of a game as the participation of group groups in around a uh a commons you can think of being able to access a public park um and having to to do some work to be able to access it and there's a mechanism in place that sort of maybe measures who is working uh working to maintain help maintain the maintain the park and who gets therefore to enjoy the park and so think of the economic structure of the participants uh around the park in working on the park to make sure that the value of that park uh stays stays high and so on um and these each player spends some resources um in doing that maintenance work um and the other day you can aggregate all the uh expenditures of all of all parties and and what they're putting into the park to make sure that the park is flourishing over time and so on so you can think of designing mechanisms that can that can uh coordinate the the activity of those of those participants um towards you know producing that that that good outcome and so think of like um at the end of the day you're dealing with agents that are coordinating in some large large scale resource landscape and you can use mechanisms to orient their activity or interactions and to get them to a spot where they can coordinate and arrive at better better outcomes so all these kinds of games tend to suffer from uh from potential failures where the structure of the game can yield defection as like the the equilibrium spot as opposed to collaboration and so the classic example um is the personal dilemma where uh you have a case where um i'm going to detail here like you have a case where uh there are two potential prisoners that could either um uh tell on each other or um and so they could cooperate and like stay silent uh or they can betray each other and kind of um uh accuse each other and if they coordinate they both get a little bit of a punishment um but but not too much if they betray the other party then they get no punishment but the other party uh suffers a lot now however if both betray each other they both end up doing worse and so the point here is that the the unfortunate equilibrium is in um in the case when both parties betray however you can use contracts and structures to and mechanisms to achieve coordination um so think think of um uh think about mechanism design and using mechanisms to to be able to coordinate groups out of situations like that where where you end up in this kind of coordination failure and this is the coordinate failure that i was describing before at the end of the day it the the macro scale coordination failures like climate change all boil down to some some kinds of games like this and usually again you end up with um games that are stacked on top of each other and so you games that are very small scale and games that are very large scale and they end up all kind of relating to each other in this kind of very large dimensional surface and and so on however you but you can use mechanism design to sort of warp the incentives of these structures to arrive at higher and higher coordination so you can end up in in better spots um one of the concepts i want to introduce here is that the difference between zero-sum games and positive some games so zero-sum games are the um idea is the idea that like there's some kind of fixed set of resources and either when one agent um gets more resources that necessarily means that other people get less resources that's not the case for all games um so uh that may be true about like things like chess and so on but there are positive some games like um uh when when you think about like um playing a uh playing in the park or something like that that could be a um a a case where people are coming together they're having fun together uh they're spending time with each other and though all parties are kind of spending some of the resources by going there by spending their time by maybe uh eating some food together or whatever and like they're losing some resources they're actually creating a lot of value together and for each other and they end up in this like highly positive game dynamic where um they're creating much more value than than everyone brought in now there are like very concrete uh positive some games here which include things like education and things like invention and so on like when people invent things and invent uh solutions they end up benefiting tremendously from those solutions but so does everybody else so think of the the broader research program of the world like in in science uh as a massively positive some game where everybody's trying to learn as much as possible about the world and as we derive um solutions and and so on to various problems we can all benefit from those solutions and we can scale the the scale the broad utility um there's a so at the end of that you can use kind of these crypto economic um analyses of the world like where you can think of the the game dynamics and the game theory and so on you can think of you know all these kind of um incentive structures and and you can think of like the different um surfaces uh to to optimize and you can think of many different systems sort of stacking together and superimposing and so you end up with like highly complex landscapes where um sometimes it's not even clear clear or obvious what an agent should should be doing um but but but often you can sort of like warp the incentive structure so so much in one direction you can make it super clear that that's the action that everybody should take so so think of like all particular interactions around um modern systems as being like just this highly nested environment where there's just so many different incentive structures all stacked at any one moment in time and if you want to kind of cause significant action you sometimes have to have very very powerful mechanisms that just cause action despite you know the presence of games that you can't you don't even know are there in some cases uh cool i'm gonna um uh move forward from here one second switch over to a different uh structure uh cool so um there was a lot of introduction but but but i think it's it's valuable because um often you uh things like game theory and things like crypto economics and things like mechanism design design can feel very intractable or or unapproachable or difficult and so on and so i hope that that introduction um helped many of you who have maybe never never heard about game theory never heard about um crypto economics or things or maybe have heard about it but don't know what it is um hopefully that was kind of like a like a smooth introduction um and can maybe inspire you to uh learn more about it and and so on now i want to kind of describe one concept that that uh i think is really crucial to think about it it relates to this positive some dynamic that i just described which is spartatopia um think of an environment um you you can think of like the the broad world as as kind of in general getting dramatically better over time like the past few centuries um have uh seen this just tremendous broad global improvement uh almost on almost any every single measure that we can think of in terms of human the human condition so things like things like mortality or child mortality or um the prevalence of disease or literacy or access to shelter or food and so on like basically living out of poverty along almost every metric that we can think of humanity has has been uh broadly improving over the last few centuries uh at the same time this in this century we have extremely difficult challenges to to solve so there are now existential risks of which human uh cost existential risks are perhaps like the most pressing um where we really have to coordinate extremely well at massive scales to be able to kind of to to be able to survive so um the species is now at a at a point where what we know how to do in our capabilities plus the the the things that we now know were there all along but we just weren't aware of so things like super volcanoes and asteroids and so on which which are kind of you know could cause extinction events too um we now have the knowledge to be able to survive events like that um so uh it might be surprising to many of you to hear but like the the species have sorry the the planet has gone through about seven uh massive extinction events that wiped out most of the species on the planet um and so uh hopefully or maybe we're the seventh actually i think like humanity human cost um uh disasters uh or like the human cost um the human cost extension event for for most other species in the planet is i think going to become the seventh biggest case now it would be great if like we don't cause our own extinction and it would be great to kind of avert that disaster and stop um causing the extinction of so much other life and it'd be great to get a spot where we and so many other living systems can survive and thrive now in order to do that we're gonna have to coordinate extremely well uh we're gonna have to make it through through by continuing to avoid nuclear war um we're gonna have to solve climate change we're gonna have to make sure that uh humanity doesn't end up engineering a bunch of pandemics that that wipe us out and we're gonna have to do things like align agi and so on and these are all extremely difficult problems however you can use coordination systems to to solve these things at the end of the day all of these problems come down to coordination failures and this entry is made even like trickier because we have this kind of computing phase transition problem in the picture where uh ever since we kind of invented computers very early on um we they've been in this kind of um uh compounding set of technological revolutions in kind of every decade there's just this greater and greater uh set of capabilities afforded by by computing uh to the point where we we now have these we will walk around with super computers in our pockets and we have the internet and so on um and we're now going to be able to make things like um large-scale robotic systems and we'll have things like um virtual worlds and we'll have things like brain computer interfaces and eventually things like agi systems and whatnot and all of those things um represent a huge transition for for the species and for for other other living systems um and this kind of phase transition that we're hitting as a species is one of the the hardest things to uh make sure uh make sure it goes right um and so the the we're gonna have to like coordinate very well uh against this now now one broader picture here is that um the macroeconomic systems that we have in the world are not very well set up to solve these kinds of problems in in general kind of the the broader macro coordination structures are um breaking down in a bunch of ways and they're not coordinating well against these kinds of problems so we're left with the the requirement that we have to use other solutions to to solve these kinds of problems now there's this really useful concept um called paradotopia um that is due to eric drexler and mark miller uh who are kind of some of the first people that talked about also tangentially smart contracts and things like that um and and the concept that i kind of want to describe is that it normally we talk about like uh series on games as as games and structures where um you have that so it's not like this line of resource expenditure between the two agents so here's a simplified model of a game where there's two agents and they can either um uh take resources from each other or or um or potentially grow the pie and so this this transition from one line to the next is the idea of like growing the pie for other parties and so the predatory concept comes from the realization that um the technology that we create the inventions that we make and so on grow the pie for everybody like grow the amount of value and the and the grow the the utility for everybody so much that in reality it's kind of creating orders of magnitude more value and so at that point um it is it is totally obvious for all parties that we should all really be doing is like stop fighting about anything and just coordinate as much as possible to get to that amazing spot where we're creating just tremendous uh levels of value for for all for everybody involved um and so part of sophie's kind of the idea of like how do you um coordinate people to land on that spot how do you coordinate people to um using things like mechanisms and so on to end up in in that in that area where we are just creating an enormous amount of value for everyone involved now i think that we can use crypto economics and we can use mechanism design to vault ourselves from where we are now um over there now um i think that uh everybody here is kind of familiar with things like bitcoin and ethereum and so on where um just a few simple rules and a few simple structures ended up causing this massive impact uh in the world uh so you think about bitcoin as the result of just a single um impact evaluator i'm gonna define that what that is in a moment but think of a single mechanism that has a reward structure that causes an enormous amount of machines to be dedicated to just the problem of maintaining the bitcoin blockchain so all of the bitcoin miners that are out there processing all the transactions and devoting an enormous amount of hash power just to maintain the blockchain are all coordinated primarily by a single mechanism which is the the block reward the block reward of of bitcoin creates this auction that allows parties to to introduce whatever um uh a hashrate they they want into the system and out of that um the in a given period uh the blackboard is going to measure the the the uh the hash rate uh and then is going to reward uh all the participants proportionally based on the the hash that they they provided now the actual way that this is implemented in bitcoin is used using probabilities and it's using uh you know single reward for a single miner in a given block uh but but that ends up creating this this larger mechanism that uh over time miners are proportionally rewarded for the hash rate that they provide and that single mechanism cause cause this like crazy run of equilibrium where suddenly you have more and more and more people at contributing hash power to maintain the bitcoin blockchain and everyone is rewarded for doing so and it's creating one of the the largest energy consuming processes that the species has ever built um and it's kind of this runoff process that we don't quite know what to do with um and and the problem is like all of that energy is basically being wasted because uh it's adding security to the network but there are way better ways to do this with things like proof of stake or or using uh work uh that is actually useful so in fact when we have this this concept of actually using that work to do some other useful work as opposed to it just being wasted so in fact we use the exact same structure we use the exact same block reward concept the exact same impact evaluator to amass an enormous amount of of storage uh around the world and all of this is yielded out of a single single mechanism now in in our case uh so so in the in the in the bitcoin case that's a degen mechanism that is well um there's a super fair to call it an entity because it is providing the useful thing of um maintaining a blockchain but in general it's just um causing and destroying tons of value relative to a much more regent mechanism that is creating some some uh positive externality out of that mechanism which is the useful storage which you can then provide and to other parties for uh for extremely low cost or for free uh so so think of um production mechanism design as the idea of using mechanism design and economics to solve like planetary scale problems by um thinking about the incentive structures of some problems and breaking those down and and thinking about the the equilibrium states that various different participants are in and trying to warp the incentive structure to get from one one spot to another so if you sort of think of like being stuck in one valley and you want to get to the other spot where everything is better for everybody uh and you can think of using mechanism design and um and group economics to coordinate their way from one spot to the other and so i think here is i have like a like a tunnel boring machine as the example of like the the crypto economics being used to kind of bore a hole through that that um that barrier in between and so you can you can keep using the same kind of idea and keep getting to better and better and better states of value over time so it's kind of like how i think you know we should use uh mechanism design to to arrive uh into this kind of party sloping outcome um use crypto economics to go from where we are today to this amazing place of you know creating drastically more and more and more value for for everybody involved uh and so that's kind of like why the the way they tend to think about this in terms of um if regen whack me else and gmail because uh we're faced with in this critical century we're faced with such ridiculously powerful um uh problems in terms of the existential risk that we're that we're facing and we can either all make it or not make it but but if we're gonna make it we're gonna have we're gonna require um extremely uh sophisticated coordination systems that can help us all get there that can they can coordinate our action both at an individual level and at a civilizational scale level to be able to tackle these these macro scale problems now that sounds like a lot like let me give you some like super concrete examples um and you know i think you think in the interest of time i'll um can i wrap it up very closely because i think we're uh gotta get to uh can i get to the panel um but so i wanted to just kind of ground this in like very concrete examples that you can then think about in terms of the hacks that you're gonna work on for the next uh for the next few weeks so first off like think of climate change um as this problem where you want to kind of coordinate all actions from all participants to arrive at kind of like a green planet and you can think of breaking that down to first like you you just need like one super green industry that is solving some massive scale problem you know it's maybe like handling five to ten percent of the of the activity in the world to be able to point to and then kind of um convince the world that is totally possible to to decarbonize completely and not only decarbonize completely but really become um climate positive or you know carbon negative uh get to a point where we're decarbonizing that industry is carbonizing much more than every other industry like and it's not just zero it's not just carbon neutral it's carbon negative and actually fixing carbon from the planet sorry from the atmosphere into the planet and if we can do that in one industry we can then convince all other industries and show that it is definitely achievable and kind of take that solution to that problem and scale it to to cover all industries and likewise we can go from um kind of uh solving kind of one industry to kind of maybe thinking of even a subset also so think of like computing crypto computing platforms or something like that and say uh just in this smaller industry it's not you know as big as one large fraction of all the industry in the planet but in this smaller industry we can maybe completely greenify that industry we can um make it decarbonize relative to everybody else in in in that industry um and so we can then cause that by gratifying one single system or one single blockchain so so sort of the goal of uh of falcon green as a pr as a project is specifically to just show that this can be done with one system like take one system and make it not just carbon neutral but carbon negative get it to a point where it is like actively fixing carbon from the atmosphere into the ground um much more than it um uh emits uh and then show that you can do it in one full system and if you do that and then you can sort of sort all blockchains by how green they are and you can show that like it can be done that can become an incentive structure that causes and if people start choosing that those those systems that are greener over those that are not then that you know on its own will become an incentive structure that will cause many other blockchains to become fully green uh there's really exciting now that there are many blockchain systems that are that are taking this very seriously and they're all kind of competing with each other to try and become more green and like that's a fantastic move if we do keep doing this like it's kind of like at the stage that we're at if we keep doing this then we can get to a full green crypto and then from there green industry and from there a green planet but hey how do you do this on a the scale of a system like that seems pretty hard well just how you can you can break that problem down into something even simpler so within falcon you can think of just um uh taking the activity and the product of all the of all the storage providers in falcon and making sure that that activity is fully green and then from that you can then scale up to other other parts and so and so um i'll describe like a mechanism in detail here so what you can do is um look at all the computers that are working around um providing the the uh the the storage and falcon you can estimate their uh energy use and so this is kind of done through um a set of um by looking at the at the power directly in the chain by looking at all the uh common hardware that that people use and you can create a set of estimates that describe how much power they're actually using and then you can offset all of that power use by buying renewable energy pumped into those grids the specific grids that they're drawing it out of at precisely the exact times that people are um are using the power so think of um directly associating the energy that somebody's drawing out of the grid to help maintain the blockchain with energy that at the very same time is being pumped into the grid from renewable energy plans and you can do this entirely with crypto primitives you can think of the information that people are um think of the plants and and the the outputs of their producing like all the energy they're pumping in and the reports about that and and put that into uh information that you can track and associate with a smart contract on the blockchain and then think of the energy that is being drawn out as also being trackable from within a blockchain and you can link these two things together and create a renewable energy purchase around um for for that energy at precisely the relevant uh moment in time uh now you can do this at not just the scale of a single uh computer or some single provider but you can do this at the scale of the entire protocol you can do this at the scale of all providers in the network and and that um motivating that kind of um protocol choice uh you can get started by breaking the problem down into something even simpler at the very beginning you can just estimate things outside of the blockchain you can run some rigorous analysis and estimate things out create some dashboards that show the community what's going on and then manually at the beginning start doing some renewal purchases to get falcon to be um uh net neutral and and eventually later not just net neutral but but but carbon negative and so climate positive um and once you show that this is working you can show that this is working at large scale then you can propose the protocol uh to actually change the entire structure of the system to do this automatically so this is kind of where where the falcon green property is at now um it's uh measured the the uh the energy consumption it's done those estimates um it's put all that information on ipfs and and make it accessible for everybody to look at um it's also proved out the renewable energy uh credit purchases through um blockchain primitives um and now what sort of like remains is to scale this into into a whole protocol uh level activity where ideally you can have this happening automatically from the protocol so you can create smart contracts and structures that would have the the protocol itself measuring the use in a particular relevant grids in the specific countries involved and buying renewable energy directly from renewable energy plans um by creating these these um economic structures so this is an example of like a a region um set of mechanisms that together arrive at it at a region um uh system where the whole system as a whole is not just um offsetting its own energy use but eventually it's gonna start pulling out more carbon from the from the atmosphere than by a multiple and like that's sort of like the goal and we can break out that entire launch problem into a problem where you're measuring the activity of participants in the in the network you're then associating um some kind of transaction with a with a contract ideally something you can do directly in a smart contract but you can usually take a regular human pdf oriented contract and and wrap that into a smart contract and then you you want a an ongoing system that will continue doing this over long periods of time and like that that way you can create a you can coordinate massive scale action in a very large scale system out of those um individual mechanisms and individual primitives uh so cool i'm gonna um yeah here let me look at chat cool i think uh we're getting um uh close to the end so i i will um say this hopefully like this was a useful example on on how we can use um information gathering and associate put all put all that information into a system where you can start using uh smart contracts to cause um uh interactions to be uh to cause coordination and become um uh positive and become regenerative um and yeah if you're interested in this particular project i recommend uh following them on twitter and participating and so on um there's a uh i think there's a set of events that are that are happening um uh there's a sustainable blockchain summit i think happening next week which which you can um uh uh check out and um yeah beyond that i would say you know take take this example as a as a case where you can go from solving a specific concrete problem um uh in the small scale and then scaling that into like a whole system and going from there to uh all of crypto then going from that to scala to compare it against all industry and eventually solve a planetary scale problem uh great i'm gonna stop here and uh welcome uh kartik thank you so much i think there's a that was a lot in terms of like you set up a base for a handful of interesting things so it was moderating the or monitoring the the chat here and uh so i mean the one common thing is i think a lot of people want to see what the presentation is so if you can send us that link after i'll just share this thing with all the attendees and also on the live stream but uh the kind of theme here that's happening at least on the live stream is that a lot of people are of course they understand the goal here they understand kind of the purpose of what this can do if we can achieve the ultimate sort of outcome but how do you actually get people excited um how do they essentially coordinate themselves at scale how do they kind of associate themselves with these larger problems that i guess ellen from collectively can agree on the value or the value prop or the actual outcome those are obviously pretty hard challenges on their own like how do you motivate people to actually be part of this movement how do you actually make sure that what they're doing is actually the best outcome that you can achieve and that kind of goes into coordination goes into canada we think about incentivization of public goods or just in general like should something be public or private good which you all touched on and uh that's kind of the base which instead of answering those specific questions from the chat i think we can make this the actual discussion for the panel and uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to obviously invite kevin from bitcoindao to kind of be on stage and turn the video on and uh jacob from the global team to also help kind of moderate a lot of this discussion uh both of you uh have enough for all three of you in this case i have enough context on uh these common themes that were obviously uh uh in the mix of but um maybe let's start off with like how do we actually start incentivizing this coordination and uh i'll let jacob take it from here [Music] yeah awesome um thanks kartik um and and yeah i'm really excited to have uh both kevin and juan here for for this quick chat um on i mean coordination on probably the book uh the greek book and then of course just public goods in general which is sort of one of these like um infrastructure things that's happening in the space around uh coordination and and funding in the space as well so um awesome uh it looks like we've got kevin too so thank you for doing this um yeah maybe it makes sense to start with uh a lot of the topics that you cover one are are in the book that kevin wrote um maybe i'll just you know to have kevin kind of kick off and do a quick little intro as well like kevin what what what are sort of the what's the story that kind of led you to to writing the greek book and um and sort of just how long have you been thinking about this what are your maybe kind of intro thoughts about this space but but just in general like um what led you to uh to come up with this yeah totally uh first off thanks for hosting this uh really big fans of each global and of protocol labs and file coin over at get coin um basically the genesis story of git coin is that i've been a software engineer all of my career all 15 years of my career and i've always built stuff on top of open source software and um open source software creates 400 billion dollars per year in economic value and uh the people that are building it don't have a business model because the source code is available for free and so every time i wanted to build a new startup and i've built a dozen side projects or startups over my career i would always get an open source database server open source web server open source operating system uh python django is it something i built a lot in so i've derived a lot of value from open source and i just found it really sad that open source because it's a public good which means that it's non-excludable non-rivalrous doesn't have a business model um which because it's non-excludable which basically means that i can't stop uh kartik from downloading uh ubuntu and it's non-rivals which basically means that kartik downloading ubuntu doesn't stop me or juan or jacob from from downloading it there's no way to monetize it and so basically the idea with blockchain is that we've got a trillion dollars of market cap that's floating around the open source financial system what if we could use some of that money to support open source because it's an open source financial system the money that used to go to it on wall street in the old financial system could now go to open source that was like the genesis of get coin and our mission has always been to build and fund digital public goods starting with open source software we've created 65 million dollars worth of open source funding uh using uh quadratic funding and bitcoin grants um and i'm just like so thankful to vitalik and glenn for inventing quadratic funding and giving us like a game theoretically optimal way of funding public goods like they're the big brains i'm just the guy who's like taking in putting like a neon brand on it and marketing it to people um and so so as we went down this path of funding open source in the ethereum ecosystem i started to discover other great projects that were also working on different types of public goods and so you know some examples would be optimism and retroactive public goods giveth and clr fund are doing some great stuff dev protocol file coin uh in protocol labs has been a big sponsor and so what we realized is that oh wait quadratic funding and what we're doing at coin is only one way that we could move the needle on public goods what if we could create an educational and social shelling point for public goods funding and regenerative crypto which just basically means like any crypto that has an impact on the world and like you know the um so the idea behind the green pill book was basically like oh quadratic funding is great but but let's actually be pluralistic there's probably a dozen or hundreds of mechanisms that can fund public goods let's be inclusive of those mechanisms and let's create a category of regenerative crypto and um and embrace all of the other projects that are doing it and like you know i i think that one of the great things about this is like the the benefits of pluralism is that you get a uh other people who are trying things with other funding sources and mechanics that are complementary to quadratic funding and so it's it's the diverse fauna of funding mechanisms in the space that we really want to grow and and we've been supporting uh that with a ecosystem series called shelling point that uh is is the shelling point for these conversations and have kind of just stumbled upon juan and funding the commons who are also doing similar things and then the green pill book is just kind of like an easy way of teaching these concepts to people and so so yeah that's that's like the four-minute version of of how we got from a to b and um and and i'm just really like uh humbled that juan even embraced the green pill meme in the in the book and have been teaching some of the concepts uh the one last thing i'll say is that these are not my ideas similar to how we took quadratic funding which is glen and vitalik's idea and we just like put a vaporwave neon brand on it and market it the green pill book ideas are the work of hundreds or thousands of really great game designers and game theorists and economists i can economic man i can't speak today economists and i'm just like taking it and patching packaging it up and like the the book is a mile wide and an inch deep because i want to give people the rabbit holes to go down so um embracing pluralism is is basically the tldr awesome um well thanks for for walking through that uh i mean obviously it's been quite a journey with bitcoin um you know seeing it since the beginning as well and then obviously we're big fans of keep going at each global as well um and yeah i love this kind of tourism that you you brought up um it seems like in general like this whole um space is so positive some for like the entire world and basically everything um that we've talked about um is sort of additive more than it's attractive in any way like you know we talked about private goods we talked about kind of rivalrous goods like it's not like those are gonna go away anytime soon um but really as to one's point kind of near the end of this talk like it's more about kind of building these mechanisms and actually kind of um having the mechanisms be so good that like you kind of outweigh all this kind of gray pill area with all this amazing region and green pill um one of the kind of questions that got brought up as we're kind of talking about through that section was um you know just kind of inherent to all this is this concept of value and good and you know the meme the public goods are good like um but but value and good is in some cases pretty subjective um i just kind of maybe as an opening question like how do you feel about the subjectivity of like what is this value and like what is what is good like are these definable topics like what's the best uh what's your best opinion on that maybe we'll start with one uh yeah so um just the easy questions uh so this is fundamentally one of the hardest questions that humanity has been faced with um because it's so um there's so many different notions of value at many different layers of the stack in a sense and here layers of the sac include um you know humanity as a like social groups and you as an individual and civilization and the species and all living systems on earth and you know the planet and the solar system in the galaxy and like the universe and so there's there's no to to the best of our ability um we have been searching for notions of value for millennia um and ever since we kind of um became uh aware and and and and so on and um sure many other uh animal species and so on have their their notions their intuitive notions of how of of value and and what not and this is one of the critical problems is like how do you orient many many groups that have many different definitions of what's valuable to them with high overlaps and high distinctions with things that resonate and things that conflict and how do you coordinate groups to achieve better and broader notions of value and um there's like a broader division here in in kind of schools of philosophy where um one one one track of the argument goes that you can't actually arrive at a kind of definition of value out of observing the universe and there's a different school of thought that that says you can that you can evaluate living systems you can evaluate communities and you can base on on what those communities are and what those living systems are you can figure out things that are good or bad for them that you can actually define the concept of good or bad relative to that living system right and so you can think of um animals in the natural state or plants in their natural state and and what they sort of want to achieve and you can think of like constraining them from that or harming their ability to achieve that as clearly bad for them and and you know this is kind of intuitive and a straightforward concept um but that really points out that there's a connection between uh what we are fundamentally with what's good for us um and so you can come up with like some some notions of value that are that are more more uh general than others and potentially eventually arrive at something that's kind of like more universal but it's probably not something as as concrete or related to um what we as individuals tend to kind of aspire to um on a day-to-day basis kind of maybe much more much more fundamental um but anyway you can usually sidestep a lot of this by embracing pluralism as uh kevin described which is you let communities define what's good for them and what what they want to achieve and you come up with coordinating coordination systems that enable those communities to interact with each other and work on things that they agree with together and coordinate together to achieve some good outcomes and then mostly try and stay out of each other's way when they're in conflict when one group values something that the other group does not value or conflicts with you can come up with systems that that govern their their shared space and their shared resources uh to to minimize uh conflict um and so i think at the end of the day it's like you can define value however you want as an individual or as a group or a community um and that nevertheless you should still be able to coordinate with many other groups that that define value differently um and you can find points of agreement um and even in cases where the disagreements are so wide that you you maybe don't even like um uh understand the world the same way uh and that's okay you can still coordinate through that and you can still coordinate to arrive at things that that you both agree on i don't care if you have anything to add on uh i'm just sort of assigning value and assigning good to to these different things that are coming out of um yeah yeah so i mean uh one of the ideas that we kind of cover in the book is the idea that um there's we typically like when we think about value we'll think about financial value and um one of the things that we sort of explore in the book is this idea from gregory landua again all of the great ideas in the book are not mine i'm just i'm just like you know the medicist behind them but basically the idea that there's eight forms of capital so basically in addition to uh financial capital there's living capital there's cultural capital experiential capital which like maybe this talk is a form of experiential capital and intellectual capital spiritual social and material capital so basically recognizing a broader diverse set of what value can be is uh i think step number one and then recognizing that each community should be free to choose what types of value they want to generate in their community you know when i hang out with my like buddhist friends they want to talk about spiritual capital whereas when i talk about web3 uh people it's more about creating arbitrages between web3 and material capital which is kind of what climadow is doing by putting carbon credits on the blockchain um bitcoin is is creating uh when we run the shelling point events and when juan and protocol labs run the funding the commons events we're creating an arbitrage between financial capital and uh intellectual capital and so um you know i just think that like recognizing a broad set of values and giving communities the locality and the sovereignty to define which type of values they want to pursue is kind of what this movement is all about and then on top of that embracing a pluralism of communities being able to pursue their own their own sets of values i think is just a really beautiful uh world if we can build it bottoms up awesome yeah one of the things that i feel like has been like particularly powerful um at least for me personally over the last couple years have been like just being able to like put names to these things i think one you kind of mentioned it with like you know actually calling all these kind of the bad stuff in the world that's malik um you know and actually being able to personify it and be able to build these tools and and actually like name all these things you know regen is another one of these things green pill like uh like all these kind of solar punch type concepts like being able to name these things seems like a very powerful concept to me and i think it's made a lot of this like more clear whereas like you know i mean you may have kind of taken a lot of ideas and a lot of inspiration from a lot of different places kevin but to be able to like succinctly put it down in a single place and name these things and be able to like uh order the this is you know super critical i think and being able to like actually come up with the solution for these for these problems um maybe maybe to motivate that like we have seen a lot of things like climate dial like you know the move towards like more um green block chains all these different like kind of more kind of regen any type things happening like um how do you two feel about where we are right now like are we on a good path i know we have these like really big problems that are on the horizon looming climate change all the things we talked about one asteroids like are we on the right path do we need to do more um like how are we trending in your opinion uh we we are doing pretty well and we need to scale it up so i think today we're doing dramatically better than we were doing a year ago two years ago three years ago like our community just just thinking about the crypto community um it is now fine to talk about how proof of work is creating this horrible waste uh and that there are better alternatives and not only that proof of stake systems like proof of sake work but that you should actively replace your proof of work structures with proof of stake work structure or um systems of work that produce some useful thing and not just kind of waste the waste the energy and not only that but like now we have many of these groups like many of these that was uh experimenting with structures and systems to to scale better we have examples of the first uh blockchains that are uh getting to carbon neutral like the the falcon did this with with our own estimate of all the energy use of the source providers it's only a fraction of the there's like the largest fraction of the energy use that anybody has um has done involved with with with falcoin uh there's some amount of calculating all of the other activity and and then the production of the the software itself like think about all of the activity that all participants in creating the software uh have made or the hardware the hardware usually tends to be one of the big carbon generation um problems um and and but we can estimate all of those things and we can we can offset all of them and so we can get to ideally like you know the we're sort of like on a race there's a number of different blockchain systems that are right now in a race to become not just fully carbon neutral but like the greenest systems the most regenerative systems around and this is totally transformative relative to where we were two or three years ago and so it's massive progress and super exciting however it's still like very small compared to the broader world right so we're in a in a serious um uh crisis of action globally uh and so it's this super hopeful like think of it right now we have a sapling or like a like a seedling of like what it could turn into this amazing tree long term and so we have to get like keep working on this keep these systems coming come up with more ideas scale the ideas that are working and then uh just kind of uh use it to with the other industries in the world um in a super positive some oriented way like we should be doing it in a in a way that is incentive aligned and that is that is um collaborative and causes the rest of the world to to orient the same way and get to a better better spot i i mean and the and it's not just script i mean like the broader world has been tackling this problem not well enough i think and and not not as quickly as we should have um but i think we're in the i think we're still kind of in time to to scale some like really fast solutions that can not only avert the the worst of disasters uh but we could potentially like curb um a lot of the the even the other problems that we that we see kind of appearing in three four decades um if we act if we scale the stuff well right so one of the amazing things about crypto is that it scales really quickly like you can go from something a mechanism working for a few people or you know in in a small scale like coordinating tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in value relative value um to handling millions to billions and trillions in in a matter of months to years um with sort of minimal changes to to the structure so that scalability is super super powerful if we can it really is kind of a tremendously long lever to try and solve the problem yeah no that totally makes sense i mean you see that even with like you know the quadratic funding that bitcoin's doing like i mean i remember that started with you know very humble beginnings right it was it was a concept and and now like it's allocating you know tens of millions of dollars right so you know the scalability there is like pretty pretty impressive to see and how quickly that even happened it's a it's insane um how about you kevin is is them all explained you just get to hang out you're hanging out in your hammock uh in an undisclosed location for the rest of time or um how do you think we're trending and maybe to add to that like um this is a hackathon people are gonna be building over the next couple weeks like what what are some of the experiments you'd love to see yeah in the space and where should people keep put their effort do you think yeah great question here in meat space i'm hanging out my hammock in sunny colorado but in the metaverse we'll we'll fight molok uh or build build uh protocols that can fight moloch since since i think we need to coordinate in order to do it um i i would i would agree with juan that we're we're doing good and the community has formed but there's there's still uh some ways to go yeah i think if if you make it like if you think about it as crawl walk run we're kind of like we've established that we can crawl uh and now we're trying to walk and it would be great if we're eventually running and i think that's you know some of the milestones that you can look at from a macro perspective is that the web 3 regen community public goods community however you want to splice it knows about each other like just that niche being established i think is crawling and i i i what i would like to see in the future is more capital and talent flowing into regen web 3 than d gen web 3. so what would it take to engineer capital rotation away from the projects that just have the best ponzinomics uh or best marketing and into the projects that have the most real world impact is like the horizon of where i think the space could be going and there's a lot of infrastructure and coordination that it's going to take in order to get there and um you know i think that i'll just say that you know thank you for your kind words about the the green pill book and git coin um uh one of the things that i think that we really strive to do is be a channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together so you know when you ask me kevin what should i work on in order to make this vision a reality the answer is i don't really know um but we have this quadratic funding mechanism that creates a uh signal map of what uh the community actually wants to see built and so i think like having that credibly neutral channel of what does the community want to build is is kind of like what i would point you to and so like just to illustrate this point um i'll just share my my screen and just show you the economic graph from bitcoin grants around 14 in june 2022 where five million dollars were raised for uh for public goods this is a graph of uh all of the contributions in get coin grants round uh 14 which was just a month ago 700 000 transactions each edge in this network is a transaction and each node is a user or a grant in the network so we're building a mesh network that not only sends funds peers to pure peer-to-peer but creates a signal of what the community actually cares about um oh and by the way seven hundred thousand transactions in the round but uh it was crashing my browser to visualize all of them so this is one one thousandth of the economic graph but it should be like a proportional amount of the economic graph so the answer is um unfortunately jacob i don't know what people should be building but uh i think that you know if if you look at that data set then maybe you'll get an idea of what the up and coming projects in the ecosystem are and can get some inspiration from that but you know one of the things that i i see as someone who's like analyzing the data um and again i'm perceiving the community's preferences not injecting my own preferences into this is that we need to engineer more capital into regen web3 projects um if we can create an ecosystem in which we reward projects that can create value instead of just the ones that capture value that systemically changes the incentives for founders and capital allocators in the space to regenerate the world and create impact so um i'm really bullish on impact certificates right now so like what would that what would be true if like every time you took 10 carbon credit carbon tons of carbon out of the atmosphere you minted an nft for it um or you took 10 people out of poverty you minted an nft for it um you invented quadratic funding you should get an impact nft or like a certificate for that and then what we can do is we can build a market where there's demand for these impact nfts and if we add a sufficient scale what we've done is we've systemically changed the incentives of the entire ecosystem to creation of value if you're an impact dow that's removing carbon from the atmosphere you now have a business model because you can just sell those impact nfts so systemically changing the incentives i think is like the north star that that i'm really aligned on and impact certificates are one way to do that retroactive public goods funding which vitalik and carl have been a big sponsor of are um are like the other the the other thing and and then like we have to build a thousands of dowels that actually create impact from there and one of the things that i kind of like like to think about um and i'll just end here because i think it's a fun beam is like we're all familiar with minor extractable value in this space which is basically i'm front running the transactions in the mempool in order to extract value for myself so juan submits a transaction that's about to redeem uh 10 eth out of some smart contract and if i'm in the mempool i can front run that and like replace his address out with mine if if if that transaction isn't isn't uh isn't a minor respectable value prevented and so minor extractable values this idea that you can front run the projects that are creating value by being in the map pool what would it what would have to be true to create vibes extractable value where you're just showing up to these impact dials thinking oh there's good vibes here they're creating impact and i trust that eventually like bitcoin and and filecoin and heath global are going to figure out how to systematically change the incentives in order to make impact else profitable but like this is vibes extractable value i'm here early for the vibes and i trust that like the world will reward me in the future so um i want to live in that world and uh so so i guess i'll put the question back to you jacob which uh youth global hackers have good vibes this hackathon yeah yeah i mean i guess we'll we'll have to see right i mean that's is basically what we're building i think so uh yeah i think yeah definitely i think you can also get a pretty you know i think actually the the whole vibe check thing is real you know like you can kind of sit down you can chat with somebody for like 10 15 minutes you get a sense like where their heads are and you can you know get a sense on whether or not there will be some like vibes extractable value down the line just because of that type of person and where they're thinking and where their heads at and um and and yeah so no i i love that um maybe one i'll turn it over to you it's also you know i know you love hackathons as well so um i know maybe a walkie doesn't know what to build uh but maybe you do um maybe i'll put this over to you it's kind of the last question is sort of you know as people set out on their journey um to to build over the next two and a half weeks um it's a long enough time for them to kind of iterate and build something cool um what do you think it's like well yeah yeah so it's good uh so let me give you uh let me share i i love this is like a panel with like show and tell this is great yeah yeah it's good yeah um so you can hear a lot of ideas from iwaki and others in the greenfield podcast you just go through and like listen to each one of these uh it's also on other other resources uh shellingpoint and one in the comments both have like huge video libraries with tons of ideas and tons of suggestions so just like go to these playlists and like just grab one at random and if like you don't find an idea within like five minutes switch to another one or something like that um and uh what i would also recommend is uh check out um i think i'm really into things that uh create like funding loops and funding structures so implant certificates uh like kevin was describing uh there's a uh implementation of that called hyper certs um then things that uh um something that also would be would be really good is um ways of so for a lot of problems usually you can come up with an incentive structure if you can get the data so so you can usually break down um a lot of these problems into hey first measure just measure what's going on in the world and get accurate readings of what's of some problem and and make sure that that stuff is is verifiable you can even start with a simple problem like because verifiable is hard so just start by measuring what it is today and feed that into a structure that you can create smart contracts around once you do that then you can experiment with a bunch of mechanisms to try and incentivize action as soon as you have some mechanism that is pumping some significant amount of value into trying to solve this problem then a bunch of people are going to show up to try game it and that's when you can like recruit the the effort to try and make a verifiable thing right so it is pretty difficult to make some of this information gathering verifiable but you don't even have to do that to start with just like take some problem in the world and measure what's going on and make that measurable thing be um accessible through smart contracts so like create an oracle out of that um bring it into like start you know this is where you can use um uh you know in in in in the spirit of hacking fs and so on a file system is a system of files great so like get a bunch of the data about the world turn it into files uh couple it uh with smart contracts then start trying some incentive structures until you hit something that works and then at that point you can worry about having to make it all verifiable and whatnot um because uh you know once you start that incentive loop and get it going um then you know you start scaling the activity and and you make it good it's kind of how carbon credits started uh they first made them people weren't thinking very carefully about verifiability there were a ton of problems out of this uh but now we have much better much more verifiable carbon credits um it just kind of we we solved that problem not there totally and i i think sound advice in general which is you know solve the smallest problem first and then continue iterating from there um you know especially for people hacking like you don't need to think about end game today you just start with an idea measure it like once said um you know do some maybe testing build something small see what happens um and then once it gets big then then you get to worry about all the other things that are that are hard but uh for now just just do something cool um awesome okay well um really thank you both for your time and it's so cool to have you both here um and and really appreciate i appreciate you all and kevin for being part of this um all these talks will be available afterwards as well so if anybody kind of tuned in halfway um feel free to uh to watch it on our youtube channel and then yeah to one's point there's an amazing repertoire that was built up over the last couple years of talks in this space um finding the commons the showing point um the greenville podcast and among many others actually so lots of awesome cool stuff out there as additional resources to this so um thank you so much again good to see you jacob let me just interject before i leave that uh i passed along a coupon code for the green pill book in the chat and i think that's going to go out to people who watch this panel and then uh there's 99 uses on that so it maybe it will even go out to the entire event so uh check out the book and you can get it for free and let me know what you think uh thanks again for hosting and juan thanks for being a great co-panelist yeah thank you i really appreciate you coming coming in and talking to us all about this thank you so much peace awesome thank you so much folks all right we're going to jump into our next talk here uh which is going to be a talk by uh david and chris from lip protocol they're going to be talking about automating web 3. uh all the different kind of interesting primitives new things you can do when automation's built in um this is a huge problem space uh that is particularly difficult in in web3 although kind of very common in what too i'm still really excited to hear a little bit more about uh what they're working on and then just kind of exploring the space with them so i invited both david and chris to turn on their videos um and welcome them to the stage feel free to share your screen hey jacob hey everybody uh thanks for being here um i'm david that's chris we're the founders of lip protocol and yeah let's go ahead and jump into it i'll start with the screen share here all righty then so before we talk about specifically automating web3 let's do just a few minutes of context setting um so first things first what is the web so on the web we have this kind of like decentralized and resilient packet transfer network for sending around information and here's a little video of that uh evolving over the past several decades and so you know this is decentralized in the same way that one of these nodes can drop out and the information can still reach its destination and so as you can see in any kind of system there's three main components which is the sending of the information and we see a check mark here because the sending is in fact decentralized but what we're going to talk about a little bit today is the decentralized compute and the decentralized storage of information and a lot of that was just touched on in the last talk and so now that we kind of have an overview of what is the web generally let's talk about what is web2 and so using this same lens of sending information computing information and storing information we can define 2 as the internet where the data is computed and stored by these centralized platform corporations so what does that mean specifically well of course it starts with the individual and in this web 2 construct the individual has a bunch of data collected about them uh from pixels uh essentially tracking codes and and tracking cookies across the web to the gps data in the phone that is being aggregated and of course all of the spending and financial data and so the result of all of this data being sent and traded and bought and exchanged by these third-party corporations and here's kind of like a map of what that ecosystem looks like these are the top 5 000 marketing technology companies is that for each of us the individuals who are using the internet there is this picture of our identity that is the wholly owned property of these third-party corporations collectively and this is uh kind of a result of the fact that the compute and storage of the data um to date prior to web 3 was only really happening in a centralized way so now let's talk about defining web3 using this same frame we can define web3 as the web where the data is computed and stored by decentralized networks and again it starts with the individual but then the other major component of course inside of web3 is the notion of the asymmetric key pair the public-private key pair the private address and and and the public address and so this is the component that lets individuals and corporations and dows etc interact with these decentralized systems with higher levels of sovereignty because the key pair itself delivers the power of being able to sign messages sign transactions encrypt things decrypt things this is a huge huge huge kind of innovation in terms of how people interact in our digitally mediated society and so some of these networks you'll obviously be familiar with them include things like blockchains which are these public state machines that are ledgers showing who has what tokens um storage networks like ipfs and filecoin and then what the team at lit is working on which is compute and encryption and so we'll take a couple minutes to talk a little bit about lit how it works and how to get started with it and then have some time for questions at the end so in context of of this framing what is lit lit is a decentralized key management network at the end of the day so structurally and architecturally what lit is doing is custodying a private key an elliptic curve in a decentralized way so the private key that you have in your wallet is essentially just the line on a graph and the lit nodes represent points along this curve which is the secret of that individual node and so the first product that we brought to market using this underlying network is a decentralized access control and encryption service and with this service an individual can get access to some resource whether that's a video an application a chat a feed somebody's friends list based on some on-chain data so a user may say uh i own this nft and i want access to this locked video they sign a message which is broadcast to the lit nodes the nodes then check the chain does this person qualify for access if so that node uses its underlying secret which is that point along the curve to generate an authorization or a decryption share which it sends down to the user and the user aggregates those shares in kind of a client-side encryption excuse me like a client-side consensus type of view and once they've collected two-thirds of those authorizations or of those shares to perform that operation which is to access something or decrypt something in this example they're able to do so they're able to watch that video access that chat so on and so forth and so this has been really excellent there's about 200 apps of all kinds of uh types that have implemented decentralized access control and encryption with lit today uh some of those examples include being able to do token gated commerce inside of shopify uh decentralized encrypted chats on this application called orbis.club is is just one example and then what uh the whole team including chris and i are really excited to introduce here today um is the notion of programmable key pairs a uh and the ability to do decentralized compute and signing and so what this means from the perspective of the network is for the access control and encryption product lit was just one key that was checking those credentials and provisioning access but now we're imagining a future with our community whereby every agent who is using the web in addition to having their hardware wallet in addition to having their mobile wallet or their browser wallet can also have a decentralized custody cloud wallet which has some extremely unique advantages around being able to run automations because the signing can happen in the cloud and can be controlled by rules and programs rather than getting an alert about something and having the user have to open their phone and sign the signing can happen on the user's behalf inside of this pkp paradigm so with that i'll kick it over to chris who will talk a little bit about installation and chris you just let me know when to go to the next slide wonderful yeah so um in order to use these pkps um generally you'll you'll want to use some javascript and that's we're calling that a lit action and so what you see on the slide here uh first is like how to install the sdk um in a way that supports using lit actions so you have to use that um at serano tag at the top there that you'll see and then once you have the sdk installed you need to write some code that will run on every node and that's what uh what you're looking at here in this little code snippet this is the piece of code that um each node will run and it as you can see in here we have a um sign ecdsa function call that will instruct the node to use its private key share to create a signature share and what happens um is the nodes all run uh this little code snippet in parallel and the user collects those signature shares um and then combines them and is able to use them for anything you could use an ecdsa signature for so you can use it to authorize a ceramic right you can use it um to send a transaction on any ecdsa blockchain including bitcoin um and and that's like uh that's that's how the lit action code itself works and then can you go to the next slide and then yeah this this uh snippet of code here is the code that um actually uses the sdk to uh to tell the nodes to run that code snippet from the previous slide um and you can imagine in in this code snippet um if you look down a little bit you'll see there's a line that says cons signatures equals await lit nodeclient.execute.js and you'll see there's a parameter there code and it says lit action code yeah right there yeah that um that is basically that's the code that you defined on the last um on the last slide and so that would that could be like a string um and uh you pass that to each of the nodes and they run it um and what what you get back is the signatures that um that were created the the lit javascript sdk takes care of like combining all the signature shares for you um so that you just get the the raw signatures back that you can you know broadcast to the network or um do whatever you want and one more thing that uh well actually two more things i'll mention one is like um in this example we're passing the code in as a string that's what that that code parameter is where dave's mouse is um it's also possible to pass in an ipfs content id and what what that will do is um instruct the nodes to pull down that ipfs file and execute it as javascript um and where that's really interesting is that ipfs things sorry ipfs things are immutable and so where that's really interesting is that you end up with an immutable piece of code um that you can uh you can use for signing um and what what you can do now is um you can use smart contracts but we're still we're still pushing some of these features up so you can't do it like today but soon you can um use smart contracts to grant access to a given lit action to use one of these pkps um and so what you end up with is like an immutable piece of javascript code that has a private key that it can use to sign that's stored and runs in a decentralized manner and so anything that you can think of that you could use a decentralized signing mechanism for you could use this for so you could you know in terms of automation right you could um so we we don't have a listener that's something that that you would need to figure out you could use tenderly for that for example but um you you need some kind of event listener right and when an event happens um you would kick off you'd run this code that you see on the screen to kick off um a signature and what's what's really cool is that you can put because it's running your code you can put constraints and conditions in that code right so like if you if you want to say like oh when the price of ohm you know drops below a certain level i want to unstake my own and sell it you can um have an event listener that looks for the price of home dropping and fires this off but you also can have inside the code here like an if statement that double checks the price um and so it so the actual event firing can be done by an untrusted party because you can put those guard rails um into your lit action code um and uh yeah definitely oh yeah next slide um definitely we have developer docs on all this at the developer.lit protocol dot com website and um come on into our discord um and we will you know help you with any questions or any support at all back to dave thanks chris and so yeah i think a couple kind of ideas in the context of what to build on this especially through the lens of hacking file systems there's obviously some of the examples that chris mentioned around d5 automation and quality of life tooling around finances but focusing specifically on on file systems and off-chain data something that gets really interesting here is you know it's long been the dream of early internet pioneers um for individuals to be able to travel around the web uh sometimes people use the metaphor of a data backpack with a self-sovereign data hub and what is so kind of wonderful is in the past in order to have self-sovereign data uh an individual would have to go and rent a server from a provider like digitalocean or amazon and install some software on that in order to interact with the web in a sovereign way but now with the rise of decentralized storage networks and the fact that it is the private key that lets an individual interact and read and write to those storage networks one can have a a sovereign internet experience without having to go rent a server by reading and writing uh to their own encrypted shard of the open web whether that's on uh using a service like ceramic file coin or table land as the protocol for for where that data is stored and so some like examples of applications that start to get really interesting are things like what does social networking look like in this context rather than writing your posts and your friends list to facebook or twitter's database what does it look like to start writing that data to a user's own hub where their own information is and then having rules around who can see it who can comment on it who can like it so on and so forth and so this is really the vision of the user owned internet and user owned social networking starts to emerge out of this frame and then we'll open it up for questions but just to end on an interesting idea here that we like to talk about often over at lit is really thinking about what is privacy there's definitely kind of a cultural idea that privacy is about building up walls and saying what's mine is mine and in the context of a networked digitally mediated world um we really like the idea of thinking about privacy less about building walls but it's more about building bridges it though the point of privacy is not to necessarily keep uh any information away from everybody else but is to give each individual each application each company each dow really explicit controls around who can see which of their data and when so we really like this kind of consent view of privacy um and just wanted to share that concept and so open up for questions here in a second but yeah thanks for your attention um here's our various kind of handles on twitter and yeah i would love to take any questions and uh looking forward to interacting with some of you in in discord and talking about the prizes and all that thanks so much awesome thanks david and chris i appreciate you going over that with us and i'm super excited to have this like kind of new primitive coming to coming to be um i think we're still waiting to see if there's gonna be any questions to filter in but maybe i'll just kick one off with on my side like um i i think you're totally right that this is sort of you know part of this vision that a lot of these kind of early internet pioneers had around just you know being able to teleport around the internet and kind of bring everything with you um i i guess like i get curious about the genesis story i guess of like coming up with with this as a feature and like was this always the plan like did you start with kind of the keys and then you sort of realize well like that would be crazy if we could do this like um like how how has you sort of got to gotten to this point and uh i mean it's exciting to be at so i'm just kind of curious like what that journey was like yeah great question um so uh so like the the so chris and i have been on this we're on like a three year journey trying to come up with a a really impactful idea and iterated through a number of different things and about two years ago we kind of got obsessed with the idea around how can we make an nft an unlockable portal to an experience trying to like think about nft's less as kind of picture frames and more as browser windows that somebody could enter and thinking about what it would take for only uh allowing the owner of that nft to be able to enter that uh digital experience and so the question that emerged out of that was where does the key live and basically the insight there was oh let's use a decentralized network to custody a key and just in the context of building it i think you know something that we talk about a lot on our team that innovation and inspiration typically happens during the work rather than before um it was just very clear that the uses of a distributed key um were well beyond uh the things that we could conceptualize and you know even if you think about like the founding of ethereum and vitalik's journey of saying oh people really like making coins and they keep setting up these forks of bitcoin what does it look like to make a network that somebody can create tokens on top of you know led by chris we really went down a similar path in terms of thinking okay this is this notion of a decentralized and distributed programmable key is very very powerful we don't know all of the use cases for this there the opportunity here is to uh basically take care of some of that work that would need to be repeated for each one of these use cases and make this kind of a generalizable compute or application platform gotcha very cool um awesome looks like there are some questions coming in now um i guess some specific questions some kind of more open-ended ones um i i guess was this technology would this enable anonymous threshold voting as part of like would that be one of the things that you could build with this or is it missing anything from that i think you could build something like that yeah um yeah it's i'm trying to think about the specific architecture of that and how that that would fit in but um yeah because you can you can do things like um like signing and i you yeah i'm looking about the anonymousness of it um so all of our um stuff right now all the the nodes run their uh their execution inside of intel sgx which is a trusted execution environment which is opaque to the um to the node operators they can't see into it um so depending on like what data you were writing to chain um i think you could uh you could do something like that with it yeah gotcha okay sweet and then maybe like a little bit more like a general or more philosophical question like um given that you now have this kind of concept of like key and then you have this concept of like compute like is it actually possible to sort of create a dap at this point that would be like completely computed on like the lit protocol like ecosystem um and like maybe not even need the kind of i guess you'd still have the blockchain component but like kind of almost like like a kind of compute roll-up type situation totally yeah we've been like calling these like liquid programs and are excited about the future where somebody can build a software product that provides a service generates revenue and is running on entirely decentralized architecture and let's say somebody builds that up and it's making a hundred thousand dollars equivalent a month in tokens and they decide you know what i'm ready to sell this business and rather than having to go through the work of like paperwork and and everything uh and finding a buyer they can just list that con the nft that controls that software on openc or one of the other marketplaces and somebody can literally buy what is functionally a software product business and the exchange of ownership of that business can happen um on chain wow yeah okay that's an interesting idea sorry i don't want to cut you off keep going chris no no yeah yeah i just want to add really quick like the the idea of like replacing a back end with some of the stuff that lit does um i'd love to just talk about that really quick right so a typical node.js back end right we'll sort of have god mode access to a database it can read and write from the database whatever it wants but the actual code you know in those endpoints are what govern what gets rid of the database right if the there's an endpoint for a like post function that endpoint will check if the user has liked it already it'll off the user then it'll just write that one piece of content um to the the database and what you can do uh actually today with lit actions um is you can have one of these lit actions that owns a pkp you can have that pkp own a ceramic stream and so what you end up with is a very similar paradigm right where you have some javascript code that has god mode on a ceramic stream and then you can write the code that governs like what actually gets read and written to that stream um and that code can be immutable um and you it's a very like uh easy transition i think from thinking about the the web 2 node.js back-end mindset to this um way to do it in a decentralized way where the you know the data actually lives on the d-web and yeah you don't have to stand up a database you're using ceramic yeah that makes sense i mean in a way like it almost feels like but it almost does kind of feel like almost a serverless function type idea as well where it's sort of like yeah you're sort of you know outsourcing some compute out to this thing and like you know it'll get back to you at some point and like maybe there's some kind of characteristics about it that you need to pay attention to but like beyond that like i mean that's like a i mean serverless function yes but then i think even in the case of david what you said like a serverless company which is like kind of interesting yeah i think that's a perfect example right it's basically a serverless function um and like if you go use you know aws lambda today you can hook it up to the aws kms but the service provider that says like hey we built some kind of defy automation using uh amazon's serverless function product the person who's building that application has total access to that kms and can you know rug the users at any point but in this paradigm that we're talking about you can do that same thing it's the same mindset except the key is custodied by this decentralized network and somebody can build a really wonderful service and then say to the users look i can't rug you uh this is built on this decentralized key management infrastructure and not even just from the key point of view but even just like the compute point of view too right like i mean aws can at any point just turn off the function and you're kind of out of luck right um so wow very cool um awesome just see if there's any last questions that sneak in [Music] um cool does i think we're kind of drying up on the question side maybe just before i while i still have you both and and before you go i know you touched on it a little bit at the end but um obviously we've been kicking off a two and a half week hackathon like what are some of the cool things that uh that you want to see built with this like what are like some of those like kind of option those awesome like outcomes that uh that you'd like to see explored chris you want to go first yeah um anything that like uses ceramic like in the way that i described i think it'd be really cool um also you can make http requests inside these javascript snippets so you can read and write for like you could build a bridge um you know between file systems between you know between chains um i don't know it's like there's just so many possibilities it's hard for me to come up with concrete ones you got some dave yeah i mean i think like basically you know three comes after two web three comes after web two like we're we're back down to the fundamentals so it's things like messaging posts friends list profiles like i you know we can there's always interesting game dynamics to explore but it's really just some of the basics of what does the user owned internet look like like you know if you think about the start of facebook it basically started as the notion of essentially a profile page right where you could upload your pictures et cetera and things like the feed and these other kind of interactions came later on um so i think that's like the state of where things are at it's just like it's wide open and early and being able to tackle some of just the super obvious components that exist in web 2 today whereby all the data is stored on these these third-party servers in the lens of of what we've been talking about whereby that is controlled by the user you know through this pkp paradigm that is like controlling a ceramic stream for example is really interesting the other place where this gets really interesting is on the authorization side so uh for many people um it's a real privilege to be one's own bank uh and a real honor to be able to custody a 12-word seed phrase but there's a lot of kind of fellow members of our species where that's a real burden right they may not have a secure place to store these words um like they're receiving these words in a language that is foreign to them and so there's a lot of opportunity on the authorization side which is how can an individual tell that cloud key how to behave using kind of more um let's call the more traditional authorization methods like biometrics multi-factor authentication things of google authenticator so there's that whole world to explore on the off side as well um and all of this stuff is just like super extendable to then every other application that is building inside of this same user-owned paradigm wow amazing i mean out of all that like i mean the auth stuff is very interesting but then also like just being able to make an http call from within it like getting data within that context and being able to do cool things with it yeah maybe you won't have the same guarantees as like you would if you're using like an oracle provider or something and yeah i mean it's a point of failure but i mean to one's point earlier at the end of his talk like at the beginning it's all about just solving a problem right and like if you could solve that problem then like sure you have like a centralized data source within this kind of liquid um thing that you're building like cool like later on take that out swap that for something more resistant and solve that problem later so it's awesome seems like a really cool tool to uh yeah i don't know it seems like a very open open-minded uh thing that people can build with so really awesome yeah and we couldn't be more excited to have those dialogues like please get in touch if you want to ideate and chat about stuff um you know it's always more fun together absolutely awesome okay great uh well that is time on our end for this talk but i really appreciate you about dave david and karis for coming out and chatting more uh about kind of automating web3 and the work that you've been doing there we're going to move on to our next chat which is going to be a panel um which is going to be led by uh lucas from the protocol labs team so let me just get all set up here as they all come on stage um this is a panel i'm like really excited about because it's sort of uh an awesome opportunity to chat about the the work that both protocol labs is doing as well as all the awesome projects from our events as well uh so this is a panel on kind of past hackathon winners and and they're kind of post hackathon journey so i know a lot of people here are starting their first hackathon journey um or some people are starting their aunt's hackathon journey but uh really there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to use these two and a half weeks to learn build something iterate use all the resources uh that uh both from the summits and uh from the people that are gonna be around you and as david just says more fun with more people around you um and it's been amazing to see the amount of impact that that hackathons have had on on these different projects coming to life so um we are joined by lucas who is kind of the the point point point of command at protocol labs around just kind of orchestrating all these hackathon outcomes we're excited to have him leading this alec as kartik mentioned earlier um is the ceo of valast vows is a project that came out of hack fest and then we're also joined by karen um who's working at hybrid art who also started hyper dab so um really exciting to have all three of you here um and i'm gonna get out of the way so that lucas can take over so i'll encourage you all to take on uh turn on your cameras and uh we'll get this show rolling cool thanks so much jacob awesome cool i'll i'll kick it off and thanks so much and karen and alex for joining this channel and i'm super excited and i would uh i was just like hoping that we could use this panel to get people and really excited about this hackathon and then not just like what's going to happen during this hackathon but also like all the potential that kind of comes after and so that's what what i'm hoping that we can you know spend the next um 30 minutes or so i'm talking about and for all the people watching and i'd also encourage them to kind of put their questions right like what are some of the things that you might be wondering about um as you as you dive into this um hackathon and yeah super super nice to meet you and alec and karen i'd love to kick it off by just um kind of going around the room maybe with a brief introduction and karen i'll start with you maybe and tell everyone who you are and what what you do at hyperdap and what hyperdev does and and then i would love for you to also talk about your relationship to hackathons and both each global one heck fs maybe specifically but also beyond um and then right like how many did you participate in and did you win any um so yeah let's start there over to you yeah great thank you thank you lucas um so hi everyone my name is karen so i'm currently a co-founder at hyperdap so hyperdab is a platform that that's to enable anyone to instantly create and deploy frontends of decentralized applications so what we are building is a platform and a tool that takes away all the complexities um related to integrating web3 interactions uh in the front end of the apps that will make it really easy so our tool is accessible to not only devs but anyone who has some basic knowledge about smart contracts and in terms of my experience with um with hackathons um so i was part of the hyperdub so we actually uh submitted our project to uh east denver um a virtual hackathon at the end of march so i was part of the team and prior to that i actually um started my my journey in web 3 um through with the chain link spring hackathon last year cool awesome so we have like two two hackathons in in the um yeah and one more interesting thing is uh alex here and i are both uh alums of the tachyon accelerator i think that's something that's notable that's uh noteworthy great awesome yeah i would love to talk about kind of your experience um that kind of what happened after after those hackathons and and and we'll dive into those into those moments alec and over to you maybe also start with a brief intro about who you are and and what you do with um valles and what problem you're solving with ballast and what your personal history has been with hackathons sure yeah super awesome to be here yeah thanks for having me uh i'm alec co-founder and ceo of vallest um and val says web through native software distribution so a web through way to publish your apps games binaries uh and even source code snapshots now so um yeah that's what we do and then as far as experience with hackathons actually yeah my co-founder and i used to participate in a lot of web 2 hackathons um throughout college but really there is seriously nothing like web 3 hackathons it's really awesome and uh and eth global puts them on the best for sure but uh yeah um we started at hack fest uh 2020 and basically uh i actually remember very vividly uh when zach and i were signing up we were like super excited like oh yeah this is this is gonna be awesome uh and uh yeah we signed up and then we we did the hack vals was super basic at that point um but then uh yeah we also uh once we did the uh finale presentation uh tachyon also reached out to us as well and then that kind of started a whole other journey that yeah it's kind of its own uh deep dive that we can go to so yeah well awesome thanks so much for sharing that um i i love that we have kind of i think the first tech fest in 2020 was probably was it also virtual or was it was it in it was virtual okay so i guess we're we're mostly if we're talking about hackathons in the past few years talking about the virtual experience and um hackerfest is now virtual again too and i think east denver earlier this year karen was was live i think i was there i but you said you participated retro so we'll get like a good scoop that's that's perfect because we are at a virtual hackathon and so i think a lot of the learnings will will apply or a lot of the lessons that you guys kind of took away and i'd love to kind of just go through that journey from basically start to finish and we can kind of double click into it and and maybe the first thing is like why did you guys decide to participate in hackathon right like you probably were doing other things and you're like hey like i'm gonna spend the next week or weekend or weeks and doing this thing like what was it that motivated you to and you know dedicate your time here did somebody pull you in or how did you learn about it so yeah just curious there care and maybe you go first yeah sure i think my my experience may be really interesting and i want to probably use it to inspire um non-developers who are curious and are interested in getting into web3 so let's just go back to around like springtime 2021 so at that time i was i was about to leave my my job my position as a head of data science at the web 2 startup and i was looking for new ideas that's when i got to learn about the concepts about enough tea and and web3 but i was totally a a a newbie and or like at that point so but then i have an idea about building a sort of a marketplace that empower photographers but like so i was talking to like i got started with talking to some users and talking to some developer friends and then i got in touch with someone a friend of mine who works at uh chain link and then he told me that hey you should uh join our discord and we have this hackathon going on this is a great place to connect with developers and that's how things started so i think it's it's been a really incredible experience so far for me for someone who's not who comes from a non-deaf background because at that point um i have no idea about what oracle was what was like a really basic uh knowledge about smart contracts so it's been a really uh great experience in growing my knowledge base and also got myself immersed into into web 3 as a founder and a business operator from the very beginning awesome let's double click into that a little bit i'd be super curious like what are some of the things that you maybe would recommend to somebody with a similar background who's very new to this and um new to web3 and maybe even not an engineer and welcome to all those who are not engineers right like you're still in the right place but i'm curious if there's um i know one or two things that you'd be like hey this is a this is a good place like i know there's a lot there's a ginormous discord happening lots of conversations lots of um workshops like what's a good place to start like what would you say um you know for somebody who's very new and try to help them orient um i would say uh the first start is probably just the the intros or the uh finding a teammate channel on on any haka long discord so this is a great way to go through i think this is a really a great channel to um just go through ideas i did that other people have and see if there are any synergies and also synergies in terms of idea or signatures in terms of complementary skill sets and then really be be open to communicating with people have dms with people from different backgrounds whether it's a back-end developer a designer or a pm or anyone yeah cool i think that's great advice i mean there are right like at the end of the day like if if you're kind of um here on your own or you know maybe with one other person and just just do know that there are a lot of people like you right so you're kind of together alone for now but um like yeah i would definitely encourage you to and kind of connect with folks and left and right in maybe even the chat right now or something alec and maybe over to you for a second um how did you kind of get involved with hackathons why did you think that was a good use of your time or what what kind of inspired you to join it yeah certainly so as i mentioned before my co-founder and i uh we're doing a few different hackathons uh and really our motivations were always just trying to build something like just that creative like hey let's see how much we could build in a shorter period of time with the tools at hand and we were always just really into like building mvps and stuff um and you know we complement each other's skill sets really well and so we've kind of always gone as a team and then met so many new friends with hack fest i very specifically remember though um the motivation for applying for hack fest was actually like hey cause uh we had been engineers in the space for a while around 2016 um doing like core dev stuff wallet dev stuff uh other things like that and and then we you know had moved towards like helping write coding bootcamps uh and then we actually got to write the last third of this fintech course and we got to write it all in web three so basically people would come in and learn fintech and then at the end we would like basically try and convince them hey what three actually uh but there was this like disconnect uh that uh you know just like hey like i feel like i'm in the community but like i don't know a whole lot of other web 3 devs um besides our existing like circles basically and um yeah i very specifically remember when applying for hacker fest i was like yeah we can we could actually like build something that gets in front of all the right people and we can make all the right friends and like find like and find uh and and there was actually also like uh another motivation too of like hey maybe we could we didn't think it would actually play out the way it did but you know we're always um you know putting things out there into the universe kind of thing and just like um you know when things come along you know so it's like hey we realized hey we could actually build this out into something bigger um that's that's kind of the direction we took but but yeah i think yeah i definitely remember having that conversation with zach and be like yeah like this is gonna be sick like it's global like it's gonna be uh online like everyone's gonna be like it was just like protocol labs is sponsoring it with them like oh yeah like it was just so exciting and just yeah like that was definitely a big part of it yeah cool awesome thanks so much um i i love it and you you guys are almost like kind of coming from it and from a different angle right like where came kind of joined was like hey i'm exploring new opportunities this might be a good way to kind of get get and get some more exploration and you were like you came in with an idea and we're like looking almost for a forum to showcase some of those ideas and get in front of the right people and maybe alec for you the question a little bit like how did you go about like finding the right idea right like finding a problem that like was worth tackling over a weekend or over the course of a few weeks like how do you go about like you know through your day-to-day work and then like finding a problem like okay that's a great hackathon problem for yourself like how do you go about and what would your recommendation be there for for folks who are like yeah like that sounds like great but like what is the thing that i should be working on yeah now that's a very good and also a very tough question at the same time uh probably what makes it so good i think it's uh a lot of it honestly was a culmination of a long period of time of being around the problems in the space and realizing like hey we're still using web 2 for everything on the distribution level and just like hey can we can we just see what this looks like if we find a way to move binaries with ipfs and some version control smart contract just something super simple proof of concept like can we at least like move towards that direction i was super into the idea of like uh you know well still obviously but uh ethereum keys as like your identity obviously and then as a replacement for ssh and pgp keys in the form of auth and i was really coming from like a security background um and so i would just say like it just naturally was interesting because it cropped up multiple times and just like was this ironic thing um as far as recommendations the only thing i could recommend is just introspect think about what you really care about and what you're really interested in and you will probably there are probably things that you've come across multiple times or maybe you came across once and you're like hey you know i might want to go explore that again um because really i mean zach and i have been doing a bunch of different projects so it was kind of just iterating and not being attached to a single idea and just continuing to try things over and over and over again until we eventually stumbled upon something that has value in a broader sense and so that's the best that i could recommend is just keep trying things that you like and you have fun with we always go into it having fun otherwise it's like what's the point right like so um yeah i mean definitely go into it having fun just whatever you vibe with whatever is interesting to you um and then obviously like you have to figure out the scope of how much time you have versus like the idea and how big it is um but you kind of get better at that over time too so i would just say like keep going hackathons and just keep keep doing this you'll get better at um that like feedback loop as well of just like hey like we built this get better at it uh every time kind of thing well sorry sir yes yes siri activated but yeah that's that's what i would say cool awesome thanks so much for sharing that and i'd be super interested maybe if we can spend a little later in the in our conversation on some of the biggest opportunities that you guys see maybe from your vantage point right now with with the problems that you're facing but maybe also web 3 and who knows the world in general right like what are some some like problems and worth addressing from your perspective we'll look at that a little bit later too and i'd love to now kind of go beyond the hackathon right so now you're there you've built your idea you've met a couple of interesting people you've had a chance to showcase and what you've done and what what what kind of what happened next and i i'd be almost like i'd love to break it down into two component components which is like one like what what did you personally gain from it right in i don't know friendships or whatever it is new connections and and then also professionally and maybe those two things kind of blend a little bit and but yeah like um maybe karen over to you with that question first like what were some of the you know personal um growth that you see and then maybe also we'll maybe talk about the professional stuff in a second but maybe let's start there yeah sure so i think the inter on the on the social level in terms of what you can gain from hackathon i think it goes far beyond just the people you work you collaborate with for this particular project it can really go and go beyond that for instance any those people that help people from different protocols different uh platforms those people could become really great partners and friends for instance we started out our first project at the changing experience spring hackathon so even after the hackathon when we continued to work on a product for our beta launch um i would say it really took a whole village to to raise and launch a project we got so much uh support from product managers uh market and the marketing team the product team and the engineering team in front from chain link it's it was tremendous yeah and the support of the friendship like last forever yeah yeah even even with our first project our first uh client uh user the creator that we work with for launch our projects uh came from um came through an intro um from the chaining team well awesome that's great like having those anecdotes i i wonder um i like if you have like a moment or an anecdote um that you remember we like wow that's maybe something that i didn't expect was gonna fall out of this apart from you know like you were like ready to showcase your project but like some um yeah i don't know if there's anything that surprises you like wow like i didn't know a hackathon would unlock this for me personally um you know or you know in terms of friends or or something like that and does anything come to mind there yeah honestly like i i i say this with no exaggeration like i'm not saying this to be like super heartfelt or anything it this is straight up like it actually changed the entire course of where my life was going uh you know and so and like just i felt like i got plugged in to the community that i was like missing in a way and just being around people with like-minded ideas and and not having to just like constantly prove like with whip 3 and crypto especially a few years ago it was just like you know constantly battling this uh anti narrative and just like you know kind of it's like exhausting a little bit eventually when you're constantly trying to pitch the validity of what you're doing for a living almost and it's like interesting yeah whereas like if you get plugged into people who are actually um you know believe the same things and you know have the same values and just yeah i don't it's just that and then um you know when shout out to gabriel anderson from tachyon when he emailed uh emailed me i was like wow this is okay and i was like from con consensus okay like what's up this is uh very surprising like um i was surprised that we won because it was such a global thing and then i'm surprised that uh you know so many people were watching that and we had that idea but we just you just never know and i would say that that's the biggest thing like i've learned since like you never know who's gonna do what who's who knows who what like it's just you never know so just you know keep you know putting positivity out there and just keep moving forward and like that's the biggest thing that like yeah it definitely what there's so many things like i could keep going on about personal uh i've met so many amazing friends in the space professional like that's completely uh entirely new levels of um opportunity that have opened up and uh you know we just didn't i mean even with the you know vc afterwards like that wasn't even something that we considered uh as a possibility i never grew up around you know uh that kind of mentality you know and like people doing like friends and family rounds and stuff like i never like that was never a thing i was exposed to and so yeah that was just like another unexpected thing um post hackathon yeah cool awesome thanks so much i mean um i i i fully hear both of you on like i think a lot of these personal connections and are what makes this even for me like super rewarding and engaging with folks and and finding community and and being challenged right to like bring your best and and also just like having fun together and i think that's super awesome and i sometimes see like when you show up to an event or you see it advertised somewhere or people are trying that's almost something that's not that's even talked about but it's like one of the one when they actually show up it's like it turns out to be like the thing that that actually makes this super um rewarding and you know like the website always has like you know hundreds of um thousands of dollars in prizes to be won and that's amazing but like um that alone is like after talking to a lot of um kind of builders in the space like that's not actually what gets them here like that's great and that like gives you some um you know runway to or or reward and that's obviously amazing and a key part of it but um the reason why people stick around is because of the relationships that they built and cool i i like i'd love to kind of um we go into the the the tachyon story and they gave you a story a little bit more and so maybe like tell us a little bit what happened so you pitched your project and and then you got a call after the hackathon or got an email like what happened and like what doors did that open for you yeah so something i learned is that yeah a lot of uh investors are watching these projects and yeah a lot of them if you were at new york you know a lot of them were approaching uh projects afterward and just yeah it's definitely uh so yeah we we did the finale uh live demo which was awesome uh to do that uh as well and um yeah so that was um yeah he emailed us shortly after the finale um i was like hey you want to chat about it and then maybe to tell everyone who who is gabriel sorry yeah yeah i i yeah sorry about that so gabriel anderson is the managing director of tachyon so tachyon uh and and foul coin launch pad accelerator are protocol labs and consensus uh partnering together to to do an accelerator where it's a three-month uh essentially a boot camp for startups um which is great coming off of writing boot camps for web 3. so that was a really awesome transition as well but uh yeah so it's essentially boot camps for startups gabriel um is a really great uh you know leader and just uh you know multi-uh time entrepreneur and just very great at candid feedback and just helping you um really realize the sort of the potential of what you're building as well as you know flesh out some of the actual you know the value propositions and how to actually get it ready for venture capital which is an entirely other ball game essentially honestly yeah it's like and you know um there's grants there's there's bootstrapping stuff and that's something my co-founder always did with other businesses so that was definitely new so um yeah he taught us a lot about that and the rest of tacky on team of course but yeah well awesome and karen you were in that program too can you maybe like share some light on like what happened in those three months you you came in with with the hackathon project or a version of a hackathon project or did you already had you already developed before yeah i'm just curious um i um i'm a second i'm a uh two-time alum alumni of of taekyong accelerator so i entered attacking a cohort uh last year last summer with my first with the first project that sprung up from chilling whispering hackathon and then with half our dab of this year we we joined the the latest cohort yeah um so obviously to add what um what alex just said it's very different game from from very different uh tragedy in a game plan to build a hackathon project as opposed to building a venture backable business what are what are some of the major differences i guess like yeah so what are the things that you focus on during the hackathon what kind of questions are you trying to solve i would say a great start a great start if even for when you work on a hackathon project if you want to turn this into a viable business in the future i think it's really great to really helpful to hone down on the the pro the problems solution part at first there's one thing we learned from my past security appearance that that for some hackathon projects um we might be motivated to to build some really innovative solutions with some existing uh technology first without thinking through to too much about what exactly the problem is and what the exactly the addressable market is um awesome any alec from you any any other things to add there in terms of like this is what we took to a hackathon and then like these are the things that we kind of tagged on and to it and during the course of those three months what what were some of your main focus areas there definitely yeah so i guess yeah just to touch on that a little bit um from from a hackathon project and for venture capital investors are definitely looking at uh like karen said the market opportunity there um some projects solve a very niche problem some projects solve a really awesome like some of them are really awesome solutions but then if you zoom out and you look at the scope of the problems certain things might be a 10 million market 100 million market they're looking for billion dollar plus markets that you could expand into essentially so that's like a lot of the lens when you're looking at the business model and you're looking at how to scale that application up um and then yeah venture capital really likes you know products that you build and you could scale rapidly to many users and then you can expand into other markets from there not all projects can do that and not all um you know products are really meant for that level of scale um and you know some businesses you know like are perfectly sustainable um at a ten million dollar revenue um but it's going to take a whole different um architecture almost to to scale it out past that uh service businesses for example venture capital doesn't like to invest in that um that was a lot of things so yeah when framing the the product and then um hackathons actually help a lot with the the whole mvp and getting things out there quickly and iterating on your on your project and getting user feedback quickly um but then yeah now you have to start focusing on that business model how it actually scales hiring um you know things like that actually getting investors interested um yeah and then uh you know once you get the capital obviously making it happen and scale from there um so yeah there's a lot of a lot of things there's a lot more to it than the code itself yeah i i bet i bet i am luke welcome i like no no problem for being late i know eu air travel is crazy right now i'm i'm also scared i'm flying from the us to m europe later tonight and like oh let's see if it works um but welcome and just am talking um with karen and alec about kind of the things that you you submit a hackathon project and like what do you start worrying about after right like to turn a hackathon project into something that becomes investable from a mvc perspective and alec and karen were sharing kind of their perspective i i'd love to dive in one one click deeper and and and then look i'll let you introduce yourself and and talk a little bit about you know what you're working on and what your relationship is with hackathons and how you took it kind of closed like that and again karen like one thing on this like you know adding a lot of things like you both strike me as like confident people and like know what you want and but it also like sounds to me like a very daunting thing to do right like you're now in in different kinds of rooms that you didn't maybe even sign up for kind of you you know you kind of got pulled into it you got an email like um what were some of the um problems or like really like challenges like hey like i'm not prepared for this or like some of the yeah those kind of like difficulties that you ran into where like i'm flexing really outside of my comfort zone like what were some of the things that you had to invest most of your energy and to kind of get comfortable around maybe karen first um i i would say the first revelation is that um after after you build a project uh during hackathon and when turned into into your business you need to figure out how to acquire your customers right it depends on also depending on your business model uh for instance for our first project it's a uh it's an upgrade platform so it's a b2 uh b2b2c model so you have to figure out what how to acquire creators artists in the first place and then when that's completed you have to figure out hey where do you find the the collectors that the the end customers that are going to uh purchase and acquire those those uh artists not to work um so this is one one challenge and then another uh a challenge is for sure for sure i think it's i like i have to must remember this from the tachyon curriculum um team risk is the top one risk for any uh business startup so like building a project with with some people with with some teammates within like a month a span of three weeks or a month is relatively uh easy compared to building a sustainable business with some people over one year or five years down the road so you have to figure out this dynamics of the team and really become friends and i lies with your co-founders awesome thanks for sharing that so getting cast getting real customers getting real-world feedback is a tough one and then um you know figuring out how you go from uh you know weekend team that's having some fun to you know some a mix of professional and then personal relationships that that it can actually be sustained over some time i like any any other things to add there that that were like big daunting things to you and that you had to invest some energy behind yeah lots of things honestly yeah and you know always learning every day obviously so i think um the uh one of the biggest things are uh yeah i mean gosh there were so many things um from just you know coming as an engineer into growing as like a product person uh you know just as a leader and things like that in general they're definitely or just you know with talking investors understanding what investors want um and you know what your customers want how to align them all up and then yeah just those are there's a lot of different spinning plates and i would say the uh one of the best uh pieces of advice we got was from juan um binet actually in the uh in the um he just said one of the best things you could do is just figure out how to learn as quickly as you can and to increase your rate of learning that i think covers like so many things it's like such a meta way of thinking about it that i think it covers all the things where it's like yeah as long as you're increasing your rate of learning at any given thing because you're going to have to do it all anyway you're going to have to figure it out on all different accounts like you're just going to have to do it so you're just going to have to figure out how quickly you can do it find the resources and figure out how to iterate on that as quickly as possible so that was the biggest takeaway but yeah i mean it was the most daunting thing to me was the first time i saw uh the numbers in the bank account that were higher than any numbers that i've ever seen and then the realization of oh wait yeah we're responsible for that um obviously we knew that and you always tell yourself and you know going in but you never really know until you know you're strapped in and that's it um so you know that definitely took a while to get used to that external pressure but you get used to that too so and and then now you embrace it and now it's a very strong drive forward so it's like yeah you just just keep embracing keep learning and adapting yeah because it is going to be challenging on all fronts for sure awesome cool things for sharing that so just like a whole new burden of responsibility both kind of like managing a budget making choices between how you prioritize your time how you prioritize other people's time and super cool insights thanks so much lil i i love this it's super super um interesting to hear all this luke and i'd like to kick it over to you and maybe just briefly introduce yourself and what you kind of do what you work on and then talk a little bit about your history and with hackathons and and how that was kind of an entry point or wasn't an entry point for what you're doing today uh so my name is zuck i'm currently working on filming fieldmine is a sharp working on infrastructure for storage providers so we focus on tooling that helps storage providers be good miners this includes doing storage but it also includes doing computing go research and we're hoping to build infrastructure that will allow computing governor daya which is pretty challenging right now but um there are many pieces that are being glued and we have a chance of actually making this possible in the next couple of years uh i got into hackathons back in 2018 actually this was the way i got in actually coding inventory like previously to that i was doing a bunch of mining like in 2013 but i don't think that was kind of a free it was more like uh you have a computer not doing anything let's try to like figure out where that computer could be doing something then then that turned out to be like 10 computers not one uh but yeah like at the end of the day it was not like really well free happening back then it was just doing some script mining uh that is kind of bonus uh hopefully today we'll be able to do computing jobs in a similar way uh back then as i was trying to do like something useful with my computer maybe in the next couple of months i'm gonna be able to do something useful with the computer network that we're building and hopefully we can allow people to kind of crowdsource computing resources and allow uh like very large computational jobs to be executed on that network also a few points on hackathons it was kinda uh unique in my case because it was back in 2018 in the ethereum ecosystem so that was a very great experience for me because i learned how communities form how uh how you actually go out and show up and show people what you're building on uh and actually uh we kind of use those opportunities to like also show new features of the products and we were kind of trying to leverage the hacknows to actually build the new features so we go there with some ideas we know what we want to solve and we use the hackathon to actually push out the feature that gives us like instant feedback because we have like a bunch of people that we need to present that to and we also get instant users uh especially back then because it was very curious in terms of like infrastructure and like dev tools were not really that uh that used so we were focused on actually like trying to build those tools and have uh also developers try to use them right on the hackathon and um and then try to to pitch that to judges and then uh i i think we are in a similar uh moment in the falcon and ipfs ecosystems because like storage is much slower uh in terms of innovation uh compared to uh like theorem mainly because it is much higher and we are now at the point where things are becoming possible and i i think like we are in a similar situation uh as i was back in 2018 first of all because we are in a bear market so like most people uh will be actually listening to you when you are building something it's not just going to be hype it's going to be people trying to actually understand what you're building and trying to use that and a lot more people will be ganking that want to build rather than people that want to sell which is also very important for our ecosystem to evolve uh and uh for anyone starting now i think it's a perfect moment to actually build things see how the community is gonna evolve the falcon and ipfs communities are still very very small even though like a lot of work was done uh the ethereum ecosystem is not that small anymore like if you want to get in that ecosystem like probably no one is going to notice that if you get in the ipfs and falcon ecosystem you can build a lot of uh a lot of traction very fast if you build the right things and you can get a lot of exposure uh and lucas is probably the best person to help you out with that if you succeed with this packaging and if you get some prizes or uh if you uh win on the hackathon or you even pitch to lucas and lucas thinks that it's a good idea uh a few things can happen from there i i love good ideas and it's it's lucas there's a whole community of people right that are you know that i work with and that are invested in you know helping builders succeed right like that is literally my job description so um yeah like i i try to make the the connection try to make those connections possible and like facilitate those meetings and i i have one one quick question and book on on this like one specific element that you described which is i first of all i love this idea of like taking a strategic look and like almost like a step back medic what's the best place to jump in right and then like finding the ecosystem that actually has the highest almost like return on investment where you're like this actually has that i get the most impact for my time or something it's not you know you're not spending money you're spending your time which is is even more valuable i think and you said one thing that i'd love to double click on which is um that you used hackathons almost as a tool to get feedback and from people that you're reading describe how that works so you're building a feature at a hackathon and then what happens like on on the last day or i don't know you just walk around and chat people up and like okay what do you think or why is that after the hackathon and just curious like to how you how you get the feedback or you just pester everyone and annoy them until they tell you what they think yeah hopefully you do it before so you don't build something stupid uh i mean it was much easier back in 2010 because like it was a physical event now you would need to like be on discord and bring people there and discover that is a bit busy so um might be hard to get feedback before uh but that actually it's very useful to like get even before you actually start thinking about the hacking like try to think about the things that you would want to uh do in your life like what are you missing like in terms of like social networking like social networking is kind of bad right now like most of the day is owned by a few companies and uh you're not kind of using the same data like with different apps which is stupid like uh why don't you try to fix that and there are many tools right now available to you like a table land like um a bunch of dr tools that the textile team built like that you can actually use to like show some apps that are interoperable and that uh can actually share data between them and maybe uh you build like the same app but then you have like two algorithms uh that the apps are using for actually like showing uh like feeds of people's photos and so on so uh but but then what you do is you have that idea and you go to people and you ask them whether uh they would want to do something like that and then you try to also to be to like ask very open questions like what are the things that are not really working for them in terms of social networking and so on and you try to get to something that uh really makes sense and then you try to build it now uh in our case it was devtools mainly because we were kind of in the early phases on the interim ecosystem so like it's not like many use cases were being built back in 2018 on ethereum so we were trying to build tools that would help with developers build better tools by the way those are like the tools that are also required in the interior in the falcon ecosystem right now like because there are many tools that need to be built uh that would allow developers maybe at some point to actually have interoperability uh maybe have some of the other uh characteristics of webfree that we are seeing right now in d5 but we are not seeing video so maybe like function uh so like uh like functional addressable computation for example like uh try using fluence try combining multiple uh workloads that would otherwise be very difficult to glue on a cloud provider because you for example with lambda functions you it's very hard for you to actually like have communication through the content but on ipfs through uh content addressing and uh functional addressing with the fluence logic it's not that hard but very few people have actually tried that so those are all like uh avenues that you could adventure and potentially learn a bunch of things up uh also zooming out and maybe also thinking about where do you position yourself for future growth um if you think about what happened in the interim ecosystem we got innovation only in a relatively small uh part of our lives which is finance but if you zoom in on file and ipfs probably like most of the things uh that you're interacting with with your phone or computer will need to be changed and those are many more than what we have changed on the on the finance side so thinking about uh all of those things that you can actually improve uh with falcon ipfs so would definitely help you uh think about the ideas that you wanna build cool thanks so much for that perspective um i i think there's a ton here right like if making the right choices when evaluating what to build on how to even find the right ecosystem i also love in the point kind of around front loading as much of the feedback as possible and and i bet they would even have you know to parents point from earlier when you're actually then going into this world where you know trying to engage real customers you already have a version of that and that makes it a lot more compelling to you know follow on opportunities ella karen and looking a little bit at time i'd love to um close out with um kind of what vuk already started which is like what are some of the opportunities that you see like what what do you think cause that holds the most potential and i'll try to force you to limit it to really like the top one or top two um avenues that you believe um people should pursue be it like you know the type of event right participate in hackathon the ecosystem right ethereum versus something else or the five engineer system or you know a specific use case or what category is it the dev tool or is it a you know maybe end user facing tool like where do you see the greatest opportunities i'll kick it off with alec maybe and then karen i'll let you close it out yeah that's really excellent question there's lots of things there it'd be kind of hard to pare it down but the best way i could probably do that is i i personally uh obviously crypto you know finance um but you know i've always been really curious about the non-financial use cases kind of with values like just hey and i think hack fest is one of the best places to experiment with those kinds of things because you know as vic was saying as well like it's very oriented around certain other use cases that are possible now um with these tools and so yeah i would just say yeah like i i'm personally really curious about how we can integrate this infrastructure in more parts of our lives that's kind of what we're trying to do software distribution um and kind of fix those problems but uh also another thing is it's wallets are still hard to like i that's still like i mean that you would think that after all this time it still um would be as easy to you know basically they're still not at the point where if you can ask your grandma to set it up uh then they need to be at that point for us to really hit scale so i think that that's still an important problem that it'll probably take a long time to still figure out but there should be lots of teams trying to and there's not i mean there's lots of great wallets out there not not you know throwing shade or anything i love a lot of these wallets it's just uh you know self-custodizing and stuff like that it's hard so yeah thanks alec and then karen what are the biggest opportunities in europe uh so um as a shameless plug for heiferdab oh so obviously i'm excited about uh no code solutions for uh for building uh applications in in web3 and so it opens up opportunities not only devs but uh like any other non-dev uh users who is interested in getting on board to webster to be a builder building a builder in web 3. and other than that i'm i'm really interested in the field in the potential uh in developing a more efficient market in matching talent with positions either position especially within a dallas because i think now i don't see any i think we're still relying on really uh web to traditional web 2 um solutions for figuring out the matching between uh talent and contributors and any uh positions or opportunities within the webster space cool um awesome thanks so much i think i i love this point around even if it was a shameless plug i'll still take it i think um you know it's almost like a meta dev tool right where you're not developing we're not even making lives easier for developers but you're making you're turning everyone into a developer and then making their lives easier which um i i love because i'm trying to get as many people um into the space as builders and if we can remove many roadblocks there and some of which might be on the engineering side and then that's awesome and cool i want to thank all of you we're kind of at time and for for joining this panel and kind of sharing your insights and i i learned a ton and i hope and you know you you took some of the fears maybe of people and and shown some light on the great opportunities um behind that follow after hackathon and all of you like best of luck with what you're building and and and once again right like proto collapse is still here to swat you guys right like even after the hackathon um and you know it's super great to hear alec that you know you got you're getting some great advice from juan and and and yeah that's that's just awesome right so like um let's let's continue to you know talk and and work together and and we want to help you succeed and and i'm super happy that you know you start in a hackathon and now look at you that's that's really really cool like i'm super super glad to see that and and thank you so much for your time that's and that was awesome thank you cheers pleasure is ours have a go on everyone thank you alec thank you karen thank you luke um cool um jacob if you don't mind i'll just kind of um dive right into the next session um and talk a little bit about um the builders program and of ipfs and filecoin which we kind of implicitly um talked about and for you know the last bit um where you know alec and karen already shared their journey through an accelerator and so let me just um you know share my screen here and and talk about some of those post-hackathon opportunities not in the context of a you know casual conversation but a little bit more structured and so once again i kind of and rook was kind of talking about it already and the ecosystem and that's growing around ipfs and tricoin is is growing and it's our strongest asset in um you know growing this five-point network and and web3 in general we have and with the fico network and on the one side a rapidly expanding site of storage capacity of the network so um today we have over 4 000 storage providers all across the globe and they're providing um 18 million terabytes of storage capacity which is an insane amount and you know and wildly exceeds our expectations from when we join launched the mainnet about a year and a half ago and it's also 18 million terabytes is about one percent of in total cloud storage capacity so that's that's really cool to see and it's still them growing at a very fast rate and then on the other hand and we have this increasing demand for all of that storage capacity and from an explosively growing ecosystem and there are now over it's actually over 450 i think startups and elastic clip this summer so i gotta update the slide and startups that are in this ecosystem and you just heard from three of them and that are operating in the space and are and building great um products and services and and there's a combined total of over 9 000 developers and who are contributing to filecon ipfs and and various other technologies that are kind of adjacent or built on top of it and on github and outlier ventures in you see it in the tweet and found that you know as with that file coin why not as large as ethereum as luke already pointed out um is still one of the most actively developed blockchain protocols and we're not seeing that slowdown um despite kind of the macro trend in the market and so with these 330 startups and 9000 developers like what how how do we ensure and and that is my role right so i co-lead the bidders program and for ipfs and firecoin and where our mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of builders and really help them make the internet more decentralized robust and secure with the types of services that they build and there's a couple of things and that we do to kind of make that happen one of them is hackathons right and you're at um one of our you know major events of the year and there will be lots of people watching what you're building and we do now around or we're part of um you know around five hackathons per month and and just in the first half of this year we've touched over 30 000 people via our events and and we've received since last year in april over 2300 submissions to um to you know all the various hackathons and and that represents around you know 7 000 builders since the inception of the program and we're aiming to keep growing that number and i hope that many of you will submit a project at the end of this hackathon and but then you know once again that's not the end of it right so hackathons is really just the first step and we want to celebrate the builders that submit projects and and we we are here to support the next steps right so um yes i try to kind of put this on the slide here how how that journey might look like for some of you and so you might join the hack fs and project then we have a grants program and i'll double click into that in a second and then you heard from um karen and alec and about the accelerator program one of which is the tachyon one um and then after that you may go on to you know secure some seed investments from venture capital funds um across the globe and just like two stories you heard from two of them um on the panel or three with books and and filming and there's many others right so i know there's in our current acceleration cohort we have over 20 teams and that started in a hackathon and and here's just like two anecdotes on the slide so secured finance which raised four million dollars in in the summer of last year actually started at heck fs in summer 2020 so similar to alex story um and then we have another um team that just joined the in the first quarter of this year the accelerator program with tech stars and and they you know they started in a hackathon in november and then applied for a grand in december and and kind of took it from there and even if company building is not for you right and we talked about some of those big challenges that and come along with it and there's a lot of opportunities for folks who want to drop out of building their own company maybe temporarily would put it on halt and to you know explore in the ecosystem for jobs and other career opportunities and if at some point you want to come back in that's totally impossible so all the programs are obviously open to projects that are coming from an eq are have been incubated elsewhere and let me maybe double click into the grants program just for a second and so this is really designed for all sorts of people i'll highlight a few so one is you know foundations that want to move this space forward maybe a company that's looking to accelerate the development of some features um and um or a developer team that's that's itching to hack on on fire controls and ipfs tools and after a hackathon maybe and we have two types of programs that we do there we have what's called the next step grant and that's um pretty much open for all um hackathon you know submissions and winners in in particular and that just gives them a little bit of additional funding and resources with no expectations and apart from you know keep building and and you know building out your project and then we have an open grants and category with with different other kinds of formats where you get once again financial support but then also technical and expertise and to that can flank your development and really help you and just in the first or in the last quarters the second quarter of 2022 we approved over 150 grand applications and about 50 of those are stemming from hackathons so and i was super happy to see that because it really shows that this you know idea that we can help people progress um with their projects through the different stages and and and kind of tailor the kind of support that we provide and by seeing that that much attraction for the program and then the other thing that i want to highlight is that acceleration program and we actually have several running um every year and and they're you know these programs are designed for dedicated founders that are looking for that mentorship and that from people all around the space and you had gabriel's name mentioned and but there's a few other people and and here's just a few on on the slide here but one bennet who started protocol labs and um you know originally and conceived of ipfs and falcon and and molly who does um product at protocollabs and andrew who and is the co-founder of textile and tablelands which is um one of the projects that rook mentioned so lots of great people here to learn from and that can support you and we're doing these um with these acceleration programs with different partners and the one that's opening for applications soon is actually um outlier ventures um and yeah but the others are also here right so long hash we have one with the india blockchain accelerator um alliance faber and you know the one that we talked about a lot during the conversation earlier with tachyon that's that will also likely renew and so lots of opportunities here and if you want to learn more about them reach out to myself and directly or go and to our website and hackathons at on post 500.000 opportunities where you can double click into some of these um and learn more about kind of the things that are open to you with that um i'll i'll stop talking and hand the mic and back over to jacob and to introduce the next speaker thanks so much thank you lucas um yeah amazing it was like a whole hour of lucas we appreciate you uh jumping in and answering all that um if you guys didn't get enough of lucas you'll be back uh so just stick around uh he'll be running another panel a little bit later um so we are going to jump into our next talk of the summit which is going to be by ali developer ali i should be chatting about um the future of file coins so filecoin obviously has a ton of stuff in the pipeline and recent stuff that has been very exciting announcements so um a lot to cover um in a pretty short amount of time so i'll probably just get out of the way and let ali handle this so um ally when you're ready feel free to jump in here uh share some slides if you've got them um and i'll let you take it from here thanks so much for being here awesome awesome thank you and thank you for the introduction and i caught a little bit of the end of lucas's talk and he's absolutely right there is so much going on in our ecosystem and so many opportunities to be involved um and so much coming up in the pipeline too which i want to chat to you about today so uh hello all um i'm ali and i'm a developer advocate here at the farcoin foundation uh so i'm very happy to be surrounded by such amazing company here at hack fs and i'm really grateful be to be included in today's amazing lineup as well so i appreciate you all taking the time out of your normal schedules to listen in and to learn today as well pack stuff on the back for uh you know spending your free time uh doing something positive for yourself as well so today i want to chat about the future of filecoin and some of the projects we're really excited about here at fivecoin and protocol labs as well um so uh first a reminder of why we're doing all these things so i heard this quote um that is up on the slide here a couple of months ago when i was listening to juan bernie the founder of protocol labs in case you didn't know uh talk at a small peer-to-peer meet-up in paris and it really struck me at the time because this is exactly why i'm in tech and more specifically it's why i'm in web 3. so one of the reasons i went into tech originally is because of just how fundamentally innovative and uh how fundamentally innovation and technological advancement if i can get that out i can change and improve our human lives so tech really creates new frontiers for us like the ability to take photos of black holes or to build sustainable energy sources uh go to the moon many years ago it can also uh help us solve some of our increasingly complex problems so with faster and more powerful computing crunching over more and more stored and available data and we'll get to that soon and it also has the capability to enable changes in not just our daily lives but those small daily uh changes do add up but also in society itself so we really don't have to look back too far to see evidence of that either like in the past 100 years alone advances in things like healthcare or inventions like the sewing machine the washing machine the printing press and then onto the more modern era of computers obviously the internet and mobile phones uh have drastically impre improved the lives of millions um and that's paved the way for major social changes and also a rethinking of the value and role of people in society as well so for example those household automations gave freedom and empowerment to women across the world they changed the landscape for women in general for the better the internet's given more accessibility and education to education and ideas sorry as well as enabling collaboration on a global scale and i have no idea where we would have been if the covert pandemic had been in the 80s for example so to me the real goal is not just tech in and of itself the real goal is people and it's improving the human condition uh by leveraging tech and other scientific breakthroughs to do so so uh that's also why it's kind of essential that we're creating a future for the underlying technology that we use daily to provide that open and fair web that protects our human rights and helps move humanity forward um so you know obviously that's the vision we hold here at protocol labs and farcoin foundation and it's a vision that was also shared by the early web and open source movement and both of which were founded on being like a cooperative accessible and free sharing of knowledge and information so this is really what drives us um here at far corn foundation and the protocol labs and it's a mission that i'm generally here for and why i'm working in web 3 and i'm sure many of you have similar stories as well um but it's not without its challenges of course so let's talk about our data which is where we really play here so data is an absolutely essential part of those daily lives and also a super fast growing field in web 3 because we need to enable distributed storage mechanisms that can also enable so many new applications and use cases to be built out with more permanence and with trustlessness and without the silos that we're used to in the centralized world today which you know can have a lot of our problems so they have central points of failure central attack vectors um they're sensors censored because uh these are centralized entities can decide what data they want to put on there uh and they can also just lock you out if they don't like you for example or you're on from their own country you're from the wrong side of the road you're wearing the wrong socks it's their choice it's their it's their centralized well centralization model so they can do that anyway so uh these current models uh have several issues and they also like create vendor lock-in and create a lack of a free market around data pricing and like portability of your own data as well um so we've definitely seen a lot of issues around companies create using us as the product so all these issues is obviously why five coin was originally uh launched um it's designed to leverage crypto economic incentives to keep data distributed reliable and verifiably stored as well as being incredibly cheap um and that this mission and the current issues in data storage is why filecoin was launched but as you're most likely aware um but and just over 15 months since we did launch the network which it hasn't been long we're so young we're still babies we've achieved so many great um things and we've come a long way towards creating an internet scale decentralized storage network but there's still a lot more to do um and this is why this is this is why this talk is called the future of far coin as well um so currently file coin enables verifiable storage at scale in that decentralized trustless and open way but accessing and retrieving that data isn't always very simple it's also not that easy to create programmable applications on top of this data or smart contracts or to do computation either overstate or over the data itself so all of these technology vectors form the future of far coin and the tech stack for the decentralized internet and we're not just focused on growing the technology either we're also growing our impact and aiming to build sustainably and with social good at our core um and our core value as well which is why the first project that i uh building for the future of filecoin that i want to share with you today is far coin green so some of you might have heard of this project falcon green is an initiative that seeks to make the falcoin uh blockchain uh carbon neutral and in time carbon negative uh so we're also a part of the crypto climate accord here so the thing is a lot of the conversations happening around blockchains focus on the proof of work chains and how much energy they're consuming um and look we are thinking about or at least falcon green is thinking about what uh the positives are of having this transparent ledger that we can track data on uh because filecoin green when we because we have an open network that allows us to capture and report storage provider energy use and energy sources and efficiency statistics all of a sudden we can uh track the energy in our chain as well as tracking where that energy is coming from and we can create tools for the entire web three um you know space and beyond actually um to help with attracting their energy systems and this is becoming a big thing in the world especially in europe and especially and you know many other countries we're all quite concerned about climate change and we want to create actions so this is what falcon green's doing it's looking to make the falcon network green and sustainable as well as being an important player in driving those sustainability initiatives in crypto and leveraging that transparent tracking and accountability provided by the blockchain to create those open source tools to measure and reduce environmental impacts in web3 protocols and there's even an api you can play around with with filecoin green and some grants that i'll get to later um so as developers you can be involved that way but in order to meet these goals uh the team has done quite a few things they've created an energy dashboard to evaluate the use of energy on the far coin chain which is at filecoin.energy it's also connecting storage providers in the network to renewable energy and providing assistance and grants to do this uh including green grants and the launch of a regenerative finance uh grant round as well that they've just launched they're also running hackathons and conferences to gather the community together and hear new ideas and build a greener web 3 dev community so if you're interested in this side of things in this um action on climate change and creating greener chains and green tools for energy tracking uh then farquain green might be something that you want to have a look into um so they've even pledged and i actually was watching uh mark from the far clean green team this morning at 8th barcelona he gave an up or this afternoon i should say at 8th barcelona he gave a talk and this slide really stood out to me um so they've made a file queen green pledge where we want to be 80 renewable electricity procured by end of financial year 2023 so that's not really very far away and 100 by 2025. um so they've made a pledge to try and make this happen on the file coin chain so we're not just buying carpet credits to offset our carbon usage but we also want to be completely sustainable um so obviously if you want to be uh find out more about any of this uh there's heaps of ways to be involved like i said earlier there is an api and the falcon green team is running hackathons they're one running one at the moment called sbs and there'll be more in future um there's plenty of places to get update you can follow updates follow them on the twitter for more information and contact them there as well and you can apply for a farquain green grant as well so there's our grants options uh for these type of uh initiatives um and the next exciting thing that's coming up if you are around paris uh or you're going to scc uh just after that we have a sustainability uh summit which they've been planning for a long time and is going to be awesome lots of cool speakers there so july 23 i think that's on uh 22-23 so check that out if you're around paris and you're interested in that so the future of far coin is then also highly retrievable with file coin saturn so at the moment the far coin uh network is really more of an archival network when we store something on file coin it can take quite a long time to retrieve that data which is why our use cases are really for like kind of permanent and open data storage at the moment but falcon saturn is aiming to change this uh so this is this is one of the reasons far clean saturn is building out a decentralized cdn that will allow anyone to participate in the network from their laptops and other devices and be rewarded for serving files and folders to requesters so what that kind of means in layman's terms is that i can install something on my laptop and be a part of the filecoin retrieval network so not only does this drop latency and improve retrieval speeds in the network it kind of incentivizes participation and creates a retrievals market which is a really exciting project and i'm definitely not doing it justice you can even actually at the moment i believe currently a test it out so if you do want to join in or try out filecoin saturn um and be involved in the beta version of testing file queen saturn it's currently out and you can check out the github it's also got a massive roadmap so this is like a really enormous project and and there's lots of information on the github as well like the farquaad saturn team does host a lot of demo days uh which they record and put up on github so if you are interested not github youtube sorry so if you are interested in seeing more go and check out some of their youtube as well or as i said be involved um they're looking for early partners so check out the code base there and and get in touch if you do want to try and be part of this early network but it will enable so many more people to access the network or enable faster retrievals so i can't imagine some of the use cases that we're going to get um from having this you know decentralized cdn live on the far coin network so pretty exciting project and we're looking forward to that like obviously they've got a really quick timeline or they're hoping to get this out by you know q3 or q4 of this year so it's going to be really exciting to see so many people be able to actively participate in this network from their browsers and maybe even their phones in future then will be just like uh silicon valley season four fifa um almost anyway just kidding anyway the next project is one that i'm personally very excited about uh and i've been working kind of closely with this team so uh i will probably spend a little bit longer on this one because the future of filecoin is going to be programmable with the filecoin virtual machine uh what does this mean this basically means that we're bringing smart contracts to a storage network so you've got storage already robust storage network combined with smart contracts so you know currently filecoin's known for being this decentralized storage and retrieval network like providing a lot of exabytes of distributed data the largest distributed and decentralized uh data storage network in the world with thousands of storage providers obviously and we can kind of think of this as the layer zero but it's really just a start because we want to be able to compute and analyze over and with the data on that far coin network um so this is the goal of the fbm to enable users to be able to deploy their own smart contracts or actors as the way call them in the uh filecoin ecosystem or in the fvm ecosystem and unlock the ability to perform on-chain computation over state data so this additional layer of capability which we can kind of think of as the layer one on the network adds programmability to this network um and that is going to open up so many boundless uh use cases and opportunities um and i know we were speaking to valas just before and they're super excited about this as well and they were part of the early builders team too so shout out to them for helping to give us feedback on that program and and on the early fem as well um but just a quick look at the technicals the fbm's built on wasn't core with the reference sdk built in rust and it's also working on supporting evm and solidity capability out of the box compatibility out of the box too actually uh we've just released milestone one of fvm onto the filecoin network so it's called the v16 upgrade the skier and skyr skier upgrade uh and that's just been released with built-in actors to the filecoin um lotus chain so it's actually running on the network right now but that is just step one uh so it's only built in actors the real programmability will happen in milestone 2.1 which will be out later this year and we're aiming to have that be completely evm compatible so it will be uh the seven f e v m so to speak so it'll be the file coin uh evm compatible file coin uh virtual machine coming out later this this year which will mean you can bring all your uh skills from solidity programming uh use all the tooling in the ethereum ecosystem like hard hat or foundry or whatever you like to use you'll be able to use them and deploy to the filecoin network and take advantage of some of those extras um available in the falcon network like robust storage um so that decision's been made and that's so if you want to keep an eye on that uh check out uh the fbm channel of our five point slack as well um but why does this matter are we just trying to build the same use cases as you know are already out there in ethereum in file coin well no um it it's going to really unlock um some really interesting possibilities because we already have this story this robust storage layer so this slide kind of illustrates some of those powerful use cases and that includes trustless reputation systems so imagine an overlay network of nodes that could patrol this network this uh storage network performing random deals with storage providers in order to gauge key metrics like quality of service guarantees performance latency and region details so those nodes can then store these reputation scores on chain making them traceable and verifiable and enabling users to decide on the terms of service and hence the storage providers that they want to use for their data so that's that's one possibility for these and another one is replication workers so you can ensure the resiliency of your data by ensuring it's always stored end times automatically or be able to store your data just once in the file coin network and have this a trustless actor a smart contract replicate and send that to multiple storage locations and times you could also create a user-defined policy of rules for that data to obey so you can specify things that you got from your trustless reputation system and one of the big ones is going to be perpetual renewal of deals so creating basically permanent storage deals because an actor constantly renews those deals with as many different storage providers as you want i'm probably going over time here because i'm so excited about this one so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna move on so the milestone one like i said has already been shipped and is actually running on the file coin chain right now so hara uh and milestone two the evm compatible one is getting worked on as we speak and you can be involved in that process um there's there's a lot of action happening in in the issue so if you are like a developer that's interested in uh working on bare bones or even just reading about how we're building this blockchain you can go to the github and have a look through the issues where there's a lot of discussions happening around how we're going to do this and why we're making some of these technical and engineering decisions that we are well actually as a group that we are making um so there's also dev opportunities um there's open grants uh for the fvm and there's an early builders program that will be focused on the evm uh compatible fvm like uh builders uh coming up soon so keep an eye out for that as well uh the next use case that i kind of want to talk about is um compute computation uh with filecoin um and it's a bit different to what i just spoke about with the farcoin virtual machine so this uh computational which is project back back allow uh which is portuguese actually for cod cod portuguese for cod which is compute over data so fun fact there uh cool name which i have trouble pronouncing but i'm sure someone who who is uh portuguese can probably correct me um but anyway project at baccalaure is reinventing science with open collaborative computing so we're really aiming to help those people with big data sets so one of the biggest uh challenges in big data is how to process growing data sets efficient efficiently and quickly while also managing costs so you can have a look at this uh top picture here the typical data pipeline uh you've got your ingest and process you've got your engineer and split test data training data train and process serve uh so project baccalaurea is really working on this first part of the pipeline so taking on the challenge to bring data processing to the nodes where it's stored on filecoin and give researchers and data engineers the ability to publicly reproduce data pipelines so it's really aiming to transform france transform if i can get my words out big data processing by giving developers simple low-cost distributed first tools that unlock a new collaborative ecosystem so if you're in academics or science get in touch with the team or check out their repo which i've linked there uh that might be something that that is really interesting to you and could be really useful to you um like i said we're not just aiming to grow filecoin uh technically we're also growing file coin by uh being part of uh public goods or creating public either creating public goods or um storing public data sets uh that should be stored persistently on file coin and ipfs and one of the ways we're doing this is through the file coin foundation for the decentralized web so this is a non-profit um so it's a 501c for those in america whose mission is to ensure that permanent preservation of humanity's most important information and it does this by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks and focuses on charitable activities related to preserving important data sets such as building and supporting the decentralized web community funding research and development and educating the public about the decentralized web and they've done some amazing work uh this team and continues to do some amazing work so these are some of the web two data sets uh that they have helped to store uh on the file coin um ecosystem on the file firecoin network i should say so the showa foundation uh if you ever get a chance to watch um uh tim i think his name is from the show foundation talk i would definitely recommend that uh he's a really interesting guy but the show foundation we're preserving a lot of their data from holocaust survivors um together with styling so that that's a really cool use case we're also storing a lot of climate data so as you can imagine these climate data sets are massive they're really big sets of data so we're storing a lot of that on the file coin our network as well uh we've also worked together with the internet archive to help store um some of the data around american elections you could probably guess which one um and do some more uh with that uh just to make sure that it's tamper-proof as well and censorship resistant and that we can we are not uh just a raising history to our liking basically um so those are some of the cool things that we are doing uh with the with uh web 2 data sets and the file coin foundation the decentralized web is doing and they are doing so much more social good as well so if you do have kind of a good use case for them uh please get get in touch with that team or well really it's a charity so a lot of file clean uh employees lend out their time to working on the file foundation for the decentralized web um i know we're also starting to store um mood courses from universities to i have ipfs and filecoin as well so that's going to be a really cool used case that's coming out soon too and we're definitely working with some of our ukrainian storage providers to help store some of that data um from ukraine uh there because you know there's we all know it's happening there so you know we will make sure that we're preserving humanity's um data uh and making sure that you know it's preserved um properly uh so the last uh thing i think for the future of filecoin is that it's going to be in your browser uh and there was a recent announcement um as well that i will actually i'm just going to skip to it because this is the exciting part so one of the most exciting recent news stories was the addition of file going to the brave wallet so this is a seamless integration uh together with many of the other projects that i've talked to the about today really paves the way for new applications to be built natively on the web and the team that is like really doing a lot of work in this space like so making sure that file coin and ipfs are really accessible or available in the web is talking to all the browsers not just brave to try and make sure that protocols um have a home uh on on all the browsers is the browsers and platforms team which is headed up by dietrich ayala for those of you that might know um so he does a lot of work with the open web foundry as well also what's it called w3c i think yeah and the open web uh he does a lot of volunteering for that as well and he's making sure that you know we have a voice at the table there too so some really cool stuff happening on the browser's team another cool thing that happened recently was uh metamask snapdeal so these snap deals kind of allow developers uh to expand the functionality of metamask and and make uh basically instant file clone storage deals um so making a storage deal can actually be a bit of a lengthy process on file coins so with metamask snapdeals we're making it almost instantaneous so you can imagine the kind of applications you can build online uh with something like this and combined with the fvm and then combined with that far coin saturn and the retrievability aspect so there's so many kind of use cases that are coming up for filecoin uh to get really excited about to be honest um i can't even keep up with them all like the teams uh the ecosystem is doing such an amazing job at bringing all of these kind of different parts of the uh far coin network to life and bringing them together um so we're also looking into how to support far coin on or ipfs really on mobile so if you're interested in building in any of these features get in touch with us as well or get in touch with the team and this is the kind of goals for the browsers and platform team or what they want to do next um so like i said lots happening in our ecosystem a lot we're trying to make it accessible to everyone we're trying to really expand the use cases and really make an open web which was our you know original value our mission as well and the last part the last part the future of far coin is also you we definitely could not build the future that is this decentralized open future that we all want uh this censorship resistant trustless kind of network without um help from all the developer developers out there without help with from your ideas um as lucas was saying before we just couldn't do it without any of our ecosystem partners or without your ideas or your participation or your feedback as well um so you and our ecosystem is really the strongest asset in growing the far queen network and growing our future and helping to shape that future as well and we're always open to your ideas like i've mentioned a lot of the githubs are open actually pretty much all of them you can go to those githubs you can see those issues and you can uh chat on those issues if that's something that's interests you if you're uh just here to learn i think lucas is probably mentioned and you are at a hackathon already so you probably already know about the hackathons uh and i think lucas also mentions that we've got kind of a pipeline from oh it's playing sorry uh so i think lucas also mentioned that we've got a pipeline from hackathons through to grants through to accelerators and then we also have that pipeline that goes into employment opportunities or to our launch pad program um so please get in touch or be involved if you want to um and yeah otherwise i think uh this is this is pretty much all from me i'm excited to see what ideas you come up with with some of these projects that i've mentioned uh on the that are coming up on the far coin network so really excited to see what you will build with falcoin and i'm sorry i think i'm a little bit short there jacob but i can take any questions or just talk on any kind of topic you like yeah i thought we had a deal here aren't we um i was supposed to use filler words i'm sorry i forgot about the words my bad that's that's awesome i mean it's great to see like all the uh i mean i mean there's so many different directions that like the file coin ecosystem is um expanding like you mentioned like saturn i think you guys are going to run out of planets pretty soon um and then you know we're even trying to take ipfs to a satellite with lockheed martin actually so that's another one that i kind of another case i didn't mention but we recently announced that we're going to be trying to run a node on a satellite together with lockheed martin and look this isn't just like a kind of stunt as well um because one of the things about ipfs is that because you can trust the content that you're getting you don't need to care where that data comes from so it can come from any satellite friendly or enemy and you can trust the data that you're getting you can verify the data that you're getting so it kind of creates this trustless cooperation um so and we are like going to send one up to a satellite somewhere in space so ipfs is going to space and fun but it's going to space soon too which is kind of cool so thanks for reminding me about that use case yeah yeah i mean it's not it's not a stunt but like it's still cool like i mean definitely it's in the name isn't it we had to send it there eventually yeah you had no choice yes exactly um well cool i mean we do have some more time i don't know if there's anything you wanted to maybe double click on as part of kind of some of these exciting things i know you mentioned like you know the fvm work that you're working on um in particular but um yeah i mean like when you think about kind of you know directionally this kind of expanding ecosystem that you've built like you said it's it's only i think you said like you know 15 months old like it's pretty recent um but you know to see all this kind of work that's coming out of it um you know to me like i think kind of saturn is probably you know very exciting just from like the point of view of like thinking about um you know just speed up saying computation like where do you turn first you turn to a cache a cdn right and just like data enables like so much more throughput which is really interesting um i don't know like i if there's anything you want to double click on i mean we've got the time for it um and uh and of course anybody who's watching if you do have any questions about any of the things that we just talked about shout out you know i'm happy yeah happy to talk about anything as well it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be on the topic of this talk if you have a question in general happy to answer it for you as well um yeah what i love about saturn as well is like firstly the team they are amazing um but secondly um you know they're really doing something pretty unique here and it's really going to allow more people to be involved in the falcon network too which is like two of the main things that i really love as well as obviously getting that retrievals um going so the input output that you're used to with like web 2 applications going on the far coin ecosystem so i mean it's definitely going to kind of be a game changer when this comes out so it's like one of definitely one of the most exciting things happening in the ecosystem together with fpm but i'm working on that so i'm biased but uh yeah definitely interested to for when this comes out so and also people can be part of it right you can download this on your browser and like serve files to other people like you would with an ipfs node so that's you know going to be pretty pretty cool to see happen and like i said it's uh you can kind of download that already i believe uh from their github hopefully i'm not giving the wrong information out everyone goes and goes and downloads it and the team goes ally what have you done but i'm sure it'll be fine uh let them know if there are any problems who are always looking for feedback like we said that's part of the process we're very open about you know trying to get our feedback from the community so if you do try it out and there's a problem let us know but yeah very exciting going to open up a heap of use cases um and yeah as i mentioned like definitely uh i can actually probably talk about a few more of the use cases that the fbm is going to unlock um yeah the slide is amazing so i mean anything you want to dive into on this slide i mean just like yeah clearly you thought out like what what what can we do with them yeah yeah so well i mean we definitely haven't thought of everything like we can't wait to see what some people do with um the fvm so obviously it's also going to kind of open up the possibility for d5 but one of the things that i'm most excited about given that we're already a data storage network is unlocking the possibility for data dows and the data database so this kind of means like imagine you're kick-starting the data set economy by tokenizing data sets so you then get to like capture and represent the value of these like data sets to society and then you can exchange those data tokens between peers you can request computation services on that data like you know you could have validation or you could join that data analysis uh feature detection um so and then once you're getting into kind of feature detection and extraction you're like really kind of then moving into machine learning and i'd love to um i just heard a talk the other day about um kind of how we would decentralize machine learning because it feels like that's kind of right to do as well because you know you've got it takes so much computation machine learning and a lot of them are behind closed doors and that makes sense because they've got they have to collect and tag such big data sets but if this data is all becomes open and then we can create this kind of you know decentralized machine learning model that's just i'm just getting carried away now but the data data does and the dataverse uh you know tokenized data sets is definitely something that's going to be unlocked by fvm and it's really something that we couldn't do without a storage network and then you know having like implementing programmability on top of it so because once you start like adding that computation onto the far clone blockchain you have like computation and storage under the same roof and this is like really going to be one of the big strengths and differentiators for the farcoin network so i'm really excited about that um wonder you know nfts obviously is another big use case for us so we're already storing something like i don't know 69 million million billion i don't know nfts um on ipfs and filecoin at the moment so with fbm you'll not only be able to you know store them store that metadata on ipfs and filecoin but you'll be able to mint them on filecoin as well um and it's completely evm compatible like i said um so that's kind of going to be exciting to see uh the kickstarting of a creative economy perhaps on um where you can then tokenize them as well on the farcoin virtual machine so that's going to be uh pretty pretty interesting as well and then obviously there's all those things if anyone's from like kind of a storage background and this is hack rfs so probably you have a good idea of this um you know when you talk about traditional cloud networks you want to have user policies around your data you want to be able to decide where your data is stored how resiliently how long for like all these things should be in the hands of the engineer really basically um so that's what you know is is really going to get unlocked by the fbm as well so you're going to be able to kind of create these user policies um because it's going to be these smart contracts or actors as we call them um on the on the fm on the filecoin network so you're going to be able to create user policies that decide how many copies of that data you want they'll be able to auto heal themselves as well so let's say one goes down which is really very rare in the far coin ecosystem um but let's say it did that that deal would be able to auto heal itself and store somewhere else off one of the other nodes which is super cool um and you know obviously that perpetual renewal of deals is going to be like a kind of a cool thing for the network as well you'll be able to just you know set and forget and it'll continually renew these deals for you at the cheapest price and with the parameters that you set for your storage provider so maybe uh there's been a government change and you have to change the parameters on your storage provider well on your user policy you'll be able to do that with the fvm as well uh it's also going to kind of unlock like l2 bridges then like we already do have some bridges over to ethereum to near to polygon to many of the other cool l1 projects but this is going to really enable that a lot more uh because it's already a layer one and already obviously evm compatible so yeah a lot lots going on in fvm land um and like i said we do have another early builders program coming up at the moment there is actually a few demos i wonder if i've got this on this slide there is a demo if you do want to play around with um kind of fbm actors and how they work one of our early builders called jim pick has um created this kind of actor playground with like a bunch of examples on there so you can play around with kind of how they work um if you go to that actor playground which i know this is a bit um hard to see but i can share these in the channel later as well um and there's also videos up on the youtube about that too if you are interested so yeah thank you i think uh yeah i think i've rather done enough about some of those use cases but yeah super excited about that and we're aiming for end of year so q4 for that to be released and you'll all be able to start building on things hopefully yeah and um i i i mean there's just so much to explore so i mean i don't think you're rambling honestly we did get a question and you know it was going to steal my my thunder from my question anyway so it was a good question um and and yeah so dale asked a question about sort of um you know i was going to ask a question about like what do you want to see built over the next couple weeks because that's my go-to default questions to hackathon obviously we care a lot about that gets built um but dale had a little bit of a spin on that so uh today's question what are some good examples of non-standard or non-obvious use cases uh for decentralized storage wow i mean you're really you're really throwing throwing a spanner at me here but look when i when i think about what you can build with um ipfs and filecoin at the moment in its current form um and with the devtools we have available which i'm sure most people have probably seen um the clearest use cases are for open data or for archival data like i kind of mentioned earlier um but you know one of the best things to do in this ecosystem is to find a pain point or find something that you're trying to build and you can't quite do and build a dev tool for that so i love seeing people submit projects that are almost like i found a pain point in your ecosystem and here's a dev tool to solve it i love those projects um or you know something we haven't considered so uh one of the hackathon entries i saw at i think it was the chain link hackathon actually uh but one of or it could be new york um i see a lot of these uh was like for an nft.storage helper for example and it it was aiming to so people don't necessarily know um what the image of the nft is going to be first because they're going to dynamically create that and they wanted to be able to then still store that and back it up to nft.storage they created a helper to do that another one was kind of like i saw a password manager um created on ipfs link sharing with ipfs is is also really cool um but backing anything up to web3.storage so i saw a really cool ecommerce site get built out um there was also like a wrapper around youtube which is kind of relevant these days um that you know stored your channel uh to ipfs and you youtube um or it didn't i don't think it quite did that um but you know that would be a good way to go as well um so there's really like a heap of a heap of ways you could go and think about this especially if you're thinking about like ipfs as a peer-to-peer protocol um that really creates this verifiable uh content id and then you're talking about you know storing and persisting that data using filecoin and using any other dev tools to do that like especially web3.storage or nft.storage uh that makes it super easy for you to do that with so um yeah there's honestly so many ways you you could go with this like even creating a personal blog post that you'd share or like you know a kind of a medium or a stack overflow or this there's definitely so many things you can do with it i've definitely seen a lot of really cool stuff with nfts as well um happen so i don't think that answered the question uh but uh there's some of my ideas off the top of my head i guess i mean this is great i mean i think you explored the space so yeah you know everybody's going to be doing that over the next couple weeks as well so uh i guess this is kind of a primer for that okay awesome well ali i feel like i've taken up enough of your valuable time i really appreciate you being um here and walking through all the just the kind of massive growth of the file coin ecosystem over the last little bit um it's really amazing to see and i think i speak for everybody i really appreciate your energy and what you're bringing to this um and it was it was awesome to have you here well thank you jacob and thanks for the uh questions at the end as well really appreciate that um and uh happy hacking everyone if you do have any questions we're in the discord and available as well awesome thanks so much ali thank you okay great we're gonna jump into our next chat here uh which is gonna be reviewing another ecosystem uh if i get the slides to work here another product in the kind of protocol labs ecosystem so i'm gonna bring up karine and alvin from the estuary team um there we go um so yes they're going to chat about estuary and and how it's being used entrusted by 150 i believe this is pronounced tetabytes uh of data clients um so uh yeah i mean i'll i'll just jump over to them um another awesome chat with another ecosystem or another product within the protocol labs ecosystem so um i'll let you kind of yep show your cameras and then i'll get my screen share out of the way um and then feel free to uh to jump into it nice to have you here with us yeah thank you so much let me just share my screen one second okay perfect all right so hey everyone i'm karine i'm a product manager here at protocol labs and i'm working on estuary and estuary is a reliable way to upload public data onto followpoint and pin it to ipfs and you can find it at asturia.tech so the outline for today's presentation is as follows the problem of centralized storage why estuary how esterary works a thousand foot view how do developers use estuary estuary's performance and the future of estuary so firstly the problem of centralized storage so first centralized storage is storage that is owned by a singular entity or organization and this causes many problems because if you store data with this one entity um and that entity decides to go down for the day then you're not able to access it and this also has other problems such as accessibility worldwide they're a limited amount of data centers so that also also causes problems and there's also monopoly over storage because there's only a few different storage and cloud companies so this allows them to dictate prices allowing them to put them sky high determine who can access this data and where it can be accessed worldwide now a solution to this is actually the decentralized storage model that filecoin is based off of um so this allows for an open market for storage and a peer-to-peer network of storage providers and this peer-to-peer network is between a client and a storage provider so a client is an individual who wants to upload their data um and a storage provider is an individual or an organization that's able to facilitate this now the great thing about falcoin again is that storage providers are able to set their own prices hence it's an open market so in comparison to the centralized storage systems where you only have um a few different cloud companies to choose from and a decentralized model you actually have multiple cloud companies um yeah so they're able to set their own prices and the client themselves are able to shop through and see a whole different um a whole different array of storage providers out there and how this works is that um storage providers actually to prove that they're having the storage uh they have to provide cryptographic proofs and this cryptographic proof means that they're storing their the data of the client correctly and that proof is put on a block to the network and the deal between the client and the storage provider is actually replicated six times to ensure that the data is available worldwide so why estuary now estrella actually solves a lot of the issues with file claim because it's actually a little bit difficult to use it it requires you to spin up your own ipfs node and to do this you need to know how to do so first of all and the computational power necessary so s3 itself is its own specialized ipfs node that protocol labs runs and basically what it is it's a brokerage between the client and the storage provider so let's say you yourself are the client and you want to store data on filecoin all you have to do is just ask ask story hey can you make storage deals for me and esther will automatically start to do this um so how this works is that you have a piece of data and this data has an associated cid in this cid once the deal is made is put onto the filecoin network so that's really important for retrieval later on and again um this this uh deal the client between the the deal between the client the storage fire is replicated six times also while the deal is in progress um your data is still retrievable off of the estuary node because it is pinned in there for hot retrieval and once the deal is made then is available for cold retrieval and here's a little bit more of an in-depth visual of the architecture here so on the left we have the clients and then in the middle you can see the estuary main node and then we also shuttle so you can send the deal request through the shuttles which eventually goes to the main node and then makes deal with the storage providers and these storage providers later on can apply to become miners and that's just an additional incentive layer for them so as you can see the s3 node is actually quite complex and it's using two protocols filecline and ipss um so yeah many things that go into it and if you want you can look at the code base yourself but if you're just a developer looking for something a little bit easier you probably just need this this is sre.tech this is our web ui and it's super easy to use all you have to do is drag and drop your files and astoria automatically starts making deals on your behalf and you can even check out your deals at street.com on the deals tab so here you can see your miner id the proposal receipt the file coin deal receipt and the status of the deal and the minor id usually starts with an f and that's important because it tells you who exactly is storing your data and in the fellow queens you'll receive you can see this minor id along with your cid now as i mentioned before the cid is super important for retrieving your data so let's say this was a traditional pinning service um if you have your pin you can retrieve your data no problem but let's say that pin is somehow lost well that's a big issue because now you can't retrieve your data anymore but what what's so great about estrella and filecoin is that even if you lose your pin you're still able to get your data back because of that cid so since filecoins also appear to pure network you're able to ask any storage provider hey i need the cid can you go ask your peers of other storage providers to retrieve it for me so it will find someone that eventually has that cid and will come back to you even though this is like slower you will still have your data back for sure and estuary makes uploading data to follow coin and replicating that data around the world a five minute problem so as i said before the deal between the client and storage provider is replicated six times what's so great about this is because if a storage provider decides hey i don't really feel like being on the network anymore well you still have five other storage providers that have your data and as well you're able to access it all around the world and here's a good representation a visual representation of that so this is us right now this is the world here are the follow coins to our providers here is the estuary nodes are able to talk to these storage providers and here are the deals and as we get more and more deals this the data that we have keeps replicating across the world more and more and more so now alvin's going to talk about how do developers use austerity all right okay thanks thanks for that buddy uh thanks for that uh i'm not sure if i can share my skin uh maybe you need to unshare reverse and then i'll share mine yeah thanks for that yeah okay hold on ah there we go right slideshow yeah okay all right so so yeah i mean um yeah my name is alvin i'm the software engineer uh here at bl and i'm i'm i'm one of the software engineers uh maintaining and supporting eduari and uh yeah i'm one here to give you an overview on how to how developers can use estuary like for their development for building their apps so i think uh corrine has mentioned earlier about the benefits of using sre uh being able to upload data and sort of like replicate that data six times over on the fico network network and then make it sort of reliable right and retrievable so there's a lot of mission critical applications that anyone can use or can can build on top of asteroids right so it's easy to say that yeah you can build sort of a uh an app that relies that an app that has data centric data center calculated that that handles a lot of data and the sre is a perfect it's one of the perfect platforms to do that right so but before we even go to the examples and how developers can use it or how uk developers could use it it's important to understand the architecture so esri has three main components the main node uh the shuttle and the front-end application so the main node is sort of like the main broker node that sort of uh um that's our apps broker between the clients and the file coin network so when you upload the file on front end it depends on the main main nodes and then it facilitates and manages the creation of those six deals six file coin deals six replications meaning and then it persists that onto the file going network to the storage providers and the shuttles is basically the way for this main node to scale so if you need more like storage if you need more processing power if you need to process more data you can actually scale the main node and add more shuttles to it right so actually currently the main estuary production environment currently has six shuttle nodes so you know we have managed to scale we managed to support a lot of files by scaling our main network main node um and the lastly is the front end which is basically the user interface for any user service or for any consumers to upload their files on to s-ray so i think this is one of the demonstrations that codeine showed earlier where you can any users can easily drag and drop files onto the front end and then every all of these replications all of these facilitation of files to the file going for the file network is done on the backend so uh so the what's good about you know estuary is that when this was built it was built with an api centric mindset meaning all of the core features or like functions of it are are are accessible by api endpoints so meaning if you upload if you upload a file a car file or even if you're retrieving a list of c ids all you need to do is all you do as developers is that you just need to call a specific endpoint uh passing a token an api key and then you you can retrieve that from your ex from to your applications so technically any platforms and platform that understands http and can also sort of bars that http response can literally use estuarine right so here are some some of the examples right so example one file upload so all you need to do is really just uh call the endpoint content ad and then pass the better token authorization so this is a key that you can actually receive and they can request invite for it for and then you just need to pass the data and then you're good to go right so just file upload just you know just pass that data in there you're you're all set now of course you wanted to have you wanted to wait you wanted to to have a way to access those files right so there's also an end point for that so just call this endpoint pass the better token then it will retrieve you back to all of the lists all of the files that you uploaded let's see ids so similar thing with car files so if you're uploading a content article file onto the network so you just need to call this the endpoint passing the better token and then passing the car file as part of that data body and then you're good to go so everything is endpoints even the collections so collections is one of these features or extra features where you can tag a specific file and then sort of like aggregate and collect them right like sort of like creates a creates a group right for each file so it's like a hashtag that you can tag a specific file so that you can collect them or certainly so you can group them and then sort of just just use that tag to identify right this specific files so again for creating collections all you need to do is call an endpoint pass the better token key right and then you're you're all set uh here is a here's a demonstration a quick demonstration of how it works i'm not sure if i can play it but i won't i don't think i can play it sorry let me just check if i can uh sort of okay all right let me play that okay so again like as i uh i mentioned earlier um all you need to do is just um call this endpoint so this entire demonstration this entire page is a is a way for you it's a way for anyone to just test out the endpoint you know then we choose a file and then we upload the file um everything happens on the back so it calls that end point so api that s ur dot tech here slash content slash ad here so you uh and uh and here we we're now listing our files right so um all we need to do is just uh replace that header token with uh with a legitimate like with a without that authentication token that we that anyone can get if you if you request an invite uh and uh everything is going to be retrievable right so there so uh yep okay let me just go back to my slideshow right now it plays yeah okay so now uh once you're once you're done with uploading your file you can actually verify your cid so uh if if you uh we do have a front end as i mentioned earlier the front end that allows anyone to just uh to upload their files but there's also a way for you to verify the c ids that you uploaded through s drive so you can verify door cid using this tool and then it will look up onto this to this dns endpoints here eweblocklink and ipfs.io so of course there are a few more apis that you can take advantage of as developers so collections api as i mentioned earlier you can use it to group files together and sort of tag them so that you can retrieve them as a group here there's also a deals api uh to access all of the existing deals uh any deals that was that was created for your cids the storage provider and minor apis so it's sort of like an admin endpoint to grab or to get all of the storage providers registered on the system and of course admin and system apis sort of like maintenance maintenance and support apis to solve to uh to uh to facilitate to maintain the sri load so of course like all of these are since these are these are accessible by http api endpoints right so it just makes sense to build tools around them sort of like bait or wrappers so that's what we actually did so we created sdks and libraries uh that we that sort of wrap all of these api endpoints and the beauty about it is that it was it was you know it's written in uh in java javascript rust python c sharp so all of these are mainstream programming language so if you have if you're working in for example in a an application that's written in java you can just import that module onto your java application and then call these apis through the through the java library right so all of these are available in our github so everything is open source and anyone can access it and we can just grab it and then just use it for their own uh of course like if they're uh since we we also documented all of the api endpoints using swagger so swagger is an api documentation tool but uh the the the great thing about it is that you can actually use that documentation to build stubs so client sdk stubs and server side stubs so for example if you have a specific use case for let's say flutter app right so let's say you're building a mobile application in flutter and you need a dart sdk you can actually use a swagger docs to generate the dart sdk for you so here's sort of like some of the key examples using the code generator you can generate android sdks apex closure uh there's even c sharp dart flash right here and then groovy and jaws everything is so everything is compatible with the cogent with swagger code generator right so the apis or the api key is only by invite so you would need to request access from the development team so if you scan your qr code if you scan this qr code right now you can actually it will direct you to the request invite page wherein you can register and then we'll uh we as a team will have we will check and we'll uh we'll assign you an api key so that you can use these api endpoints so yeah so estuary is open source so every source code the node the sdks the swagger docs the libraries uh even the complementary tools that uh that that it has are all open source if you go to application research github page you will see all of the projects here and anyone every anything anything is anything everything is free so you can just if you have sort of like an idea how to extend it you can just clone and sort of create a pr against the against the repository against a project so if you're sort of trying to build an innovation on top of filecoin and you want to use estuary right to estuary to you know to to have your own use case or to build your own project you can definitely do that just clone extend and then you're good to go yeah so yeah i mean every all of the developer documentations api docs are available in our documentation website so that's docs.sure.tech you can scan this qr code to visit that webpage as well and of course if you have any questions about the tech our tech team is on slack um we have a a a slap group which is open to anyone it's ecosystem. and uh we are if you have any questions about or anything that you need assistance we will be happy to assist you uh yeah that's uh that's it yeah i'll give the floor back to karine for the yeah next few snacks thank you um oh then you can just click for me or okay sure i'll share my screen oh okay cool we're back so estuary performance um we have over 18 million total files uploaded by all users using the primary sra node 165.93 terabytes of total pinned ivfs storage for hot retrieval from the iqbus gateway over 100 000 active storage deals on the qualcomm network 971.59 terabytes of total sealed storage on follow client including replication and lastly we have 176 total storage providers receiving deals from our s-ray node so some really good stats and then as you can see the trend is looking good for the amount of data that's been uploaded onboarded onto the followcoin network and this data is since april 2021 and as you can see here there's a really great upward trend so the network is definitely growing and now to talk a little bit about the future of estuary um here are a few of our goals that we want to accomplish um we want to make it easier to onboard data to followpoint and what this means to us right now is that we want to improve our web ui for other users as well we want to make it very easy to use and a story right now is actually going through a little bit of a redesign so that's very soon to come we want to be able to onboard more data and users so some examples of our users are listed below and we want to be able to accommodate larger upload sizes right now um in a singular upload s-ray can only accommodate up to 32 gigabytes so we really want to stress test that and see if we can break that barrier we also want to expand the amount of projects using estuary broaden our network of storage providers and we want to have more online deals like on the network and then our biggest goal i'd say right now would actually be auto retrieve so this is kind of completing the picture of uh data retrieval so if you were to lose a pin on estuary it would be really great to be able to retrieve your data so that's basically what autoretrieve is doing it is about 95 of the way there it's almost completed and i'd say would be done within the next month or two so that has been the major push as of now so yeah thank you so much for listening to our talk today and as alvin mentioned earlier we're all open source you can find us at ecosystem.dev on file coin slack please check out our github if you want to contribute you can find that application research estuary and again if you want to use estuary go to sre.tech and please request for an api key so thank you so much everyone and we can take some questions now yeah awesome thank you so much folks um just loading up uh the channel just to see if there were any questions um i mean maybe in the meantime uh if you could highlight maybe some of the you mentioned some of the big companies that are using this tutorial but um maybe just kind of some of the cool ideas that that come to mind for ways in which people can can leverage this kind of bridge to to build some cool projects during their next two and a half weeks um i don't know if you have any good ideas or any any alpha you want to leave for things that people can build um but uh but yeah i would love to hear any any ideas you have for for a bunch of hungry hackers obviously yeah i guess like i i guess like you know i mean one of the key benefits right of using extra is the replication right that whenever you upload a file on esri it replicates on the filecoin network so if you're building sort of an ai machine learning app that uses a data model that you don't want to be tampered with that's actually a good use case because when you have that when you have a reliable storage like filecoin network right like for example using the estuary as a broker you can easily you can you know you can sort of like ensure yourself that that data is there it's it's replicated it's retrievable and it's also verifiable right just because we have the content addressable storage technology there so yeah if you're sort of building a an application i would you know i would i would look at building an application that really that uh that relies on aggregation of a lot of data like geo location uh and then use sdrive to store that or use sri to yeah at us right just to store all of those information so yeah i mean that and that's that's virtually any any applications right like any application any application that collects data really yeah it makes sense how about your career i mean yeah basically what alvin said like anything that's really that you need to onboard like a lot of data s3 is definitely the best step for that um yeah alvin really hit it on the head there yeah uh yeah because i don't know machine learning yeah yeah just it's just because like in in in this in the ai machine learning space there's there's a lot of data sets right that you can take advantage of and i think one of the key things really in the ai in in that in this data sets because i i work for like for a company that does this um it's the reliability of that data set before you feed that onto uh the machine itself so like sort of like a supervised learning uh data model so you you create this whole bunch of data right you you source it from different like sources like you know different different uh channels you aggregate it and then you store it somewhere and then you use that later on to create uh data sets or data models that will then be fed to chat bots you know chat bots that you know responds to customer requests customer inquiries or to maybe uh an application similar to amazon e-commerce website right where in it tries to predict what your what your what your trends are what your what your what uh what are the trends or what are the things that you buy or a person buys during this season right so so you know those are those those are the things that i would look at uh those are the solutions that i would i think that's very impactful and very good and it's very it's it's great to have those you know solutions i think yeah awesome well yeah this has been amazing thank you so much for the whole overview of just how far our story has come over the last little bit uh i've been amazing i've been amazing just to see sorry um and and yeah really appreciate having both of you here uh to give us a quick overview and um looking forward to seeing many projects built using estuary um and uh and and the world that you can have when you have this persistent data so yeah thank you so much folks and uh i think we're probably gonna move on to the next talk thank you thank you thanks thank you so much all right great so up next uh we have another awesome talk uh by another amazing thinker in the space so we have a talk called decentralized trust as a web 3 primitive danny from the ceramic team is going to be leading this chat um and danny you have a little bit more time which is nice so if you want to go a little bit long you've got the space for it but we'd love to have you join me up on stage share your video and uh otherwise take it away i would love to hear more about how you're thinking about trust data identity data sovereignty all those topics i'm sure are overlapping here absolutely thank you jacob can you hear me okay before i dive straight in yeah you're coming through awesome cool let me share my screen sounds good all right cool um well thanks again jacob excited to be here hack of s is always one of my favorite hackathons of the year we always see some incredible projects so very excited to um get into the meat of it and see what people start building and um excited to be part of the opening series here um so as jacob previewed i'm going to be talking today about trust as a primitive for web 3 and a really core building block to start to bring some of the use cases around web 3 and more sophisticated applications to life on par with you know financial legos and data legos i think trust is a really important aspect that we don't dive into quite enough um in the right way so that's what we'll be talking about today um before we dive in just quickly about me very very quickly um danny zuckerman i am one of the founders of three box labs have been working on issues around decentralized data identity reputation all of which touched trust for uh four and a half years now um steward of ceramic network which is the protocol that we've been building at three box labs for decentralized data um and i will stop there more about my bio and then on the right hand side some places to come find vns but that's the least interesting part of what we'll talk about so very big picture um i think the the goal of hack fs and building around web 3 is to start to move us from talking about the stack the web 3 infrastructure stack which can be pictured in a lot of different ways here's one that i really like from the edge of node devrel team um i started talking much more about the things that you can do with the stack the applications use cases and users and values being created um on top of all this infrastructure um and it kind of begs the question why aren't we there yet what are the missing pieces when so much great infrastructure has been built and i don't mean to take away from that the place that we're at today compared to this time last year when hacking fest took off is way more sophisticated and the primitives are way better um and so we are getting much closer but we still don't see a massive amount of um mainstream ready high scale applications and things that are that are even at a point to do that and this talks about one of the reasons why another piece of the framing and the kind of issue of trust has been a hot topic in crypto twitter and web3 world recently for a lot of reasons among them is the decentralized society paper from puja glenn and vitalik um and uh i just highlighted this one quote in the at the top of their abstract by three kshu today's hyper financialization in favor of a more transformative pluralist future and their paper was really about the need for us to move beyond purely financial applications why we hadn't to date and what was needed to or or one course for what was needed to do that and trust is really at the center of this i think a little bit unfortunately a lot of the conversation that kicked off after that paper became this massive debate between the implementations of how to get that trust in particular soul-bound tokens non-transferable tokens that could be issued on the blockchain as a way to start to issue signals of of trust and reputation versus dids and credentials which is the stack that many in the identity world um in the off chain data world have been working on for quite a while um and so if you've been poking around the space or if you've been part of this um debate you've seen um a little bit of a flame war between these two implementations that's not what i want to talk about today unless we go really fast and have some extra time at the end um what i want to talk about instead at least at first is the importance of reputation as a mechanism for trust um it's a very quick story here um and one of my favorite fun facts about the founding of the united states and the founding fathers is that ben franklin wrote a gossip column um amongst the many other things that he did and this seems like very strange and at odds with some of the reputation around ben franklin but he knew that his town needed some trust to be able to work together and start to mature the things that they could do as a newly burgeoning society they didn't know each other that well it was a lot of people who had recently migrated or were migrating between different towns on the east coast and there weren't a lot of norms established in this brand new society and among the many things that he did was write a gossip column in the local paper and gossip has this very negative connotation today but one thing that gossip does is it's a way to create reputations about people it's a way for third parties to trade information including negative information about others and it's a really important way that we have developed as societies to basically put reputation at stake and when reputation's at stake for individuals it really helps reinforce the norms and values of that society that they're a part of and this can be for a society like the united states or it can be for an application in the users of that application or the constituents in a tokenized network but reputation being on the line through in different ways is a really important mechanism to get people to work together it's not the only one and we'll talk a little bit later about how this interplays with tokens and financial incentives but it's always been a critical one um this was the case on web 2 as well if we look at some of the biggest segments and success stories from the last major wave of internet companies reputation played a huge part and they could not have see exceeded without reputation trust was not an extra feature it was a key enabler ebay the first really massive ecommerce success succeeded in huge part because they were able to build trust around between sellers and buyers in a way that no one really believed was going to be possible early on um you're going onto this website you're paying money to a random person somewhere in the world who you didn't know had no way of knowing and ebay was a startup at the time um and you just had to trust that the seller was actually going to sell you the item and then it was going to be what they said it was especially some of these used goods that they would be not broken that there was actually original um condition that was new in box and there was not a it was a huge pain to be able to actually like if you got an item that wasn't what you were promised to actually track that down and and get resolution was fairly painful um and so scoring and ratings and reputation was the primary mechanism that actually enforced good behavior made ebay a massive hit same thing with amazon later when they opened up to third-party sellers so reputation as a way to build trust amongst parties was critical to doing any commerce online um any social platform had to build trust um in facebook it was friends linkedin it was connections twitter's followers but they all put front and center the the followers that you have in common with someone else so not every piece of reputation needs to be quantified some of it is very contextual and so showing the connections you share in common with someone is a way to very quickly build some trust understanding and familiarity on these social platforms um airbnb as a quote from the ceo of airbnb the trust of our community is our top priority um again similar to ebay but probably even more so nobody believed that airbnb could succeed in getting people comfortable staying in strangers houses or comfortable with strangers staying in their own home um but it was by creating a really sophisticated and trustworthy itself reputation system that they were able to build this massive company but also this this really new way of having economies different sharing economies and so what all these had right when they're trying to build what you can think of as these little digital societies on each of these platforms is that um i think what if i did in this quote from jonathan hay uh the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time um that sounds very punitive um and in some ways it is and and we'll come back to vitalik has been talking recently about negative reputation which again makes it sound punitive but if you're trying to get people to behave in a way that is in the not just their own interest like the capitalism and financial incentives work so well because um in a one-time game people act in their own interest and it balances out and allocates capital but if you're trying to do things that are not one-time financial games but rather repeated games where you need to actually build familiarity in context and trust basically any social application or use case um you need reputation to be able to convince people that um they should play by the rules that they should do what is expected in the norms of that system and there needs to be a way um for them to lose reputation if what they do goes against that and so one thing that we learned from this is that reputation is inherently a social thing not an individual thing um so all these web two companies did a great job building their reputation systems the problem is they're built in silos and jeff bezos said a brand is a company's reputation and so as all of us users are using these platforms and building reputation the social capital that's built the trust that's being built goes a little bit to each of us as individuals but mostly it's accruing to the companies who built these reputation systems in these walled gardens and they're trapped within those gardens or within the silos and so you have no agency or portability or composability to use that trust elsewhere um and this is uh really great for some of these big web 2 platforms um but it took them a long time to build it up and we don't really have and you see tons of crypto companies trying to kind of bootstrap off of the trust that's been built up on twitter which is why we are constantly verifying our twitter handle for different um for different services on web3 to try to build off of that but we don't want to replicate this same issue in web 3 of having to rebuild trust over and over again because that's going to dramatically slow down how quickly we can build up trust on web3 as a whole and therefore how quickly we can build up applications and use cases um that are meaningful beyond financial ones um and so the question is if we're not doing reputation on these platforms in these silos where are we doing it um and we kind of need a new organizing principle and that organizing principle for trust as a primitive in web 3 is to organize it around users and users individually kind of put users at the center an agency of their own reputations and the data that makes it up but also give users kind of control over um and and a sharing kind of a collective way to manage reputation and data um and so i'll talk about what that means abstractly but first i want to give a few examples of projects that are doing this really well already today because we're starting to see the emergence of trust as a primitive in web 3 in some very cool ways just in the last few months first example in kind of the commerce and finance world was a partnership between cyber connect so social graph protocol and rockfy um to basically look at on-chain data and a bunch of other information about a user and create a credit score and then to link that credit score to a user's profile and their social graph and also incorporate their social graph on cyber connect into their their reputation their credit score and so what this does is it creates um a way so cyberconnect is this social graph protocol built on ceramic which is a public data network and it creates this open shared way to start to aggregate information like a credit score in a way that anybody can compose on and use and interoperate with instead of it being locked into one place and so once it's done once for one lending platform now it's accessible and extendable by anybody second example is orbis which is a decentralized social application and it looks a little bit like a a twitter but with more of a community bent to it lots of conversation happening there every day go check it out orbis.club um but like with any social media platform um there's problems with content moderation and ranking of content creating a feed and so they've included like many social platforms comments and upvotes but also down votes and the down votes are actually a way for people to signal about the value of not just content but implicitly the author of any given piece of content and so an author that is creating lots of content that's getting down voted is implicitly building a reputation that can be looked at to say this this person is creating low value or spam content um and that can uh that can be used by orbis to change their application but also if another social app um joins because this is happening on a public network they can also look at that same data that same reputation and say okay this author has already built up a reputation as distrustworthy i'm not going to let them in a third example uh git coin uh recently released before the last grants round bitcoin passport and git coin had been aggregating lots of different signals of proof of humanity so proof of humanity itself um and bright id and linking to your google account your twitter account all of these give some insight into a user is um just a single user and the reason this is so important for git coin is they run these grants rounds with matching funds and they need to protect against civil attacks and collusion to against people who are trying to get more matching than they deserve and so they need to have some idea of one person um uh is is acting the a person is only acting within the grants round in one way um and so to do that they've activated all these scores and created a json document they sign into a credential and put into the user's profile this bitcoin passport um and so they needed it for their own application but because it's linked to the users the id and key now that is available for any other application on web3 to query and use also and so again it's not just a single walled garden implementation of reputation it's this new primitive for trust that others in web 3 can build on so how are they all doing this i've kind of referenced it a little bit but really quickly the anatomy of what these pieces of trust which is really you know it's data that's aggregating to reputation what does this actually look like and how are people building this especially for those of you who will be hacking unrelated things uh this this uh this hackathon um and so there's a few different flows but very generally a user might submit a claim that they are a certain person if they have a certain credit score they'll just bring certain data to bear or they'll just interact with an application and that application can run a service that verifies the claim or just you know it's generating the activity um for example the fact that a user participated in a um a working group for a dao and they create a piece of data and they sign it um if it's a certain format it might be called a verifiable credential which is a spec from w3c for what some of these claims look like but it can be any piece of signed data and they sign that data using the application key did and they write that claim to the user's stream on a public data network in this case and the one that i work on ceramic and that is now tied to the user's key and associated to them but written by the application and so you have this shared piece of data and it could be written not by an application but by another user more peer-to-peer and so you have to assign data on this network that can be shared and what you're starting to build up is this single public network that maintains all this data and all this latent trust that others can build upon and start to create you know not just reputation but other forms of signal um that that lets you do much more powerful applications and ones that are much more than one-time financial apps so yeah what this is starting to build up just implicitly is the shared graph of trusted data trusted because it's being signed by the ids and so it has some properties um that are really good for building trust and reputation in ways that are shareable across contexts um it's both sovereign and social um and we'll talk about in a few minutes the the um soul bound tokens versus credentials they both have limitations they both get used in ways here actually um but sovereign social because things are being signed and and organized around private keys but the data itself is on a public graph and so you have user control but not into it's not purely individual because a lot of data and especially our reputation is shared between users and so you need to be able to make attestations and claims about others to build reputation it's provably authentic because it's being signed it's being verified by nodes and that reputation is at stake because if you've accumulated lots of positive reputation lots of positive claims but then you also start to get some negative ones you're actually damaging yourself and so you know going back to the john hate quote reputation is only super valuable at stake all of the time um it's composable because it's structured data it's being signed with schema and it can be used across chains and i think most importantly it's emerging it doesn't need to be a perfect reputation system right off the bat first these use cases are being built for their own value bitcoin built a passport for their own need for their grants program so the value starts locally but now others in d5 or l1s who also need anti-symbol or proof of individuality can start to use that same passport extend it add new claims to it add new algorithms for how they're calculating to it and so you start off of this one you know trusted context in one use case but because it's composable and provably authentic um and on a shared network others can start to build on that same thing and extend it um similar to how we saw defy legos uh really extend the use cases of finance and blockchains similarly this trust primitive can very quickly get built upon and extended in powerful ways and so that creates is this kind of composable set of building blocks for reputation in web 3 people's and reputation again is really just an algorithm on top of lots of data so what this really means is composable sign data in web 3 of all different times preferences participation endows content that's upvoted lots of followers on certain social networks and you have these composable bits of trust to build new f3 applications that can resist attacks um so i said we weren't going to make this about the the implementation details um but a little bit about like the way to build up um this these trust primitives and what works well and what doesn't work well um and so a few things that are all important to these systems but on their own not enough um so we'll talk about soulbound tokens talk about dids and verified credentials and talk about tokens themselves why does why can't we just use financial incentives for everything um so really quickly soulbound tokens um can be really powerful there's there's a value in bringing some elements of reputation on chain um in very thoughtful ways to make it interoperable with some of the other things that happen on chain today especially financial markets um but they're not a good mechanism for every piece of data that we want to build as a trust primitive they're they can be encrypted and you know these can continue to change but a public by default um method for publishing data is going to really compromise privacy for users um and make people shy away from using it um there's lots of scale issues and you're chain siloing everything that you put on a blockchain as opposed to making it more interoperable um verified credentials and dids in the stack that many in the identity world have been working on for a long time play a huge role in um should play a huge role in building trust for one web3 applications um one of the key elements of that stack is selective disclosure of vcs giving users the power to decide what data to share when which really helps privacy compared to sole bound tokens the issue is you can't have complete selective disclosure over data and actually build powerful reputation systems um imagine a airbnb like application where every where every um review and meeting that you got uh was put into a private data vault that you controlled as a user and then when you went to go use the application again you would get to choose which pieces of data you share and what you did you would only share your 5.0 ratings and every user would have a 5.0 rating and there wouldn't actually be any trust in the system and so reputation systems are necessarily somewhat public and social and involves some third-party claims and so pure pure sovereign systems don't work for building full reputation systems they also have some challenges around know ux and security of key replication and um and credential revocation and rotating keys maybe most importantly is why not just use tokens tokens are great incentive um financial incentives for things and most of the crypto space to date has relied on using tokens as incentives to align networks but there's a huge downside to over financializing everything um and as soon as there is a potential to make profit our um arbitragers will flood a system and find any profit to make and completely overcrowd any of the more pro-social behaviors and an example i heard recently from uh from stephen cloud fund i'll give him credit was that like how come we all pay our phone bills on time or those of us who do do and it's very rarely because we're actually scared of verizon coming to take us to court and settle our phone bill it's much more because we don't want to have our credit score harmed um reputation is actually a much more powerful day-to-day incentive than financial incentives um in a lot of cases um and so and they don't coexist well as soon as you introduce financial incentives that crowds out reputation and other types of incentives because all of the financial arbitrage comes in and so as soon as we bring in tokens we're no longer in a social multi-time game we're in a one-time game with arbitraging and the incentive actually gets worse not better um and so one more quote from adam smith who's most known for as being the inventor of capitalism but he wrote another book called the theory of moral sentiments which is really largely about reputation um and how we're mostly motivated by reputation and things like it rather than by capital a man naturally desires not only to be loved but to be lovely um so to be seen in the eyes of others as good and to live up to that um and so even the founder of capitalism but we you know that the the book that kind of is looked at as the founding of capitalism is about how um the invisible hand can make markets be a great way to allocate capital but he didn't believe that was the right way to actually incentivize individuals um that was for that reputation as a much more powerful tool um so what to do with this um some ideas that we've been talking about around our team and community that we'd love to see continue to build out the primitives for decentralized trust or to take use of it comment and rating plugins for different applications for smart contracts for tokens um for all sorts of stuff happening in the space reputation doesn't all have to be quantified and so giving people ways to write verifiable information about what they're seeing and for others to use it can add a lot of context to what's happening in the space tracking contributions to dow and endorsement on tools and what's happening skills and what's happening um for those who've been around for a while for there was a huge wave of token curated registries a while ago but what about reputation curated registries a way for people to put their reputation at stake behind something which probably means more to them than tokens and can't be attacked in the same way as token curated registries could reputation only sharing economies so networks where you don't earn financial capital for contributing but you do earn social capital which has a softer power aggregating data around users bridging from web 2 to web 3 or creating these personality profiles that can be used as an alternative to centralized ad ids and things like it so lots of different things that are now very achievable with the tools that we have for managing decentralized data and and using the web3 stack to start to do more with trust and more social use cases um i think i'm supposed to wind down so just a couple resources um if you want to know kind of how to use data to build some of these things there's a talk from matt davis on monday morning on building with composable data um there's a blog on how to build with composable trust and how other apps are doing it on blogs around um and also some links here to come chat with others who are thinking about these things building some of these things and some bounties related to this from the ceramic team at hackafs for the hackathon as well so i think that's it i don't know if we're doing questions in this one but again here's some links to come find me um or our team um or some of this tech and would love to see um and hear from some of you on this but also can't wait to see what some of you build in the hackathon the next few weeks amazing thank you so much danny um i mean i do have some small questions i mean i think this is a really fascinating topic in general and like it just seems to be such a missing block from the web 3 uh world versus like web 2. like you think about it almost like all of our institutions financial lending like all these different things are based on trust reputation and and really enable you to do so many things and um like as as great as kind of defy has been in terms of like allowing anyone mark good participation that kind of thing like one aspect of that for sure is that like in almost all cases it has to be over collateralized you have to have some sort of like way to get back the money in the end if somebody kind of messes you over or screws you over but in the traditional financial markets it's almost the opposite it's almost always collateralized um i i guess my question to you would be like i think we both could probably agree on the importance of trust and reputation and stuff but um maybe what what has been so challenging about tackling this project and this problem and i know it's a problem that a lot of people have been thinking about and it is in a lot of ways like a bit of a holy grail um we'd love to hear a little bit more about just sort of the some of the challenges involved in actually making this reality yeah here's a few um the first is um so reputation is not the only way to build trust but it's a really good one and so if we focus just on that i think the easiest way to look at what reputation is is it's just a combination of data um in the real world it's a combination of like experiences you have and what you hear about someone in the digital world it's like looking at a bunch of pieces of data and saying well what does this aggregate into its reputation and we haven't had a great way to manage that data um to date to just like aggregate it um in a web 3 native way and i think that's changing very rapidly um and through many of the sponsors and the hosts of this hackathon and a bunch of others but you need the right foundations to build on um first of all i also think that um you know there's a few different ways to to start to build and bootstrap reputation um but like it's it's much harder to do it in abstract than it is to do it it's like almost one of those problems that's harder in theory than it is in practice because mathematically it's very hard to build decentralized reputation and to kind of bootstrap that and you run into the who watches the watchmen problem and you need trusted seeds but in practice people trust get coin and so when they release the passport which they are signing as a company um it's uh it's got trust from the beginning and so when you start to build in these specific use cases and context and you sort of build trust from there then you could start to extend from you know from there and so i think we've been missing those first initial cases with real applications that are building decentralized trusts for themselves and then that can be leveraged you know beyond that and so i think that's what we're starting to see um it's not an easy problem even with that um there will start to be ways to attack it and it's almost harder it's definitely harder than what three than one two because people can um just leave their private key and move to a new one and so um you can't limit participation in the same way but i think we'll start to see a lot of a lot of these open systems where positive reputation gets you a lot of benefit and then anyone who's found to be kind of going against the grain will be banished and so there's a lot of cost to actually um a lot of opportunity costs to misbehaving and so um that's what we're starting to see um but it's it's taking a little while to get there yeah it makes sense and and i guess yeah i mean at some point like if you go far enough down the line you've got to trust somebody right whether that's bitcoin or like some oracle or something like down the line like you've got to trust something it has to be the end um and i guess like you know it depends on maybe the rigor of trust that is required for your application um but i think in a lot of cases you're right like you know um bitcoin putting something out into the world or you know any anybody kind of with a with enough skin in the game being able to put something on out in the wild and say like you know like we are validating that this is the case like that's probably enough for most applications and then maybe there's like a you know a much larger set of things but maybe it's also the case where it's like exactly just described like it's like there are so many of these different attestation or type like trusted things that like you have so much positive trust that like even if like the bitcoin side is lying or even like one out of the like 50 different things is that trust you is is sort of like not trusted um i'm using the word trust a lot um it almost doesn't matter at that point right so um yeah definitely yeah go ahead sorry i think that's a really interesting point that like we were at a phase in web 3 where it was so small for a while that like just knowing someone's ens name wasn't that was enough trust because you just like knew who they were what they had done and what they had said so you didn't need a score and if we flash forward a couple of years there'll be so much data and so many different you know verifiers and services and reputation algorithms you know the hard part won't be having trustworthy choosing which one to trust and we're kind of in that middle portion today where we haven't built up some little services but we're past the point where just knowing someone's twitter handle or username or their telegram or discord handle is enough um yeah and everything ends up being composable too which is super interesting so okay cool i mean i could talk about this forever so i'm gonna have to stop because i think we're already over time a little bit um but yeah danny i really appreciate you coming and chatting about this um i agree i think we're in the middle of it and i i think there's gonna be some really interesting applications that come out once we uh sort of come out on the other side and and i think the earlier people start building with this is the faster that that accelerates so um amazing well really appreciate your time danny thank you for being here jacob and take care we will jump over to our last chat of today um so i'm assuming everybody in the crowd is excited to have lucas back as a moderator for one more panel today we're gonna go he's still got high energy um so yeah this this panel is awesome i mean it's it's sort of you know earlier we did the panel about um how to take your your hack fs project and take it to the next step um in that journey through grants or accelerators or any of that um but of course there's a whole other side of this which is like maybe you're just coming into this for the first time or you're really enjoying the role that you have but you want to kind of explore other roles you don't just have to start a company you can also join an existing one so we're going to do a panel that lucas is going to run on careers in the web 3. there are a lot of tough problems a lot of really interesting work in this space and we are joined by ian and jenks who are also kind of thinking a lot about both the problems in the space but then also like best practices and hiring and and thinking a lot about just like how web 3 is a little bit different and a little bit more interesting an environmental work and then basically anywhere else in my opinion at least so uh why don't we just start off the panel with a bunch of bias so there we go um cool so yeah excited to have you all here and i'll get out of the way and i'll let uh lucas take it over awesome thanks so much jacob and yeah and welcome again and to those who are kind of still tuned in and like jacob said i think what we're going to do we click on in this session um is you know not how you take your project further but um kind of focusing on your personal growth and opportunities that either in parallel to building your own project um you could pursue or as an alternative right so um i i just want to really broaden the aperture and like um make you guys aware of all the opportunities that may arise from this event um in in any sort of way and and shine a light on that this won't be a technical talk um but uh hopefully it'll be enjoyable nonetheless i'm not sure um how many you know technical folks we have in the audience and but yeah i as we jump in like the first thing i'd like to do is kind of introduce uh finalists so we have jenks who's um on the developer advocates team and who i'm sure you will interact with a lot over the course of the next weeks if you have um questions and and and ian from from the recruiting team of protocol labs and he's wrapping the protocol up shirt there which is great and james and ian maybe i'll i'll let you guys just kind of introduce yourselves and i'd i'd be curious and to for you guys to highlight a little bit what your kind of previous career steps were very quickly right like just kind of tapping onto them and then and how long you've been in in the web 3 space and then we'll probably double click on on on that transition and and how you navigated it and and ultimately what kind of tips and recommendations you would would give to folks so jenks i'll and kick it over to you what was your like pre-web 3 life and and how did you make the transition and when did you make the transition thank you both for joining thank you lucas uh you you make web 3 sounds like a second life but it kind of feel like that my name is james i'm a developer at okay at falcon foundation uh for those who who don't know firecoin is decentralized a data storage network one of the world's largest a decentralized one um my job is to evangelize the relevant technology to the developer community uh on a daily basis that participate hackathons like this one look after builders engagement and work on open source projects like to help developers to become superhumans in my previous life i worked in telecommunication industry ericsson specifically a swedish company and also i worked in a sas company called xero it's the accounting software and also i work for a tool called elintry they're powering the creator community and my webster life is is about five months old now uh over to you ian awesome uh nice to meet you all and and thanks for having me today uh yeah ian brunner uh joined as the head of talent here at protocol labs back in october of last year although it feels like i've been here for for 10 years so i definitely resonate with that second life comment the space and subscribe into to web 3 and decentralization and prior to my four years at facebook leading teams was at a company called centro in the ad tech industry basically helping them build a technology completely from scratch uh but yeah i think they've rebranded his basis now but they were centro back when i worked for them uh but yeah just really happy to be here and and excited to talk to you guys today awesome thanks so much and to both of you i'd let's just like jump right in there you kind of said like um you're coming from a space that's kind of the antithesis anti-thesis of of what web 3 is about and i'm curious when you have now looking back or when you have conversations um with people who are still in that space like what is some of the things that they're most i guess looking for and and and and and maybe you know like or in in two ways where you could look at what you're doing currently and like what are the biggest frustrations and then looking onwards like what is the thing that they're really looking for and excited to get out of and potentially next steps what what would you say ian yeah yeah i can speak to that for sure so i i think one of the things that we hear constantly with any candidate coming from from web 2 or comparable industries or areas is that just the growth opportunities are just really incremental in those spaces because you have these large companies lots of different people moving towards similar goals even if their teams are smaller so just really sort of incremental growth and not a lot of sort of green field areas in some companies to really dive in and build things completely from scratch so we talked to a lot of candidates a lot of my friends i talk to that are just interested in the space because there's so much to build and so much to just create completely from scratch that's really to me what's the most exciting thing about this this space web 3 is that there's just so much green field so much to build from scratch um i say to everyone i that listens to me say it that i've learned more here since october than i did in four years at facebook and i truly mean that it's been just supercharged charging my knowledge and all these different ways that have been super super exciting so that's just a few things that i would know cool awesome thanks so much and i i think jenks you're like um one of the reasons you're one of those people that are like helping people really accelerate on that learning trajectory and i'm kind of curious like if maybe you could share an anecdote or two of of somebody you met who you interacted with on discord on you know any of in the community forums and who really like who you were helping with something and just kind of like sharing a little bit of what kind of challenges and you help them with because i'd like to basically get folks to understand what it is that you can help them with and what parts of their journey you could and basically have them accelerate yeah sure so so working in ecosystem team and with a very vibrant community you had you have lots of good things going on and sometimes uh there uh there are things that's uh it's a little bit annoying but most people are building most people are building awesome projects so my job is there to help them to succeed technically um and uh and i can't i can't even mention that one or two projects because i've reviewed so many hackathon projects myself and every day there is a grand submission and people paying me for uh giving them technical advice or just how to how to write a better grant and i've been i've been helping them and seeing them getting approved getting the the fund that they needed to take their project to reality has been very satisfying i'll keep doing that um i watch the community threads um every monday is my shift to to watch all of the stack channels i have about five or six uh it's like uh the chatting software's on my computer right now that i watch regularly um every day um so the question could be like very random a question could be technical or technically related the question could also be business related i answered them all because of my background um has uh technical stuff but also a little bit of business facing stuff as well yeah so i love the challenge it's challenging sometimes but um also i'm learning keeps from from talking to people yeah that's awesome and like diving into maybe like some of those differences right like i i guess like a lot of the ways that people interact and with each other is is kind of it's often even using web 2 tools right like you'll still be on on telegram you'll still be on discord those aren't yet decentralized services and and i'm kind of curious like um are there any ways that you know like in how we interact that is different in web 3 than maybe in another world and in en both from a perspective of you know roles and recruiting right maybe double click on that and then also just like in terms of connecting with folks so like on the recruiting side i guess like i my background and maybe just to share that right like i also come from a very kind of conventional business background where i worked at a company called bcg that does consulting and i only you know knew recruiting through linkedin and then you know at school there would be maybe a career fair or something web 3 doesn't have that really so i'm kind of curious like ian and what are the forums where you would learn about these opportunities like where where would i go to and find out what might be an interesting role and yeah how do people learn about it yeah yeah so it's in many ways it's sort of the opposite of of web 2 or i guess industries that you were sort of referring to there lucas because a lot of times in web 2 people sort of search out opportunities like i want to be a software engineer let's see what sort of software engineer opportunities are available to me now in web 3 it's more about like figuring out what sort of projects or what sort of companies are interesting to you and then like putting your foot in the door and seeing if there's something there that you can work on and that's something that's really really cool about web3 and certainly is the case of protocol labs is sure we have positions posted but we also create positions for the right people so there's plenty of people that we talk to where it's like you know we don't have a job posting open but like this sounds like an amazing skill set that could be influential at this spot so it's sort of really seeking out projects seeking out individuals that you admire are working on really cool things seeing what else they're working on um i know danny before this in the last talk talked a lot about trust and like it really comes down to sort of figuring out that trust or credibility with companies too because there's a lot a lot of noise in this space too unfortunately um it's like figuring out who's working on legitimate projects what's cool in the space who's partnering with really awesome companies um and then sort of like working backwards from there to see what sort of opportunities there are if there isn't an opportunity listed that's like right in in your skill set like reaching out to the project teams and seeing like hey here's my skill set is there something i can work on for you guys whether it's a contract role or full-time so i think what i'm getting at as a whole here lucas is like there's a lot more flexibility in web 3 and a lot more sort of looking at people's aptitude and potential as opposed to just making sure they 100 have you know 10 years of job experience or whatever the traditional job description for a software engineer would have um so yeah that's just a few things i don't know well that's that's awesome and i actually do um know of one guy who was just contributing because all of these are open-source projects right they were just contributing and then eventually made the jump over and and so you can even live on the edge of being kind of like formally associated with the project and not being formally associated and so i think there's even different types of being engaged that very much you know mirror whatever you feel you're most comfortable with right you don't have to drop everything and like start this job and spend 40 hours or whatever it is per week on doing it you can also kind of find like softer ways and i think that's that's something that you know in the old world maybe doesn't work as well we can say hey like i'm gonna just stick or hang around in the channel for a while and kind of see what's going on and yeah what are jenks maybe like switching over to you like what are some of the um you know things that you think when you're in involved in some of these projects right like in in through one of the roles that ian was describing um or in kind of a semi-formal way where you're just contributing to the open source way what are the channels what are the forums and where people are engaging would that be github would there be discord just kind of curious like um where does the community meet and where do people find each other these days is mainly discord and we uh because of the falcon project history we have a very um slack focused community slack channel and i think it's a it's because our project is quite technical and a lot of uh different parties will like to use slack to communicate because they're all pretty much developers that's been the major places and tru it is true that these tools are web 2 centralized very centralized tools but web 2 has its places of course and then web 3 is just starting it's young right i predict if when we have a web3 uh decentralized app installed in our in our phones and use it every day that's when when web3 has made it we're all waiting for that moment right um anyways the i'll speak a little bit about the the experience in working in web 3 as a uh as someone who joined just a few few months ago um compared to the previous workplaces that i have been to web3 is default to open right very very very drastically different you don't need permissions to get involved what ian said was was great like you can get involved lucas said as well that's how we hired discordant from our team like he was just working on uh ipfs open source project he's been contributing and i caught eye of of some sort of people at uh protocol labs and he got hired as a developer advocate and that's the best job according to him has ever had um this is this is one of the best job i've had as well um there are literally hundreds of ways to to get started um i can speak on behalf of some technical audience because my development background i really recommend start following and learning about projects that you know or people who uh who follow them and then you like those people because um uh because you know them and then the projects they follow stop by getting involved in in that way just looking at community threads chat chatters um and then getting involved in their education program attend public meetings um follow them on discord target your interests project to look for opportunities that way because you really need to get excited about that project and get get behind the mission um to have the passion to to contribute your your working hours to it um so get involved in open source project if you're technical um you can start your own project join hackathons um propose grants applications and run with it and you'll get noticed by the project people in project uh if you're active enough in most uh most of them you don't need to like guess rubber stamp to to to get involved the same goes for product people and business people i believe there are there are ways to contribute other than coding um the second thing is burden your network that's what i did myself as well for fall coin when i was interviewing i just reach out to people in the stack channel and say hey can i have a like 15 minutes or 30 minutes to validate something with you because this is all new to me and they're open they're open everyone is open for it because they're used to working in an open um in an open way um we're in a kind of a in in a in a funny area because we're going through market cycle right now so it it it actually helps with technic people because it gets rid of people who are looking for just hype and opportunity to make quick money um this will give us right now will give us more opportunity to meet good people who are down to earth building right now so i encourage you to get involved in your pro in projects but also boarding the network by just chatting to people awesome thanks so much i feel like i'm in one of those like um teller sales commercials so it's like hey why do you think your job is so amazing and like hey you know it's the best job ever and even it's like i've learned so much over the past few months so and that's great and you know i'm honestly like i would second that but i would also like it it also is like challenging right and it is different and it like takes a lot of adjusting to do so i'm curious like maybe to like you know like now that we understand that it's like oh fantastic and and fun i'm curious like what are some of the um challenges in that that somebody who is new to this space and like faced with all this abundance of opportunity and openness like what are some of the things that um you know might might make the adjustment a little harder like what are some of the things they're like okay like that's actually like a little tough here or a little challenging and you can still frame it in positive terms if we want if we want to keep this a conversion yeah just just kind of like let's let's shine a light on both sides yeah no there's there's tons of things that are challenging about the space too especially you know coming from a large company like like facebook or any company that's that's larger there's a lot of differences that can be challenging uh the first one that i think is most obvious or at least i experienced was just like the completely async nature of how projects and work get done um you know at facebook i was going into an office multiple times a week and seeing people face to face and having candid conversations but here it's like you need to drive things forward with people across the world i work with people in new zealand brazil germany us everywhere so just really being able to push projects forward in a completely async manner like that is is definitely challenging if you haven't experienced that before the other thing too is just like really getting comfortable with the tools as well that need to be used uh async to push things forward um notion i had no exposure to prior to going to protocol labs i use it every single day multiple times now um but yeah slack discord so twitter everything that that is just like really sort of central to this space that you know i didn't utilize on a regular basis uh at facebook or any of my previous companies is also a definitely a hurdle um i'd say the other thing too or the third thing is at a company like facebook or again traditional companies there's projects have sort of like longer life cycles it's generally like okay there's three to four months of planning there's a month of like getting stakeholder buy-in for everybody involved and then finally after six months you can you can ship something um at protocol labs and i know this is the case that other companies we partner with in this space too it's sort of the traditional startup mentality that if you're not like embarrassed by the first thing that you shipped you waited too long to ship it so it's very much like pushing things out the door and getting projects done as soon as possible to have something to work with as opposed to waiting until something is like completely polished and i think that sort of like startup mentality or like builder mentality you know if someone's worked in traditional web 2 startups are going to have that but for people like me that are coming from larger companies was definitely a learning curve but is also what supercharged my learning here like i mentioned earlier lucas it's been great to be able to jump in and sort of take on as many different projects and and the scope of things that work done has been really incredible so that's three things that that i would know well awesome thanks thanks for sharing that and and jang same question for you what a you know as a developer maybe specifically in the engineering space right like beyond kind of the the meta comment of coordination things like what are some of the um challenges in in coding with web3 technology right like one of the things that i could imagine but i'll let you speak to it is like the fact that a lot of the tools are underdeveloped or undeveloped right so you're like constantly hitting like um black spots on the map and you're like oh like i wish somebody had built this i guess not so i'm curious like what are some of the frustrations and that you encounter when you join a space that you know is growing accelerating and and you know like seeing this tremendous momentum but um is still early right so like from an engineering perspective from a developer perspective what are some of the frustrations that you see so if i if if you ask any developers frustration it will be like documentation there's no documentation about things and that's true very true in watch three like um even in web 2 tools like people don't document because i used to write those documents it doesn't have everything in there um but i was warned by this before i joined so i spoke to ali which is another developer advocate who joined farcoin just few months before me um and she says wow all the tools are clunky you know rusty and they're new it doesn't have everything it's not like developing in um with uh with mature tours in web three and i know that um and one of the amazing thing in web 3 is if it's missing if the equivalence is missing you can go and build it and people often give you uh money funding to actually build it as long as it has some real value um the challenge i have is is learning right learning speed is just not enough you need to get things down thank god there's async work only like here um i don't have a lot of meetings that i reduce from like having 10 meetings a day in my previous job like getting nothing done by just talking and coordinating things to like nearly like one or two meetings a day and i have a bunch of time to do focus time so my productivity has improved a lot as a developer advocate as someone in devrel but learning is this takes a lot of time um there is um there is a um i need to contribute about one to two hours just like heads down learning about projects that i have heard in conferences and in in general news uh keep following with their updates um and also learning into learning technology i'm still reading falcoid specification i haven't finished that yet and i need to know that i like the back of my hand um so that's that's the challenge i have but at the same time like um in this job i've never been uh so well trained um after i started i had about one month of self-paced learning and then i joined the pro collabs network launchpad program which was a six weeks pretty much a full-time training program and i flew to amsterdam to have collocation week with with people who i learned together and that was those best experiences of my life um one of the books working in web sprees is very unique experience work experience wise it's um i enjoyed it very much but it could be could be strange to someone there's one book written by nadia i think that's the the last name and the book is called working in public the book was mainly talking about working open source community and how to there was a difficult or colorful developers around the world there are a lot of challenges in web 3 i think is is very similar to this um i'll close that at that point and allow other topics to go on great great and i love that you know like while we were trying to shine a light on some of the difficulties still i heard something like what's the best experience of my life so anyways like we're doing our best i i think like one thing that i'll add is like and i come from an organization that was like very hierarchical in a way and honestly i kind of like i liked it i didn't think like there's a lot of benefits to that right you can move fast you can make decisions fast and things just happen they might happen the wrong way but they happen and i think in web 3 you have and maybe like i'll reference these like graph structures right like you have a lot organizationally you have what looks like a directed acyclic graph where one like you know a daughter of something can have multiple parents organizationally right so like um jenks worked for the firecrack foundation which is a different legal entity than the legal entity that i i'm work for still jenks and i interface a lot like you know frequently and during the week so it it that like it it like adds an interesting dynamic where and people from different organizations sometimes with somewhat different cultures and different expectations and come together and need to kind of um almost like negotiate a working model um on a very frequent basis so you can't just be like hey i work at this company and i kind of know what's going on no like you're constantly renegotiating who spends their time on what and i think that's that's like one of the other and challenges that i definitely see but that are also kind of fun to work through yeah it's like a two-sided two-sided two sides of the coin um cool i i would like there's definitely an experience to to report to someone that is outside of my organization like i've never had that before michelle is in pro collabs and um you're in protocol labs and i work with you quite a bit one of the things that i have a really good manager michelle lee is awesome and this is not pronouncing because she's not even in this meeting at all um one of the things that she said to me after repetitively uh asking for permission to do stuff and she says jank stop asking for permissions as long as your core target is finished like you can get involved in anything i was like wow this is good i don't know about ian did you have that moment coming from a big corporation before we need to get like seven people approval to to go for a business trip 100 the basically exact same thing happened for me joining protocol labs where i was just you know refreshing to you know not have to cut through all the red tape to to get stuff done um and just like you know go and go forth and make it happen uh so it was really refreshing to work in the environment here cool and awesome well i i think this is i i don't know i i find it helpful i hope it's helpful for folks out there i i and i i don't think i'll keep us around much longer what i would love um to hear from from both of you is like maybe a few resources right and that can be places to go like actually go and look right like what's the website that you should go and check out what's a book that you should read what's a podcast that you should listen to and or something just like very specific next steps like after this call if i'm like yeah that does kind of sound interesting i'd like to explore some opportunities here like what are maybe two and two or three resources very specifically that you would recommend to check out after this call yeah and i'll start with you ian awesome i think the first one that i definitely want to plug jenks actually referenced which is our our launch pad program here at protocol labs we have cohorts going off throughout the entire year um six week programs supercharging people's knowledge and web3 and specifically our ecosystem or network um and honestly like every single cohort we make more and more improvements to it uh more and more cool aspects to it so definitely if you're interested in that you can reach out to me we have postings on our site there's a website for it um you know hit me up on on twitter linkedin or anywhere and i'm more than happy to um to chat about it and get you in touch with the right people to potentially be considered for it but yeah that launchpad program is really awesome and it not only connects you to opportunities and protocol labs but also as you guys were talking about the collaboration of this space our whole network of companies that that build in our space so i think there's like 50 companies plugged in right now but we plug in 10 to 15 more for every single single cohort um in terms of like other resources i guess i'll call out one that i like recently have found really interesting uh a16z has a new podcast um that's like specific to blockchain web3 crypto they've had i think three episodes and each of them have been like super super informative for me to to listen to but a lot of the other ones i listen to it's like just more one-off episodes where i'll see someone on twitter post like oh this one's really informative with these two people and i'll listen to that but i guess a16z's uh recent crypto podcast is one that i have really enjoyed so i'd recommend that too cool great so a podcast and and kind of like the the job sport in the launchpad for maybe let me just plug there or if you go to hackathons.faricon.io and you go to this section that's called post technical opportunities you will find links to both information about the launchpad program as well as the jobs that ian was describing and so encourage you to check that out and join over to you we already heard in the the book tip for working in public and to kind of like get a get a little bit of a sense for what what's going on what are some and other resources and that you would recommend i i i'm a big uh podcast listener like before i had children and now i have no time to listen to podcast but thankfully i do fly business trips sometimes so i have plenty of time to finish audio books and stuff in uh well on airplane one of the things the gateway podcast for me to crypto and web 3 world is bankless and they have now they have uh segments called rollups which which are really good it was like a fashion news for uh for forward three um so from there i used to not understand eighty percent or even ninety percent of what they were talking about um and then i learned right every day you spent at one or two hours what's what's this project what does that do and where are they at and to now like i can understand probably there's only probably about 20 of things that i don't understand so that's a good way to learn apart from the working in public which is about working ways of working uh uh in webtory the infinite machine is talking about how ethereum is funded uh the stories the good parts and also um the not so good parts that was good um very educating and they talk about so many projects are very famous in the in the history of uh web 3 world and falcon was talked about as well and and very um very uh in in a very impartial way um the cryptokin is another book that talks about uh coinbase and how they started and in that book they they referred to a few few projects financially related too um and and to to to close down this is uh i'm going to give you advice which is going to be the the best career advice you'll hear or you'll forget right after this panel is don't change yourself for a job but find a job that that suits you be choosy and absolutely selfish to you because um if you find a job that energizes you if you find a job that you really like um then you don't feel like working and that's what i have been feeling like for the last two jobs and including this one as well which is getting into their real uh this is a space where technical meets kind of business skills together and community skills and marketing uh together and i've been i've been not feeling like working for honestly like for six six six years also yeah awesome thank you thank you for both for kind of sharing those tips and and since you're both like um too humble to mention yourselves i'm gonna do it right so you have ian and you have drinks and sitting right here and um you know they are available on on twitter on discord etc so and please do reach out to them same applies for me and we are here to kind of support you in whatever you know way your journey may take you right if you want to start your own company and we talked about in the opportunities around that earlier and then also you know your personal growth goals and so super exciting and to hear that and from you about those opportunities and i think and we'll we'll just kind of close out there and i have one thing that i heard earlier that um quan said which was like figure out how to accelerate your own learning and space which i think is great advice i i hadn't heard it and i think that's that's really key and and like what does it specifically mean right because ian also said that there is a lot of noise in the space like just connect with people and ask that you trust and think that they have something else to say and they will be able to direct you right so you don't reinvent the video there where there have been people who have been in the space and like trying to make sense of it for a while just reach out to them use them as signposts and and and and help them navigate through this space and with that like thanks so much ian and james for for joining the panel and sharing some of your perspectives and insight and i'll hand it back over to jacob thanks so much and awesome big thank you to lucas too for for leading the panel and as a moderator and uh for all the help that lucas also had and playing a role in this entire summit so i really appreciate the help there um and thanks ian and jax awesome uh i love your ideas and and your thoughts in the space so thank you so much for being here you bet my pleasure all right and with that we have come to the end of uh of the summit for a hack fest kickoff so you know i wanted to say you know big thank you to everybody who came out and uh and both watched uh but then also all of our speakers and everybody who's involved in any way making this happen um everything you saw today uh is already recorded and available if you want to keep watching after this is over if you missed a talk we're also going to chop up all the talks into individual talks over the next couple days and those will be available to you on our youtube channel i just youtube.com youthglobal um and yeah i mean happy hacking of course this was the kickoff for hack fs which is a two and a half week hackathon that we're running as the global uh with the protocol labs team really excited to see what everybody builds we've 850 plus hackers building it's the biggest one we've ever had for hack fs so cannot wait to see all the amazing projects that are built um and what you can do when redefining the future of the internet um so thank you so much for attending and looking forward to seeing you on the next summit cheers you
