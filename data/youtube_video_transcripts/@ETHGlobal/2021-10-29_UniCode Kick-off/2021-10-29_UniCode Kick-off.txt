good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of eat global and i want to welcome all of you to the unicode kickoff so all of you are watching this on eatglobal.tv for those of you who are not familiar with this we created this custom interface to do all of our events so be sure to log in and say hi and if you have any questions for our speakers especially as we go live and do any of these talks you can ask those questions on the chat and we'll be able to relay those questions to our speakers and for anybody who also logs in and engages with us we'll be giving out nft pro-apps for all participants so this event is organized by heath global and for those of you who don't know equal was an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons in summits and unicode is no exception we're super excited to be doing this partnered event with the unizwab grants program and i am super excited to share that we have over 320 hackers participating in this hackathon from 48 different countries spanning 17 different time zones not only that we have over 20 ecosystem mentors six technical mentors and seven ecosystem partners are going to be here for with us for the next 14 days helping out and answering any of your questions whether you're stuck on the defy side or solidity side or the front insight or design you name it we'll be there to offer any sort of support these are some of our amazing partners that we have on board for this event and i'll be going over what you can do in terms of engaging with them winning prizes for some of the price of everybody's offering and how everything will look like from the hakadon side very soon so on top of all that we are giving away over 125 000 in prizes and all those details will be shared in this session and uh stay on for uh for a lot of those uh details all right so let's get into some of the event stuff so the most common question we've gone here is what can i build up for unicode the answer and the possibilities here are endless there's a lot of things you can do here especially using the protocol if there's stuff around making lending trading hedging better you can do optimization for liquidity and just creative things that we've seen with lp position management you can do asset management related tools and analytics a lot of people are interested in understanding how you can understand what's going on a lot better from looking at on chain data then there's also stuff around layer two integrations you can even write documentation and make the rest of the ecosystem better and of course uh contribute to or create new developer tools uh there's a lot of potential here and we're also going over some of the things that you can do later on in the day if you are in a need for different ideas to uh to work on so let's quickly go into what the next 10 days look like so i'm going to be covering how does team formation works um how you can get help if you're stuck all the prices that you can win we're going to talk about some of the talks in the workshops that we have planned and also how judging and submission will work for for the hackathon uh the most important piece here is with respect to communication everything is happening on discord so the discord is um available through your dashboard you can authorize your discord and you'll be able to get the automatic permissions to see all the uniqlo specific channels keep in mind the channels are private for anybody who's participating so if you do not see a unicode heading in your discord sidebar with all these channels on this image ping us in any of the other discord channels that you are able to find or send us an email and we'll be able to make sure the permissions are set for everybody who's participating in the hackathon whether you're a mentor or a hacker or a sponsor or a partner all these things are managed directly automatically so keep in mind that everything will happen here similarly all these uh if you have any questions whether you're stuck on how to use a certain protocol or a tool or just in general any other technical help that you're in need of there are channels dedicated for just support so you can head over and type type in your question there with any of the relevant details and somebody will be there to answer your requests on top of all that we'll also be doing calendar invites for all talk to workshops so you should have gone a whole set of invites directly to your calendar you can just see all the talk names and in those details whether it's the speaker when it is and how you can find out more the whole schedule for this hackathon is also on the website and keep in mind that we want all of this thing to be asynchronous so it is totally okay if you are not able to meet uh or join a call because of a time zone constraint or designing all of this thing to be easily digestible independent of what timezone you're in and all that information is available on the website which is unicode.heathcluble.com right so quickly into the hackathon logistics so the hackathon officially begins now which means that as of me saying the sentence you can start working on all of your projects and you can work on your projects with other people and have a team of up to five different people you have 10 days from now to submit so today is friday which is day one and you are going to be submitting all of your projects on sunday of next week in terms of rules and criteria we want to keep this fairly straightforward everything that you're going to be submitting in order to qualify for a prize it must be done during the course of this hackathon which means that all of your submissions need to be done from today to the next sunday every submission to qualify for any price must use the unispot protocol in some form if you have any questions around the nuances of what this means or what discount would something count please let us know we'll be here to answer questions on discord or email and only rsvp attendees are eligible to win any prizes so if you're working with somebody on the team if they are not listed as a team member on your dashboard they will not be counted so please let us know if everybody is there on your team and i'm going to make sure that we have all that information ahead of time and again if there's any other questions or some clarification you need if there's some edge case that you are you think you're a part of we'll be happy to clarify so reach out to anybody on the applicable team on slack or discord or email next up is in general what if you're new to all of this a lot of you are participating here for the first time whether it's to the first time adding global hackathon or first time going deep into d5 we have a lot of support here for anybody who's in this situation you can head over to find a team channel on discord to reach out to other potential team members who may be interested in pairing up with you whether it's some skill set that they need and you have or you have an idea and you need somebody to help build and work with you you can find everybody who's in a similar position and potentially form a team we also encourage all of you to uh say hi introduce yourself in the unicode chat channel there's over 300 of you from nearly 50 countries and that's amazing and would love to learn more about who you are and what you're excited about and also if you are curious to have uh if you're still interested in looking for any ideas for the hackathon there will be a call today on just ideation and looking for different ideas and what's possible here uh to build over the course of the hackathon so you can join that call today and participate with anybody who is also interested in building a team or looking for other ideas and of course it's not required that you form a team or have different team members if you are interested in working on your own that is totally okay and it's not a requirement so it's totally fine and then also on talks and workshops there's a lot of stuff happening for this hackathon there's a lot of content for beginners uh intermediate skill levels and experts so whether you are super new here or you want to understand how something works deeply under the hood we have a lot of stuff planned for you today and on monday and a few other days of next week all that is going to be available on the website from the schedule you can sign up and see everything and all that information is also available on your info center that is linked to your dashboard and once again if you miss something because of time zones or any other conflict it is totally okay all that content is recorded so you'll be able to catch up immediately after that talk or conversation or the call ends and watch it directly from our website um the recording the website again is unicode.eforvault.com and then a few more things so check-ins if you have been part of any global i've found in the past um some of them have been multi-week events uh for this one we're gonna do one quick check-in with everybody next week uh this will be on monday and we'll just quickly ask how things are going and if you need any help whether it's on an idea or understanding about something that you're stuck on from a technical level and this will just let us ensure that you are able to get the help you need and of course uh similar to our previous events you all stay to participate at this event and as you kind of go through that process all next week we'll be able to uh get you all set with your stake refund and all this happens again asynchronously over your dashboard so you'll be able to see everything directly by going to hack.eportvale.com unicode and then in terms of judging so judging will take place on monday november the 8th that is day 11 starting today and for judging you'll be required to make a four minute demo of the video this will only be a video submission so we will be taking live demos and we really encourage all of you to do not do this last minute because this will require some practice and planning to make sure that you can fit everything you want to talk about in four minutes so all those details that you need will be soon available on the dashboard directly and you'll be able to go ahead and submit your projects very soon next weekend and i also want to talk about our code of conduct so keep in mind that all the event rules and code of conduct is listed on eighth global dot com rules but in general to summarize all of this please be respectful and harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated so if you see anything that is not ideal for any other member on our community please reach out to us be sure to report that and we'll be able to take immediate action and ping and you can ping any global member on the team whether it's through discord or email and finally before we go into all the creative stuff and interesting things you're all here about i want to make sure that i remind everybody to pace themselves we really do not want this to be exhausting for you we want you to have fun this is all about learning experimentation this is about understanding what is possible and how we can kind of do creative things or unique things with the tools and services that we have in the space uh very much uh the goal of our events and the global work is to bring on new people and bring on your creative ideas so uh don't treat this like a competition uh even if you don't get to finish what you wanted to do initially today by the end of the submission deadline it is totally okay um you will have a lot more opportunities to continue building and getting still getting help from our ecosystem in broadly so with that we are done with the logistics of unicode so let's go into a couple of other things around the rest of the event that i'm sure all of you are waiting for so i want to quickly thank some of our amazing partners that are here participating at this event so i want to specially thank you spot grants program for making all of this happen and we have aztec protocol advisor polyrap omni analytics group skynet and ens who are also here making the event possible and bringing on their team members and staff to help all of you succeed in building really sweet and amazing projects so we'll be going into the details of all the prizes that each of these partners are going to be giving but before that i have a quick video from the union swap bands program team and they're going to share how they can help everybody here and why they're excited to be part of unicode for the next two weeks so without further ado let them tell us who they are hey guys boris from uniform friends program here first let me thank the eath global team for organizing this great event also big thank you to all the co-sponsors uni-swap team and all of you hackers that decided to take up the challenge and work on some great projects over the next 10 days you are probably familiar with uniswap but they'll still make a brief introduction uniswop is a decentralized mm exchange on ethereum there are three versions deployed with version 3 being available on optimism and arbitrary l2 scaling solutions as for the units of grant program we are the community run grant program established by the units of governance in an unchained vote speaking of governance voting and proposals we prepared a very interesting category for unicode titled governance enhancements governance is in the core of uniswop and would like to see you bring some fresh innovation to it second category i'd like to introduce is advanced trading tools here we're looking for projects helping out our swappers where it is helping them in decision making tracking their portfolio performance or just making their quality of life while using unis for better we are interested to see what you come up with in our last eat global hackathon we saw that a lot of you are interested in implementing different instruments on top of uniswop that is why we decided to create a separate category for such projects futures with or without exploration leverage positions or something else it is up to you all will qualify in this category over the past year unifor grant program support a lot of different teams and individuals in creating help of delve tools libraries sdks and more for ugp grantees in new ideas category we would like to see some of them in new projects list of all such projects can be found in our hacker guide last but not least we created an innovation category we didn't want to limit your creativeness so any project which is unisop related will qualify if you'll need any help while working on your projects you'll be able to reach us and the uni swap team in discord we are looking forward to see all of the great ideas you guys will implement over the next 10 days awesome thank you so much boris um so boris went over how ugp is here to help and all the prices are giving out don't worry if you missed it or didn't catch all those details but uh i'll be going over that and sharing all of that very soon and before we go into the prizes i want to quickly invite noah from the union swap labs team known as the head of engineering at unispot labs and he's going to be sharing a quick talk about uniswap oracles the talk is cleverly titled the price is right and without further ado i'd like to welcome noah to come on and tell us more about how you can get this working with v3 welcome thanks card dick um and thanks also for this the the great intro and lots of uh of great information we're super excited um to partner with all these great groups that you've already heard from um at uniswap um for you to you know create whatever um whatever your heart desires and we're here to help and um so yeah i thought i'd give a little presentation um about something specific rather than you know just a general overview because i thought that would be a bit more fun and just sort of inspire you um if not to work on oracle's directly to sort of understand the scope of the kind of things that you'll be able to build um during these two weeks or so so let me quickly share my screen here and i'll confirm that everyone can see that everything is good to go great okay so um welcome the price is right um full disclosure i actually haven't seen any episodes of this show so i don't know uh the the the title is about all i've got but um i figured i would talk a little bit about v3 oracles today and um i'm going to start off with this meme um you know i received your gas you received to you up so um ultimately um the unisop oracle is a you know a fully on chain um system of you know creating and uh and distributing tu ops which is time weighted average prices um a little bit of inside terminology there okay so why why are we through oracle school why am i talking about this as opposed to any other feature on uniform um frankly it's a it's even a bit under the radar like most people when they think of unison they don't think oracle's they think about trading or liquidity provision or you know ticks or concentrated liquidity or or what have you but i thought it would be fun to just chat a bit about oracle's because i think it features some of the really interesting design patterns that we developed in v3 and it's just a great example of how v3 can serve you as a developer and and can be sort of a bedrock upon which you can build really interesting really complex you know other protocols build out your ideas things like that so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna hit each of these little bullet points here um and just briefly describe like what i meant when i when i wrote this and like why it might be interesting to you as a developer thinking about writing um an integration on top of uniform so accumulators so that's the first that's the first bullet point um this one's pretty interesting so there's a lot of history here i won't go into the exhaustive details but um you know the way that we track prices in uniswap in both v2 and v3 both of which feature oracle um you know capabilities um we track prices via an accumulator so what this basically means is that we don't just track the price and like store the price history um overall time because you know that's a prohibitively expensive thing to do but what it turns out you can do is if you if you actually know the price at some time t0 and you every second add the current price to that historical price and you just keep this ongoing running sum that's getting bigger and bigger and bigger all the time you can actually back out average prices within intervals by taking the difference in accumulator values so if you take accumulator value at time two and time one and you subtract them it turns out that the average you know that value is the average price within that duration and this can extend to any number of arbitrary intervals and um and and it's very flexible and it's an interesting pattern right it's sort of somewhat non-intuitive um and there's lots of ways that we tried and failed to get this um you know this pattern to work and so anyway accumulators is this very interesting pattern that you'll you'll get exposed to if you've ever looked at the oracle code um so it's a good tool to have in your toolkit okay integer overflow what's this so um we're hyper optimized you know we're hyper focused on optimizing for gas usage at uniswap so this is something we've sort of become notorious for um sometimes in fact we actually sacrifice a bit of code quality or code sort of readability for gas efficiency and so um we're hyper focused on making sure that swappers are paying no more than they actually absolutely need to and so what we've done is we've actually taken a you know the time stamp which again as i mentioned the oracle is accumulating on a per second basis um and and what we've done is essentially allowed we've compressed the timestamp from 256 bits which is its native representation on in the evm down into 32 bits and that lets you express a smaller range of times and it's actually about um 100 and something years so um you know two to the 32 seconds is something like 100 years um and so actually what happens is every 100 years the unicef oracles will all um potentially overflow and so we've actually written all the logic in the oracle integration of v3 to be fully integer overflow resistant or or you know um basically everything just works no matter if the energy is overflow or not and so this is a pretty non-intuitive pretty interesting pattern so again if you're interested in overflow um or you know being robust to 100 plus year intervals of of tracking prices you know this this oracle is for you okay variable length circular queues this one's this one's wild very interesting um and don't feel like you need to understand all this by the way i'm just trying to pique your interest here um so what this means is um in v3 um unlike v2 we offer you the ability to natively uh calculate the t-wap the time-wave average price to you know about which i'm going to go into more detail later don't worry if you still don't really understand what that is but anyway in v3 we offer you the ability to calculate this um over basically any arbitrary time frame within the last about week or so in v2 this wasn't the case you had to do a lot more work actually in order to extract these average prices and if you didn't sort of track a price at a particular time snapshot you were unable you know in the future to sort of retroactively go back and check what the price was at any point that that wasn't that specific time that you tracked uh we solved this problem in v3 by well implementing variable length circular queues and what this basically means is we rather than tracking a single accumulator value which just is overwritten on an ongoing basis we actually track an array with a variable length um which stores each accumulator value um for each new block that touched the unisoft pair so rather than having one value and just consistently overwriting it with a new accumulator value again and again and again we actually stack and we push these accumulator values onto an array and then when we reach the end of the array let's say length 5 or length 10 we actually just loop back to the beginning hence circular and then we just keep writing in perpetuity right and what happens is you can actually increase the length of that array and so by default we don't make you pay as a swapper or nlp we don't make you pay for this ability to read twops in the far past but if you want that feature right you can actually extend the length of this queue um and uh and and get you know access to these historical prices and so very complicated um implementation you don't you can you know don't take my word for you can go look um but a very interesting feature that was that was basically core to this improvement in oracle's um from v2 to v3 okay binary search this is a cool one too so again now that we don't have just a singular observation we have actually an array of them um we have this problem where we need to get the observation or the accumulator value or the price right at a historical time and that time might be a long time ago it could be a day ago it could be an hour it could be two and a half hours it could be um you know a week and we we actually don't natively know where to look in this array for that value and so what we actually have to do is a binary search so we know that this circular queue is sorted with an offset right so like because it's circular you know you're never starting it's not guaranteed to be sorted from like index 0 to index max but it is sorted sort of starting from the the current index you know and going around in a loop and so we can actually abuse that feature by performing a binary search whenever we're looking for a historical observation at a particular time moment and so again don't take my word for it this is this implementation is like publicly available you can look at it in our github super interesting um and again a great tool to have in your toolkit binary search extremely efficient um login complexity um a really great way to find data in a in a gas efficient way um given that you know your sort of your input data is sorted chronologically or you know by whatever in whatever by whatever sort of sorting criteria you care about okay linear interpolation we're almost done here and then i'm going to actually explain what some of the oracle stuff does rather than just like titillating you with these fun little details okay linear interpolation this is a cool one so as i mentioned um the accumulators and the oracles in general work on a per second basis right so you can get the price at any given you know second which is what we sort of intuitively understand um you know as humans right but uh but what the evm understands isn't just seconds it's also like blocks and blocks are sort of the canonical unit of time in in blockchain land and so what we need to do actually is if there's a block at time 0 and then another block of time 13 let's say we want the price at time 10 or time 8 right like we we can sort of we know what it should be right it's just like it never the price never changed between blocks because that's impossible but we sort of need to like we can't say that it's the price is what it was at time 0 or 13 because that's not quite right you know what i mean like we need to sort of do some well interpolation between 0 and 13. and so linear interpolation just refers to the fact that the the core um the v3 core code which implements oracle's actually does this job of linearly interpolating between blocks um if you're looking for the price at a historical moment which actually didn't have a block but just happened to be between two blocks so um yes this is another interesting feature and then finally we get to use all three pythagorean means when we're using oracle so this is a pretty cool one um i i one thing i didn't mention actually is that we don't just track average prices in v3 we actually track average liquidity as well in the same fashion and i won't go into um much more detail than that but suffice it to say that we we're tracking average prices via an accumulator and average liquidity via the same and what this lets us do is take so first of all we can get arithmetic means of uh ticks which are a representation of prices in unison e3 right so arithmetic mean great and that's exactly using that logic that i mentioned earlier about the accumulator right like if you have an accumulator value at time two and times zero you can just take the delta divide by the you know interval length and then there's your average over that interval right so that's an arithmetic mean and so that's what we can do for for ticks say um what we do with liquidity is we actually track not just liquidity natively but seconds over liquidity uh for complicated reasons that again i'm not going to explain but because we're tracking s over l and we're we're trying to get the average l liquidity um if you accumulate s over l on on a sort of rolling basis and then you divide out by seconds um which you can obviously get from um you know from just the duration of um uh you know of whatever period you're looking at it turns out that's the harmonic mean right so the harmonic mean is like one over um you know x you know summed up you know divided by like the x or something you know i don't know if exactly i said it right but you know you can look up harmonic mean and basically that's what this is and there's different properties that the harmonic mean has relative to the arithmetic mean that make it actually pretty pretty well suited for tracking average liquidity it sort of down weights um it it weights downward for low values of liquidity which is good because you want to you want to sort of um you know not put a lot of weight on sort of uh low liquidity pools for example right so that's two and the third is a geometric mean so um it turns out that the arithmetic mean of a over b when you sum it up over time and b over a is actually different right and that's just because a property of the arithmetic means the arithmetic mean of ratios isn't equal to the arithmetic mean of the inverse of the ratios um a little bit unfortunate and so in unison v2 we actually tracked both a over b and b over a you know so for each die say we track the east die price and also the die each price which are basically again the same right but because of this quirk the arithmetic mean um they aren't actually um equal um and so we tracked both which was a bit wasteful and so in v3 what we've actually done is we track now the geometric mean price and so instead of b over a and a over b we actually track the root of the product of a bunch of observations of a over b and actually it doesn't matter if it's a over b or b over a they're the same if it turns out like if you have a zero b zero a one b one if you take the product of those and then take the root the second root in this case um it's the same value as if you had just flipped everything right and so that's actually quite a nice feature it gives you sort of a canonical price for two assets rather than two which you need to choose between an or ultimately sort of arbitrary right so um it turns out that by tracking arithmetic mean ticks which actually represent exponential prices um you get um geometric mean prices so arithmetic mean ticks correspond to geometric mean prices meaning um uh we've used all three means so anyway cool don't feel like you have to understand all this um but hopefully again it's just interesting and like prompts you to dive a bit more into the code um again which i'm gonna explain how to do very soon so okay without further ado let's move on from this and um we we still have a bit of time left so let's actually talk about like what you know um v3 oracles are maybe now that i've um fully confused everyone so uh they are on-chain permissionless t-ops which again are time-weighted average prices um and so basically what they are is for for any given liquidity pool on unisoc let's say esai as a great example right you know people are constantly trading with this pool they're providing liquidity um and more more importantly or most importantly perhaps they're arbitraging this price to match what the sort of true price um of ethai is across the entire market and so the unison price natively tracks the price of um uh you know of of these assets um you know in an incentive compatible way right like in this permissionless environment there's always an you know you'll make money by trading the price on unisoft closer to the true price and so um you know you'll you'll just you'll just do that and then um as a benefit right we have access to this price now because of this oracle feature and so we can use the sort of true or arbitrage um price of each die say as an input to any number of systems that we want to build on top and so like the most obvious example right is if you want to offer people like leverage where you deposit even you want to let them withdraw some dollar denominated um you know asset in in return you know up to some collateralization ratio and then you want to maintain this sort of ratio and have a liquidation system and um you know things like that well you can actually do that natively if you have access to some kind of true price of you know east usd or ethio or what have you and so um that's just one example of how you know tracking the price on unisop um and and having access to that on a historical basis crucially um can actually be a really powerful way to have a permissionless system of prices that you can use as inputs to other economic you know uh systems say so um that is what t-ups are and this is a bit of an example so if you were not following what i was talking about earlier with like the array of observations and things like that so on the bottom here let's start with this last row so that's the v2 oracle right and so we have this price accumulator which at time uh like 1 pm it looks like is uh has a value of 11 400 right and and then there's a bunch of blocks that go by and then if we want to check again at time you know 2 p.m this accumulator you see has increased so it's now it's 48 000. and so what you can do is you can take the difference 48 000 minus 11 000 divide by you know one hour and then you get the average price over that whole duration while the accumulator was sticking up but crucially what we didn't do in v2 is we didn't store this 11 000 value you had to actually proactively go ahead and store it yourself wait an hour and then check what it was against you know against that historical value and so if you didn't store it you know you you're out of luck and you know it's it's it's actually hard and costly and sort of frustrating to have to do this so what we've done in v3 which is now the top row we actually store all of these checkpoint values um on a on a rolling basis again in a circular queue and so now at time two you don't have to have stored anything at time you know time one you can actually just look back in the array using a binary search um find that historical value perform the delta get your arithmetic average tick and then derive the geometric average price over the whole interval so this is super cool and you can actually do this not just at one time but like at any variable time in the whole you know duration of the tracked sort of period um that the oracle is oracle is tracking and again you can see here it says up to nine days later right the oracle is about a week or eight or nine days worth of data um when it's you know fully initialized and so this is this is a really powerful way to like um calculate any sort of arbitrarily any arbitrary curve or price um you know average over over this whole interval so hopefully that helps a little bit um okay so why like more importantly like i've described more or less what unicef workers are and how they work but why would you use them so the first is that they're economically robust and i touched on this earlier right like it's important to have full incentive alignment um for a system to sort of be um you know trustworthy and so economically robust refers to the fact that again if the price of uniswap of you know let's say the eth die pool diverges from the east side price on coinbase or binance or any other decks on ethereum or any other decks anywhere there's going to be money on the table for some arbitrage whoever to come in and and and and trade the price back to its you know fair true value and so economically request refers to the incentive alignment that that exists to push the uniform price close to the true price which is again probably what you care about if you're building this second order abstracted economic system the second is explicit manipulation costs so um you know there are other ways to get prices on ethereum right like you can maybe just have a trusted party submit a price that you know they have claimed is is the price of each site on some you know in some um aggregate fashion you can maybe have an external exchange like coinbase for example sign uh cryptographically the price of you know you die on their system every so often submit that price to the chain and then use that as your source of truth um there's other projects out there that like offer you know pricing as a service and they'll sort of report on a periodic basis what the price is of various things and it's not clear in any of those cases really what the manipulation cost is um for a reporter to perform uh you know poorly or sub-optimally or even maliciously and so uh in unisop that's not the case right like because the implementation is no because we we have a very clear like data provenance pipeline like we know every step of the way what's happening there is a cost to manipulate really you can pay money to push the unisoft price away from its true value but it will like you the only way to do that is to incur economic losses right because again you're just feeding arbitrage money the more you push your price away and it gets arbitraged back and so explicit manipulation cost refers to the fact that the only way to manipulate the system is to pay money in a fully public transparent manner whereas with an off chain reporter it's not at all clear what the incentive structures are how you know we're maintaining um verifiability and trust things like that um and so i think that this is an important property to have when you're when you're designing an oracle system okay guaranteed up time this is obviously just a simple one like uniswap is always on because ethereum is always on and there's no off chain infrastructure like there's no reporting that can't happen um of course you know you can have a scenario where blocks are being stuffed and maybe no one is able to arbitrage the price on uniform but i think that would be sort of a more systemic issue on ethereum um and not something sort of that we have to worry about as a as a dap level um project but um but you know in the general case i think that guaranteed up time is a huge feature um and you don't need to have any liveness concerns uh about oracle's when you're using unison and finally zero counterparty risk so this is i actually alluded to this earlier in the manipulation costs but um you know there's no party that's responsible for for you know publishing prices or being timely or being fair or accurate again it's fully algorithmic it's just code you can audit it yourself and there's literally zero counterparty risk there is smart contract risk of course there are economic considerations that you have to make hence the first two points um but uh yeah there's no actual party that is able to um you know that is able to cheat or or misuse your system so hopefully that it you know motivates you and sort of explains why we think that decentralized permissionless oracles like uniswap are um you know very powerful and of course maybe not as um sort of fully accurate like they're not is they're not always going to track the exact price off chain of any of these different assets because again there's a little bit of arbitrage flow there's um there's the fact that you're just taking an average as opposed to looking at spot which you can sort of trust off chain um but i think that these benefits are really quite strong and they potentially outweigh those costs um okay so here's just an example of what can go wrong if you have a bad oracle right like so if you're a landing protocol and you're thinking oh the spot price should be fine well what can happen is uh something disastrous like uh the stack trace that you're seeing so you know there have been a couple examples historically of lending protocols usually or some variant of that where they're using uh the price of an asset again as i mentioned before to sort of collateralize um the borrowing of another asset and they're using more or less what what can be referred to as a spot price which is the the immediate price at any given moment which is fully manipulable right and there's like very little cost to manipulate the spot as opposed to an average um because you you have you can do that synchronously as opposed to you having to being forced to do that over multiple blocks over you know a given time time span so you know these lending protocols historically like use the spot price and in fact not even an off-chain spot which is which would be more like an off-chain oracle reporter where it's accurate maybe but there's like you don't know who that reporter is and you can't you don't know if you can trust them but they actually use the spot price of an on-chain protocol like they use the spot on a decks um to figure out the collateralization um ratios um and so this is really dangerous right because you can fully manipulate the spot sort of at quite low cost um you know exploit the lending protocol as you can see here in this stack trace this is bzx um and you you can make a lot of money you can wreck people so uh yeah so this is just a cautionary tale about the fact that using oracles is important and if you're going to use oracles maybe you should think about using a decentralized oracle network like uniswap as opposed to um you know a system of reporters right okay finally how so this is where i'm just gonna give a couple links and sort of bail out here because um i don't want to take too much more of your time but there's there's a couple places to go to look so the first link here um is the v3 core code on unisop's github so what this is is the implementation of oracle's at the lowest possible level um this is going to have all the juicy details that i mentioned in the beginning variable length circular queues binary search all this good stuff so if you really want if you want the sauce that's where to get it so v3 periphery is a bit different um this is a repo where we we write code that is at a bit of a higher level than core and it doesn't implement the core like it's not the implementation of e3 um that's in court what it is though is it's a set of sort of helper contracts helper libraries things that abstract a lot of the like nitty gritty details um for you and um and basically offer a sort of smooth developer friendly hopefully api surface right and so um an example of this is like the the router contract which is actually how you trade through unisop that's a peripheral contract because it's never holding people's funds it's not implementing the amm functionality it's simply like managing approvals it's managing transfers um you know doing the court sort of swappage logic doing swapping logic doing slippage checks things like that uh crucially additionally it also has a lot of oracle functionality so there's a library in there called oracle library and it again offers like a bit of a smoother interface to using v3 oracles in a way that is going to be easier to digest as again as a third-party protocol that wants prices and some um you know for some for some input to their system finally there is some there are some docs so if i missed anything in this description of oracle's as i'm sure i did um you can look at this doc page here um probably just the easiest way to search it is just go to the docs site yourself.org site and like search for oracle's um rather than typing out this link but um there's a lot of information um you know there about about this system and why it might be interesting to you and finally of course the discord is always available as a place to ask questions about these things and so i'll be on there a bunch of team members and people from these global and and ugp and things like that will be will be hopefully on the discord to answer those types of questions and so you know i want to wrap up you know thank you first of all um oracles um i just wanted to say that you know we're really appreciative that you guys are all here and taking time out of your i'm sure busy lives to you know to hack for hack for fun and and maybe a little bit of profit um um you know hopefully this was interesting just as a bit of a a deep dive into a specific feature of v3 that is you know near and dear to my heart i wrote most of this code um i think it's really interesting i'm excited to see people building on top of it um but you know i just want to say that there's so many areas like this um around swapping around the user experience around lping around all kinds of um really interesting things um that uh you know that are possible to build on top of unisof so um hopefully this is helpful um and inspiring and you know i know there's lots more to come um uh you know i know that aztec i i talked with those folks and they're they're really excited about some some interesting ideas um you know building on like layer two and zero knowledge to trade on unislop um i know there's a lot of interest in optimism and arbitrary um so yeah i'm excited to see what you all build don't feel like you have to use oracles but um again thank you for your time and i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap it there awesome thanks noah um this is uh super helpful i think uh just uh it's a really good way to point out that it's not just about plugging into the liquidity and trading there's a lot more you can do with is a perfect example i was going to say all those memories of me prepping for engineering interviews or fun coming back and uh you can see them in practice and hopefully everybody gets to use this too so with that i want to thank you for giving us that great overview for everybody who has questions um please uh you can thank noah or the broader ugp and swap labs team on the discord for any help or questions i hope that uh a lot of you build really cool ways to uh use an indicator case all right with that we got a couple of things to go before we wrap up this call um i want to quickly get into the prizes which i know a lot of you have been waiting for so without further ado let's kick into all the prizes that we have available for the hackathon so first up is the uniswap grants program so i know you saw boris list out all the price that they're giving but we'll go into a lot more details here so uh we've asked for us to make another quick announcement on each of those prizes and uh we'll play that for you now hey guys boris from uniform grant program here i'd like to tell you more about the prices we prepared for the unicode we have five different categories we will give prizes in governance enhancements is the first category and here we would like to see projects that innovate on the uniforms governance process in the category advanced trading tools all projects or tools helping out swappers will be considered for the novel swapping instruments category projects working on things such as leverage trading on futures will compete over the past year a lot of great libraries sdks and tools were developed with the support of the units of grant program and we would like to see some of them put to work in the ugp grantees in new ideas category and last but not least in the innovation category everything goes as long as it is unisop related hope you find our categories interesting and happy hacking awesome thanks boris um so just to repeat uh some of those prizes venus what will be giving fifty thousand dollars between projects working on all those listed categories and you can find all those categories on unicode.educable.com prizes and we'll have ten finalist teams where each of those teams will be winning five thousand dollars each next up we have aztec and joe will be talking about the prizes you can win from the aztec protocol hi guys my name's joe i'm one of the co-founders of the aztec network aztec is a privacy focused layer to running on ethereum we're thrilled to be sponsoring the unicode hackathon this weekend as we've just launched our new product aztec connect to test network aztec connect allows users with shielded funds on aztec to transact privately and with 10 to 30 times gas savings with any l1 smart contract and layer 1 liquidity users can now interact with unisport v3 using their shielded funds on aztec and do it for a fraction of the cost of layer 1 and with ironclad privacy we'll be sponsoring a 5000 zkdi prize for the team that writes the best bridge contract and i'm hosting a workshop at 8pm tonight to go through how to write a bridge contract and discuss some of the ideas for the best british contracts that we think will enhance the uni swap v3 protocol with privacy and scaling i'll be discussing time weighted average orders with privacy and private one tick range orders using the v3 engine if you're interested in dark liquidity and dark pools come along if you've got any questions feel free to pin me in the discord good luck and happy hacking thanks joe to repeat some of the prizes from aztec aztec will be giving five thousand dollars in zkdie for the top bridge contract that enables private transactions on top of v3 using asset connect super exciting space to be working on so i hope all of you check that out and uh next up we have miles from advisor finance and uh they'll be sharing what they're giving you guys surprises i'm miles from visor finance a d5 protocol for active liquidity management in may of this year unisop moved from uniswap v2 with an infinite price range applied to each pair to unisop v3 where lps can concentrate their capital within custom price ranges providing greater amounts of liquidity within a certain price range in doing so lps construct individualized price curves because of this liquidity provision now has a range of complex strategies that can be applied to positions resembling a traditional market structure and financial products visor is the protocol and venue that allows for the deposit of assets and management of these new liquidity positions the visor web app allows lps to deposit assets into managed positions visor allows a strategy to be applied to positions on a liquidity provider's behalf to maximize fee return and stay within range and anyone can create a position management strategy we've built an active management framework with documentation for you to use in this hackathon the active management strategy framework allows you to write your own strategy simulate it and then deploy it for lps to subscribe to visor has three categories for prizes with the first place in each category receiving fifteen hundred dollars and runner-ups receiving one thousand dollars we will also be awarding strategies up to an additional ten thousand dollars the first category is uniform v3 lp strategy construction the second category is unisop v3 tooling and the third category is the most novel use slash integration of unisop v3 we will be available in the discord during the hackathon to provide help and guidance for participants building with visor thanks for joining awesome thanks miles to kind of repeat some of those prizes again the best v3 lp strategy construction will get fifteen hundred dollars for the first place and a thousand dollars for the second place the best v3 tooling implementation will get 1500 for the first place a thousand for the second place and the most novel integration the v3 will get 1500 for the first place and second place will get a thousand and there's also a pool price of 500 with anybody who uses advisor contracts will get an equal split of this amount next up we have polywrap and four polywrap prizes colorado will be giving two thousand dollars for the best hacked and two one thousand dollar run are prizes for the best use of the polywrap sdk then we have ens and ens will give 150.8 to each of the five best use cases of ens for those five different projects then we have skynet and scanner will be awarding a four thousand dollar pool price in cya coin to anybody who implements skynet in their project in a meaningful way so this means that anybody who is going to be qualified will get an equal split of this four thousand dollars then we have the omni analytics group and for romney analytics the first the most innovative use case will get a thousand dollars for on the analytics the most useful feature expansion will also receive a thousand dollars the best dashboard is derived from the data collected through the venus swapper we'll get a thousand dollars the there's going to be a pool price of a thousand dollars for the best split contributions to in this proper package and well there's a lot more details here for all these prizes including documentation and tutorials on how to use some of these sdk so you can head over to unicode.educable.com prizes to get the full list um and if you have any questions please let us know on email or discord with that um i want to just quickly wrap up today by saying uh there's a few more talks that we have going on over the next few hours so uh as you uh may remember from joe's video aztec protocol will be doing a talk at 3 p.m eastern on how to make private swaps work using the aztec protocol then there's also a quiz from the ugp side on just a halloween friday night quiz that will be happening online you can check out all those details again on the website schedule and then kevin and jordan will be giving a talk on how to use the playgrap sdk and making your lives easier by just getting a lot of web video utilities um quickly integrated and available then at 6 00 pm eastern we'll be doing our ideation and brainstorming sessions if you're looking for ideas and are interested in getting some feedback or getting some inspiration to figure out what you want to do for the next week you can join this call and then crypto rachel will be doing a talk on the uni single-sided liquidity poll so check out all these talks in case you were not able to make some of them because of a time zone constraint they will all be recorded with the exception of the brainstorming session so i'll please uh check and watch them later if you if you do miss them with that i want to say happy hacking to all of you thanks for joining us for this opening keynote and uh i wish all 300 of you happy hacking and we'll see you all on discord so let us review any questions and for all of you we're going to ask about the pro apps they will be emailed to you in 14 days if you signed into the tv you will get an email with the claim link so thanks everybody happy hacking and see you all on discord you
