foreign [Applause] [Music] so Charles is working on another data dial side which is uh the LaGrange style so Charles when you're ready I'll feel free to yeah welcome to the stage um and uh yeah feel free to jump into your presentation when you have a second yeah great yeah so yeah one minute yeah so yeah so so I'm from the first one so um we haven't been working on the fried corn storage and um ecosystem for quite a while and um I found exciting recently because we've won the we have a new opportunity for New Opportunities under New Journey to work in towards the um for the data sharing and analystick space for decentralized scientists foreign data in the world they need a really better services so we see like there's a lot of good public data search people on the world of site wide access they want the lower cost computing power they wanted to have a contribution and the social impact because when they do the data uploading the one people know that they actually do something good for the uh Society and also the there was a lot of things on the data but it's not really on Trend so it means that sometimes the link loss the space laws work loss which is uh really important for those precious data and uh and the versioning now is basically is the burial or based on the centralized system and and there was also like um sharing the data is based on Google cloud or AWS Cloud so this is really a huge Market from the graph you see there will be more than 250 petabyte storage of a few years that means that it will be covered the 10 percent or even to 50 uh private storage so which is really means a lot by 5.5 over 18 gigabyte storage on the other side there's a different scientific data they're still holding on some Central storage places looking for storage space so we really want to build a new place and for decentralized science without the borders there are a couple of different places people need us through each and they need um decent incentives so we see like a Enterprise have their data stay in the hard drive we see like a story provider working hard um better storage proven technology we see like developers working hard on retrievals and the token holders they have a fire coin token in hand they really want to encourage the ecosystem because they don't really know how to do that so we need a better places to edit different people in the same cycle so they can contribute to the bigger system a better opportunity to get everybody together so first of all we have we can make the which there was a lot of data sets um you can convert into the data become data schema store on ipfs and also on the farico network previously like we can without fvm we can only do one and a half a year which is 18 months storage but now it's possible to make a extendable long-term contract to satisfy the needs of storage for long term for example 75 data in University maybe you don't really need more than five years 10 years storage so it will be really good opportunity for them to store on FICO now compared to what happened in the past few years on the workspace side we can create a place for people to sharing their data and models and on the payment side the the key proof can be aggregated on the fvm to reduce the gas cost and then increase the volume of the transactions cross-trend payment with fom integration it'll give you more possibilities to make a payment not just in fairy coin but other blockchain users like a polygon and the balance changes also make a payment using the cross chain defray Bridges to enable the storage on fire network but I've already done some work on that but now it's become more easy foreign modeling and Computing kind of working together as well we already noticed that there's a lot of computing power existing in the frag Network for selling storage but um not 100 dedicated ceiling after the storage is onboarded they can also share some of the computing power for the cross chain Computing and it can if we can create a workspace put the data set and the model together and add a paragraph in the same places it can be there was a token economics we needed to be done to sharing the revenue from data provider storage provider data consumer and Computing consumers then we need a effort on the data on boarding and allocate as the dedicated funds for people willing to provide the storage and willing to use the data this is the technical part of the stack so in in order to make a very stronger system we needed to using the smart contract and core services to make the payment uh where you uploaded the data to the frag Network you need a different people to swap the tokens so the external ecosystem they can use in smart contract based on D5 cross chain to using the same storage services at the end you need to give people the capability to meet their data asset as NFD it might be great if it's one click experience instead of writing a whole bunch of code and at the end all the resources in the fragment Network can be contributed to different systems the critical part is about the data governance under the Computing validation so we need a data article um to help proving the data on chain data availability availability and also the data Computing capability so this part is by a dial organization you need a multi-seek wallet to assign the proof on chain so we have done some work on top of that under the help of retaining external adapter and also very quantitative fee ebm this is the data and payment flow so we found that in the new Dow model there are actually new business opportunities um because for existing far plus system uh there was a couple of things like the data provider so the data set owner and the model Creator they are data provider with the fry Compass project they become uh become fair plus deal which will be 10 times more power than 60 sectors the storage provider willing to store them for free even the willing to give them some Revenue sharing and then the general is something confusing why storage the provider sometimes willing to pay for stored kind data it seems like a very um not common in traditional business just because when storage provider started using the data to earn for extra fire coins it becomes a data consumer in business side I actually data consumers pay for everything he needs to pay for the storage he needs to pay for the community and he needs to pay for the boundaries so when student provider trying to get the fireplace gear for storage he is downloading data from the data provider that's why he needed to share the revenue to the data provider it is for the data downloading data is a value that is how it works for today but there's no clear way in the clear Market about how we can do this process automatically and in smart contract away foreign schema and yeah so this is the data schema and the model storage so we'll have a bigger data set for example more than 400 terabytes it will become a chanted to 32 gigabyte data PCS the indexed data should store in your safe place as a data schema and the distributor can be stored on ipfs because people need the index to easily fetch it with the data relationships at the end of the day those data included the data schema needed to backup to very coin it should be back up to five nodes or even more to provide enough redundancy and availability the data space is also on private one because it's a huge amount of size and you can treating the data set Minted as an nft on the data market to show that you are actually a data owner of it and you want to provide the opportunity for others mix the funds together this is one example about from the community using the same methodology to Mint the five point snap shot as a data set so basically like the type of frequently backups of Franklin snapshot put it storage on Franklin Network and create a CSV format Json format data set schema and they mean to the schema as the nft with the smart contract and put it on openc so everybody can fetch the data set schema from the smart contract and because this is really important so it will be the key pointer in the smart contract with the ipfs hash you get the data safely persistent in the network of long term foreign easy we needed to create a space which can join the data provider and the model provided together with the computing power and then the community result backup to strike Network we have done lots of work in the past few years and we have a web stream switch to whatever and worldwide searching all the available storage provider and it gives them education points so we know that who is good for the community to store who is reliable we have a cross chest through it previously already working with the polygon Network and we are planning to migrate to every event evm Franklin work it's really solidly compatible and it can automatically back out the story to five nodes on fried coin ecosystem they also have age Computing nodes come doing the Computing based on the ipfs container hash so now we have course for participants to join the ecosystem doing the revenue sharing so we are as many about 12 to 10 percent Revenue were shared with all the data set uploaders and well we have been contributed in the system for a long time since 2020 and we participants initial one seminar B2 and the fair housing we manage the data so you can see we already have lots of ecosystems projects working on the data and the relative building work now we are going to show some work we have been done already so this is the um system we first using um but as a V1 draft version so we already be able to connect with the five point Malibu system and you can log in with the meta mask to sign saying and you will see yeah your wallet address and your balance of the frycoin and you can credit your data set here according to uh to your need if you want to create a new one you can just add the data set and you have your wallet as the owner you can give the name of our data set of for example B is hello yeah and for the data schema and you can choose the data schema for example I have a data streamer here already you can put the status ID yeah so in future we can catch it and you see here you will create a new data say ID with the content here uh we're still working on the model and the space and the Computing we managed to get as a Computing work here from the tensorflow running all everything yeah and doing all the companion works here and get as a result from other systems foreign so the next step of the work is really like to make every piece is working together Computing Hashi machine learning uh ipf pass integration and create the workers freeze for everybody and the token sharing model with this margin storage we are working on provide people of feeling of storage gigabit bytes of free storage so visual storage is can be connected with the data dial you can use this as a AWS compatible feeling storage and the storage that are used stored on the data will be used backup to ipfs and then back on five nodes and those three providers will share their revenue with you and as a data provider you get a income because your data value when data models start and the computing power slot you again extreme mode value from your machine learning models yeah so that's pretty much about what we are now and we're working toward the next Milestone to bring the computing power online and please follow our us later and if you have any questions you are also welcome to talk to me on Instagram thank you awesome thank you Charles for the presentation and and also for those demos at the end on on what's actually being built um I think really awesome to see and um I mean just this concept of being able to take um just kind of underlying infrastructure and actually make it really easy for for end users to to to you know store files or then eventually do compute and these things it seems like you know really really valuable um effort that that's that's being put into this so uh thank you for that um just see if there's any questions from the the chat uh but it doesn't seem like any of them coming through so far so um maybe just curious on your end like uh if you were you know you yourself you say you've been in the community for a long time and I saw a lot of the hackathons and stuff there if you were going to be building this weekend at the hackathon um what would you be thinking about and what are some of the projects that come to mind that you'd like to see built this weekend yeah so I'm willing to I'm really interesting about the project he like make a usage of the data for example we see in last uh data dub um in hackathons we see people like using the data for the decentralized routing because the CDN Network building on top of the data they're trying to share using the revenue sharing from the data storage and redistributed to other services become a cycle or also interesting to see like people how to do in the governance part for example votings um sharing openings proposals submissions and the central party is something like um we really like to see like people can using apis with fire coin provide value for Access like um mirror we know that the mirror is already using the ipfs and the firecon storage but how can make them use more uh eventually pay more in the future so that will be very interesting topic for us amazing um cool well it totally makes sense um okay great I didn't see uh uh oh there's actually um okay cool somebody asked is there really a connection in between ipfs and nfts um I I guess it might be worth kind of dipping in a little bit closer into how you can kind of use ipfs to be that storage layer behind um nfts yeah I'd really like it we see like an ft stored on ipfs is a variable because but it's the only issues like lots of nfts have IP address content but they don't really tie together and we are just stored right that's just one ipfs how about the ipf content is you know we know that ipf is not incentive to store for a long time yet so have ipfs through each back and foreign like yes my storage is on ipfs and nft so prime minister wage that is how it works right right yeah exactly the kind of nfts right now a lot of them have the content hashes but of course if somebody stops serving that file or the network um stops serving that or whatever even Gateway a lot of people use gateways instead which is even more fragile um then then you know you're nft that at least the content behind it goes away um but then yeah actually having that defined relationship between um filecoin and ipfs and kind of having that guarantee that uh you know Perpetual storage uh is is sort of uh we don't really relaxing Solutions we can have a vvm native Solutions get everything in one system which means mix since ultimately much easier than the cross Chain Solutions definitely very cool um awesome okay well that's all the time we have on our end Charles thank you so much for uh your time and your presentation on uh The Little Garage Tau and uh looking forward to uh having you back on the show at some point and and also feel free to join the Discord and chat with people as they build over the weekend so um yeah thanks for being thank you
