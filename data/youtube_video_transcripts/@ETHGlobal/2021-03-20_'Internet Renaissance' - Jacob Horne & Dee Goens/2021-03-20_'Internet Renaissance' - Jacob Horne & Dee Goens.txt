on uh jacob and d are co-creators of zora and they're going to be talking about the nft paradigm and and inverting the internet um in a talk that's titled crypto media so without further ado please welcome jacob and dee and let's hear more about crypto media let's kick off nft hack and the summit jacob d sweet way here i'm just about to share my screen one sec ooh yo all right can you see my screen you're all good all right brilliant so yeah hi everyone um dna pretty excited to run through this talk and presentation today um we've titled it internet renaissance um so shift away from the crypto media title i guess uh what we want to talk about today is basically like the moment of time we're in in the ecosystem generally um i think nfts uh have like catapulted through into the zeitgeist and kind of having this amazing moment i think what we want to do is like take a step back and kind of talk about like well why why is this moment happening um what is the kind of the history and the state of the internet that has led us to this moment what are nfts as a paradigm why they're important and then crucially like where we think the space is today and where we think it needs to go it's so incredibly early there's still so much left to build um and i think uh yeah we're just excited to go through those details so um yeah just a quick intro on me i'm i'm jacob i'm one of the co-creators of zora um i was previously at coinbase before zoro where i worked with dee and i'll let d introduce himself quickly before we jump in yep dee another one of the co-creators at zora i met jacob while working at coinbase i look after everything kind of artists creators and whatnot at zora so yeah pretty excited to be here thanks for having us sweet okay let's jump in so let me just press next so let's start with the obvious so nfts are undoubtedly a paradigm shift um and specifically their paradigm shift in information ownership so if we think about the internet pre-nfps they've kind of been two dominant systems of information ownership so if you think about the media you create um you know content anything that's being put on the internet there's typically two systems of ownerships that have existed and like kind of defined how we create and share media today one is the copyright system so the legal system that's kind of instituted you know by governments and across across jurisdictions all over the world and copyright is defined by well if i have ownership over this piece of media information i have the right to restrict reuse and distribution and copy paste downloading like all those things um so that's like kind of the think of that as like the fiat information ownership ownership system the kind of second bucket which is obviously related to copyright is platform content and media and information ownership so when you create um a piece of media or a piece of content and you post it onto a platform they that platform is like you know monetizing that information creating value generating value from that um and you know if you're a big enough creator you you may see some flow through from that ownership um but for most of us like everything that we're creating on the internet the value rounds down to zero and the platforms kind of monetize that and essentially have de facto ownership over that media content um instead of us as the creator so the problem with the kind of two predominant information ownership systems is that it's kind of a paradox basically like to generate value from that information you have to restrict access to it so you basically build a platform that essentially functions as a walled garden that world garden is built out of advertising or subscription or pay-per-view and the paradox is that you want to build a walled garden but fit everyone in the world inside of it to maximize the value capture so if you think about like the universe of the internet today we kind of live on these mega platforms these huge wall gardens that bundle everything into a single place so all of the media you create the social graph of people who are creating an interacting community on those platforms and it's those platforms who can benefit the most from owning that content um so our view is that we've never really escaped intranets yeah the the instagrams the tick tocks the youtubes the facebooks the spotifys they're all essentially private networks that take ownership of the media and the content and the information that we create they monetize it better than any of us and then you know we get paid in social currencies like likes or follows and like i said earlier if you're big enough you may get um adsense revenue or a share on the actual dollars generated um and like this is the entire mental model that kind of forms how we think about information ownership like oh for this to generate value we must restrict access to it so nfts there's kind of like two gems of like quotes that i think you should hold in your mind to think about like well what's actually happening with this new value system why are nfts a paradigm shift and a complete inversion of how we think about media ownership so the one on the left your brand in the 80s it calls out like information wants to be free but information also wants to be expensive and that tension will not go away so if you think about that it's like information like we want to share it we want to copy it we want to download it we want to give like we want to distribute it as far and wide as the information wants to go but in the kind of prior paradigm information ownership that is at odds with the fact that well the only way you can generate value is to restrict access a second kind of gem that you should hold in your mind when thinking about nfts is this one by mackenzie walk which she said in 2016 in an s like amazing essay called my collectible ass is the future of collecting may be less than owning the thing that nobody else has and more about owning the thing that everybody else has so it's not about owning the thing that no one has you know you could have a physical artwork that only lives on your wall but what if you own the piece of media that's on a million people's screens it's a very weird way to think about ownership but in practice that is a step towards what is actually happening and enabled by nfts which kind of you know alleviates this you know perpetual tension that has been called out with the prime prior internet which is like well how could we have information that is both universally free and accessible to consume but also be recognized for its inherent value to society and to whoever the creator of that information was so nfts are a paradigm shift because it inverts the way that we think about information ownership and it really like gives us the the best of both worlds for uh information ownership on the internet so by way of example like just to kind of think about like well how this works in practice and if you've been in the nft space for a little bit like you've probably heard this mona lisa analogy a million times but if you think of nfts as something similar to the mona lisa the mona lisa as a as a artifact it is individually ownable but it lives in the public domain so it's universally free for anyone on the planet anyone on the internet to copy remix redistribute print on a poster put on a t-shirt post on instagram and every time that that redistribution or that reproduction is happening that isn't taking value away from the original that's actually making the original mona lisa more valuable because it's becoming more well-known more culturally relevant you know has more override like more notoriety and as a cultural artifact like it proves more value the more widely known it becomes so to kind of like shift the perspective with kind of by this you know visualization and you know crude analogy it's like well what if that same value system now starts to apply to every piece of information media and content on the internet um you know be it memes be it youtube videos instagram posts typefaces websites themselves what if we do now have this like canonical original this provable original that can be individually owned but is now you know universally accessible to the entire internet to be freely shared and copied and distributed built on top of um and that's where nft is going to get us there so you know with the with an nft it's the opposite to copyright or the opposite to how platforms function it's like the more you copy paste the more you share it the more you download it the more it's being displayed the more valuable you're making that original instance um the more valuable you're making that nft so if we think about pre nfts this is kind of how you would can like view most platforms so you have a platform and they're kind of this walled garden that content is bundled within and restricted within and to move it between platforms you'd have to you know copy and paste or duplicate or pirate or download or whatever uh nfts completely flip it so now it's like well you can have a single nft and now any platform on the internet can freely build on top of it so instead of tick tock having a monopoly on the entire content database of tick tock it's like well what if now every single developer on the planet had complete universal access to you know that database like imagine would we have just this singular feed experience that everyone can build on top of or you know what would what would it look like if there are now thousands of websites that can or apps that can start to build and remix and curate all of that content and not just picked up um so that gives you a sense of like the platform inversion that happens because of nfps so nfts are undoubtedly a paradigm shift in our view they're a paradigm shift that's halfway there so the current construction or the ecosystem today is basically we have an amazing ecosystem of galleries or what the nomenclature of marketplaces so there is probably like now 15 to 20 different marketplaces and one of the most con and you know this is all aggregated you know a level below or above however you want to review it by open c but essentially one of the biggest questions that a first-time creator coming into the ecosystem is is like well which marketplace should i meant on and then the problem is that when you meant on a marketplace the the marketplace owns the market you end up becoming bound to that marketplace in a lot of ways you've of course for some of these marketplaces you can take your nft post sale and you can start to move it around but unfortunately like yeah the the value system that accrues there is built and held within the marketplace themselves so the market places charge fees once you kind of like do a primary sale and move it it's like well where does this value capture happen and there isn't that there isn't any interoperability between marketplaces today so we you could have uh anywhere between five or you have as many markets as there are marketplaces on a singular nft so we're kind of finding ourselves in a similar situation to pre-nfp internet which is well okay i now have to like pick which platform i want to bound myself to which i meant on and then occur all the value but there isn't this kind of like interoperability that the technology allows for so the media and the content may be universally accessible but currently we see a marketplace per platform which is kind of like giving us this head fade and you know this the insight is that nfts are bound to marketplaces so for us for zora we started as a marketplace and like we love that model we get to have a strong curatorial sensibility we get to charge a fee on top of everything that's going on and when we were starting to build for nfts we kind of had this awakening which was like well there are amazing nfts on every single one of these marketplaces and it's one thing for us to curate and point to one of those nfts but in what we wanted to do is go like hey this amazingly beautiful artwork on super air wouldn't it be great if we could just point to not only the nft but also the market on zora so we don't have to compete in the zero sum competition for like winning absolutely every single artist what if there was some shared public layer that meant we're all building on the same market and what if that market could be owned by the creator themselves so we kind of ran into this head first we realized ourselves as like oh like the whole reason we're building on this technology is to create a new open and public infrastructure for creators to reclaim ownership of their work and the way that marketplaces function is kind of at odds with that like us ourselves as a world garden we're getting like very early like flashbacks for the early decentralized exchange era so if you remember for those in crypto at the time like there was kind of this first wave of uh order book based decentralized exchanges and they were directionally correct it was like yes there should absolutely be exchanges that are decentralized and protocol based but the early instantiations were a little skeuomorphic it was like well why don't we take the order book model that we see on traditional exchanges like coinbase or nicee or the nasdaq and put that on the blockchain but the result was is you had you know even though it was like this global and open system you still have all of this fragmented and competitive like liquidity so it's very hard to like create this unified system that would allow for liquidity to accrue into a single point and then crucially most of them were not entirely permissionless so you would need to go convince a particular relay or a dex to actually list your token it wasn't a permissionless and public tool there was still this kind of like middleman that you'd have to go through to access the technology so the shift from early decks to something like uniswap really did like three things it was a net new market model that hadn't been seen precrypter um it were it was a model that led to global liquidity so it was like a more effective model instead of seeing fragmentation across all of these different order books it was like well what if you can collapse it all into a single pool and then the third and most important was it was entirely permissionless and completely open for any developer or person on the on the internet to use and start an exchange so for five or ten dollars in gas you could start up an exchange and get the same power out of the box as a developer as you would you know the entirety of something like coinbase or finance which is just a huge paradigm shift and you know so you can get a dex with a couple of lines of code um so for early nft i think we're kind of seeing a similar thing which is it's directionally correct there's no doubt about that like yes there needs to be a market model and a way for value to accrue to the creators and um you know the people who are minting and curating and collecting these nfts but the model again is a little skeuomorphic it's like let's bring auction house put on the blockchain and we're kind of finding ourselves in a similar position there's like a lot of aggregate like fragmented liquidity that has been trying to be aggregated in multiple different places but it's resulting in like okay creators having to mint on 15 different places fragmenting not only the markets for those nfts but their identity across those platforms too and most if not all tend not to be permissionless um so there's different um curatorial standards the most you know marketplaces do not have open source or verified contracts um they're they're not like entirely open tools that developers can build on top of and get the benefit of this like liquidity out of the gate so for us it was like well okay we were to take that same conceptual leap for nfts what would it mean to what would the net new market model be for nfts how would that model enable global liquidity that would open up the ability for any developer or creator to start to easily build on top of this new paradigm and how can we make it entirely permissionless so to speak to the net new market model uh we designed the entire protocol around like well instead of us being a marketplace being a protocol the nft is the marketplace so you know exactly where the market needs to be the amazing thing about nfts is that they have a very unique market structure there is only a it's one to many there is only ever one owner um and there are many people trying to buy so this is very different to say a fungible token which has a many-to-many relationship so while something like uniswap or sushi swap or a model like that may be winner takes most it's very hard for it to be when it takes all because the types of relationships you need between those many too many buyers and sellers means you'll probably still need multiple forms of market for an nft it's very different you the market collapses to a single point at every time you know exactly who the owner is um so the protocol was designed entirely around this notion that's like well let's build the market into the nft itself and let's give that market ownership to the artist to the creator of that nft so when you're minting your nft you're minting the market for it and that market is entirely open for anyone to build on top of it and there are some interesting um design decisions which you can see in the in the docs which we'll link later where it's it's not about the highest bidder so anyone can bid in any currency anyone can bid at any time and you as the owner do not have to accept the highest bidder if you see an anonymous bid for say ten thousand dollars but then a bid from kanye west for five hundred dollars you may be inclined to take the one from kanye west because it could increase the value of your work long term and there is a notion of a creative share and perpetual equity built into this token so you can realize that time so the results of the protocol so one thing to call out is that the way we deployed the protocol was a one-time deployment so zoro protocol we did not build any ability for upgrades um any upgrades would have to be through you know social consensus um which means that the protocol is entirely unstoppable so we can't stop the protocol even if we wanted to anyone can mint on it anyone can interact with the markets it is like by all intents and purposes open public infrastructure that allows you to create these um nfts that can survive outside of the lifetime of any given marketplace or platform um and you know gives it towards permanence as far as you possibly can um so to speak on the the permanence piece basically whenever you mint a token on the zoro protocol you have to mint the content hash the sha256 hash of what that piece of media is uh that hash when you mint it is immutable you can never change it and what that does is it means that if you need to say it's like you initially choose ipfs or rwev or even aws as somewhere to store your media if that file storage solution for whatever reason turns out that you know it goes down or was incorrect or there's a better model you can always the owner can always update the link of that token at any given point in time um and the the the content hash means the public can always verify that that link is pointing to the exact right piece of media at that point if you try and you know but if you buy a token and change the link to a piece of media that is you know not what the nft was minted for it's trivial for the public to compare that to the the signature of of the media and the hash um so yeah but when you're creating on the zora protocol your nfts are entirely platformless so if the zorro.co website you know went down or the team went away the market is still running for it the nft still exists anyone can build on top of it so you don't need our permission to create you know your type of nft it can be literally any form of nfc you can mint and the permanence aspect is like yeah like okay how can we create mechanisms that means that this nft is an artifact can survive for as long as the ethereum blockchain itself which could be decades or you know depending on how optimistic you are on blockchain technology it will the the nfts will last for as long as ethereum itself which could be an extremely long time another point to like uh talk about is the this notion of perpetual equity so if you think about um someone like john michelle basquiat it's like the original his like first painting sold for 200 in the early 80s and you know as the the culture and society like woke up to the beauty and the notoriety of his art that value skyrocketed into the tens of millions hundreds of millions of time um and in the traditional art world resell royalties have been you know tried to be instituted over you know hundreds of years like the france had started uh the resale royalties in the early 1900s but they didn't become commonplace across auction houses so as these works like get bought and sold over time artists would almost entirely miss out on you know earning some of the value that they've created through those works as it changes hands in zoroa protocol you know when you mint you can define well what is the resale royalty that i would like as a creator as this thing is bought and sold in the future so it could be 10 20 literally whatever you want um and that is built into the protocol itself so when you settle on the on the protocol that royalty is is honored by by the market um and our view is is that well instead of seeing 10 or 20 marketplaces that are helping people view and browse and curate and collect experienced there should be millions of these marketplaces so and maybe every website that is uh you know now every website is able to build on top of this universally accessible content media they should have a direct line to the market place themselves um so you know by bringing the market into a single point making it permissionless and open to everyone you know every website can now be a marketplace in some way shape or form um so to like flash back to here it's like i think we can actually get closer to this direction because now we have this public and open layer where now every single one of these platforms if they're starting to curate their own subset of nfts that exist on the protocol and you know one of their community members happens to you know love the meme or love the video or you really love the song if that platform still wants to help that person directly collect and engage with the market within its own website it can it doesn't have to push you out into some other marketplace every website can become a marketplace in essence and we're starting to see this kind of play out you know the zora protocol only went live at the start of this year um and we're already starting to see like these like unique and specific experiences on the protocol so one that launched um a couple of weeks ago is catalog works um so you know they are building an entirely um specific experience to music they want to come at the spotifys and the soundclouds of the world and explore what it means to you know give uh ownership of the music and the value of music back to musicians and it's a very distinct experience that you know you could never do for like this experience wouldn't work for memes perhaps or you know typefaces or whatever type of marketplace you want to see like we should see a very rich diversity of experiences based on the types of entities that are being created and then similarly like uh mirror this um amazing tool for like writing so coming at the mediums and the substance of the world it's like well when you're minting your writing or your blog posts your essays whatever it is like this is also being minted on top of the zora protocol and again it's like a very different experience to to catalog i think like what we're trying to help bootstrap and help teams build over time is like well what are the unique social media experiences marketplaces experiences or niche markets that we can help bring into fruition so if you wanted to build a meme specific auction house then you can do that if you wanted to create a market just for music samples or stems or typefaces or code snippets or 3d objects or you know name any form of information or data or file type you can mint and create a very rich and unique experience um and then you know you can start to integrate and curate across all of these different places because you're built on a shed an open layer um and again like you know we're starting to see like very early examples of what this type of ecosystem looks like we've got radio stations someone built like a tick-tock-based interface on media on the protocol virtual worlds you know interesting text um collectible experiences and then you know we had um someone in the zora community build a zora interface before we even did we deployed the protocol a month before zoro.co went live and you know we saw someone in the community just build their own interface on top of it because everything is completely open which was like a really cool moment for us um so to speak to like some of the things that uh the zora protocol unlocks now that you have these trustless markets it meaningfully unlocks trustless dowels and all of these interesting use cases so if you think about a dao minting azura nft now the dao is directly interacting with and has the opportunity to accept bids so today if you construct the dow and we do this with st fame you like mint and nft because the markets uh kind of on a per marketplace basis you need to figure out how the dow can like interact with that marketplace and in many cases there's just no direct hire to do it now if you mention nfc with the market built in if there's say a bid for a thousand dollars the dow can trustlessly vote to accept that bid um and if it does accept that bid the funds can then trustlessly be put into that dallas treasury or distributed to token holders or can then be used to you know do any collective action with um and these dowels just give you kind of a sense of like you know a visual it's like yeah these dowels can be governed by obviously um a token but they're starting to like manage any amount of nfts and like can trustlessly accrue the value and you know um from the activities around those things so you can see like well what if you have artist collectives that are now collectively minting under a single name or a single collective identity what if you have daos that are now collecting as a community so you can have you know are hip-hop one of the largest like subreddits well what if they were able to pull together capital and they could start commissioning and bidding on and collecting nfts as a as a community and they can choose to vote to then you know accept bids put it up for auction and they can trustlessly then like you know create and accrue that value together and distribute that value um and there's like amazing early examples of this like flamingo but the trustless nature of the protocol now means it's like well it's very simple and straightforward to create an open template that anyone can now start um creating it on a per community basis um which drives us to these very interesting notions of community ownership both for dows that want to collectively create and curate and collect together but also lets you layer community ownership into the platform levels themselves so if you think about the catalogs of the world with their music it's like well if they're facilitating these auctions and curating as a community and curating as a platform it's very easy to programmably route the value capture from those platforms as a community and distribute it to everyone who is you know using those platforms and marketplaces so we we truly think we are entering into an internet renaissance one because we're actually getting a step close to what the internet actually was supposed to be like we're entering like we're exiting this massive intranet era and heading into a world where it's like well anyone can create content that is platformless and can like stand on its own right accruing its own value and is entirely interoperable universally accessible and open to everyone so our view is that the social media platforms as we know it are dead it will take a very long time for them to entirely go away but there are very direct incentives and i think a general want for people to you know we we all know and feel that like well if we're on instagram or youtube like we can kind of feel that it's not entirely our own space or it's like you have to wade through the ads and you know the way that value capture and these platforms uh the way that they they are constructed are just totally at odds with what information wants to be which wants to be free so our view is that the mega platforms are no more and they will be replaced by public permissionless protocols that are open and accessible to everyone not just based not just accessible to the platforms who are kind of constructing these huge wall gardens and that you know there are the other tools for creators and communities to be their own platform and you can be your own or build your own or do whatever you want because you know the starting state or the way to the barrier to entry to now start a valuable platform is so much lower you no longer have to compete and catch up to the entire content database of instagram or tick tock you can now build on top of and start like stand on the shoulders of all of the content and media and now it comes down to like well how do you want to curate how do you want to present and experience all of that content um you no longer have to build and catch up to that content you can just start from there and start to really experiment and create your own rich and unique experiences and that's only possible when you have entirely public and permissionless infrastructure whenever you have uh permissioned or central control the incentives eventually get skewed towards you know defending that value capture mechanism versus if it's public and permissionless by design no one can really stop you or stop anyone from building or creating in the ways that you want or can like change the terms of how you're creating on that infrastructure um so for us it was it was critical that when we deployed the zora protocol it was open source um fully audited twice verified and deployed in a way that was unstoppable so if we ever wanted to do an upgrade to azure v2 we couldn't just flick a switch at the smart contract level and force everyone to upgrade we would have to create an entirely new instance and you know provide the option or the path for people to move across but only if they wanted to zoro v1 will can never be changed upgraded or stopped it'll always live there as an option that is public and accessible to everyone um so yeah if you want to learn more about the sdks and tools that we've built to make it easy to interact with it this is the kind of starting point zoro.engineering we have the white paper the protocol source code links to the github and then a sub graph and you know javascript tools for you to like interact with the protocol also join us in discord so zoro.community um if you just go to that link it'll take you into our discord and we've got channels there where you can learn about the protocol ask developer questions and just interact with the the creative community that's growing there and then to kind of explore everything that's happening across the protocol zoro.co is kind of this general explorer and you know uh open marketplace that is you know letting you interact directly with everything so um that's where you can like see exactly what's being mentioned who's bidding on what you know you can see everything from there um and yeah it's kind of just like a bird's eye view of this of the the way we think about um different parts of the stack that we're building out so there's the protocol itself um the os so the sdk and then of course like the the interface the open source interface and open interface for everyone to like look into and explore everything that's happening across the protocol and our long-term goal and the thing we're driving towards is that you know everyone is interacting with zoro everywhere but or if we if we're just creating a huge mega marketplace that everyone has to go to to mint and share and exchange all of these nfts then we've failed like we want there to be millions of marketplaces that is fundamentally powering the internet itself so the xor is successful when it's everywhere but zoro.com or most views everywhere outside of that um so yeah that is kind of the end um and yeah i don't know if there are questions in the chat or if d you wanted to add some coloring as well but uh yeah it's the start of the internet renaissance no i think that was pretty perfect amazing jacob t thank you so much i'll kind of just ask you to just disable the screen
