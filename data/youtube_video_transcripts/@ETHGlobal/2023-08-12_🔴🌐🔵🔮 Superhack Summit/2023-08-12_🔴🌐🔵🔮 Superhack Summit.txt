foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign good afternoon good evening everybody my name is car take one of the co-founders of beef Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the super hack Summit let's get started this is a summit that's part of the super hack hackathon that's been going on for the last week which ends next week where we have 1100 hackers building all the amazing things they can think of on the op stack and today is about telling all of you what's actually happening in the rest of the op stack and Super Saiyan ecosystem and we can't wait to get started so let's dive right into it today's schedule is going to be these five incredible talks on what is happening in the world of super chains we're going to kick off with our very first talk today which is going to be Carl from oplabs talking about super chains and what everything you need to know is in this world then we'll have Marek from Cello talk about their L2 proposal which is going to be going in depth on what it's going to take for cello to move over to being an L2 on ethereum then James from mode is going to talk about how we can use mode and structure the op stack for hyper growth with how we can set up different incentives uh Jesse who's one of the well contributor number zero for bass is going to be talking about what all chain uh what on chain summer is all about on base and you've kind of seen the incredible growth that they've seen the past couple of days on the launch and we're going to conclude the day with Devin from Unison Foundation talking about what is unit swap on multi-chain world looks like and everything that you need to know about how to think about building applications in that context so that's the schedule jam packed for the next couple of hours to go deep into op stack and we're going to kick us off with our very first talk today right away with Carl talking about super chain 101 so without further Ado please welcome Carl here with me to tell you all about super chants hey Carl hello how's it going it's going great we'll uh we'll let you get started welcome alrighty well I apologize for the semi-false advertising because this is definitely not a 101 this is more like a uh significantly more than one um very very in-depth if you want a real 101 um the Devcon talk is probably the way to go but you know what we are all about getting into the weeds also notably notably some of you might have seen some of this presentation before um because it is on the YouTubes um but I think it'll be a good reflection there's way too much information here um so it's it's a good one but yes no fun allowed this has to be a boring presentation because it's very in the weeds let's go let's do this time's up okay so super chain to the rescue reminder why are we building the super chain well it's to scale because blockchains are so insufficient for the decentralized web that we want to create why is that well because of congestion oh my gosh it's horrible so blockchains don't scale right like we are often paying 15 you know 13 for a transaction it's insane my transaction was just an electric Electronic Arts trying to tweak no not tweet I'm trying to X um and it paid 13 for that transaction no way no way no way so we need scalable infrastructure that is decentralized but can still support the insane amount of traffic and throughput that we you know require and and this isn't new right like this has been a problem from day one this first response to the Bitcoin white paper we very very much need the system but the system that you proposed does not seem to scale sorry Satoshi um we have to make progress on top of it so anyway this has been plaguing the industry since 2008 it's now 2023 goodness gracious let's do this so okay before we like you know get too sad and and cry let's imagine a future because we are very close to that future we are incredibly close um what if things were different it wasn't just crypto wasn't just about you know Meme coins and you know it was also and everyone was happy using it for literally everything all like you know from social media to games to Etc the whole world was running on decentralized infrastructure well you know what would that be like right we can literally abstract away the back end software stick we don't have to worry about what provider we're using because we're using a decentralized network of providers that are all competing on the same internet standards it's like standards for the entire internet's back end so much more composability people can actually work together application developers can work together the boundaries start to dissolve between one application or the other and we don't need to worry as much we can think more about the applications that we're building and not so much just about the infrastructure cost I mean let alone all of the amazing open source software that we would then be using and this is how we turn the into you know the the internet from a Walled Garden you know difficult to hack on and contribute to ecosystem to a vibrant vibrant world and so obviously of course in reality these pictures were going the other direction stop using sunblock fam that's our sponsor um okay anyway no we should we have to oh my gosh I literally need to update these slides with the Twitter on the you can build in this world right like you should be able to build the application Logic for Twitter that is horizontally scalable as a smart contract in a hackathon weekend like that's where we need to be okay so the decentralized web obviously still can be realized we've been working on it for years started out building out east 2.0 like we were trying to Shard ethereum directly then we realized that we needed to build it out in Layer Two which we you know formed plasma group to scale ethereum in that way without having to ask for permission we just implement it and then we realized that not only is there a scalability problem but for optimism we realized there's a public goods funding problem AKA there's no way to build open source software and get uh get rewarded for it so that's that's kind of the transition from plasma group to optimism so anyway but it's not just been us it's not just been us building out this Tech it has been a massive web 3 ecosystem full of developers and tons of incredible contributions talking about Roll-Ups the roll-up Centric ethereum road map and it has allowed us to over time Define the abstraction layers that allow us to scale this software together right in order to really unlock the internet stack we needed to define the stack of software that all worked together the transport layer that you know Etc that all works together to serve the internet we're doing the same thing this time for the decentralized web for the base essentially the stateful decentralized web the first you know web one was kind of stateless so all of these different contributions they've led us to L2 they've let you know shout out to Barry White ad um and we are starting to see the architecture clear and clearer and so that's really what this talk is about it's trying to give you the intuitions around what are the different layers of this stack and how do they all fit together and how all of that comes together to tackle congestion with the super chin let's go super hack pal one two three okay okay so what is the super chain first the basics right scaling to support the internet requires more than one change why is that well because a chain you need to be able to sync the chain download all of the transactions replicate it on your local machine that is a critical property of chain software but if we were to just increase the size of a chain arbitrarily well what happens the blocks get bigger and bigger until my computer explodes and forms a black hole because there's too much information in one place we need to horizontally scale it's a fundamental law of nature um but it's not multi-chain right the super chain is not quite um you know the multi-chain future because multi-chains are ins Vision they each different chain has its own different trust model its own different validator sets so each one adds security risks so as you bridge from chain a to chain B to chain C that is actually a different asset that you fundamentally created versus bridging from chain a directly to chain C so you really can't this is this weakest link security really increases the risk of you know building out cross-chained apps and also deploying chains is super expensive if you have to replicate all of this infrastructure form consensus Etc it is very expensive so we need a system where chains are truly commoditized where we can really make use of them as a fundamental construction on the internet similar to how virtual machines commoditized Hardware anyway it's not monochain it's not multi-chain super chain let's go okay so super chain properties we can kind of go into all of them but I'm not going to really go into that because there's too many words and I like pictures so it's not model change it's a multi-chaining super chain so first up just one one visualization that we can start with is it's all of these different layer twos that share a bridge and share node software so they're all instead of having totally isolated ecosystems they're all using the same standards to communicate with each other and they are all on the same security model using a shared Bridge Okay so it means that means that because all of these op chains are standardized the dapps that are building on them get superpowers because now I don't need to think oh is this going to be compatible with this chain do I need to change my application for that chain no instead you can write our application once and be sure that it is compatible everywhere so you can then build out these abstractions and deploy directly on the super chain so I told you that we were going to be a little different from the stuff you know online that you can find already so this is a bonus this is a bonus section governing the standard Okay so shout out to David standardized open source modules for Layer Two Chains that's the op stack if you like Google it or you you YouTube it um so that makes sense right open source modules make sense right it's all open source MIT license modules it's swappable the you know we broke it out into consensus execution the proofs are modular so you can do ZK proofs optim you know fall proofs Etc but what does it mean to what is standardization really mean in this context because it's actually a little okay it's a little nuanced especially when you're in a decentralized protocol context who defines the standard okay so let's unpack that I I've recently I've recently started to like cats I'm not gonna lie um anyway okay stack right everyone's familiar hopefully so apy stack implements that is the standard right and it implements a shared bridge and consistent client software across all of these different options now notably it is still the case that you can plug different things in or configure it in different ways but the way that you plug in those modules and the modules they are standardized so that you have nice abstractions that you can play with and kind of a shared ground that you can rely on um now how do we think about this further well up the optimism governance optimism Collective governs the op stack you know sets v0 V1 and that boom that expands out to the rest of the client software the shared Bridge so that everyone is upgraded on the same version similar version two everyone is upgraded on the same version all of these just op chains stay in lockstep what does that do well it helps keep a vibrant ecosystem and I'll tell you why so all let's see all of these different op chains okay so first off let's talk about Standard Security what does that do for the security model of these chains well what I talked about before with the multi-chain stuff where you go from chain a to chain B to chain C and that's a different token that you've cut out on chain Z versus Janae to chain C that is not the case because you have this Standard Security across the bridge okay so that's useful that's already useful that means that we're you know not fragmenting uh you know the token standards and all of that stuff but another and very important point is universal tooling now I already mentioned all of these things but I think it's worth repeating so we can gain some intuitions for this stuff so let's say a developer is deploying their smart contract to NLP chain okay great well let's say they now because they are all the same software like all of these op chains is standardized that same deployment works on all of the options and that also goes for the tooling let's say block explorers wallets you know debuggers Etc they all work on the same standard this is the power of standardization more broadly but I'm just trying to really connect it to why we need it in web 3. now it's not just a couple Chains It's a bajillion chains tons and tons of chains what can we do now well we can actually build out abstraction layers so that a developer instead of thinking about the chain that they're deploying to right yes it's compatible with all the chains that's great but now we can actually go one more step meta and say okay we're going to build software that abstracts it away and now I can deploy directly onto the super chain broadly I can think about oh I need to instantiate I need to provision uh this many chains for my application to work right we I need to Auto scale all of those things start to become possible once you're on the same standard you're sharing the same apis you're working together in an open source manner so now the block explorers don't just have to be on approaching basis they can be abstracted and they can be on a super chain basis wallets they can be on a super we can have cert to see super chain wallets emerge that you know that all of these means that have standardized security so you can display the asset and it will doesn't matter which aim it's on or similarly debuggers debug across the super chain send one transaction boom have it affect the whole network so that's the power and I'll just say right now like similar what I said about kubernetes or uh you know containers I'm I'm ready for not just kubernetes I'm ready for supernetties uh you know like let's build out all of this software and obviously it is nowhere near to that today but that's the key power of Open Source now speaking of the key power of Open Source let's talk about Cooperative Innovation let's talk about sharing our Innovations okay so another shout out to to David Hoffman I'm not gonna lie he kind of talked about this analogy for evm equivalence which is exactly the analogy that we use kind of for the op stack and that is the Peloton so the Peloton is like you know when you're you know when you're racing in a bike you kind of break the wind first here right you're you're so it's actually you you use less energy if you're you know riding behind folks who are out in front up this allows everyone to move faster right because they get to trade turns you know this guy's in front and that guy's in front anyway Etc you can look up how Valentines work I don't really know I don't know how to bite um but the cool thing here is that the Peloton is kind of like the standard right it's the open source standard everyone is benefiting they're all working together they don't need to worry so much about upgrades about customizations Etc now boom someone Forks the sack right it's MIT licensed it's open source they change something up maybe another person does the same boom they change something up now they're riding out ahead they are venturing into totally new territory that means that they have the latest and greatest craziest software but they've also incurred a bit of a maintenance burden right they're hitting the wind so what does that what do they do well they ride out in front with their Innovations but then they contribute them back to the stack and now everyone who's in the Peloton is benefiting from that Innovation and we push the industry forward that is what it is all about it's about building out open source software and standards to push the industry forward and that is the beauty of Open Source now what happens what about let's let's you know open source is one thing but open source has had a bit of a struggle and that is that there is not a strong incentive in a decentralized system to contribute back to the you know Upstream to contribute back to the collective really and what does that mean that means that if I build my custom software there's an incentive for me to keep it to myself you know add some kind of proprietary license instead of giving it back to the public good now what do we do for that well obviously optimism is not just about scaling ethereum but it's also about funding public and so retroactive public goods funding let's go so another incredibly cool thing is that the standard also encodes standard ways to give back to op stack contributors and reward them for their incredible contributions that push the stack forward that means that we're not only benefiting from the open source software permissionless Innovation Etc but that permissionless Innovation once it is integrated once it is really caused impact the people who build it get rewarded impact equals profit so this is exactly how you know the this kind of creates this nice flywheel where demand for Block space increases sequence of Revenue and that goes back to the builders and users and importantly how does it go back how is it distributed because that is a non-trivial governance problem well critically it is a citizen's house discretion that means one person one vote we care about people always in balance with the token house and nice checks and balances system the bicameral anyway I can get into that for a long time but I won't the point is that it's all about non-plutocratic governance that is truly decentralized to govern and contribute to the stack so we're making public goods profitable in a non-plutocratic way we're making them sustainable so people so we know that we can rely on the open source infrastructure we're not going to have a heart bleed and we can make sure the internet is decentralized because one of the things that we don't really recognize is that it is incredibly important that the incentives of the system the incentives of the decentralized protocol promote decentralization versus allowing centralized parties to out-compete the decentralized ones all righty so let's do this so we're back we're back we're back that was a nice little bonus right remember building out the super chain they're all standard Deploy on the super chain coming soon now it's been a decade pretty kind of savage how long we've been working on this thing but we are closer than ever and really this is a green field I don't know I did that was a bad uh Windows XP reference anyway it's a green Field Green Field and you can contribute to help this thing become real all right that's governing the standards so architectural foundations this is the thing that I was talking about this is in the weeds the boring stuff let's get into the boring stuff no okay it's all about abstraction layers when things are beautifully done there's usually a well thought out set of abstraction layers so derivation that is the core abstraction layer the most important so this is the process by which the L2 state is determined that means that it is essentially it is a pure function on the L1 chain so you use this derived function boom now it spits out the L2 chain it's a pure function so if I have ethereum that's the ethereum block space now I run this derived function and I get the L2 alrighty so if I send a transaction let's say I'm Alice I send a transaction to ethereum the derived function pure function transforms that it's almost like an index or like a uh you know yeah an index on ethereum boom it now updates the balances in L2 and this continues even if there's nothing happening in the blocks it's still producing L2 blocks now similarly Alice didn't submit to L2 I mean uh L1 directly or can submit to a sequencer which then submits it on her behalf and this you know amortizes the cost of the transaction and also provides her low latency confirmations that derived function happens again boom now we have the L2 because remember the sequencer submitted that transaction to L1 pretty simple okay so let's go over this is an important thing everyone needs to remember this is where we're in MythBusters the sequencer can forge transactions true or false okay well we're gonna see so Alice sends a transaction to the sequencer it's assigned transaction only Alice knows the private key the sequencer changes the recipient of the money of the tokens let's say and now the transaction signature well it's invalid but the sequencer is not done yet the sequencer will submit that transaction to ethereum okay uh oh the sequins are just submitted in an invalid transaction what's going to happen well drive this dry function happens when I'm I'm locally deriving the chain right like this is not necessarily something the sequencer does anyone can derive the chain I spin up a note and I'm driving the chain right remember so I locally derived the chain as I'm deriving the chain I realize that this transaction is a little iffy it has the wrong signature so I'm gonna throw it away boom and I'm going to create an empty block ignoring the invalid transaction myth busted the sequencer cannot Forge transactions that is incredibly important you're meant to model it really must be that the state of L2 is derived and determined objectively based on layer one that is critically important and no one can change that no one if I'm deriving the chain myself no one can make me derive an invalid chain okay so that's deriving one chain but really all roll ups are just different derivation functions on ethereum so there's the L2 chain and it's the function you know it's the it's the result of calling on an L1 chain but they each have a slightly different derivation function okay so you know the red derivation function results in the red chain blue and the blue and purple and the purple if that's purple and they each have their own sequences that are submitting transactions and of course when those transactions are submitted boom now there's new transactions on Layer Two for all of the different layer twos so if I want to submit to you know red chain I can or I can submit to you know uh blue chain and derive that I can do that or let's say I derive purple chain it all works this is why L2 scales by the way because every time I decide to sync a new chain I'm not syncing all the blocks on all of the chains I'm only syncing the chain that I care about this is why we need a super chain this is why the kind of mono chain thing doesn't quite work out okay so now that was that was that was their driving chains but let's go to driving's super chains okay so practically infinite roll of chains what does this do so instead of defining our derived function as just a function of L1 we're going to define the derivation function as an L1 comma the configuration of that chain and make sure that that configuration is of course a standard configuration otherwise the derivation function will throw that results in an L2 chain but notably if you change the config so let's say you change the chain ID now you're deriving a different chain this gives you access to basically an infinite number of chains it's literally it is a standard so you can you know instantly derive all the things it's kind of like looking into a kaleidoscope all of the you know stuff is there but you're just looking at it from different angles and kind of getting a different view of what's going on got it you know gotta have a little trippy imagery in the when you're talking about Infinity it's pretty cool that's that's math for you um okay so you're deriving all of these different chains these Infinity Chains It's not Infinity of course there's limited number of bytes and a half but it's practically infinite okay so that is how we get a bajillion chains all right let's see okay I think I have 15 minutes left if my recall correctly um so let's talk about cross-stream messaging but we'll go reasonably quickly so how do these chains communicate with each other because we talked about how you get the state of a chain but now how did chains talk to each other how do they bridge between each other so Alice and Bob they're they are let's start off what does messaging look like in a normal World Alice sends you know is writing a letter to Bob she has a two and a message and a proof the proof is her signature she goes and she gives it to Moe the male person and can mow the male person gives it over to Bob and he connects the two he uh checks the signature to make sure it's from Alice and then reads the message knowing that it's authenticated well what if I told you that these were actually chains they were chains talking to each other well actually what happens is Mo initiates tells Alice Jane hey I want to bridge my tokens the Bob Jane sends that transaction migration tokens boom now Alice chain has just does the you know does its magic and it generates a message that will go be sent to Bob that we want to send to Bob now but Mo the person who you know initiated the transactions where the analogy breaks down a little bit it's pretty close Mo takes that as well as a proof a proof of the validity of that of that message and sends it over to Bob and Bob validates the two the message and the proof and the proof the message is executed on bobchain right so what we're doing is we're relaying a message and we are proving it now how do we actually how do we actually achieve this well the two is easy the message is easy but the proof is pretty hard to do so what is that how does this actually work in practice and how do all these proof systems work just in general right we're talking about abstraction layers we need to be able to think at a high level and then zoom into each each detail so first we're at the high level how does this work generally well a message is generated on red chain and that wants to be related someone wants it to be relayed on Blue chain well what happens is the two is of course blue chain the message is arbitrary and the proof we'll get to that so how does the proof actually how does blue chain know that red chain actually sent it well because blue chain knows the derivation function of red chain based on its chain ID and chain config what can it do well it can derive that chain in some way boom it derives the chain based on L1 because of course all these chains are connected to derives the chain and then it checks the Authentication authenticity of that message so you might notice a problem right if you were to do this kind of like fully verifying proof it would not scale whatsoever all the chains would be verifying the messages from all the other chains so what do we do well all of these crew systems they somehow manage to compress that proof into a small number of steps whether that be a fault proof or a validity proof they're all running this derivation function in some sense and validating the correctness now the fall proof does it only if you are only if there's an error and a validity proof does it up front you know using using math or some other method so importantly right I've seen that modularity importantly all of these proofs are valid all of these proofs are fine so the op stack it's all about modularity we need to be able to do fall proofs at gestation-based Living Proof zkp validity proofs all that stuff needs to support all proof types so now we can message between them but each message is asynchronous well we don't have time unfortunately to go into sharing sequencing directly but it you know at a high level it's actually very simple basically if you want to be able to send these messages back and forth you need to be able to do them atomically and therefore you need both chains the sequencers on each chain to coordinate and get those messages get a guarantee that both messages will be played on each chain at the same time that shared sequencing and it gives us the ability to do things like flash loans and really tighten up that interoperability and so boom we can coordinate these sequencers and you know there are many different ways to do this okay so now we've got cross chain messaging synchronization but I cannot end this talk without talking about the elephant in the room scaling data availability we still have a bottleneck right if you if you were looking at this system you would notice that we're deriving infinite chains great fantastic but we're only deriving it based on a very limited amount of data that is mean that means that we've only scaled compute we've not scaled data yet that is the data bottleneck um what am I gonna do so what do we need to do well first we can add more L1 data availability so that's the ip44 that is the most key fundamental thing that we that we're shipping actually very soon so very excited for eip4844 additionally in order to horizontally scale at least in the near term we need to do more and that is where the plasma protocol and alternative data availability providers come in plasma remember plasma group we're going back to Our Roots baby okay so plug in additional data availability providers with a plasma API how does that work okay well notably this is not just alt d a uh in like uh in the abstract this is a protocol for coordinating and basically allowing alternative data availability providers to plug into the same unified system so what do they do well we augment L1 data availability instead of taking the raw transaction data what do we do is instead of submitting that to ethereum we hash it and we commit to that raw transaction data and we submit the commitment to ethereum that allows us in the derivation process assuming the data is available to pull in all of this information and validate it against the ethereum total ordering of transactions and that also allows us to plug in multiple different data availability providers all submitting their own commitments in a standard format and process that means that we've gotten all of these we've horizontally scaled data availability providers which means that we've got infinite chains which can meet infinite data very exciting so this is how you get you know close enough to Infinity uh scalability obviously it's easier said than that but importantly the data availability provider may break and this is what makes it a plasma as opposed to those two so the data if the data that was committed to on ethereum becomes unavailable what do we do well we can do a data availability challenge now notably these are subjective they cannot be penalized directly on ethereum ethereum doesn't know who's right or if the data available is available or not it's off-chain data but users can submit this data availability Challenge and then withdraw from the chain so how does it how does that work well Alice says give me the data and tells ethereum to give me the data now either one of two things happen either the data is revealed aka the data availability availability provider posted or the commitment is deleted from ethereum and is therefore ignored from the total ordering of transactions that is directly available on L1 so and that is all all done in this derivation process that we talked about before um it is not any different and so this also by the way just as a note that means that if you if we build out the right abstractions then the proofs that are going to work for that work for Roll-Ups roll-up chains also work for plasma chains now notably plasma chains are fundamentally less secure than Roll-Ups there is no way to get the same level of uh security uh for your data as posting it directly to ethereum but it does mean that even if the date availability provider is you know goes offline you don't lose safety you won't lose you'll lose access to the data for a short period of time but you can always get that data with a data availability challenge so not too bad um great so these are the two things right roll up all data on L1 secure and expensive plasma commitments to data on L1 less secure but nearly free very exciting infinite chains chain messaging synchronization infinite data that is how we create the super chain let's go alrighty oh no it's congestion what are we gonna do pow knocked him out we're done we are in that world that we believe in that we know we can create the decentralized world and it was created because of folks like you contributing to the op stackers folks like me we're all doing it together it's one happy party of Open Source software notably this is all not actually here yet however we're still building it right we're still building it we know that the concepts are there right this is what I just talked about is a culmination of an enormous enormous amount of research that has been done in the ethereum and elsewhere communities finally ready to be implemented in open source license software for the community for the world public goods forever so to infinity and beyond right we are so close we can see that incredible future ahead of us we are getting there we will then we it will get there with all of that public goods funding generating Revenue with this open source software that goes back to the contributors that built it very exciting together we can build the open source internet and realize ethers Phoenix impact equals profit the earlier you start building public goods the more profitable uh they'll be because the more impact you can have because we are currently in a state of honestly a little bit of Crisis not to scare you but like we're very unclear if decentralization on the Internet is going to win hopefully it does for everyone's sake because we're humans and we want the internet to be human first so that's how we create the super chain which burns the collective come contribute welcome to the collective because you're already in did I tell you anyway stay optimistic thank you [Music] I actually didn't get the questions I I'm sorry y'all finally um we actually have a couple minutes uh so uh see if anybody in the audience wants to ask any questions feel free to send them in the chat and we'll relay them here uh we do have one question right now which is kind of from what you just talked about uh in the last couple slides the question is around the incentives for actors uh to challenge uh if the data is available and then kind of how do you think about the economics of all that hey Sick okay great so basically the problem is that this is the fisherman's dilemma so if you want to look up the problems with it this is why we don't do data availability challenges for L1 but there's a really nice property on L2 with data availability providers so the who pays who pays for the data that question well it is the person who wants the data pays for the data itself because we can't figure out if the person who is asking for the data is asking for it because it is genuinely uh not available or just because they're trolling the data availability provided so there's an interesting catch though it might not be attributable on L1 but it is subjectively attributable on L2 for the person who's submitting the challenge so I know if I'm just griefing the data availability provider we need to protect against that that's why the person who submits pays the bond but if I am a user of a date availability provider and they go Rogue I submit the challenge and I get off of that data availability provider and migrate to a new one so that is actually how we can remain secure and also you know kind of get around the trickiness of the fisherman's dilemma again this doesn't negate the need for Roll-Ups Roll-Ups have this incredible Unstoppable property that Plasma's just fundamentally cannot because of the fisherman's dilemma awesome um hopefully Laura your question got answered uh if uh just any follow-ups or to put that in chat we'll relay that to Carl but that was an amazing Talk Carl thank you so much for that amazing 201 primer and uh looking forward to seeing more on the super Channel sick all right thank you all right next up we have Mark to talk about Cello's transition to an ethereum L2 and we wanted to make sure this is more in depth around what you can look forward to so instead of just talking about high level what's happening we're going to actually talk about the specifics on how do we actually make affordable transactions happen so without further Ado let's welcome Mark here on on camera and we'll have to get started thanks very much it's really great to be here um okay I'm just gonna bring up my slides cool be good to go how are you guys doing today ah cool well um once again it's really great to be here um my name is Mary koshepskin one of the co-founders of fellow um and um I challenge myself and this year to do all my presentations using emojis so you're going to see a lot of emojis here today and if you like the format definitely let me know on Twitter I'm at Merrick underscore uh and then likewise if you have any questions or any follow-ups definitely do not hesitate to reach out um and so um you know I just wanted to start um I don't know if there's a chat here or not but sometimes it's nice just to kind of uh start with a bit of interaction um uh I like to ask you know just how many people here um either are regularly using web3 products themselves or you know have friends who might be normies who are using them um looks like folks are watching on YouTube so it's a little hard to kind of provide feedback um that's okay because you know I've asked this question in conference in-person conferences and typically uh or actually every time the answer is very very few people are actually raising their hands um you know on the order of maybe five percent or so and that makes vitalik uh sad I would say uh shown here in the form of a sad cat Emoji because you know why not um and it's a real shame because you know I think this is the future that we want right like we want millions and millions and billions of people streaming into the house of uh web3 or I don't know uh the the Best Buy of web3 uh here on a Black Friday um but it's sadly not the reality that we have today the current reality looks a little bit more like this you know there's just a few of us running around in like a really exciting Bed Bath and Beyond we get to have all the fun um but others are sadly not having that fun um and you know luckily um you know a big part of why we don't have a lot of normies uh using uh webview platforms is around scalability and of course ethereum has a really exciting roll-up based scalability um road map and you know we're super excited uh to be part of that um with kind of the transition um from an L1 to an L2 which we've started talking about over the last couple of weeks and so before we get into kind of the L2 design and what we're doing there and why we think it's super exciting um I wanted to just share a few slides about what cello is today in case you're new to it um and I think first and foremost you know not surprisingly cello is a fully evm compatible network it's currently a proof of stake Network um and it's a proof of stake layer one it's been around for three years it's been running really well it's only had one um uh production incident um and so it's definitely been hardened I would say over those three years uh and it's a really elegant prophecy consensus protocol with a lot of scalability and a lot of decentralization but I think the thing that makes cello unique is really its focus on ease of use um from the get-go we built cello thinking about what would it take for people to build daps on top of cello that were just easy to use uh for anyone in the world and that that meant really great Mobile support yeah cello has a really amazing ZK Stark base like client it has this protocol called social connect that we'll talk about a little bit at the very end which lets you send value to phone numbers um it has all of these really nice mobile features and a lot of really exciting and big popular dapps on cello are in fact built in in a mobile Source manner um to be really good for ease of use I think you need things like gas abstraction and so from the beginning Stella has supported paying for gas with tokens natively using eoa addresses so without uh the need for even account abstraction um and and that's uh really really amazing uh and then to top it off uh seller was the first Network to um offset its uh CO2 emissions programmatically using block rewards and so that's just a really nice cherry on top uh and you know because of that um first of all other networks have followed which we're really excited about but uh but also cello has become kind of like a home for refi projects there's just a lot of refi happening on cello which is really cool um and one of the really nice things about focusing on ease of use is that it enables a lot of real world use case type applications uh to be built on top of cello and one thing that's really nice about real world use cases is that they aren't really tied to um the crypto Cycles um so there's a lot of folks building payment products Community currencies micro lending products earning projects where you can earn on your phone using earn micro credits on your phone um and then also Universal basic income projects and all of these are not really tied to kind of bears and bull markets um and and so that means that you know um they've been able to actually grow quite nicely um even in this in this bear market and you don't have to take kind of my word for it you know all of this is uh visible now on Dune um and this is kind of what the active addresses look like on cello which is pretty cool to see a lot of growth since March of this year uh which is just um unusual I would say in this market um and uh nanson has a really cool table that shows kind of compares the chains that they're tracking and if you look at last month you look at the last six months uh the active address changes on on cello are are higher than any other chain and then some tracks and I think if you look at the current data we've also overtaken Phantom which is really cool to see okay so that's just what cello is hopefully we're now all on the same page but we're here really to talk about the the L2 road map for cello um and so I wanted to kind of dive into into that right now and you know one of the interesting things about uh creating or transitioning an L1 to an L2 is that you end up with some constraints that I think are are different um input and you know a little challenging I would say you know compared to if you're just launching a new uh L2 from uh from scratch um and so what do those challenges look like uh I would say there's two really major ones uh the first uh is around um uh throughput and transaction costs um and this is hence the the title of the talk uh on cello you know because we have a very scalable consensus protocol we can process a lot of transactions per second uh which means that gas fees are very very low on cello and that's attracted a lot of applications that that require really low gas fees right like those payment applications where people are sending stable coins around to each other um or um the micro lending um dapps which you know are most useful in Emerging Markets where people are more price sensitive um and then also just Community currencies any any time that people are using crypto rails for medium medium of exchange use cases um people tend to be a little bit more sensitive around fees than uh than elsewhere and so um we have a lot of those use cases on cello and it's difficult for us to transition to an L2 and then suddenly you know uh increase gas fees to the order of tens of cents because we need to store transaction data on on ethereum and so the solution for this problem um is to to use eigenlayer um so eigenlayer for those of you if you're not familiar with it it's a really interesting restaking protocol on ethereum that effectively allows ethereum validators to opt into running additional services uh eigenler likes to talk about this uh as creating a Marketplace for trust so if you think of each ethereum validator as kind of uh an operator on or an actor in the network that offers some degree of trust right that they're gonna validate uh the blockchain correctly um then eigenlayer effectively allows people to tap into that trust and purchase additional trust for their services uh and since there's a ton of ethereum validators right there's a lot of trust there that can be tapped into which is really really exciting um and you know one of the very first um apps or middlewares as as eigenlayer is calling them um to to um to be launched on on eigenlayer is kind of this Flagship middleware that the team eigenair team themselves are building which we're calling eigen Da and so eigenva is effectively bringing um dank sharding to uh to ethereum um potentially one or two years ahead of when tank sharding will will actually roll out um and that's really exciting because dank sharding for those of you who have been following it effectively is a much much more bandwidth um favorable way of doing data availability it turns out that data availability even in a decentralized network is an embarrassingly parallel problem uh it's only hard if you can pair it with consensus so if you only do data availability then you can actually do it for significantly cheaper um then you know it is to for example pay for data availability on ethereum on the L1 today um so that's exciting it allows us to you know really dramatically lower the costs of L2 transactions um and then Challenge number two um and then of course by lowering those costs you're also able to increase the throughput of the of the L2 as well which which is also really really important uh Challenge number two is you know Stella has a lot of node operators a lot of validators a lot of full nodes um and you know it'd be a real shame to um just give all that up and move towards kind of a single sequencer um it really feels like it'd be a step backwards now of course I think many uh uh l2s today um are looking at ways to run their sequencers across multiple nodes um but you know alas we're not there yet as as a whole industry um and so one thing that we're excited to to do is to kind of contribute to the Future by effectively taking our you know production ready consensus protocol that that again I mentioned has been running live for three years and turn it into a decentralized sequencer and really make it a public good that you know any anybody can also use to decentralize their L2 as well um and then Challenge number three um and for those of you who've been following very closely you may remember I said there were only two challenges uh that we thought of at first but you know alas nothing is that simple uh as we were looking into this we learned that there are actually um additional things that we have to worry about and this kind of additional challenge is third challenge uh really is one around finality um so cello has offered one block finality since the network launched three years ago um and many LTS today they um they don't offer that same uh one block finality um and it's primarily for two reasons um I think uh it's um you can have reorgs that happen on the L2 side but you can also have bjorks that can happen on the L1 side that can affect the altitude state and so in in the design that we put together um we address both of these um the first is on the L2 front um since cello already has some economic security that guarantees this one block finality rule using slashing for qualification uh it's possible for us to to reuse this and make it so that um validators today or decentralized sequencers tomorrow I won't have to um uh well we'll be punished if they ever uh cause a reorg and so that gives us some economic security again on the L2 front you won't have reorgs um and then the other uh idea is around uh slowing down deposits and forced transactions a little bit uh so that they are only executed on the L2 side uh once you get finality on the L1 side um and this has you know the downside that it makes kind of bridging just a tiny bit slower but on the flip side you end up having uh this resilience uh anytime the L1 reorgs uh you won't have to reorg as well um and so what does all of this look like together um I created this little example um demo here that I wanted to run through I think this makes it a lot easier to kind of understand what the design of this looks like uh we have um three main actors and then the ethereum chain so we have the decentralized sequencers on the left you have the eigen DNA nodes in the middle uh and then you have the L2 full nodes on the right and then we have kind of all of ethereum uh down in the bottom and so as with any chain um you know the first step is to effectively collect a bundle of transactions uh that have been gossiped throughout the network um and in this case uh the leader in the bft consensus uh that makes up kind of the consensus protocol um that these decentralized sequencers are using kind of the elected leader um which changes for every every slot basically proposes a set of transactions that will constitute the next the transactions that go into the next block and so it will then gossip that around to all the other um sequencers and then using bft consensus which is a multi-step protocol that I'll just simplify it into one step uh eventually this leader will get back a aggregated multi-signature of all of the signatures of all of these decentralized sequencers and the bit vectors so you have accountability uh that shows who who assigned that particular bundle of transactions um and once you have this you know then you know that for the slot height you know the decentralized sequencers have committed to this set of transactions and so we're ready to kind of post that to eigenda um eigenda will then uh return an eigenva certificate which is also a multi-signature threshold-based signature um and uh and then the leader uh will then have everything it needs to put um to effectively commit this transaction bundle to ethereum and it does that just by you know posting the eigenva certificate to ethereum um once that is on ethereum then any full node that's interested in following the L2 chain it can download that certificate it can use that certificate to get the data from the data availability um layer by querying eigen da that gives it the transaction bundle and multi-signature and the bit Factor um and from that it had each of these full nodes have everything they need to effectively derive the L2 block um and so they can they can do that here once they derive it they can execute them and um and they're Off to the Races um and so this is really nice and elegant and pretty simple um but um you know there is some latency to having to go through ethereum in this way and one thing that op stack and optimism does that's really really nice is that they have this concept of um a network an LT Network where you can gossip around uh what are deemed unsafe blocks so that full nodes can kind of follow the network a little bit faster with a little bit less latency um and so that uh that's something that this kind of design um is is compatible with um with the one caveat and you know this is true in in op stack in optimism as well um sometimes you may find that um what you pull from ethereum later on will not match what uh was it gossiped around before um and so in the case of in most l2s today you know that will cause a reorg and you know you have to reorg because I think the ethereum uh view of things is is the final View and it takes precedence over everything else and so the best we can do um to avoid those reorgs is to effectively make it economically very very expensive uh for um nodes to to effectively equivocate across both of these different paths and the way we do that is by um um right and so uh if if you don't do that you don't have unblocked finality but bring back one block finality the way we solve this is is by adding slashing for equivocation in this way and because we have the bid Vector we can also see exactly who are convocated across these two different blocks and then we can we can slash just just those validators and this is something that we have today already in the L1 uh and so it's actually quite easy for us to bring this over to the L2 design because all the code is already written and it's been in production for three years and it's really nice because it it effectively makes it very economically expensive to equivocate to the point where you know nobody on the seller network has has done that since the network has launched for three years so this is really nice and so um maybe just summarize this design gives you scalability and low gas fees by leveraging eigenva eigenda um as I mentioned is kind of bringing the the design of dank shotting to ethereum um many years before uh dang sharding will be rolled out um and it's still run by ethereum validators and so it still offers really nice trust assumptions and because it uh uses that [Music] um Bank sharding like design um it's it's effectively allows you to to cut the transaction costs on the LT Side by 95 which is which is really really nice um we of course also get to maintain the current level of decentralization um offered by cello uh which is just really nice for increased uptime and for better censorship resistance um and then finally um you know we worked really hard to to also keep the one block finality design that cello offers uh which you know does come at the cost of a slightly slower native bridge but ends up having a much better ux and you know we've started chatting with eigenlayer as well about how we could add additional Economic Security here this design only offers cello Economic Security uh to enforce this one block finality but you can actually go a step further and also opt into uh restaking nodes that can add additional Economic Security um and uh and ultimately I think this makes so potentially like a really nice place to to roll up to if you're building an L3 uh because you get um you know these short block times this kind of nice guarantee about not having to reorg um not to mention the the cheap data availability that you effectively inherit through the cheap transaction fees um so yeah so that's the that's the design uh you might be curious uh you know what the timing is and what's next um and so you know we just posted this um design in a very detailed proposal uh to sell a governance um just at the start of ECC which was you know just a few weeks ago um since then we've gotten you know just an incredible amount of really amazing feedback and just a lot of I would say excitement for this direction uh it's been um pretty cool to see you know other L ones now also kind of following suit and uh talking about making a similar change and so I think in the future we're going to see you know ultimately this um large amount of maybe coalescing around ethereum which I think is you know really again amazing for the ethereum scalability roadmap and I think ultimately just really great for users as well um and you know we're just excited to be at the Forefront of that uh since the proposal went out we also had a temperature check governance vote on it which um uh passed um with just a ridiculous amount of um I guess um folks in favor of it uh and so that was really really cool to see as well so generally the cellular ecosystem is excited about this um and so that that means that you know now the hard work begins um and you know of course it wasn't easy coming up with that architecture and that design we spent a lot of time uh working on it before making the proposal but but now we're working hard to turn that into uh into an actual um deliverable that we can use to then upgrade the network um but you know when it comes to folks here you know especially developers who are participating kind of in the hackathon uh this weekend um you might be wondering what this means for you uh and there you know the good news is that um beyond all the benefits that will come from this you know the increased alignment with ethereum the um better bridging uh better security um all of those things all of those things will effectively come for free because this will be hard forked into the network um again assuming that the folks running the actual solo Network are excited about the final deliverable but it seems like that's the case based on the governance vote um you know this will ultimately be uh deployed through two hard Forks that will upgrade solo and transition over to to the South too uh and hard Forks um just like on other networks um are very non-disruptive for people building the apps on top of the network and so that means that you can effectively start building on Salah today and start benefiting from this future design and from you know all of the amazing features that sell offers today um and uh since you know I had a lot of time for this talk um I thought maybe it would make sense to just spend a few moments talking about some of these cool features that are available today and you know what you might be able to um to do on cello both today and tomorrow um but before I get into that you know I think research shows that people's attention spent and so Wayne after 25 minutes most people you know just naturally need a little bit of a break and so I just wanted to to do like a one minute intermission uh and so if you've been walk watching a lot of talks and you know I just needed a breather now's a good time just to yeah grab a drink maybe take a deep breath maybe stand up um and we'll get started in just 30 seconds I'm gonna take a drink as well awesome so hopefully you had a moment to um just take a deep breath maybe get some water stand up and uh yeah be ready for the next part of this talk it's gonna be much quicker than the first part uh it's just a few more slides to go um but you know I thought um frequently when when chatting with Builders people are always very interested in learning about what what's different what what can I do that's uniquely available on Stella that I can't do elsewhere and so I thought it would be nice just to have a few slides to cover that um and so there'll be three of these um cool things there's actually many more but um it's just you know too much to go through in any one talk but um I would say the very first cool thing that that you may want to experiment with today on solo if you're building kind of a hackathon project um is going to sell those native gas abstraction that I mentioned before um so again you can pay for gas with tokens on cello these tokens have to be allowed listed through on-ching governance and right now there's three tokens that are available um a US dollar stable coin a Euro uh stable coin and a Brazilian real stable coin I think there's about five additional stable coins uh and actually some non-stable kind of Gap um uh um currencies as well uh that are going through uh governance right now they're at various different stages of going through governance uh and so this list will expand pretty quickly but even just for the current assets today one of the really nice things about being building the apps that support paying for gas with ease is you know you can build use cases like payment use cases where you can send the stablecoin to someone it can be a completely new wallet and you never have to worry about them having to figure out how to go get gas uh money to then be able to send it on to someone else and so you'll never have that really frustrating feeling where you know I'm sure folks here have you know sent usdc either to themselves or to someone else you know through a new wallet and then only to realize that those funds are kind of stuck until until you're able to get some eth over to the address um and so if you're interested in experimenting with this um I would say VM is probably one of the the best ways to to play around with this VM for those of you if you're not familiar with it it's kind of a um uh typescript focused alternative to either web3.js or to ether's JS uh it's it's created by the the folks who built wagney it's really quite elegant um and they have now native support for paying for gas with tokens on cello in their transaction objects so this is really cool uh if you're interested in playing around with this learning a little bit more uh the PM who who worked on this he gave a ECC talk a few weeks ago and he has a nice GitHub repo with the slides to his talk and with some demos of this that you can find over at I think his account is 0x Arthur XYZ and then he has this ECC presentation repo so definitely check that out second cool thing is around address abstractions this is a little different than account abstraction cello has since the beginning made it possible for people to send payments to phone numbers and in effect map phone numbers and other social identifiers to wallet addresses um and this enables you to create some really really cool experiences um the the current incarnation of this offering is called social connect um and um you can use social connect to effectively build apps to let you send uh cryptocurrency to phone numbers instead of to wallet um to address sorry publicly derived addresses like the ones that are you know uh plaguing all of us in crypto today um and so this is really really neat um it actually does this in a privacy preserving manner which is really cool it uses some really elegant multi-party computation to do that um and so it's it's a really really cool design and you know you can build apps to let you send value to phone numbers even before the recipient creates a wallet but you can also just build apps that that tap into kind of this data and effectively allow you to tap into what you know I believe is the biggest social graph in the world which is kind of the amalgamation of everyone's contact lists on everyone's mobile phone so this is arguably bigger than kind of the the Facebook social network uh so definitely check that out uh you can learn more just by going to socialconnect.dev uh it's it's really neat um of course seller also supports account abstraction with 4337 and there's a whole bunch of um API providers offer that too and so if you're excited about account abstraction definitely uh definitely check out solo as well but um and you can pair that with with address abstraction as well to build some really amazing experiences and then finally uh and this is the final kind of set of slides um the third really neat thing um that that I think it's pretty exciting um is something that we're calling wallet shortcuts um now it's really hard to create a series of emojis to represent shortcuts so this was the best I could do uh uh and um shortcuts are a feature now being offered by velora which which is kind of a flagship wallet on solo it's funded by some really incredible investors including um um polychain and recent and um SV Angel as well um and um you can learn more about velora at valora.xyz um think of it as kind of a wallet designed for uh for normies we try to make things as easy as possible um for for all the users leveraging all of the like awesome features that sella has to offer uh but one thing that um ballora's been doing now is um you know velor supports has an adapt browser you can you know connect your wallet to the apps and interact with all of these amazing mobile apps and seller with it but a lot of Builders who are building these daps they they're excited about offering tighter Integrations with the wallet uh ways to make it possible for people to interact with their dapps without having to go and load the DAP browser and load a web page and everything and so shortcuts um and and generally hooks in velora are a nice way to do that you can use hooks to help velora figure out how to price your asset you can use hooks to help Laura figure out how to price dap positions so if you have an LP token it's a position for something and you want to price that you can do that and then finally you can build these shortcuts that effectively allow your users to interact with your dapps with just one tap natively in the wallet without having to leave the wallet and go to go to your dapps web page um so you know obviously really useful for claiming rewards but generally you can use these to kind of push people through the life cycle of your product one step at a time um and you know valora is working to also make it possible for you to send push notifications to your users to kind of guide them through through that step through those steps and so if this is interesting if you're if you built a Dap and you're trying to get more engagement with your users you're trying to find ways to to make it easier for people to go through the funnel of all the operations that you want them to do without having to necessarily load your Dap You can just do it directly in this popular wallet shortcuts might be for you and you can learn more about that at docs.lore.xyz um overview um so I think that's everything I had and I think that brings me pretty close to time um yeah thank you so much really really appreciate uh you guys listening and and I'm not sure if it's possible to take questions in this format but uh if so I I have five minutes left and happy to answer anything that's on anyone's mind hey thanks again for all your time jumping in for Karthik um but yeah thanks thanks for the presentation and for being a part of this um I did ask if there's anybody who has questions in the chat so if they kind of ask any questions I'll surface them here um I mean one of my questions uh around this presentation was just sort of understanding how you sort of made the decision and maybe just your decision Matrix around you know ethereum versus not trans transitioning to ethereum within the ethereum ecosystem like choosing um the op stack versus kind of all the other opportunities out there um there's a lot of great stuff happening all over the web3 ecosystem um and would love to just kind of hear a little bit more color around how you're thinking about um op stack versus other opportunities and and uh and what you consider yeah it's a really great question um yes I think the ethereum um decision was a no-brainer for us um Stella's origin story was actually you know we tried to build um that wallet that I just shared velora and we tried to build it on top of ethereum five years ago we wanted to build basically a global venmo global cash app global revolute accessible to anyone in the world uh and not surprisingly you know back then it was it was difficult to build that on top of ethereum and make it easy enough to use for anyone in the world especially if you wanted to also make it decentralized and connect with the like client and everything um and so that took us down the path of uh working on cello but you know in our mind we we were always part of an extension of the ethereum ecosystem uh we were just kind of the mobile real world use case uh extension to the ethereum ecosystem and back then there was no other way to really accomplish what we wanted to do without you know launching our own ebm compatible uh layer one but you know times have changed and you know ethereum has this incredible scalability uh road map that that uses Roll-Ups um and it just made sense for us to um to you know propose to the community to transition into an L2 uh to be part of that road map and almost to have you know this kind of coming home moment right like uh coming back into the fold so to speak um and we were just really excited to see that you know the whole ecosystem was very very excited about about the direction and we saw the all right just how many people voted yes on the proposal and I think also the ethereum ecosystem um has been um you know just really amazing about about um celebrating this as well um so that's on on ethereum why op stack I think that's also a great question you know I think op stack it has a really nice modular design that um I think really fits our needs really well because it um you know as we talked about there's a few things uh that we uh are working on that are different from other l2s that we think are important for uh seller users uh and and the op stack code base just is very uh amenable to um to um making those changes um so I think that's um yeah that's that's part of it you know we're obviously very excited about about the broader kind of op Network and we have developers who are actually started off on cello and have been building um uh Bedrock that we're close to and we just generally like you know the folks in the op stack ecosystem and so uh I think that's another a big part of it um uh I will add that since making the proposal we've actually had a lot of inbound from a ton of um you know really great projects in the ethereum ecosystem that are um I think offering to collaborate and you know find uh ways to potentially speed up the deployment of of this um that that was I think a surprise but um certainly you know a welcome surprise and so um it's just been really interesting having those conversations now as well amazing yeah it's been great to see how much support the proposals got overall it seems almost I can you can almost call it unanimous I would say based on the vote and um yeah and I mean I even saw that you know vitalik jumped in with some questions on the proposal as well uh lots of Interest lots of support um really excited for uh the work that you are doing and the work that you presented here um and excited to see that will roll out um back on top of ethereum let's make it happen amazing well thanks so much for your time really appreciate it and uh yeah have a great rest of your day have a great weekend and uh I'm gonna move on to uh the next stop now awesome likewise it was thanks for having me have a great weekend everyone awesome cool thank you again um Mark for jumping on with us uh and chatting about uh salo's out to proposal um really excited uh that we had a time to kind of share uh that proposal in depth uh and learn a little bit more um jumping into our next chat uh we're gonna be welcoming James um for everybody who's not aware mode just went live uh in the last week or so so this is uh op stack hot off the presses um so we're really excited to have James join us in just a minute here um to chat about the work that they're doing at mode um so we've got James here so I'll add them into the chat but yeah welcome James uh to chat about uh mode and the work that you guys are doing uh on the op stack with them pleasure how's it going everyone going well awesome hand it off to you perfect so yeah thanks for having me I'm James I'm the founder of mode and I'm going to tell you a little bit about mode I'm sure some of you already been hacking on it which is awesome um yeah we can get a little bit deeper into it today so mode is an OP stack L2 designed for hyper growth what does that mean that means that we're trying to design a blockchain ecosystem that directly rewards users developers and protocols that grow the network so there's typo there it's built an OP stack for easy application development there's growth mechanics implemented a protocol and product level I'm going to go through that there's Network sequencer profit distribution as well through contract secure Revenue which I'm going to explain and it's been launched by a team of growth experts um who have built some of the largest blockchain communities and ecosystems in the past so let's go so mode is kind of found on the principle but right now blogspace is very much commoditized um there is essentially a lot of blog space and there isn't enough applications there isn't enough growth in the application and user layer to fill that blog space so for the average person using a Blog chain or using an L2 especially it works quite well okay fees could be lower there are certain optimizations those should happen but it works quite well um so the real challenge now is not in incremental Tech improvements it's in building ecosystems that have deep liquidity clear incentives for developers and applications and can bring applications that have product Market fit and a growing user base what we've seen are mode is that a lot of ecosystems have launched recently they've done a very good job of Building Technology but they haven't effectively allocated resources to solve the challenges that need to help L2 is an ethereum scale um so that's what we're trying to focus on how do we design a blockchain an ecosystem that helps yeah helps everything grow and ethereum grow so yeah as mentioned Mode's been designed by a team responsible for bringing thousands of developers millions of users to web3 and kind of three of the key elements of mode of three of the key things that we're focusing on mode is efficient incentives resource allocation integrated growth tooling to scale apps and enabling developers success so let's dig into those so right now um l2s are earning considerable profits um I tweeted this out I think yesterday or the day before and we've got quite a few views quite a lot of discussion um it's the profits from July from arbitrary optimism CK sync so you can see that they're all pretty profitable um the profits come from the network sequencer which takes transactions rolls them up and sends them to their one about half of the transaction fee maybe sixty percent that you pay on art from optimism um is going to the L1 gas costs and the other half is Network profit so these profits currently go to different places for decentralized networks they usually go to the Dow for projects which are backed by companies they'll go to the company that's running the sequencer um One Core principle of mode is that we believe the sequence of fees or sequence of profits should be distributed to those who grow the network especially the developers that grow the network and we think they should directly be distributed not through a dow and not through a company the reason is I know a lot of people have probably applied for Grants from Dallas um it can be sometimes they work well they're very effective at allocating resources sometimes governance can be slow cumbersome it can take a long time to um get paid out or get uh get resources to build and then centralized companies it's often not the best idea that you know we're completely relying on centralized companies holding large amounts of money so let's dig into contract secured Revenue so contract secure Revenue enables mode to share profits with Developers developers that build on mode were in a proportion of transaction fees from the contracts they deploy and this is done via a CSR module which we based on cantos designs Kanto was the first blockchain to really take contract secure Revenue seriously with the founder Scott Lewis as like the inventor of contract secure Revenue we think it's awesome um and we want sequence of profits to go straight to developers and the percentage of sequence of profits that will go to Developers it's going to be decided by the mode growth Council which is a type of delegated governance Council um sequence of profits that does get will be paid in eth they'll be claimable each week and we're experimenting with different ways for developers to be able to claim sequence of profits um one of them is by holding nfts and basically assigning contracts those nfts there's a few other things we're playing around with but this is going to launch on mainnet and the real reason why we believe contract secure revenue is can be an awesome Innovation for the blockchain ethereum how to ecosystem is it makes building predictable if you have um if you deploy an application you have 100 users and you earn 100 that's great because you know that if you can scale um your application 10x or 100x you earn 10 times or 100 times more profit from the sequencer so that's kind of cool and that enables developers to make Forward Thinking decisions enables them to invest more and that's where we think it's going to be a nice feedback loop for developers building a mode um so yeah at the end of the day developers will get directly rewarded for growing the Network online another key thing with looking at is how can we have an integrated uh growth tooling sweet um to scale applications so in web 2 it's become pretty common that Developers will deploy to certain I don't know certain ecosystems sorry certain platforms and now we have like a suite of tools um so when you deploy like an app to the ice for the Apple store they're like hundreds and hundreds of really great tools you can integrate and to get insights uh for example you can plug in advertising through Facebook and you can do direct app downloads and you can get your first 10 000 app downloads pretty quickly you can use HubSpot for sales you can use Google analytics there's loads of stuff that enables developers to scale the applications very quickly um and we want to try and take that approach with mode so over the last say 12 months as I say yeah two two years 12 months there have been a load of apps that have basically emerged that help projects grow so you can't really see the side I think it might be quite small but that spindle there's Guild there's 3rm there's galaxy there's addressable these are all apps or like plugins tools services that um applications can use to help grow so for example spindle is a web 3 Analytics tool it helps developers understand their users um and attribute certain actions to wallets so you might run a campaign on Twitter you can see that a load of people if you're using spindle you can see that a lot of people have come from that Twitter campaign and deposited or started trading on your exchange you're probably going to do more Twitter stuff Galaxy helps you scale communities Guild is an awesome tool um to essentially help like reward communities for certain actions and addressable is a web free advertising tool that helps you advertise to people that have wallets so the example and like what we're kind of basing our platform strategy on is Shopify so Shopify was awesome well it wasn't the most awesome um store Builder it was pretty good but there were other better options and it also wasn't the first but Shopify really focused on how to build a platform for people to grow their store um it was bringing in a lot of different Services applications that helped stores grow and kind of do all the manual back of this stuff um into that into their platform via their own app store and yeah it was really impressive of just building a platform for shop owners to become successful entrepreneurs with many of those entrepreneurs going on to build businesses which ipo'd and essentially that's the goal of any blockchain is to have successful applications on it that will scale and yeah maybe become bigger than the blockchain itself or at least yeah via user numbers start to really grow next slide so yeah part of that platform approaches to enable developer success and yeah for mode this means we want every developer who builds on mode to succeed recurring revenue from contract secure revenue is a part of that on every developer to be paid proportionally to how much they grow the network uh we can have this developer dashboard which should help all developers understand more about their applications and about their users um we're going to be giving away grants from ten thousand to a hundred thousand for marketing and growth support and we want to support projects that launch on mode and also want to launch across the super chain ecosystem so we're happy to support anyone um if you plan to launch on mode and everywhere else as well So currently we are in public test net we'll be in public test now for probably four to six more weeks and uh we're early so there's lots of opportunity we've built some projects in town ourselves Bridge amm we're working on the dashboard the referral Network and the contracts care Revenue module projects we're looking to support include Bridges dexes with like cool kind of Innovations amm style taxes especially learning protocols some experimental defy stuff marketplaces nfts nft fi uh I think I think that's how it's spelled it's like nftd5 staff I think that's really cool we really like that as a team on-chained games and other fun stuff like AI uh we want to yeah really help anyone who has cool ideas um and maybe is really talented but doesn't know how to get those ideas out into the world uh that's what we're here to do like we're here to help you get your first hundred thousand and more users um and yet grow your project across yeah l2s and across ethereum um so here's a little bit about remote governance this is I think fairly different uh from what other projects are focused on um with Trying to minimize governance as much as possible through the mode down and the Dow will really focus on a few things and a couple of those are around well a couple of the most important are around the parameters on how much revenue goes to users who refer others to grow the network and how much sequence of fee Revenue goes to Smart contract Developers um that's pretty much yeah mode and it would be cool to uh yeah answer some questions um so yeah let's uh yeah let's jump in some questions I'm happy to answer them from the uh the chat here or maybe someone wants to jump in hey James how you doing contact I'm doing great thanks so much for uh for that overview I think I'm really interesting to see a lot of these types of uh incentives kind of being given out and tried on the office back so uh thanks for kind of covering this uh we'll um we have a one question from the audience really is a couple I think coming in but to everybody on the live stream if you have any questions just hit them out in the chat and we'll be able to relay them and ask those questions to uh to teach directly I'm going to start off with like the one we've already received as you were giving uh which is one kind of common criticism we've seen here is effectively trying to understand like how does this mean uh what does this mean for developers and how they should think about deploying contrast because in a way this creates an incentive for you to not write captivation code and is that is that at odds kind of square that how do you think about that and so making sure that people are writing good code and not treating blockchains as databases yeah so I think like obviously Every Chain is competitive right so if you write if you're if there are two people building the same product and one has higher gas fees than the other one people are probably going to use the one with lower gas fees so I think in theory it's a problem but in reality when if you're building an exchange if you have like contracts aren't optimized then someone else is going to build the same exchange with contracts that are optimized and people are going to use that um so I'm not sure how many contracts that haven't been optimized for gas have been successful I don't know but uh yeah yeah that's fair but I think I guess we're also talking about you know like a difference of like maybe one magnitude right like somebody might play with a hyper optimized transaction that costs a tenth of a cent but you can also write an efficient version that costs like one cent and uh to somebody in the US they may not make a difference but uh it could mean a significant portion of someone's spending power if you're in a world that does not rely on the U.S denominated currency so the question becomes well yes if this was a Mainland deployment of course uh you can notice that dollar value difference in transaction fees but at the same time uh on on L2 transactions you already have like a 10 200x Improvement but it could be that or it could be 10 000 or a thousand X improvements and um and then the question is kind of interesting but uh if any other comments we can go into that if not I'll ask another one um yeah I do think it's super interesting and yeah I'm I'm yeah I think should it make you optimize your contracts to make them competitive yes should it make you spend a considerable amount of time to make them completely optimized um yeah I'm not sure fair enough um another question we have is as mode how are you thinking about making it easy for developers to understand what this contract secure Revenue here is like does that mean there's going to be additional libraries or ways to query this directly on chain or manage or see uh examples of what a good practice is how should somebody get a good understanding of what this means yeah so we're building our developer dashboard right now and that dashboard will give you an insight into the contracts you Deploy on the transaction fees that run through and the percent of profits that you'll receive through contracts to care Revenue um we so Kanto originally came up with an idea to have an nft you can mention nft you can assign contracts to it um and then that nft is actually transferable so you could in theory sell the nft um we're talking about this is also true for remote uh talking about Kanto we're playing around with some similar designs right now we're thinking of making the nft non-transferable um and yeah you can you'll be able to get a sign some contracts too that you can uh I don't know decide to donate that Heath really we're trying to make it flexible but um it'll be very visible for developers through an interface oh that's super cool how what happens in a world where uh somebody loses access to their keys or uh if some contracts are not upgradable you want to destroy who they're the private key that has the the ability to uh to upgrade or redeploy and uh how do you kind of think about or how I guess what is a good way of developer to think about these things yeah I think the best way is that you'll be able to assign new contracts to an address so if you have to upgrade a contract you can reassign it if it needs to be reassigned um but yeah your your address should your main address you're using uh should hold an nft which will be where the contract security Revenue will go so you have to obviously keep that extremely safe um that's hard to think about it right now uh yeah awesome um I don't think there's any other questions coming in uh that are not easy to look up lookable on your docs paid so uh I'll leave it at that but uh other than that I mean if there's anything else that you have um like I can just maybe think of like one or two questions that I'm curious about it's just overall like um what made you get excited about this as an idea like what was your motivation to do this and uh and especially do this thing on the op stack yeah um so I've been working the space for around five years um I originally was just an Angel Investing and um spent a lot of time building uh growth tools and spend the last two years working for the largest growth marketing agency called hype um and during that time I work with a lot of big ecosystems including like BNB chain algorand Affinity um flow polygon and quite a few others and yeah I saw like a lot of great things happen when it comes to Resource allocation and I saw some you know difficulties with dials and as you know for a developer I think the most important thing is that you can have predictable Revenue it doesn't have to be a lot but you want to know when you do something get rewarded um and I really like that uh contract security Revenue gives you some predictability um I previously had a company we ran around advertising and you know you can spend you spend money and you see what your return on ad spend is and you decide to scale up or cut it and that's quite hard to do when you're a developer um in web3 because you have to put a lot of effort in up front and the reward can be very variable um maybe deploy an application that goes crazy or maybe to pull an application that gets a huge Grant in three months or six months or maybe nothing happens but the idea is a contract secure Revenue you can start to deploy some maybe lightweight applications CK I've earned like 100 bucks I want 500 bucks um and see if that can help you kind of bootstrap and grow so it's just some yeah an alternative funding model I really like the op stack because um I think it's very much aligned with ethereum's values and I like that the community around it is yeah super focused on how to scale ethereum um building with OP stack is also fairly straightforward like I would say I'm semi-technical um yeah let's dig into that because um this whole thing is about building an OP stack the hackathon today's Summit and understanding kind of how you how you can effectively think about uh creating your own universe that's still consistent with the other universes when did you kind of get this idea to build this thing when did you kind of make the decision to make it on the pay stack and kind of from a timeline standpoint like how how easy was it to kind of get started to receive that all of your requirements are going to be met and uh and uh kind of curious on that and then I have a couple questions about the launch process itself to you from the last week yeah awesome so um I started to get interested I've been like watching optimism for a long time um I was a I was an investor in synthetics and Haven and they were I think one of the first contracts to deploy to optimism so um it was really cool to see how they kind of were really bullish on the ecosystem really early on um and yeah when uh the op stack was kind of announced I was really interested to see how it would work then I think in March um we started to hear about bass um that was going to deploy so it was really interesting looked into it and yeah it just kind of made sense amongst a lot of other Solutions because it's production ready which not many other uh kind of altered role of skating Solutions are right now um and I wanted to get I see this as a good window of time to launch a project because the market is fairly steady um and there's not as much noise as there was like a year and a half ago so I think it's quite a nice time to launch and focus on yeah growing a good community and ecosystem nice um what was the the most challenging piece over launching an EOP stack in any uh pointers or others who are thinking about the same that they can either save time on or avoid some mistakes or any advice um I think that you you have to figure out a lot of what you're doing by yourself so there are there's lots of good documentation um there's a good Community but I still think you do need to really just figure out by yourself um building stuff free trial and error there are I mean we're we're pretty early in our journey so we haven't had too many like big hiccups I expect there will be when we launch mainnet um yeah we have we have a good team so yeah I uh are some of these things obvious thing that we can just complain to fix the doc one or is it more about how do you think about structuring something long-term whether the fact that maybe for adding CSR here you had to uh think about it making deeper engineering changes to how the stack is structured and and that was an easy or obvious compared to someone else's requirement just launching a chain yeah I think if you're if you're going to run the main uh a piece that configuration then it's it's very straightforward um it's more an infrastructure challenge to make sure that if you get high throughput on the Chain like how rpcs has everything supporting that um and yeah we're working we're working on that right now we have a good partner for that conduit so that's great um I think that yeah we're gonna we've had some challenges with like uh deploying Foundry but I think that's been fixed so if anyone's trying to do that you can do that now um uh yeah that's kind of yeah the biggest issues we've had so far amazing uh we also asked you one last question from the audience coming in um can you apply renting or multi-cig EAP protocols or proposals and uh or kind of have you evaluated that or did you end up coming up with a new standard for how modus incorporating these things um we haven't come up with a new standard yet so yeah we'll run on here piece oh okay I got it and uh maybe I'll ask this same question to uh to the person who asked this question uh what's the EIP that you're referring to um quiz on and uh and we'll just make sure that it's the same one or it was like a different one that now kind of could be curious to get your comments too but uh is uh is it just an implementation of an existing and no kind of changes or are you also the proposals of contract secure Revenue yes um yeah we do plan to we do plan to build it out um and propose it as an EIP but initially we're going to test it ourselves for a little while um and yeah we are say two to three weeks away from deploying on the test map um for people to start to see within the dashboard um that working and start to be able to assign uh contracts to yeah for contract secure Revenue so yeah we'll definitely try and push it through but um it can be added as a module it doesn't necessarily need to be like a pro cool upgrade initially [Music] it won't affect like the it won't have to go into the the open stack mainnet configuration run as a module like separately I'll get it okay and you have the flexibility to do that I I actually did not realize uh we should have the flexibility as it comes through the you know the fees come off the sequencer um which is a centralized part of the stack so but that's on the settlements and the sequencing to mainnet but that's not controlled by the mode chain is that correct um the revenue will come through data mode but not as its heat being sequenced so this is a post sequence yeah and then you have the ability to claim it is that correct or is it exactly oh I see okay so that's a lot of things because you have a pot at the end of the day that you have a lot of claims on and then people are able to kind of manage what this would look like in order to change the actual uh code base to uh to incorporate this which uh I think I am 100 sure Kanto have to do so it it added a bit more engineering complexity exactly exactly well James I want to thank you so much for uh for taking the time to walk us through a lot more specifics of how you got excited about building mode and kind of what it means for somebody to consider building an eopstack but it's just super cool and hopefully we'll see a lot of people kind of test it out and break and uh and so yes a lot of good things over the course of the hackathon and again you already remain there thank you so much really appreciate um yeah being able to speak in front of everyone thanks so much awesome well thank you so much great well we have oh there we go so uh we have a just uh our next video coming up uh in a minute as uh you may all already know that uh base has been having a really amazing week uh we're going to be talking about what on chain summer looks like here uh coinbase just announced so the base chain just about two days ago we've seen people build into play apps uh insanely especially the last uh 48 hours and all we have next is we're going to bring on Jesse from from base to really share what they're excited about which is kind of the whole launching summer and there's a lot of things going on and there's a lot of experiments a lot of kind of ways for you to explore what getting millions of users potentially looks like to uh to put looks like we're having some technical difficulties so give me one second um also for I want to just thank everybody here for uh for your patience on some of the comments we're getting uh one cool thing that's going on on epl.tv is today we switched from streaming on YouTube to streaming via live peer so this whole live stream is being streamed through life beer as a decentralized video transcoding platform and uh we're kind of figuring out what it looks like and what bugs we need to account for we added some custom functionality here as well so uh it's one of those things where these types of issues will only come up live and in production so uh some of you have been guinea pigs and telling us that something is not working so I want to thank a few of you here especially Ethan for uh really telling us all the variations and we've been fixing a lot of these things in the background but if this goes really well today we're going to be streaming everything on live peer decentralized so looks like we're having one small issue here on the speaker side and what we'll do later is we'll just take a quick few minute break so uh stay uh stay on the stream hold tight and we'll uh we'll be back in just a couple minutes we'll kind of put a small timer here for all of you to refer to when we'll be resuming very shortly foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign welcome back hope you all enjoyed a quick five minute break and with that we are ready to resume a lot of things primarily what the rest of the song chain server looks like so without further Ado let's welcome Jesse to talk about base and on chain summer hi everyone glad to be here thanks for having me it's Friday I'm wearing my Friday shirt and it's on chain summer let's go amazing well I want to hand this off to you we'll first want to say congratulations on what an incredible week this has been I've only seen incredible amazing excitement on everywhere else on social media and uh I'm sure the rest of your team and you are feeling incredibly grateful for how this it's all has been kind of finally come together so a big congrats to all of you thank you yeah we're excited about it um you know it's been a massive team effort it's not just based I feel like the whole world's starting to come Unchained this summer and so I feel like we're we're just joining the party uh so you know it's been so inspiring to see how many folks have been um hacking over the last week uh I think we have what like a thousand plus hackers here more than that we're we're 11.50 11.50 I mean that's crazy uh that's crazy and I think that there's a few a couple hundred of those who are building cool things on base um so it's super team super dream super chain Unchained summer all the energy I'm ready hundreds of projects under the projects yeah it's epic I can't wait to see them all um also this is like a fun fact um we uh inspired by super hat are doing a on 10 summer hackathon next Thursday and Friday at coinbase and so that means that you're gonna have another you know a few hundred hackers uh joining the efforts you know we're not gonna be going through the super hack stuff but it's pretty cool that we're gonna have uh another couple hundred folks building on chain this summer oh wow yeah yeah it's happening um so I think but I have like 20 minutes right now to to get going and we can um expand it a few more minutes so I know you have some slides if you're ready we can uh I got some slides uh you know pulled together we're doing it it's been a hectic week so everyone bear with me as I do this but I'm like looking at the live stream I see people in the chat maybe just to start if you're in the chat in the super hack Summit chat maybe you can just drop like where are you calling in from uh maybe like drop a flag or drop a country I guess it's in there but just like give me some sign that people are watching uh but you know hey everyone I'm Jesse we got New York City summer let's go Unchained summer um let me put up these slides we got San Francisco we got the Canary Islands India let's go we are an international crew um pretty Epic okay let me put these slides out uh I hope folks Arizona we've got the United States we got Ireland epic um hey everyone uh I'm Jesse I'm the creator of Base uh I've been in the kind of coinbase orbit for the last seven years been working to bring coinbase on chain and building base for the last two years uh and I'm here to talk to you about base Unchained summer what's going on uh and get into it um and before I talk about all those things I just want to talk about this word on chain uh I think folks have probably heard it enough at this point it's in the title um but just as a quick refresher uh the way we think about onchan is that there's kind of three eras of the world right now there's the before internet days and that's what we call offline um that was when really we were just out you know like if you wanted to learn something you listen to the news you watch the TV um everything was unidirectional and if you wanted to create something there were all these Gatekeepers the Publishers The Producers uh the folks who basically got to decide could you have a voice and then in the early 2000s we all went online and that's when I grew up it was a pretty magical time uh because I think for the first time all of our kind of creativity could come out and we could share it with the world we could write uh and it became bi-directional and that's what created Twitter is what created Instagram it's what created Tick Tock so it created this incredible wave of creativity that had I think like transformed the world for the better over the last 20 years but if you reflect on kind of what way wasn't perfect during that time I mean what left a lot to be desired is even as we were all kind of having this creativity even as we were bringing this creativity to the world um when we were putting it online it stopped becoming our it stopped being ours I put my content on Facebook and now Facebook set the rules I put my content on Tick Tock and tick tocks at the rules I made incredibly creative things and they got to decide how much I earned based on it and they got to take most of the money and instead what I got was likes and comments which can't be exchanged for food or any of the things that let me live a better life uh grow happier family Build a Better Business and so we believe that we are on the precipice right now the next generation of the internet which is the on-chain era um and we believe that the big shift that's happening is that for the first time not only can we read and write but we can also own and for the first time when we have creativity when we make things and we put them into the world those things remain ours The Song Remains ours and we can earn from every time someone collects it the piece of writing remains ours and we can earn from every time someone engages with it um and we can enter this next era where I think we're going to see much more economic freedom we're going to see folks uh having much more resources and we're going to see folks uh having much more sovereignty and feeling of much more autonomy to actually be able to live their lives and so that's on chain um and I think the thing that's exciting to me about kids that it feels like it's finally here just in the last three to six months it feels like we've really started to have new use cases being built on chain on Chain music with things like sound um unchain media with things like Zora and manifold highlight um just incredible folks who were her neighboring pools for creators on 10 games uh today uh I was on on a live stream with the parallel team who's building an incredible trading card game um we have on-chain communities uh you know I've been working in in the city of Oakland to build Oak which is a community currency there um Unchained advocacy even uh coinbase has been Leading The Way with uh stand with crypto which is a fully on-chain advocacy campaign where you can mention nft and support get involved uh and activate to you know bring better crypto policy to the world and so we at base are basically trying to figure out what can we do to make it so on chain gets accessible to everyone and that everyone can start to build um we opened up base mainnet for everyone this Wednesday uh so that was a huge milestone after six months of hard work um and many of the folks who are listening into this are Building on Base I was talking with kartik and he said I think there's like a couple hundred teams that were Building on Base in some way during super hack and there's been so much energy over the last three to four days as we opened up base uh for everyone just to give a little bit more color on base bases in ethereum there too it's built on the op stack uh it's part of the super chain that's why you're here for super hack and we really think that bass is going to enable the next generation of on-chain products uh and that people are going to have an easier time building us people are gonna have an easier time using those apps through interfaces like coinbase and coinbase wallet and all the other incredible walls we're working with like rainbow and Ravi and frame and metamask and Trust wallet um and that this combination of easier application building and easier application using is going to enable the next wave of crypto adoption that brings millions of Builders and billions of users one of the things that's really important to us is decentralization uh and so we've been talking about kind of three commitments to the centralization that we've made for base um the first is technical investments in decentralization we've joined as the second core developer of the op stack alongside op Labs uh we've already made a bunch of kind of key contributions on scalability uh we're working right now on something called opref which is the second client for the op staff and also working on Security Council a few other technical initiatives to help base to centralize faster in every op stack chain to centralize faster we also are participating in an open neutrality framework called The Law of chains this is something that we helped co-create with optimism over the last nine months uh and it's the thing that allows us to keep base open and decentralized and permissionless what allows us to ensure that base looks and feels and acts like ethereum and then finally our third commitment to centralization is that we are funding public goods we're taking a portion of all of the transaction Revenue that's generated on base and we are routing it back to the optimism Collective to fund public goods uh this is uh uh you know really our commitment to ensuring that the underlying infrastructure that enables base and is going to enable the next billion users to come on chain as a sustainable funding source that can grow over time and so that's what base is doing but I think the thing to kind of ground us all in is that we're still very early in this journey um there are less than 10 million people on chain there are eight billion people in the world and so we have to get from 10 million to 8 billion people in the world I'm seeing someone ask just in the chat can you index space with the graph right now the answer is yes the graph fully supports base as does pretty much every other infrastructure provider uh and so if you need a tool um I would just say ask uh you can pop in the base Discord you can drop in the chat right now I'll tell you yes or no um but we've worked really hard over the last six months to ensure that everything or as much as possible supported out of the box but face um and that's because we believe that it's not just gonna be based it's not just gonna be coinbase it's gonna be all of us that get us from that 10 million people on train to the 8 billion people on chain over the next decade and so the way we're really trying to kick that off is with unchain summer uh you've maybe seen this on the internet over the last week uh this is uh really bigger than base you know we think about base ads joining the party but that the party started at the beginning of the summer when the world started coming on chain um and our contribution is basically bringing a bunch more people uh to build a bunch more cool stuff and share it with the world and then hopefully bring a bunch of users into the ecosystem so they can experience what's happening uh on chain and get excited and get a crypto wallet and get involved um today just as a like shout out we did a really cool mint from parallel uh they are building a trading card game uh you can get a starter pack for parallel at onchanesummer.xyz slash parallel or just on 10 summer.xyz um this gets you early access to the beta and it gets you all the cards you need to get started the game is really really cool um really excited about it uh folks have been loving playing it and it's all fully on chain on base we also have a bunch more coming up so tomorrow we're doing on Chain music with another block we have to get one web two brand in there and so coke is doing a really cool piece of uh on-chain art with a bunch of uh artists including kind of the van Gogh house and a bunch of emerging folks on Sunday on Monday we have a day of action for stand with crypto where we're going to be telling the world why we need clearer policy on Tuesday we have Blackbird who's doing on-chain restaurants with loyalty they're doing a summer pass and then every day all the way through August um we have something else cool happening on chain uh and so if you want to get involved in unchain summer you can go to Unchained summer.xyz uh every day there'll be something new to do we also have a trending Tab and a community Tab and so if you build something on base this summer uh let me know you can tweet at me you can DM me and I'll make sure that we get it featured in the community section uh and then if it goes viral if people are minting people are engaging it'll show up automatically in the attending section and we're seeing a ton of eyeballs right now around June summer I think yesterday we saw that there's like a hundred thousand plus people who visited and so this is a great way to show off some of the cool stuff that all of you all are building um every day and building in super hack and I think my message to all of y'all is this chart down here that's the growth of l2s over the last year you can see that it kind of started at zero ethereum's the blue line um and then it's kind of gradually grown up into the right and we're at this inflection point where it's growing but there's still more room for it to grow faster and so our belief is that this is it that we're here that the time is now that the tools are finally ready that it's Unchained summer and that's going to take all of us to ignite what will be probably one of the most incredible growth Journeys uh we've seen ever in the history of humanity as the whole world moves Unchained and so that's my message uh if I had one other thing to say it would be let's go build some cool stuff we have a thousand plus hackers here for East Global um uh we know that there's already a bunch of projects being built on base and other chains that are going to be really impactful that are going to help tell the story of on chain um and so if there's anything I can be doing we can be doing to better support y'all if there's anything you need to make your on-chain Summer Dreams Come True please let us know um one last plug on that is we have a hundred each of additional grants alongside the prizes we're doing for super hack that are open right now you can learn more about those at prop.house slash base or you can just Google unchain summer grants and those will come up um those are for all sorts of things uh you know creative projects building on base accounting abstraction infrastructure uh and so if you're building something cool this summer uh please submit it for a grant we'd love to support you in the next generation of builders on base and so with that those are all the prepared remarks I have I know there's not technically a way to do questions but maybe if folks have questions we have Karthik here you can ask questions also folks can drop drop questions in the in the chat and I'm happy to answer them we can take a few more minutes and then we can call it a day yeah absolutely uh we uh there's no way for people to ask questions to you directly over voice but if they type anything in the chat we get to see all of them you can relate that we do have a technical question coming in which is uh is base already indexed by the the graph right now I mean yeah I answered it I answered it live um because I got the chat live stream um it's fully supported by the graph and pretty much every other infrastructure provider and so if you need something you can DM me about it I'll make sure you get it sweet um the the other hack idea is it yeah what hack ideas am I most excited about uh I'm most excited about people building cool consumer products uh it feels like the technology is finally there like we have a counter abstraction we have low-cost l2s we have like good wallet interfaces um I don't know if folks have seen friendtech but that's been kind of like popping over the last 24 hours uh on base uh and I think it's a great example where it's like you literally just put your phone number you can transfer an e uh you can build um whatever you want or you can you know like do whatever you want there and you don't have to engage with crypto you don't have to get a new wallet um so I I think that that's awesome I want to see more experiments like that I'd love to see people build consumer products on base um I also am really excited about anything that's on chain summer themed uh telling the story of the world coming Unchained this summer and every summer until everyone's here I think it's really important and so we'd love to see projects related to that I see someone just ask Linux or Windows if I had the paper between those two I think Linux um you know I'm a I'm a hacker I grew up on the command line uh and you know I use bash for a while and actually not a fish user uh and so a little bit out there um but I'm sensing Mac but Mac yeah yeah you know like I uh what am I gonna do I'm a Mac User I grew up like taking apart iPhones and watching and Steve Jobs Keynotes and um yeah grateful for all of the incredible products that Apple has built uh Bryce just dropped into prop house round um yeah you can just go to prop.base everything's retroactive and so build something cool put it in there uh and then folks are going to be kind of selecting what gets awarded the grants amazing uh maybe one one question to put yourself on but uh what uh what's been kind of a big learning from uh from the last 48 hours well it's been a big learning from the last 48 hours um I'd say the biggest learning is just like man there's so much energy out there it just needs to be activated like we weren't really sure how people were gonna respond when we started telling telling everyone this is it like this is the summer the world comes on Jane and I think like realistically the world's not going to come on Shannon for this like we got a lot more work in here we're we're every Summer's gonna be on chain summer but I feel like there's something about the like just the vision that we're painting that is getting people fired up and it's like juicing creativity and getting people to do things that maybe they didn't feel were possible before and oh no that's been really refreshing it's been energizing uh like I feel solidly out of the bear market right now right now like we are solidly in the like Builder summer Unchained summer uh grow it all bring the world Unchained um yeah and I bet a little bit of a relief too now uh now that it's we're there it's just a little bit less pressure and yeah you know you get to see pictures so yeah I'm really grateful that this is out in the world now and now we're past the launch man it's like it's stressful launching something um because it feels like you only really got to do it once and so it's been pretty it's been stressful three months of getting here and I think it's not it's it's kind of non-stop through the end of August like every day I'm doing a live stream from now until the end of August Saturday Sunday is included just telling the story of Unchained summer every day we're doing a new man Saturdays and Sundays included so the next 20 days are going to be intense but I feel like the pressure valve being released of like oh this thing is out in the world now people are using it people are starting to like build on it organically um that's been uh really really great um I also see one more question in here what's our internal goal kpi for on chain summer 2023 um honestly we've already we've already exceeded all of our internal kpis projects like kind of crazy enough like if you look at the activity on dates like the goals that we originally set we didn't know what to expect we're like launching a new L2 like you know trying to compare it to other folks who've recently launched new l2s and um I think we've already been like kind of Blown Away by the response um you know just like today I think yesterday we crossed a hundred thousand unique transacting addresses on Base today I think we're gonna track towards like 125 or 150 000 um uh so yeah like it's crazy like that that's way bigger than we were anticipating um and so I think we're kind of like doing a little bit of an internal reset right now like okay like what do we what do we go on for the rest of the month um and my attitude is that it's day one like 150 000 is Big relatively right like I think base has the most transacting addresses of nel2 today and yesterday uh maybe not yesterday but will today but in the grand scheme of things it's tiny right like we're talking about millions billions of people that we need to bring on chain and so I'm just now recalibrating like let's go get to a million daily transacting addresses um I think the the biggest like internal goal that I have is um I just want to make up products like all the products work better on base like that's been a forcing function for like or on-chain summer is a forcing function for that like there's a part of it that was just like getting energy getting momentum getting movement but the other part of it was like making it so every day the coinbase team the coinbase wallet team other wallet teams who are promoting on chain summer and doing activities non-chain summer like they have to go through the experience of trying to use an on-chain product and seeing what works what doesn't work and just in three days like every day we've done a retro an hour-long retro with the coinbase team the coinbase wallet team and the base team uh for the last three days and every day we're like here's a bunch of that's really broken that we need to fix and so I think that's probably like the single biggest like North Star for me this summer it's like can we make a 50 Improvement 100 Improvement in quality of life and quality of experience of people who are trying to transact every day on chain um yeah yeah and uh it's set up to be in a right world too because you now have this really tight feedback loop where you get to actually see and try things and just see the next iteration 24 hours and see if it worked or not and that's that's a great idea 100 um I'm seeing someone asking about parallel about Prime on base Prime I think is on base already um it can be bridged via layer zero like 80 90 sure of that if you want to tweet at me I can tag the parallel team and they can give you any information that you need that's a response to gos um Nico awesome to hear that the Dows migrated to base this week we want more of that uh we're here to to make that happen um and let us know if we can help and then David Deb Judy do you have a question on l2s um navigating the regulatory space you know in general our feeling is like there's a lot of Need for regulatory Clarity um in the US and in countries around the world and that's why we've been advocating for that coinbase with stand with crypto and all the other stuff that we're doing I think in general our belief is that layer twos are an extension of ethereum and that like ethereum we should be standing for and fighting for layer twos to remain open permissionless and decentralized and so that's one of the big reasons why we are part of the super chain why we're part of super hack why we're building on the op stack why we spent the last nine months working on this open neutrality framework called The Law of chains because we believe that it requires decentralization requires open source it requires real commitment to ensure that happens and so that's that's what I'm focused on when I'm not focused on on chain summer I'm focused on ensuring that layer two remains open permissionless and decentralized because that's what's going to be required to have a global on-chain economy and a global on chain platform that all of us can build on and that all of us can stand on with a Level Playing Field so I think I'm at time card kick thanks for the questions everyone who is here thanks for being here thanks for hacking thanks for being a part of super hack thanks for building this summer and if you launch stuff for on-chain summer tweet at me will get it featured on the website um if you're looking for cool things to do on chain go to unchainsummer.xyz every day there's one cool thing to do on chain get on chain this summer let's go build some cool stuff awesome thank you so much Jesse and I will see you on chain awesome thanks see you later bye all right that was an awesome intro to everything that's happening in base and with that we are ready for our last Talk of the day so without further Ado I'd like to bring on Tevin to talk about multi-chain unit Swap and uh given all the things that are happening in this L2 ecosystem this is the perfect opportunity for you to think about and learn about how you can potentially also structure your projects to be on multiple chains so Tevin welcome and hi Hi how are you thanks for having me today I'm doing great and so it's been a really fun day I've learned so much and uh yeah for me very very busy it seems I call it the end of Jessie's talk um and yeah the the base launch has been super exciting and Unchained summer is very cool so um very exciting time to be building in this space absolutely well I'll uh I'll let you take on with the rest of the presentation and I'll get out of your way great thanks so much car check and thank you um all for being here with me today uh today I'm here to talk about multi-chain unispop unispot protocol and uh cross chain generally um and I'm here to fill you in on a few different things first uh I'll introduce myself I'm Devin Walsh and I'm the executive director and one of the co-founders of the unisplot foundation I'll kick off by just explaining a little bit about what that means what is the unit swap Foundation how is it different than companies like unispop Labs um then I will go into some background info on uniswap Cross chains some 101 on how uniswap goes and is deployed on other chains on whether they're l2s or other l1s some some history there as well and then what I thought would be helpful for this audience of hackers is talking through the opportunity for multi-chain uniswap and multi-chain generally for protocols as well as some of the biggest considerations that that I have and I think the the uniswap Dow has when we deploy protocols on other chains while the opportunity for multi-chain protocols is large we are still early and there are some frictions and things that I think could be made easier to do when we think about deploying protocols cross chain so first off what is the uniswap foundation so uh I along with my co-founder Ken ing founded the unit spot Foundation one year ago approximately in in last summer right now we are a team of seven operating remotely around the world it's possible some of you who are youth Global hackathon frequenters may have met myself or some of my colleagues at some of the hackathons around the world and we are a non-profit that's focused on supporting the growth decentralization and sustainability of the uniswap protocol and ecosystem uh we do that using 60 million dollars in funding that we've received from the uniswap Dow that goes towards grants grants to build developer tooling content interfaces cool apps on top of unispop alongside new committees processes groups events that support the longevity and sustainability of the protocol and ecosystem and if you want to learn more you can visit us online or on our Twitter I would recommend following us on Twitter because next week we will be posting our first set of requests for proposals in other words grants funding opportunities to build for uh uni swap V4 which should be coming uh to be deployed by end of this year potentially early next year so uniswap X chains uniswap across chains um unispot protocol as many of you know was originally deployed on ethereum but since then has been deployed on many many other chains that l2s and l1s um some a quick primer on how that happens uh the key inputs to a deployment happening on other chains from the protocols perspective are a the the open source license on the protocol um called it the BSL or business source license as well as the uniswap Dow so um uniswap V3 and unit swap V4 upcoming are controlled by a business source license which essentially prevents others from you know deploying uh the protocol for two years um unless they've been granted an exemption um uh in this case the Dow was able to Grant exemptions to teams and after two years the protocol transitions to a GPL license so in that two-year period when the BSL is is live the Dow can vote and as you can see on the right hand of my screen you have some recent votes that the Dow has has conducted to to uh you know in this case recognize that uh pre-gpl to deploy the protocol on on other chains um and once the uh code transitions to GPL anyone can deploy anywhere and the Dow recognizes canonical deployments um which are supported by the Dao and foundation and I can go into why why that canonical recognition is is important a bit later on some history um so as many of you know uniswap has been around for a few years now uh the most recent live version you just bought V3 was deployed May 2021 so a bit more than two years ago uh and swiftly after that was quickly deployed on optimism arbitrum and polygon some of the earliest l2s in the space the first L1 deployment on cello was was conducted a little bit maybe a year and a half ago or so um and over the past to to years uh 11 deployments uh have been recognized as canonical deployments of unit spot V3 on other chains and the Dow recognizes those deployments um by uh through essentially an ens subdomain v3deployments.uniswap.e you can check those out and basically look at the look at the address which has been recognized as canonical by the Dao on all of disease all of these chains most recently I know you all just heard from Jessie Pollock um uniswap was deployed on base and it was also deployed on Linea those are two of the most recent deployments which have been been done um now cross chain usage um so I think it's notable to call out how um popular some of these these X unit swap deployments are so five of the top 15 dexes in terms of volume are um uni swap deployment so you can see that you're gonna swap on arbitrom is the third uh most popular in terms of volume decks as of as of today also notable um are the fees generated on uniswap you can see that average in terms of average daily fees uniswap is only behind ethereum and notably ahead of Bitcoin and BNB chain in terms of fees generated and you can see that those fees are not only coming from the ethereum deployment but also arbitrum polygon optimism Etc so when you think about unispot deployment cross Chains It's you know not only in in name and like philosophically believing in the power of multi-chain but also in terms of you know true um people are like are showing with with their action how how it needed and valued these cross-chain deployments are uh so one of the things I wanted to talk about uh today as well that I'm sure you're you're hearing quite a bit of are the opportunities in terms of cross-chain deployments so as we could see from the last slide there is you know product Market fit for cross-chain deployments of unispot for sure um our vision or I believe the future of um the space is multi-chain um and that on all of these chains you will have tokens that require swapping and that requires liquidity and we envision uniswap to be the liquidity layer for those tokens across all chains um and as again many of you know many chains have different trade-offs so um speed for one transaction cost and I want to call this out because for unit swap you not only have the cost to swap but also to be a liquidity provider so to provide assets which can be swapped against and that is a an activity which for many on the ethereum chain is is not it's untenable if you don't have too much Capital to to provide liquidity with um I was doing a test last week where I was providing liquidity on ethereum mainnet with probably about a hundred dollars worth of capital to just test out a new function and went to rebalance and it was fifty dollars worth of gas in order to merely rebalance my liquidity and that is just unsustainable on the ethereum main net but that's an activity which is much cheaper and can thus be done much more efficiently and effectively on l2s like optimism and arbitrum and bass and then something else I want to call out is the fact that different chains and different l2s will also have different Focus areas and different um distribution to serve different use cases and different populations so Sello the first L1 that uniswap was deployed to um has focused on it the use case of tokenized carbon credits and is has broad distribution across the developing World um coinbase is base similarly we'll have um you know strong distribution into um you know a slightly less crypto native population than some folks who are on chain all the time but there are still many frictions that exist today with cross chain deployments um having gone through quite a few of these myself I think there are definitely areas that I can speak to from from experience that um you know are have troubled Us in the past and I think trouble um also other teams um which deploy their protocols across chain and I'll dig a bit into into each of these but three that I'll call out are bridges and bridge bridge security two is the Integrity of a deployment and three our support for the deployment it's it's one thing to to actually you know deploy code for that code to become useful on the chain is is you know a whole other story and um uh and has a number of dependencies for one Bridge security so so why why does uniswap care about bridges why does the unistop protocol care about bridges well unit swap governance so decisions to turn on protocol fees to create um fee tiers and um you know uh to to do other things but the protocol are um occur on ethereum um if if a decision is made via uniswap governance to turn on fees on another chain like optimism or to add a fee tier like one bit the one bit fee tier on optimism or polygon that decision is made on ethereum but that decision that message needs to be passed in a secure way to the factory contract on optimism or or polygon um and we as the Dow need to trust that that message will not be be compromised and that the bridge which owns the factory contract on the other chain will not be compromised um as many of you have likely seen bridges are a developing area of the crypto ecosystem and there have been a number of hacks and attacks over the past several years um when it comes to uniswap a bridge attack could compromise ownership of the Cross chain deployment um and you know a malicious hacker could potentially take over that deployment and send decide to turn on fees and send them all to his or her self um which is not not a scenario that the unit swapped out would want to see happen which is why we care about Bridge security um unfortunately Bridge security is notoriously difficult to assess and it is nearly impossible for the typical delegate even the technically Savvy delegate to do well given the amount of context and time required to do it um we've seen in the past some of you may have seen earlier this year there was a um you know situation that that kind of um uh came up in in the uni swap down which uh you know there were potential conflicts of interest between delegates who had also invested in in Bridge teams which caused you know um some some debate within the community about how these decisions should be made and so what we did at the foundation was funded the creation of a committee of independent experts um on Bridges to define the unit swap protocol use case build a comprehensive framework for assessing the security of bridges for that unit swap use case and then they diligenced I think eight or nine bridges in in total and recommended two bridges for use as well as a road map for the other Bridges to to be considered uh usable and and secure for the unit spot use case um the team also uh supported and is continuing to support and we're continuing to fund development of a multi-bridge aggregation solution so you can think of this as a kind of multi-sig of bridges that adds a so two of three three of five Bridges from ethereum to some other chain um that need to approve a message before it's sent just adding that even more security to the mix um another consideration number two the Integrity of of the deployment so earlier um in in the the slide I mentioned um the uh the licensing of uniswap V3 so today uniswap V3 is GPL totally open source anyone can can Fork it anyone can deploy unisplot V3 anywhere today which is great um it's it's great that anyone can build and play around with this code and use it as they would like um however um so there there are some kind of considerations and things that that we had foundation and the Dow thought were important to address here um given how broadly and widespread usage of the unit spot protocol is um we thought it important for um LPS and users generally to know which which deployments have been reviewed and approved by and are owned by the uniswap Dow itself and there are a few examples of why this is this is important and I think the the tweet that I that actually sent out yesterday um is a good illustration of of this so um the governance lead on my team Aaron basically found that there was a uh there are two deployments of unisplot V3 on on base one um that was voted on by by being swept out to be canonical and recognized in another that was not which again is totally great like base is permissionless anyone can deploy the unit swap V3 code the reason we thought it was important to call that out is that this deployer had turned on fees and was sending fees to themself which again totally fine to do but if you're a liquidity provider and you're providing liquidity to that deployment you might not realize that that you're actually giving up a portion of your fees to this deployer um because you you may think that you're you're providing liquidity to the canonical uniswap V3 protocol which does not have turned on fees and um and you just may not realize the fact that there are multiple deployments some of which are have different parameters that that impact your return in this case um this this was not the case here but it's also possible for um a a deployment to um have code uh rearranged deleted or maliciously updated to rug users um uh and of course that's something we we really care about um or we care about preventing um we would not want folks to uh you know go to swap or provide liquidity on a deployment of unispop on base or any other um any other L2 or other chain and be harmed by by that usage so that all gets to why we as a as a dow the uniswap Dao has decided to take this step of recognizing the canonical deployments the deployments where users can can trust you know the the code has been deployed by trusted sources it's been reviewed by folks in the Dow it has the same parameters as as um that you would expect a deployment of unispop to to have um and um and I call this out because as we saw yesterday um you know me tweeting about this is probably not the right long-term solution to to this problem or um to this I guess like consideration that we have um so so that's another point I'll call out and the third is um chain middleware and interface support so so I call this out here for um if you've you've you know approved and are excited to uh deploy cross chain that's only the beginning of your journey in some cases um even if another chain is evm compatible um some evm chains may not have the same AI EIP support as as mainnet um which for uniswap will be relevant for V4 immunospot V4 is dependent upon an EIP EIP 1153 which will be introduced in the Cancun hard fork and um if an evm compatible change does not have that EIP V4 will work differently on on those chains and will not have the gas efficiencies that that e at the 1153 chains have middleware may not be available across across all chains where you deploy unispop so um uh or the middleware May function differently and in a one example I'll call out here is um for folks who have used the graph on the graph is an amazing tool that uh is you that we use with uniswap in order to index and make queryable unit swap data we found that on arbitrum the arbitrum Chain was too fast for for the sub graph um so we had to well one for a year or two to be honest some data was actually broken on the info.unispop.org website until the foundation provided a grant to um to a developer to do some custom optimizations to the arbitrum subgraph to speed it up so it could keep up with with the chain and provide data to the users to our users um and third uh interface support requires additional Dev work so um so in the union swap realm you may be very familiar with the unispop uh app front end um which is maintained by unislap labs and um you know the the in in some cases in this case not not all um chains which uniswap protocol is deployed on are um actually readily available on on this interface yet um uh popular interfaces may not have the development resources required to maintain all of the the chain support given some of the considerations I've mentioned before um uh so so all of that being said this is leads to you know um some some frictions per additional deployment of a protocol um so so with that I think I'm actually I just uh I'm just at about 20 25 minutes time um wanted to say thank you again for having me and um I am happy to chat this weekend or you know over the next week however long folks are hacking um reach out to me on Twitter I'm at Devin a Walsh um and you should also follow us on Twitter to see some of the grants that will be excited to support uh next week awesome well that was that was actually very informative this is uh I learned a bunch of things around how you structure the the grants and the foundation here but uh I mean you brought up a really really interesting point which is we will see some malicious behavior here especially when the code is public and being able to actually streamline that and at least screen on the communication if not like the resolution of preventing these uh scam potential situations is a very key requirements and not only just for unit swap but every single protocol is thinking about going on different chains um so having some better Frameworks is uh is something that I feel like you and and the rest of your team and a few others will Pioneer very soon and others can uh in a way steal from uh for the better but uh like I'm really happy to see this is already happening and uh and we don't have to worry about or well we have to wait for something to go wrong remember we start thinking about these things actively which is a really good pattern to follow here yeah yeah I think threading the needle between you know embodying and embracing open source ideals while also you know doing what it takes to ensure user protection is like definitely a tough line to cross um it's something that you know I don't really think there's a great playbook for today but we're certainly trying to figure it out and and I'm also excited that's why I'm so happy that you guys have these hackathons because there are very smart people here who can help us figure these things out yes I think the the people uh people usually think about hackathons as a way to come up with ideas in products but I exclusively think of them as a way for us to figure out what's broken and that helps uh with more net new progress than uh than the first one three days that they've like aggregated and I can I can I second that like many things a lot I think for some of us who have been in the space for a long time I think there are a lot of things that are like have been broken for so long we don't even realize they're broken exactly yeah the power of defaults for for us in our interviews versus people like oh this is annoying and I wonder why and like oh this is how it is but you actually get to see that when you bring in way more people who are reacting for the first time so it's been a great pattern and hopefully we'll uh we'll see some better guidance on how to think about multi-chain deployments from that yeah yeah that's great well yeah good luck talking to everyone here and yeah again feel free to reach out to me on Twitter um and hopefully you know if you think you have a solution to some of those issues I brought up please reach out we have grant funding to support you amazing thank you so much Kevin thanks take care bye all right with that we are at a close to our super hack Summit so before we uh jump off I want to remind everybody that your hackathon submissions are due this Sunday at noon 12 p.m Eastern and we'll see you all on Discord and happy hacking take care everybody goodbye
