you'll make sure your marble is faster I don't think I think it's all down to chance no way I mean I would I would shave mine down to make it you know the least amount of well I wouldn't make it faster you gotta weigh it down unreliable but it's not all one guy and right now we're live okay no more talk of marbles alright sorry about a little hiccup there but we should be good I'm gonna just double check that YouTube is going unless Emily you've verified that yeah everything's going Twitter thank you awesome that means we can get started welcome everybody to the middle of week for the last week of hack money it's been quite a ride these past few weeks it's been super fun for us organizing and I hope it's been a really good experience for everybody on the other side of it working with mentors working through teams and we're really excited to see what submissions are on Sunday so let's dive into it today is the ecosystem support program is going to be giving an overview just some of their processes how they work what they look for in process in projects and from that team is Ken I like Ken give it a little bit more of his background and something about himself maybe but we're really excited to have him here and we appreciate him spending some time with the hack money crew so Ken once you introduce yourself a little bit of ecosystem support program yeah take it away yeah thanks so I'm Ken I am NOT important but I think it's really cool to have ASP up here I'm gonna start sharing my screen but you know I think one of the really interesting things about seasons of a program is just how yes widely known it is for it's kind of broad and expansive levels of support so what came what we kind of grew accustomed to the part out of was the what was known as the theorem foundation grants program it sort of evolved into something that we you know feel better addressed the ecosystems needs you know a lot of the lessons learned from the grants program really showed us that funding obviously is important but it's not the end-all be-all it's not what makes a project successful it's not what determines or what helps a project get to where it needs to go what we realize is actually there's so much more in terms of compounding these effects and so by kind of growing what we are able to do we've realized that this is much better for the ecosystem especially the teams that we work with so I'll dive in for today's presentation I'm going to do a walk-through of the program what our application looks like what the inquiry form looks like what does it even mean real quick so I just on this at the beginning but Ken's gonna go through this presentation if you have any questions or things that you're that's unclear to you either just write it in the chat or raise your hand through the e please the toolbar at the bottom of zoom and then we can go be time for questions at the end and Ken will be happy to answer any and all questions cool yes I wasn't happy no no words do I have 20 minutes from now or is it I have 12 minutes we have we have the full hour so however much time you know I think this should be more than enough time awesome cool Easton's or program a tech money I'm Ken not important this is this is actually really hard because I want soom and PowerPoint at the same time so like it's giving me the you're not clicking all right so how do we apply we'll just dive right into it it's actually super simple applying is right there ESP dot a theorem that foundation really simple website you can remember because we are ESP and website we're in its foundation initiative at the bottom of the website you'll find two inks one for a specific project and that's for teams and projects who you know have something specific as this says and you know you know what you want to do right I have a project I have an MVP I have an idea I know what we need to be successful I know what success is or more like me when you're in the kind of exploring possibilities phase where you know I have this idea or have this project that I built at a hackathon and I don't really know where to go with it going to explore possibilities will kind of I'll help us kind of craft the conversation around what that means what our next steps whatever potential next steps where I used to really kind of explore within the a theorem ecosystem but what I want to kind of dive into while we have you this beginning and reframing um is something that will kind of ring true throughout the the rest of the presentation right questions we ask when we identify goals and kind of going through these inquiry forms and proposals you know we want to know precisely what we're trying to do here what are we trying to accomplish what do we hope to accomplish with these projects and they think Greece what are examples of you know the outcomes is it a direct outcome of this of the output of this project is there something that's indirect is it a second-order effect you know different levels of kind of thinking through you know what else can happen what are the possibilities here but accurate or precisely kind of listing out what will be done what do we want to do and what happens if X happens what are we not looking for this is a little more prescriptive Espino knows we will not pump or help sell your token we won't invest in your quant or all go fund unfortunately we're a non-profit these are not things that we want to do and we also won't fund you're not related to it they're in business we are so and if they're in foundation initiative this is something that we want to do we want to push it there in the right direction we want to make sure that you know theorem is advancing from things that we support something that is not to then relate it is not within scope rule so then what do we actually offer the goal of ESP is really to help you know identify and address the various needs from anyone and everyone within the community you know we want to figure out what level support we can provide what resources can we allocate from anyone within ESP or the theorem foundation and this is a non-exhaustive list right we can do financial grants project an idea validation product and community feedback project coordination introductions you know applicable credits and software we are a AWS partner so we can give out AWS credits and alternative funding sources I always like to talk about funding as like a it's like dating right you you try to get to know each other and it's a two-way street you know what's right for us may not Ricky right for you what's right for you may not necessarily be right for us know for example if you are a for-profit business we don't limit that as we don't stop someone who is a for-profit or nonprofit from applying to DSP or trying to understand you know whether or not we can fund we do both but perhaps maybe grants aren't the way for your project maybe for you to be successful you need VC funding and something that we can introduce you to or maybe we're just not the right grant organization to give you a grant it could actually go joven tech fund there's a flurry of other options that we can introduce you to so for the next however many minutes we're gonna go through an actual application and try to kind of break down what all this means so for inquiries this is where the conversation begins just so we're clear this is an inquiry it's not an application right we want to get to know you and your project this this is where we start a conversation we make the questions on this form very vague and we make this form itself very short we do this all on purpose because we want to make sure that we're getting answers or enough answers for us to begin and have a conversation but we don't want people to feel overwhelmed and we don't want people to feel like they need to spend weeks on an application the same way this inquiry form is a lot of this is framing as you know what can ASB do for you but if there's something that you see here from say the which lists or you you see something that we didn't list earlier that you that you want support for or if there are things specifically you want to call out they don't know the answer to that's totally okay right this example we have here is an idea taken from hackney to WTF this is not a real project but project name yeah that is whatever the project description is pretty specific right it's exactly what it is that we built it is something that I think there's what success can look like or at least success for the project as our team determined will be and the profile itself is you know we're just university students it can be as simple as this to something way more specific to LinkedIn BIOS this is everything we've done you know in the past I've built you know X teams X companies and had whatever exit anything that you feel is relevant to your your inquiry I'm going to come in missing pieces that we see a lot come from the next question of needs and challenges right so the challenges that we're looking for is specific to what your project is facing right what do you want help with addressing what specific problems are you facing what needs do you actually have you know it helps to kind of contextualized within what stage your project is if you think about it as we're we're just a an idea then during a project validation do we need a community feedback or do we just introductions like we want to speak to one specific person or we don't know who we want to talk to these are all questions that we can help answer we just need to know what that actually is with this example it's building off the same each to application that I put in myself um yeah this is super short but it is concise and I can I get to the point right we're full time students we don't have an intership anymore so we really just want funding if that's what all you need feel free to call it out a lot of times we get you know things that are like the biggest constraint for us is and then know like you two more paragraphs about how financial hardship is an issue but never actually calling out we just need funding that is super easy that's totally fine we're not going to reject you just because you say you need money or we're not going to reject you just because you say you need something else you know like we we want to be able to kind of go through this really quickly and kind of jump on a call and really figure out what is it that you need and how can we help you the other thing that is super helpful for us and it's commonly missing piece is if you have already sought feedback from others if you already have a discussion you know link us to it if it's on each research if it's I'm ready that it's on Twitter just send it to us we'd love to know kind of what conversation already been had so we don't need to ask the same questions again that saves you time that saves lost time and I think it allows us to have a much better and easier for in conversation on the status of the project and kind of what's next so when we go with their initial review when this is all done comes into us we make initial contact so much margin reach sound says hey thank you so much for applying let's let's talk about it well it's four different pathways right so we'll just explore the different types of project support that we mentioned earlier will also support or or explore financial support if that's what you want in that case we'll move forward to a grant proposal if it makes sense or give me a combination of the two doing one doesn't limit you from the other we can do all or not some of things we're taking the account when we actually evaluate is you know we have conversations with you we call them interviews but generally they're a lot less prescriptive so we talked about booking we also have peer review this leans on the ESP s the whole roster of advisors people who we trust to kind of help with applications and we try to make sure that anyone we speak to you any of the applicants also have folder and itself but here we try to make sure you know this is a fully decentralized decision making process and that has rain true from the beginnings of the EF Grants Program till today if anything we've actually expanded the team and expanded everyone who we kind of bring in from the community to ask for help with so the next couple slides we're gonna go into the financial support option and here we're really kind of diving in to the project scoping right these are some of the questions we're going to ask and you know for the what you know specifically we want to know diving into the main concept of your project what do you aim to produce right what is the outcome here what is the output the next question is why you know can you articulate how and why this is important what are the impact what is the impact of this project going to be specifically call that out and then why this project you know our other projects going to address similar try to going to adjust similar needs or are they in the same tactical area you know what does this improve upon how does this actually help that and does this is this is just a different approach so then we start talking about project scoping of what is the starting form where are we currently with the project is there a demo to show can we go somewhere with where we currently are already are what happens in the status quo right and then there's the ending point where do you want to get what is the desired outcome or output here what do you hope to deliver within the entirety of the grant scope and then there's the required steps what are the challenges you have to overcome in order to get to this point you know what are the specific milestones to get us to this to this end point so when we consider and we do these project scopes and timelines we also think about the approach and the risks in all of this right why do we approach it the way that we do why is this the way that we actually approach this problem how is this the optimal approach or if it's not the outcome approach why is not the approach why do we take it this way instead are there alternatives and should we consider kind of different ways to approach the same problem for this for even for your specific team right maybe this may be what you originally thought after speaking to your host of advisers you realize you know this isn't the best way to do it maybe we want to Reese cope this whole thing but every step of the way we want to make sure that the milestones really get us to this kind of overall overarching goal and we'll touch on that a little bit more but you know the output is really kind of where we want to kind of drive towards one of the big things that is commonly missed is the risk right what are some likely downsides and you know possible unintended consequences here a lot of times we don't think about chilling effects second-order effects here these are some of the indirect things that we refer to earlier how do we make sure that we're limiting the amount of downsides that might come from any of the milestones or the overall output you know oh got it commonly we we enter a you know when we're building something we're really excited by it we have this tunnel vision of life this is the ideal way and this is how we're gonna get there but we we don't stop to think about what happens if we do this and all the other teams working on it you know sort of fall behind which isn't a bad thing I think it's just something to call out so diving deeper into the impact and goals beyond the specifics of what the project hopes to achieve what are the larger goals right this is this is kind of at a high level what impact can this potentially have right who is going to be affected what other projects will be affected how critical is this work is this something that is you know of utmost importance and up most urgency right is this something that needs to really get done right now otherwise it theorem is going to fail there was something that you know if we push six months down the line you know we'll be it in the same time or place what will it be what will it bring to the ecosystem right is it going to solve for something that's really difficult or inefficient or is what's currently or is what you currently want to bring about impossible with what's already out there do you need to build the tools tickets at this point where you can actually build a project off of or you're building the tools for someone else to build a project off of or different projects all right are you unlocking different possibilities here some of the high level goals that we have we've kind of thought about this is again a non exhaustive list you know everything here is still intended to be grown everything that the ESP tries to do is really kind of exploring one one path from different angles and trying to make sure that you know we have the flexibility and adaptability to really continue to grow what we see as a goal or what we hope the ecosystem sees as important part of that is growing usage growing community in the developer base you know growing research capabilities improving developer output you know supporting R&D that makes tomorrow's a theorem a reality today or maybe soon but also upkeep is super important right maintaining today's crucial projects these are things that are important now and probably will be in the in the near future so it's not always about you know advancing but it's also maintaining you know yeah that was into the presentation now it's time for a Q&A but before that you know would love for everyone to go on asp.net foundation there is a wish list there's lots of really good applicant resources our Twitter is yes or a TF underscore ESP yeah the wish list is not exhaustive as well so I think at the bottom there's one that says if you see if you have something that's not here and you have something creative apply anyway right the worst we could say is no and who knows right we also have a brand new newsletter so I'm just gonna shamelessly plug that in as well and you know sprinkle that in so if you know sign up find out what we're doing yeah awesome thanks Ken that's great I think one of the key things is that sometimes people given that I mean ESP has been around for at least a little bit right but they may not know actually what it does or what that acronym stands for so it's really good to get the background and and see actually your process to how you review projects and how you support them financially or otherwise absolute what did it have a different name previously or was it just like the grant program yeah so it was this really kind of grew up the out of the EF grants program um yeah with the have as he as the community really kind of grew in terms of just number and research capabilities and what a theorem can do I didn't make sense to just do France right even even the grants that we did give there was so much more that we did with the team there's a lot of hand-holding and a lot of times you know what we've realized was a huge help was really just providing them introductions providing them external feedback you know coordinating with all the projects who are doing similar things it actually is you know like for as beautiful as a community as we have I think you know coordination is still pretty as a problem for us and just you know being aware of other projects I think we see a lot more just because of the inflow of applications but just you know everyone else that we do know I think we sin a very unique position to have the opportunity to be able to be connected with more people so being able to bring people together in terms of you know any needs has been super helpful for I think a lot of teams yeah definitely does anybody in the chat or on the stream otherwise have any questions directly for Ken I know you're welcome to unmute and just ask away this is a perfect opportunity to get direct access to some of the people around program yeah I can this is how sure you might not remember me but the and I I reached out to you guys in the starting off for Apple and actually you guys were the one who invited me to this hackathon and because of that that they did rough idea OPP and I said actually grew up to be in an MVP stage for an alpha stage I just wanted to know can be really on ethereum foundation once we have the entire working product between 10 to do before the hackathon finishes so just wanted to know my question was whether we can reapply once we been from idea to a product seats or that idea has things considerably ya know we so we definitely remember you we actually I I was on the initial call I think that Trent kicked off for hack money and I was like dude that's harsh we told him to do that money so it was really happy about that I'm really happy that you suck all the way through and the answer is yes you can definitely apply it we're like the thing is ESP is supposed to be in an open door you know we definitely want you to reapply and that was the original intention for you to kind of go to ask money you know test out the project that you're working on you know and kind of go from there to come back awesome thanks thanks and really really awesome to know that you know you guys remember question I can everybody am pooja pooja from the ATM card holders team I hope you guys remember me - who okay so I mean about the newsletter thing it's really really really good good place to get more information about the ESP I was reading one of those and I found that if I'm not mistaken it's 2.5 million dollars over 2.5 million dollars q1 2020 grant is for the ESP so my question here is like in this particular wave we did not see a lot of non technical working groups like I wanted to know how open is ESP to support the non-technical group of the etherium ecosystem and this question may be relevant to the marketing initiative the community building another support yeah no it's really good question um we're definitely open to it this is there's there's very few things I think we would say for certain that we're not open to I think the trickiness here is that for community projects you know we want to make sure that what is being done is going to kind of encompass kind of what is most impactful and really kind of where the negotiations go negotiations go is and good I know you're privy to this but just for everyone else you know negotiations will take a little bit of time just because we want to understand kind of what the intended impact is how do we get there how do we make sure that we're limiting kind of any indirect downsides that it might cause for other people right there's ripple effects even if we don't intend for it and we don't expect it there are things that may happen so you know we're definitely open to it we definitely want to see it it's slowed down a lot just because of co vid and different other things like originally we actually had a bunch of our committee projects applying but we've seen a huge huge kind of downturn of that yeah I think you know the applications right now for you know physical meetups don't really make sense for physical meetups but obviously we're still doing sponsorships you know we do we still want to see more events happening we want to be able to support other people in the community so the answer is yes we still support it that's really good to know I see a couple of bullet points and the wish list which says that it supports community initiatives as well but unfortunately in this way we could not find it so was just curious thank you for the on second of course I mean like even hack money we're happy to support AK money bread' awesome looks like Doug Doug is up next hi-yah thanks for the talk and just a quick I put in there it's basically I probably it wasn't the slice what I missed it it's does the project I'm guessing the project needs to be something that betters the community so I'm guessing if it's a technical point has to be open source but we had an idea like chilling prove defy tooling around testing you know that there's a lot of hacks and if I and things you don't know really what's going on with your projects will it hits maintenance so we're thinking around the tool that improves that testing but at the same time we can make that oppressor but can we if it's viable as business can we made a platform around it afterwards is that a problem an issue a spear or that's not a problem a bit I guess I just need sir like a clarification what we're like the position around the licenses what what the output needs to be ease or serve yeah what is the position around making business out of that yeah definitely so this is a really good question it's super specific but I just wanted to call out that definitely needs to be open source like that is that is pretty much a bare minimum for projects that we fund and support in terms of kind of the licensing and and everything else I think it's a little specific so maybe you should apply inquire yes fee that appeared on foundation and we can talk more specifically about the project kind of what you're working on and of what your business model is and then kind of go from there help yeah yeah for sure well we'll do thanks cool of course correct me for Monken but I believe they're the ESP has supported companies or projects that turned into companies in the past right yes we have we have done that many times yeah which is exciting it's super cool to see you know something go from idea it's a fully fleshed out project to you know a functioning business right it's it's really awesome to be able to kind of provide that not just kind of the the you know I guess initial funding or whatnot but also being able to construct you know the best or the most conducive environment for success and for growth being able to determine exactly what in say like a three to six month time frame what success is going to look like how do we best reach that point who do we need in order to get there how do we kind of combine the right tools and people to bring us to that point I think is I mean it's so much fun to see yeah it sometimes that's the best outcome for specific projects is that they they move on from being just kind of a side gig to something that the people working on it can actually be supported by absolutely yeah any other questions uh yeah jump in here and introduce myself my name is Jesse I'm with the yield hero and you guys probably don't remember me because I haven't been able to attend too many of the video chats but I have seen you all in the discord and have been really enjoying the program working with coated and on it so my question for kin is more about just a one interesting point you made which i think is interesting you were saying how maybe certain applicants you would find that they would be better suited maybe further down the road tastes I think he used the example six months down the road are there certain segments of or types of aetherium projects that you're finding more interesting right now or more in demand at this particular time whether it's D Phi or NF TS or maybe something else maybe interoperability or or something along those lines yeah that's a really interesting question so in terms of trends for applications we definitely are seeing an uptick in D Phi right I think this is just where the community is and kind of what I think everyone is really excited about D Phi n empties and obviously e2 as always top of mind yeah I mean it's been really cool to see and kind of get the a good sentiment on where people want to drive either the NF t ecosystem towards or you know the D Phi ecosystem right so whether it's like a Dex aggregator or you know getting an energy marketplace to do you know automatic yeah Tomic swaps for NF T's or doing like like a crypto voxels in person or gets like in in CV kind of trading yeah I knew there's a lot of really cool stuff coming through the pipeline for sure thank you and and yeah I think maybe a quick follow-up like a tougher question would be what would be an example of something that might come through the pipeline and you'd be like you know that probably we're not there yet maybe it's certain things that would be better suited after 2.0 or yeah I don't know I wonder yeah this is this is another good question so there's I think a lot of things within each to that we're really excited to buy but it's hard to say that we need it now you know I think a lot of times we and I think this is this is again kind of going back to the same coordination issue right I think you know there's so many researchers out there in terms of there's that you to like R&D discord there is the e azam get er there are a lot of community resources out there just speak to team leads to speak to researchers like Danny or like a snake like Christian um you know there's just like I think it's really accessible direct channels to you know stake holders were literally driving these road maps forward and a lot of times we get projects that come in and you know maybe not maybe they haven't had the same conversation with you know Christian or x''k or you know any of the youth to I guess teams that's totally fine we're happy to make the introductions we're happy to kind of you know draw that bridge just so that we can have these conversations right we want to make sure that we can you know every step of the way we're not wasting resources not just from the etherium Foundation perspective but from the ecosystem perspective right we want to make sure that what you're building is going to be impactful for their team and what their building is going to be related to what you're building right you don't want to just build like a like the same thing that they're doing you don't do you know the same thing that the you hacen team is doing right you want to make sure that their spec is frozen you want to make sure that what you're building is related to the frozen spec once it's frozen or what your building is going to help them freeze that spec right and that's that's super specific but I do think that there's a lot in there where you know even if you're not sure the worst thing you do is reject us and we say we're not there yet and we're more than happy to kind of you know bring you to the right channel so you can speak to the right people to maybe readjust that roadmap or maybe kind of gets to the right point where you know or have a conversation and literally they change the roadmap for your project that's totally fine too and that'd be really cool anything else any other course I know we had a few people just joined recently so maybe they had some questions or something that they'd missed that they want clarification on let me double check the other live streams and see if we have any questions there I told Trent that I wasn't going to do a stand-up bit dancing make jokes that I'm not fully I think we've got everything cleared out I don't see any outstanding questions and any of the chats is that true anybody wanna they've been too shy they want to jump in and ask a question ladies oh sure go ahead hey guys I'm Erin I used to work at consultants work on Penn Valley right now there was a period where it seemed like the Theron foundation was really interested in like different ways of funding stuff like contributed to Moloch Dow I did a lot of the quadratic funding experiments is that still an area where y'all are interested in supporting experiment supporting experiments absolutely um so indirect funding is one of those things that I think where we want to make sure that you know in terms of where we can make the best decisions it's it's that we know that there are things that we don't know right we're still funding Bitcoin and and the the various quadratic funding around Moloch Dow as well we want to make sure that you know all the decisions we make are going to lead to the best outcome for aetherium and we're going to kind of advance some some subset you know forward we know that we don't always make the best decisions right we try to make the best decisions given the information that we do have we try to fund teams that we do feel our values aligned but we don't necessarily move as fast as say like almalik down right we can't just you know send one tweet out there and feel like this is it we're done in like two days we are a Swiss nonprofit you know we try to do things as fast as possible but we also know that you know we are we are who we are right and we we try to rely on a this decentralized decision-making process relying on advisors bring people in having a conversation and really trying to kind of flesh all that out but it's not always that's not always what unique system needs it's not what you know things that Moloch has been able to fund that we haven't been able to fund we would have been able to do all the things that they able to do we would have been able to kind of drive it as fast as they've been able to do same thing with get coin and get coin grants right I think it's been awesome to see what they've been able to do and you know not for nothing like convo has been really cool to see and you know we wouldn't be able to do what you've been able to do right so you know it's knowing that we have our own blind spots and understanding that you know maybe we're not the best decision makers we try to be we really do try to be but it's not always the case you know and I think admitting that understanding that and you know being able to do the indirect funding model helps us kind of alleviate a lot of that awesome I think your decisions are pretty good you know we try but that's not what Twitter tells me that's your problem yeah you're taking the opinions of Twitter cool I think that's it unless anybody's been holding back and waiting till the last minute to ask I'll start to wrap up and then if anybody remembers anything last minute feel free to jump in so for hack money logistics let's see what we've got going on this week tomorrow is the final check-in for your cohorts so make sure that you're checking discord you're checking in with youth global team members make sure that you're on pace to submit something for this Sunday very exciting but I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be really grinding this weekend out as they kind of try to get those last features in I know we'll be available over the weekend to try and kind of give support and make sure mentors are available we'll be there as best as we can so tomorrow is cohort check-ins Thursday is we have to hack feedback sessions if you haven't registered do that now please only register for one of the sessions if you register for both well we'll probably biases trying to get as many unique participants as we can typically these get oversubscribed and we run out of time so make sure that doesn't happen and you and you sign up early we'll have a bunch of mentors there so you can you'll have ten minutes lot and you can present get feedback on some of your project features and just generally make sure you're on the right track or also a few of specific considerations or specific problems that you need a dress like a solidity question should also able be able to address those things during those sessions again there's two sessions on Thursday make sure to sign up for one or earlier rather than later and they're they're gonna be really good they're always really productive and then Friday is the unis AMA they just launched v2 so make sure to sign up and register for that it's gonna be really interesting to chat with Hayden I'm looking forward to that I think that's it in terms of logistics we sent out the judging guidelines and process via email and in the skort Youssef if you have any questions please make sure to read that very thoroughly there are some requirements you're gonna have to make a video for submission and then there's just some other details in how you actually schedule yourself for judging so make sure to read that oh hey Morgie I'm shameless plug 8 oh yeah of course I was gonna let you let you wrap up where people can best connect with the program and I'm connect with you so go ahead now that you got it you can you can do it better than I can oh I'm an honorary member all right so if you have a project that needs funding or just guidance or coordination with other projects in the ecosystem reach out to ecosystem support program at EF underscore ESP or sign up for the newsletter ESP dot a theorem Dog Foundation that's like super easy yeah and there's a great team there they would love to help you make your project awesome more awesome than it already is if you crush the trick I'm glad to help all right all right final 10 seconds for anybody thank you everybody cool yeah I guess we can wrap there thank you everybody for coming out make their 14 axe axe emitted on Sunday thanks Ken and ten twenty kids you got your L see you all again soon yes sir yeah
