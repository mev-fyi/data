foreign [Applause] [Music] ition it over a couple minutes early here then we are going to have Elaine speaking next on uh Mev activity since the merge strategy Searchers and Builders during Market facts okay cool just checking if the audio is working right so in the next 15 to 20 minutes I'm going to go through uh some of the Meb activities since the merge I'll touch a bit on everything including uh the strategy the Searcher strategy the proposes the Builder competition market and and specifically touching to recent stress or Market crisis events um yeah so let's get started so before I go into the data I'd like to highlight the concept of nav um because it's a theoretical value that sometimes it's difficult to assess and obtain all the data on chain to do this so therefore we introduced a concept of realized extractable value so rev is the actual value that we can observe on chain that's from the Mev opportunities so before the merge we've done something similar by collecting the Rev from The Proposal balance change or the Minor map balance change and after the merge we are collecting the same data so here we're using the East send to the proposal as an approximation for the total rev but bear in mind the Rev Pi which is only a portion of the NAD be theoretical pie also contains different parts for example we only look at the atomic arbitrages the any of the opportunities we don't look at any kind of arbitrages outside one block there are also rebs on other domains on Cross domains and also on centralized exchange which currently we don't have too much data on these so the numbers that we see are currently in the ecosystem is mostly focused on Atomic Arbitrage or any of the opportunities on chain and some of you might be aware of one of the products that we have from flashboards which is called in math explore and there have been many quotations of the numbers from mavic's poor but just to highlight that MAV Explorer only represents a small portion of the pie so when you look at the data from map Explorer just bear in mind that doesn't tell you the whole picture okay so let's have a look at the nav activities since the merge on layer 1. um back in 2021 we have produced similar numbers using map explore here we're showing on the right hand side a 12 months coverage of Mev activities from liquidations and arbitrages and that's in territory of 475 million and bear in mind that the the dollar value is based on the East price at the time uh at the end this 2021 which is probably much higher than where we are now on the left hand side is what I'm going to show you um in the following slides this is the six months since the merge and in total we've seen the total is sent to the validators around 146 000 East that's equivalent to around 260 million in dollar value today um just looking at this number again just to highlight that we are using the East page to proposes as an approximation for the total Mev and we've seen this number having accumulating since the merge but uh you can see two distinct bio charts on the right hand side here where um the weekly numbers are actually much higher than the other weeks so these are the two events that I will talk about later on in my slides so these are the two Market crisis events happened recently one in November the FTX collapse one in March not too long ago the bank run on svb and also the shortly the packing of the stable coins um just to show you all the parties involved in the supply chain we're talking about only the East paid to proposes which is only one component or one a party involved in the supply chain and if we make a simple assumption to say the other parties um uh other than the proposed and the Searcher receives no Mev which is not exactly accurate at the moment for example the builders some Builders take do take a profit from uh building a Blog but let's just assume the breakdown is only between searches and proposes we see a 48 and maybe go into the Searcher and 52 going to the proposal so the numbers are shown in the previous slides only represent that 52 roughly on on average okay so since the merge what's happening uh with the relay so we see the relay competition uh has been increasing there are more relays in the ecosystem now than since the merge um at the beginning we have just flash votes um and block um and and no other relays in the in the ecosystem now we have multiple relays and you see flash volts um slot shares has has been decreasing since the beginning of this year at the bottom here you can also see the East paid from flash votes relay versus the others uh you also see there used to be a gap where flash was really pays more than the others but now this Gap is closing rapidly looking at the Builder space um also at the beginning we have um at the beginning since the merge we have flashboards and also Builder 0x69 um dominating the market but then the share from flashpoints Builder also uh starts to decrease since the beginning of this year and now we have shown just the top 10 builders in the space that we can identify but at the same time there are many uh other smaller Builders I haven't included which I will touch based on the later slides so later so what do we mean um by latency usually um among all the parties involved in the supply chain we look at when the block submission happens so this slide shows the time the validator um asks for the get header from the Builder so this is around 400 milliseconds after this the slot starts so after this 400 milliseconds the validator starts to ask for the bid From the Block Builder and when was the block ready on average here we see that the average winning blocks winning blocks means the blocks that actually lend it on chain on average they arrive 149 milliseconds before the slot starts I'm just going to show you the winning blocks um also the proposed of the landed blocks versus all the blogs submitted to a slot so this chart shows you actually um a very interesting uh picture that most of the blocks actually submitted in the last two seconds of the slot and this is what we are talking about in terms of latency so there is a delay from each involved party to submit the block as late as possible to the end of the slot so they can include as much a transaction as possible to increase the total profit so here this picture just shows you that most of the blocks that landed on chain arrives two seconds before and also some of them are too late two seconds after the slow ends but at the beginning let's say the the first 10 seconds they're not that many blocks being submitted so high latency in Block submission could cause some major issues for example the delay in the attestation and also the congestion in the last few seconds to the network I believe there are speakers talking specifically about the latency problem in the later sections so I won't touch too much details in this so now um zooming in to the two recent Market Panic events um one happened on the 9th of November when FTX sends three Arrow Capital collapse and the other one uh very fresh in your mind probably just a few weeks ago that we saw the svb bank run and the stable coins such as usdc and um uh and die Deepak shortly so here is a chart showing the Bitcoin price and the Easter East price during these two crises uh interestingly you see the the first crisis actually last much longer all the way until almost the beginning of February whereas the recent event recovers very swiftly so why do we um want to look into these two events and what is particularly interesting um so here we can see the daily Mev pay to the proposals have reached overtime High since emerge in a recent event and that's like nine times more than the average daily nav and that's due to the uh the usdc depict events shortly happened after the svb bank run whereas before in FTX collapse event we see a slightly less severe in terms of the nav sent to proposes but still six times more than the average um also looking into the Mev from a searcher's perspective we collected the data from uh I can find this is showing the Arbitrage sandwich and liquidation specifically during these two events you can also see the same pattern can be observed from this chart where the Arbitrage volume on that day skyrocketed and interestingly looking at a cross domain so the cross domain shows a slightly different story um the you you can see the FTX event is has more impact on a crosstalking whereas the recent Bank Run svb Bank Run and the Deepak event is more contained within the ethereum network so interest interesting data from semiotics across chain Mev um specifically we are going to look at how much easier were paid on these two days to proposes and what's the Builder competition look like during these two days and also the latency in Block submission and these are on ethereum and we're also going to look at the cross domain strategies on these two days so on the 11th of March um that when the bank run happened we we see that 6 000 East has been sent to the proposes so this is equivalent to or even more than the average weekly total ease paid who proposes so at the bottom here you see the weekly average is around four thousand where on that single day on 11th of March you see 6 000 paid um similarly on the 9th of November when FTX collapse you see around 4 000 it's paid um so these are extremely large single day Meb activities that I'm highlighting here um on the right hand side I um I have a breakdown by the builders um in terms of the total ease paid to proposes so in back in November we see that the top Builders flash was um Beaver build and Builder 69 dominates the market taking about over 60 percent of the of the market but in a recent event the top Builders caution have actually decreased and we see more Builders coming into the space and the non-top builders or the smaller Builders actually um takes 60 of the total is paid to proposes so you see a kind of um decentralization happening or diversification in the Builder Market from the recent event compared to back in November now what about the search strategies so we also look at these two days so on the left hand side you can see the Arbitrage on these two days and on the right hand side you can see the liquidation so bear in mind I mentioned the map inspect pipe which Powers the map Explorer dashboard is only counting liquidation and Arbitrage so it's only a small portion of what's happening on that day just to highlight the eigenfi also provides this data and they also cover a large a wider spectrum of the MAV types they also cover sandwiches and also uh probably more Protocols are in included but here I'm just sampling the data on these two days from Mev explore you can see that most of the Arbitrage happen among ethereum Bitcoin and stablecoin so the the in terms of the token that's been upped they're very similar between these two events but in terms of the liquidation it's more event based so as you can see the the recent event at the bottom here we see the the curve pool actually have gained a lot more uh portion in in the whole pie whereas the November event is also simply arbing through across different uh tokens okay um in terms of the search strategy by protocol uh this is also looking into math explore data where um we have included nine different protocols in this data um just comparing the two days we see the same story basically um back in November when FTX collapsed most of the arbitrages happened on uniswap V2 and V3 whereas the recent event we see an increase in the percentage in arbing on the curve uh stable coin pool and in terms of liquidation the recent event has um not much in terms of dollar value of liquidation or that's kind of obvious because the the recent event is not um highly correlated to a liquidation room event whereas the FTX has a wider effect in the market where more liquidations were happening okay in terms of latency um here on the left hand side we see uh the November FTX event and then on the right hand side we see the recent event very interestingly the chart on the right hand side is very similar to the overall chart that I've shown at the beginning of this presentation and it's probably showing that the latency gain is more severe um as compare if we compare it to the beginning of the merge because most of the blocks if you look look back to November are submitted quite evenly across different time frames of the 12 seconds whereas now most of the blogs are submitted in the last two seconds so just ensure spam of four months we see the latency game is more similar so this is probably not um not related to the market Panic events but more of a Time comparison in terms of the relay and the builders getting more sophisticated and competing on Landing the block yeah now looking at the crosstalking we have um two different types of uh events happening also on the cross domain the top Arbitrage tokens are very similar to the single domain or only theorem you can see most of the the hopping Parts happened or initiated from either the stable coins or Bitcoin or east so this is also very similar in terms of the percentage so it's probably not that different across different Market events um just one thing to highlight again the cross domain Mev in terms of US dollar value is much higher back in their FTX collapsing events but the recent event has a much lower uh Mez value looking at the the chains and the and the particular paths we see that ethereum and BSC and are the most frequently arbed chains and also one thing to notice is back in November we also see polygon and arbitrum whereas in a recent event it's mostly between ethereum and BSC okay lastly um just a little bit more detail on the top 10 arbitrages by profit we have shown the top 10 arbs uh conducted across different domains so this is the exact path the the Bots have simulated where the Bots can detect any Arbitrage opportunities just to bear in mind that the data provided here is not actual cross chain nav realized data it's based on simulations across different eight different chains and around 40 different decentralized exchanges and 60 tokens so there might be inaccuracy in the simulation where the missing Arbitrage opportunities or the missing data could cause the value to be even higher so just to summarize I'm talking a lot about different activities Mev Trends in L1 in Cross domain since the merge so what we can summarize is that we know that Mev estimation is very difficult we have only limited data from ethereum and own chain data there is a lactose data in any the estimation of nav in the centralized exchange activities we also observe like more relays and Builders coming into the ecosystem since the merge and the space is more Diversified um the top Builders market share uh interestingly during the high Mev periods have actually decreased so this is also a sign showing that the Builder Market is more Diversified than since the merge in terms of searches Arbitrage strategies we don't see too much of a difference between different Market crises most of the Arbitrage strategies focus on are being across ethereum Bitcoin and stable coins the liquidity the liquidation strategies are actually event based so if it's more of a um a crisis that's related to liquidation of certain assets then you will see the liquidation number in terms of Mev goes up but in a recent event this is not the case course domain strategies also have the same pattern there's the Mev activity spiked during the crisis but in terms of the magnitude on average it's much higher than the daily average probably because a lot of the cross-domain are arbitrages on a daily basis are not as much as on ethereum but when major events happen the Bots are searching everywhere for opportunities so that's why you see much more of a spike during these events and also the strategies differs from different Market crisis it's event driven and lastly I just want to mention that because of the lack of data we have a lot more room to improve in terms of the estimation of crossover vet domain Mev the centralized exchange to decentralized exchange Mev and there's still a lot of work to be done to collect the actual Mev activities and total values so here is a list of the references and also some of interesting readings that I recommend lastly a special thanks to Tina from flashcodes and I give five blocks route metrica semiotics and block native for helping me presenting preparing these slides and contributing to the charts and the data
