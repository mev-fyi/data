[Music] gm good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the web3 jam finale so you're all watching this thing on eat global.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time i encourage all of you to uh log in and say hi if you have any questions that come up during this event we'll be able to answer them for for you from the chat directly and anybody who signs in and engages with the audience will be receiving a co-app token at the end so this event is brought to you by eighth global and youth global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this thing primarily by running hackathons and summits and web3jam is our last event of the year it's a hackathon that invited 410 hackers from 51 different countries spanning 17 different time zones to work over the past week on really interesting and creative what 3 projects this is an incredible a map showing where everybody came from as a participant we're super excited to see all the diversity and and the different perspectives everybody brought in for this hackathon and on top of these uh representation of the cities we had over 20 ecosystem mentors six technical mentors and twelve ecosystem partners that were here with us um throughout the entire events to help all of our attendees uh get help in not finishing their projects or getting unblocked if they needed any technical help [Music] and not only that we had over a hundred thousand dollars in prices to be won from this event so today we're going to be going through everything that happened over the past 10 days this event has absolutely been incredible we had a hundred 101 incredible projects come out of it and yesterday on monday two days ago we went through the judging process for all of these hundred projects and we landed on ten finalists who will we will be showcasing um today in this live call so without further ado i'd like to congratulate these 10 incredible teams in no particular order i want to give a shout out to tweeter three feet die factor seashells crypto murals transdimensional inventory service nfts filter ens.me and backer these are our 10 teams that will be coming on stage today and showcasing live what they built over the course of the hackathon and then after that we'll go into all the prizes that uh everybody's won from this event so i know a lot of you are eager for prizes so uh you have to just sit tight a little bit longer until we go through all the incredible demos and as we were looking at not only just these 10 teams but also throughout what actually happened for those 101 submissions we saw some incredible and common themes for all of our projects uh decentralized media and ft's were obviously the most um common thing that everybody was excited about this kind of blends in everything from real world art to nfgs in general to gaming to video streaming you name it you're going to see a lot of that today and of course there was a lot of defined analytics people are still making it easy for us to understand what's happening on chain and that's going to be an evergreen sort of category for us to continue improving and on top of that there are an amazing set and amount of tools and projects we saw that are building tools and other utilities around making it easy for everyday folks to play and experiment and try out what's happening in all of what three so these 10 presentations will cover a lot of these topics and themes and i can't wait to get started but before we jump into our very first demo i want to quickly take a second and give a huge round of applause and shout out to these 91 projects here who did amazing work over the past 10 days for this hackathon and demoed their projects to the judges got some feedback got some great amount of eyes and users and even uh bug reports from our community throughout the hackathon and just because you were not one of those 10 teams it does not mean you were not good enough uh we want to really make sure that you are there to uh we are here to give you support and you have the ability to sort of continue working on this project and if you need help whether it's technical or on the product side or just if you are trying to make this bigger than a hackathon project we can help uh with all those things so really encourage all of you to continue working on these projects the time that we had for this event was obviously uh not not a lot to sort of see everything come to provision so i really encourage all of you to continue working and uh we're just blown away by the incredible amount of talent that came in for this event so without further ado um we can get started with our demos and before i jump into our very first demo i want to just quickly uh let everybody know that if you want to see what these hundred plus projects uh were you can head over to showcase.eatglobal.com and you can see a list of all the projects that came out of what three jam and uh didn't watch anything from their demos to their source code to read about how they work architecturally and under the hood all right so enough talking um let's get started with our demos so what we're going to do is we're going to invite these teams back to back and they're going to come on present live what they did and we'll move on to the next team we won't be able to do any questions because the time this time around so uh we're gonna have three teams come on now the first one's gonna be ens.me and then we'll have three feet and then crypto murals so um let's get started with our very first demo i would like to welcome tom to uh showcase ens dot me welcome hi there thank you very much um so my name is tom wade i'm based in england and i'm a solo team that created ens.me um a project aiming to visualize a user's ens domain to create a single link tries landing page quickly easily and effectively and directly from ens for the data and not only that but i really wanted to persist the information um that was stored across external decentralized applications uh for using ipfs there's also a small second application that forms part of vns.me but i'll come on to that a little later um so this is an ens domain at its source i've used nic.eds domain for this example as it's quite well populated but we could just use any domain so we all know that text records aren't that sexy but currently if you own an ens domain then this is what you're faced with and the default ens record keys do provide much more interesting data than traditional domains and one of the things i was really excited about is this gives us a lot more flexibility in what we can display in the information that we can pull through so through querying the graph and hitting the chain directly with ethers.js i was able to create a user-friendly representation of an ens domain um so we can see here on the same nic.edu profile that i just showed you we can pull through the ether dress and then proceed to send um send ethereum directly to his wallet we can link out to his website mail him at his email address go through follow him on twitter view his github and you know connect on discord as well as at the bottom we're able to directly link up to the ens domain there so if i switch to oh and just to mention this is all pulled directly through there's no um information edited from nikkei this is all just direct and if i go through to my profile um we can see that it's admittedly a little bit better than nick's um you can see that i've only got my ethereum wallet address i'll link out to ens as i haven't further populated my information and my avatar's also blank because i don't put anything there yet but if i go to hit manage because i'm the owner of this ens address and i'm connected via metamask i can now see the full extent of the data that could be pulled through if it was populated so if i wanted i could go through say i want to disable bitcoin like client does coin and just leave ethereum if it's uh they're pulled through disable my gilbert twitter etc i can go through and start disabling things so if i disable dns and i can also go in set a few colors um and start to customize the colors that will be pulled through onto my profile and i explain why i'm a little bit excited about that soon as well so if i hit update profile and then skip to the his one i did earlier effects and we can see i've now got a nice light pink background my buttons green colors change slightly to my preference and i've also hidden out the links that i wasn't wanting so there's no cost for this as all of the information stored directly to ipfs via pinata um and i was quite happy that that could then be persisted and indexed and also made public um and the reason why i wanted that to happen was if the user was then to query ipfs or add slash preferences to the end of their url we can start to see what a user's preferences is that are stored so if i come in through here um i can see that i want to display my avatar while display email and website um but these are my preferred background colors so if another decentralized app wanted to query this data once they connected their ens they can instantly get a range of preferences and data and pull them through to their application directly and start to customize the user experience over there um so for the profiles in the coming weeks um i'm going to be working with a small team to help develop the profile to start making it a little bit more impressive start pulling through richer media content such as a user's latest tweets rather than just a link to their twitter profile starting to incorporate pulling through nfts from a subsection of what a user has in their wallet start to create a little bit of a gallery and my real goal is to create a visualization of an ens profile that a user would be proud to share um and start to also offer that to decentralized applications as a central source so the second aspect that i briefly mentioned at the start of this talk um is one that i actually used to obtain my ens domain at the start of this hack so by querying graphql i was able to build a small application that pulls in expiring and recently expired dns domains and then allowing them to be filtered getting domain stats and also factoring in like cool down periods for when they'll become fully available and then starting to estimate the costs associated with that cooldown period and from looking at traditional domain offerings this is relatively common but i found it to be a really useful tool at the start and also quite quick to prototype um i'll be continuing to work on this too to pull through additional domain information additional filters reminders and pull in en estimates that are on the secondary market as well so you can see there's recently expired domains if you're looking to start a new project and you can also filter by keywords in the ens domain and the previous number of years it was registered for so if you were looking at an oauth service you know enslogging.eats available now so you know don't waste time i'm sure millions of people are watching just gagging to register that so with a combination of these two apps i'm actually really excited to continue building tools that will further the ens ecosystem and start to look at decentralized identification um which has got me really excited about web3 really um so yeah as a bit of an outro please feel free to try it out at ens dot me slash and then your e s domain and i'd also love to welcome you to join a fresh discord community that i've set up for keeping up to date with announcements on the roadmap which can be found at ens dot me slash discord thank you very much amazing thank you so much tom this is awesome not only is it an incredibly useful thing especially right now in this community it's it's live so anybody who's interested in checking this out head over to ens.me with that we are ready to move on to our second member for the day and that is project three feet so i'd like to welcome chris and caleb to get started uh hi everyone i'm caleb i'm based in victoria canada and my partner here is chris and i'm based out of canada as well so welcome here to three feed i hope everyone can see my screen okay uh three feet is meant to be a modern um feed reader system and content publishing platform so we're going to jump right in here so everything is hosted using ceramic which passes everything through to ipfs so everything you're seeing here is actually being pulled through um i mean a fleeq gateway so the co the app is hosted on fleek but it which again means it's hosted on uh ipfs everything passes through so you can see we just kind of have a base uh publishing platform heart it's completely built with react and next.js but it's meant to be a little familiar to those who use standard systems we have here is your id so the id is based on the distributed identifier from ceramic so that that's unique to each person and use that to follow creator so you can see here i've actually already followed someone um who conveniently has published huckleberry finn so you can see here i can go in read to my heart's content jump back everything works well but what might be more interesting is is this uh publishing platform and so we'll just jump there for now so we can enter uh you know really quick hi and then i'll i'll put something a little bigger and so you can see i just got some blank text but actually you know be nicer if this was a title you know i want to call out this lorem ipsum as well uh i'm gonna pull that so this is all just like a fully featured rich content editor the user can access how they want um and we're going to go down here we actually want to publish this now and i feel like i put a lot of work in so i want to actually make this page so we the the paid publishing is provided through unlock uh which means right now when i press this button we're going to connect to the unlock smart contract uh just on the rinkvie test network um okay the fees look good to me and this is going to publish a smart contract that that's going to lock our content so right now that's what's happening is we're running uh that this is all processing live on the test network uh and as soon as that contract's ready we'll see the pop-up confirmed and it's going to drop us right into that article which is now live on ipfs here we go looks nice and we can jump back and unfortunately you can't see it so for the for the demo action i wanted to demonstrate our subscription feed so i'm actually going to subscribe to myself so i can see my own content like that that's just for the demo um it takes a couple seconds here that's going to go on the fee your actual feed is going to ipfs and that's going to come around i'll pop up so we can see our article that we just published here but actually you know what i just wrote that i just looked at it um i don't actually want to view that now let's let's check out this thing i've never heard of alice in wonderland before i click on you can see it's locked um so here's kind of the fee to unlock um and you might those who are familiar with these kind of transactions you'll see that the gas fees are quite high but that's just for the demo um we want to go quick here so what this is doing now we're interacting with uh the unlock protocol to uh and not the the the lock contract from unlocked protocol it's going to verify that we have access to uh this article and you'll see in a few seconds that transaction will go through and and will be will be dropped right into our alice in wonderland article um so basically as you can see what we have here is a very simple demo um of what this kind of futuristic content authors look like so you'll see here okay we dropped right in [Music] and now that we've unlocked it we don't have to unlock it again we just have access and that's stored on the uh well it'll eventually be the theory main net but for now it's on the wrinkly test net but uh just one of the yeah this this this is kind of our our very uh bare bones uh in the future we want to integrate with the ceramic identifier like the self self id system which uh will allow us to kind of move away from these ugly dids and get into more like profiles similar to what uh ens.m is offering as well the unlock contract supports things like subscriptions which we haven't baked in so there's actually there's a lot here that we're gonna we'd like to flesh out um as well as adding support for things like email uh and discovery feeds which can be hosted uh in a decentralized fashion so a lot here uh thank you for listening uh and goodbye from three feet caleb and chris thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh yeah this is exciting um can't wait to uh get more and more decentral's version of existing services that we use uh up on mainnet so with that we are ready for our third demo and that is going to be project crypto murals so i'll have uh the hello everyone and welcome to cryptomurals the new way to start collecting this on the blockchain uh i'm not a hiraldo a designer and digital art producer from colombia we teamed up with claudio chunorus a developer and musician from patagonia argentina but living in france uh here sir sorry crypto miracles is a web 3 platform to collect curated street art around the world as dynamic nfts want to support the creators muralists motion designers festivals the platform and the public are heritage i would like to share with you our short video before starting the demo list maybe the sound is not going to come out so i'm just going to play it like this tell you we don't have uh audio okay so just continue so uh in the video you can see the qr code that you can scan with your phone and open the gateway to go to crypto mirrors on the overlap reality experience so i'm going to go around the overlap create experience uh here is a demo on how the overlap reality works once you scan the qr code you will land into a dedicated web app of the mural that will show you the artist the motion designer and the owner's address then you will hit the live experience and this location will be activated and then you will find the image target that you will need to match e with the paint in front of your view or click on it to enjoy the animation at the end of the experience you will be able to place a bit and you will be redirected to the cryptomurals that eat website so once you connect your wallet you will see the nft marketplace with all the information related to the nft you'll also have the option to see all the murals around the world who has been geolocated we invite you to go and catch the uncatch them during your trips so now we're going to our live demo mvp we used nfd port to deploy our smart contracts and store our metadata on the interplanetary file system ipfs and file coins such as your location and the animations so here we are in our website uh so here we have the login here you can log out as well uh so here you can see the nft and then you can place a bit to buy it right now it is not available to buy it but uh here we are in the admin section so we will have these options like start the auction like minty nfd and upload the image also here we have for example the minter we have the sorry about this here uh i have the minter here so here we can choose the file just upload it as regular and here we will have like to wait a little bit until the meeting is completed and then we also have the action launcher that will be allowed to commit and to start the action for the mirrors that we will start collecting we also have this media blogger to connect to the ipfs so as we continue with our presentation and here we can see the deployment of the contracts where we can see the four parties and the description of the nft the idea here is to share all the sales between the creators and creator murals so for our next steps we are planning to go mainnet we named it with dynamic nfts linking with live beer for live streaming gaming gamification with rewards community tokens and metaverse integration we want to have a sprint test with five artists and motion designers to get ready for the international public art festival on june 2022 in europe so thanks so much for your time cryptomineos will be on the streets very soon if you want to be up to date please follow us on twitter instagram and discord have a good one everybody bye bye thank you so much that was an awesome uh overview of crypto murals and uh yeah i am i'm more and more excited to see what projects are doing to bring in and blend in the real world uh art with smart contracts and nft so this has been amazing thank you so much thank you bye-bye next up we have our second group of projects so we're going to invite backer trans-dimensional inventory service and future to come on and present and without further ado let's welcome mark from backer to uh share what he built hi my name is mark kerry from toronto canada and i'm here to present backer which is a web3 version of patreon creators can get paid by their backers creators can get paid an erc20 token of their choice this gets streamed in real time from the backer to the creator using the superfluid protocol creators to find multiple tiers of membership at the same time they they launch their own erc20 token which gets streamed to active backers higher tiers can receive a higher multiplier of creator tokens to provide that extra incentive to use the higher tiers each tier deploys a lock on the unlock protocol and active backers get an nft key that can be used to access membership benefits for that tier specifically the onboarding process takes only about five minutes and a creator can be set up and ready to go but i don't have that much time for the demo so i'm going to show the onboarding screens really quick here as slides first of course creator connect wallet choose the token that they want to get paid in this example of choosing die name your own backer token symbol the number of tokens you want to pre-mint create your first tier choose name price and the multiplier here's an example after creating three tiers and the next step would be to create a create a profile name description some images social links all this profile data gets saved to ipfs and the cid gets stored in a smart contract okay with that we can move on to the live demo so we're going to start off here as a not as a creator but as a prospective backer so i'm looking at a profile here a creator profile here and i can see the information the photos the social links and the here are the tiers that we saw before so i'm going to join the uh the fan tier here and i should it's going to cost me 10 die per month and i'm going to earn 100 run tokens per month i'm just waiting for a meta mask here this is all live on the rinkeby network if you want to give it a try there we go uh so a confirmation that i've joined so i can hit this link to add the run tokens uh to my meta mask so they'll show up there and you can see the custom icon that i chose when i saved my profile so one thing i can show quickly trying to change tabs here but zoom is uh in my way what i want to do there we go quickly as the user here i can see in the superfluid uh dashboard i can see the two streams now the payment i'm making uh to the creator and what i'm getting back um you can ignore the dollar amounts for now because superfluid doesn't really understand how much a run token is worth perhaps nobody else does either so let's go back to the app and i'm going to switch to the creator view of this same one so i'm just going to switch users so i land here on the dashboard and i get graphs of the uh the balance and the flows uh that are coming in and you can see here the uh the balances of the run token uh you can see how it's the ones that are you can see that the balances are changing here in real time because these are flowing in and out uh via superfluid some other stats here as well here's a list of numbers various tiers you can sort this and filter it you can see how many backer tokens they have in their wallet so you can see who are the big supporters uh the revenue to date if you look closely here you'll see that these revenue and backer tokens they're constantly changing because these are real time streams the tiers tab we kind of saw this before on the slides i can add more tiers here profile this is where i can change my profile upload photos to ipfs i can preview the profile there it is again we saw this on the balance tab this is where the creator can withdraw funds from the account that they've earned from creators there's a tab here for their own token and here they can send tokens to members of the community or anybody these don't get streamed they get sent directly over here we have an nfts tab that's coming soon [Music] and that's about it another thing here it won't show is you can you can add team members who can also view the dashboard next steps as i mentioned nfts feature i'd like to offer the ability to create nft collections and meant nfts either for auction sale or just for community rewards i'd like to create a public directory or showcase of creators using backer i also like to get some feedback and advice from crypto content creators because i see them as potential early adopters a convenience layer for enabling credit card subscriptions it's not very decentralized but i think opening up the uh the audience to people who are not quite ready to use metamask and and such would make sense uh finally looking towards a polygon launch mainly due to the high gas costs which are a big barrier to both offering and subscribing in this kind of a scenario so that's it for backer thanks so much mark real time memberships is awesome can't wait to see more of this and uh i wish y'all meaning this deployed on mainnet next up we have trans-dimensional inventory service and now will be here to tell us what he built whenever you're ready hi everyone my name is will i'm a student at the university of waterloo and i created uh tis or the trans-dimensional inventory service so tis is inventory for the metaverse what is the metaverse supposed to be it's supposed to be a shared digital universe to live in right now the metaverse is many separate web 2 universes tis provides a way to share a common inventory across multiple metaverses it bridges the gap between web3 and current metaverse technology tis provides a framework that can be used with current metaverse technology in order to access future metaverse data so here's a demo of me using tis to bring my nfts into roblox so i created this place in roblox that allows me to show off my nfts to my friends so if i just click here it loads a list of my nfts on polygon so my regular nfts are just shown as like this it tells me the name of the nft the contract as well as like its description and token id but if i have nfts that have a metadata made a metadata field of roblox asset id i'm actually able to spawn them in roadblocks so for example i can spawn this dog i can like push it around and interact with it and it can walk i have another nft which is a car so if i spawn that in it'll load in and i can actually interact with it and drive it around and i'm just gonna wait for it myself to respawn oh looks like some of my friends joined and i can also um spawn in this like grappling hook and interact with it and like shoot it around and it'll pull me etc and i also have this tower so i can actually have really big objects and stuff like that um i think one of the one of the most important things about nfts in the metaverse is you can have nfts that actually do things whereas regular nfts might only just be a static image that doesn't do anything nfts in the metaverse can actually have functionality i can get in this and like goof around and stuff like that so i'm gonna exit roblox for now and i'm going to head over to my openc page and if you look at my openc page you can actually see some of the nfts that i have so i've got this dog i've got this car grappling hook etc and this tower and if i just look at the metadata of one of these nfts the only thing it needs to support roblox is this roblox asset id field and yeah here's the dog so i'm gonna go back to my presentation so uh what technologies behind tis so in order to make the roblox framework i needed to uh use roblox studio covalent is used to source the web3 data so that's how i get the information for the nfts et cetera an nft port and ipfs are used to create new web3 data so that's in order to create nfts that are compatible with roblox etc and other metaverses so in the future i want to be able to support more metaverses rather than just one to actually like bridge the gap i think vr chat is a really promising next step and i also want to be able to sort source data from multiple chains so if you want to try out the roblox demo yourself if you're a roblox account you can head over to tiny dot cc tis demo to try it out for yourself amazing thank you so much will that's uh you can just see everybody excited about this right now in the chat and this is this is awesome uh not only is it just a cool demo but it's also live so you can try this out directly and um we'll we'll paste the link for tiny dot cc slash ts demo on the global tv chat too congrats uh and next up we have patrick and evan who are going to talk about vulture so without further ado let's welcome the next team awesome hello everybody uh my name is patrick and i'm my co-host evan yep evan's here uh i'm from bentonville arkansas and i'm from rogers arkansas and uh today we're going to demo focus uh let me just give you a quick overview of what we made here for this hackathon uh focus is a social marketplace that is built off of photos that you take with your smartphone camera everything on the app can also be remixed let's talk about that a little bit more here's an example of a photo that you might see on your feed in focus taken with an iphone or an android camera there's three different things that you can do with photos on your feed you can either like them pay a small gas fee to do that you can purchase it for the price that the creator listed it for and you can remix or edit the uh creation and create something new and unique yourself so if you were to create a remix you could you know make something like this for example uh crop in add a few stickers to it create something brand new from it and the symbiotic relationship between the parent and child is very apparent in our app if you are viewing uh an edit you can see the parent as inspiration and if you're viewing parents you can see all the edits that uh people have made from that photo and if you come across my edit on your feed and you decide that you need to buy it and add it to your collection uh the original parent will actually get a cut and a kickback from the sale and this will be the first mobile app that supports ethereum purchases for nfts on mobile currently uh evan i'm going to kick it back to you for the demo here all right so as you can see here i have our our feed screen up uh for the sake of time i won't go through the process of uh photo nevermind sorry um but uh i will go through the process of doing a remix so here you see uh this uh picture of a bet that i made before if i click this link in the top left of it i'll come to our photo editor uh here we have different options uh stickers uh text and whatnot uh but for for now let's let's add a sticker so add the sticker uh click this button in the bottom right it's saving an image and what will come up is uh a modal to put in our uh information so this will be the metadata for the nft so this is a remix i'll call it remix five description of remix and then i get to choose a tag and i will say art i click save nft and what this is doing is it's uploading the the image to ipfs uh then it's uploading the metadata then it's going to take me to my preferred wallet to uh confirm the maintain uh so here i am in rainbow if i hit confirm uh do the face id and now i can go back into culture uh so while that's going uh let's go through another flow uh this is unfortunate uh i'm working with uh less internet than i generally have uh due to the holidays in the u.s so we can go a minute or so if it works [Music] yeah i'm i'm i'm not sure my bundler it has enough juice to get it to uh there it is we're back perfect there we go [Laughter] all yeah so um so now i'll just uh do something uh simple for now uh right here we have the uh original image of the bed uh this one is actually up for sale so we'll go through that flow uh if i hit buy uh the price is is .01 matic we give you the approximate usd price and that will show up in rainbow for me to confirm the transaction the approximate price is a little over one cent i'd confirm and again that transaction is going through i believe if i hit here i can see that it's sent and then go back into filter and now patrick if you want to talk about any other future developments that we're trying to do absolutely yeah in the future we want to be able to support video and using our rich editor for handling video editing as well as photos we also are going to be supporting a faucet in the future as well to be able to support your first matic transactions in our app we also have a full-fledged camera here that we did not show as a part of this editor but again we hope to be the first ios and android app to support ethereum nft purchases uh for the mobile market well thank you uh so much and uh this was awesome uh murphy's law is always a concern when doing live demos but uh you pulled through this worked out everybody is excited about what you're doing and uh can't wait for uh this to go live on the app store congrats appreciate it kartik thank you very much all right so with that we are ready for our last four demos so we're going to bring on twitter nmt's die factor and seashells and they're going to talk about what they built and then after that we'll get into all the prizes so without further ado let's welcome tweeter we have richard and thomas okey dokey hello everyone i hope you're having a great morning evening wherever you are um we are team tweeter and this is our project for the web3 jam hackathon um uh our team we actually recently created the dao we are 404 dao and are very proud to kind of get started work on these projects consisting of four friends who are formerly all from the same college now spread out throughout the us uh and these are our telegram handles in case anyone wants to message us later um so the goal for our project was to create a social layer for ethereum um because we think that you know with these wallet addresses that often are very long and not very beginner friendly and intimidating plus there's they're hard to like kind of be able to easily recognize other you know people's wallets just by name alone right because they're so long and complicated we want to make it a little bit easier and create this social fabric for the ethereum network our solution to that is twether which is a completely decentralized web3 site that lets you follow your favorite wallets it streams live wallet transaction activities for your followed wallets supports ens and address lookup for convenience and also includes nfts as profile pictures for addresses that do contain them so with that let's hop into the demo here is our site which is live at this link and i'll have it later as well i've already connected my wallet so we're going to go ahead and just click that and we're at our feed um currently all of the wallets that i'm following aren't actively trading and since this only shows live transaction data nothing's populating yet um but let's show an example of us adding another address to follow so i'm going to search up the ens for vitalik we have his site here as well as his current balance and the ability to follow him so we'll get follow wait a little bit as that goes through and if we go back to our page we now see that we're actually following him and can click on the site and all those things also notice that we have the nfts here for those people who have them available if we want to unfollow them all we do is click on the card we're brought back to this simple card ui uh hit unfollow and then we are no longer following vitalik uh but let's say we want to spice up our feed and actually see some things here so i'm going to enter the address for a pretty hotly traded ftx wallet these do take a little bit longer to load so as this is loading i'll kind of explain the main pieces of logic in our engineering flow we use ceramic backed by pfs to kind of store all this social graph of followers and followees and we actually don't use the ceramic id for this what we use is deterministic queries uh where we kind of take someone's address and append a tag to it to allow us to represent that kind of follower network which is a pretty um great way to keep this basically free to use and also um pretty powerful so here we have this uh wallet address now we're going to click follow and now we're following this wallet as well if we go back here we can see it here and if we go to our feed we actually already see some transactions that they're making so we see the sender the receiver the transaction hash as well as the value how many block confirmations it took the transaction type and the gas price plus the time um it's already you know populating even more but one cool thing is if you click on this actually it will take you to etherscan so you can read more in-depth information about uh what's actually going on so that's about it for a demo um back to the slides i'll kind of talk about how this whole thing works in our next steps uh so how it's made as i said we use ceramic which is decentralized storage basically for our social graph via ipfs um ens and nft port are great additions to allow users to query easily for people's uh ens instead of you know complicated addresses and also display nft profile pictures for some added flair ethers.js allows us to provide the live feeds for those transactions for the fallout addresses next js and reactor are the backbone for our ui framework and then for cells used for deployment next steps for tweeter specifically is we love to kind of build out this feed it's a little annoying that you have to be following you know either a lot of wallets or you know wallets at trade a lot to see information so we want to make it you know historical and searchable transactions available as well as reactions you know as we want to kind of build the social network a little bit here uh commenting favoriting emoting all these things are really integral to social networks we'd love to add those features um to this decentralized protocol basically additionally we want to you know give people the ability to personalize their profiles if they want so beyond just the nfts that are in their wallets you know adding other options as well um really though we see this as more of kind of a demo for kind of what we want to build in the future so the end goal really is to create an api that allows other dapps to integrate with our social graph um kind of think about how like google facebook twitter these all sites allow login options for a bunch of third-party sites um we think that something like this for the um web3 decentralized world would be really really powerful and useful um especially because ours is you know free and decentralized um the way i think about it is like tweet there's just a demo of that social graph in uh in action um and to close i'd just like to challenge you to think about a future where like every dap that you log into automatically knows the wallets you care about and automatically knows that network around you and i think that can be a really powerful thing moving forward for for all of us so uh with that uh i want to thank you uh enjoy the rest of your day here's the link to our demo app if you want to try it out um and we actually just recently set up a twitter within the discord so feel free to follow us at 404 dao for updates about this project and more to come thank you thanks richard um this is awesome and uh hopefully we all get to use it soon in production so congrats and uh next up we have ianis who's going to talk about nfts whenever you're ready hi so i'm janis i'm from paris and i will present you my project for this hackathon my project is nfcs with a z and so what is nft so who i am first uh i'm project manager i quit my job a few uh weeks ago uh to focus my to focus on building products on rep three and so um a bit of context uh why i'm building uh nfts uh and what is nfts so nft is a figma plugin uh that enables uh uh designers uh to to um to mint nft directly from uh from figma so why uh so a bit of context i saw that adobe will empower their users with on-chain solutions uh and also i'm a big fan of figma the most used product design software uh with four million users so why i'm building nfts so first it's to uh on board the talented web 2 designers on web3 and i think that's the the easiest way is to go search for them on their preferred tool second reason it's to create new opportunities for creators i know that there is a lot of creators that are designing uh designing nfts on figma and i think it's a cool way for for them to to um to uh to monetize their their work and also uh the long-term idea is to uh enable designers to monetize uh design elements so create a new economy where they they can buy sell buy ui elements or an entire design system for example so let's start a quick demo so here i'm on figma and i created this nice design and so i will use my plugin so first i can give a name to my nft so let's say web3 jam nft and a description a super cool nft minted from figma and the ethereum address where i want to receive this nft and so i can start meeting so what the plugin is doing is first i will upload the image on ipfs using nft nft storage api so i can check that my image is uh well stored on ipfs and then i'm using nfc port to to mint the nft on rinkeby so we can check that the transaction is well made so here is my image stored on ipfs the design i made on fema and so we will come back uh in a few in a few seconds so about the the product so uh uh what is the product so as you as you saw it enable you to create uh nfts but uh also you you will be able to search for nfcs uh directly from uh from from fema and also manage all your nfts created and so what's next uh for uh for my project so i hope to release the the the the plugin uh in two weeks uh with uh um with uh the domain thing available on polygon um and uh also i will work on store more metadata about the design so for let the users uh upload more metadata about their designs and also enable the users to fetch stored design elements to use them on their figma designs so we can check now that our transaction is well made so uh this is our transaction uh we we we've just minted our our design and also we can check our openc profile to to make sure that the the nft is uh is minted he's here and uh now i can i can uh i can sell i can sell my uh just i can sell directly my my design uh on uh on on openc so sorry my my connection is a bit is a bit slow but uh we can see that the the the nft nft is here and uh and as you know you you can you can you can sell the sell it on on opencv so um i hope i hope to see you to see you soon on female using uh using nfts uh with a z and uh and thank you thank you all for your attention amazing thank you so much and uh i this is this is incredible just uh mint empties directly from figma go straight to the source uh can't be more excited so can't wait to try this out in two weeks thank you so much and with that we are ready for our next demo and i want to welcome the die factor team to come on and showcase what they built hi everyone so this is dye factor we are presenting our project for the web3 jam hackathon for if global so we are a team of three antoine is a is our blockchain developer he took care and full stack developer he took care of the api endpoint connections and was him took care of the ui ux and the front-end development salome our project manager took care of building the roadmap for die factor prioritizing the development features we all work for blockchain partner by kpmg which is a french leading company in the blockchain consulting market so the idea is to i don't i don't know oh sharing swing is not working anymore so i'll share i'm sorry everything is good now okay great so here's the team so i presented it so now for the idea it is to generate your wallet score based on your past activities to access advantages and bonuses in decentralized protocols the use case is to generate your score based on your wallet activity using some api endpoints and data analyze the activity score and compute this score based on some criteria and mint an nft score to access these advantages uh on other platforms so here's the demo this is the die facto landing page we connect our wallet i already have a wallet connected now the score is computing this is my score which is based on some criteria i'm gonna change my wallet to see that i have some other details for the other address i have some we chose some criteria arbitrarily so for now we have six criteria the cumulative balance nft holdings token holdings scam tokens and these criteria are used to compute the score we have some bonus scoring criteria based on some specific protocols like having an ens or having nfts on the zapper verse so now i'm going to mint the score on a ring kb so while it is minting i'm going to explain all this data is used uh is taken from equivalent api and ens api and then computed on the front-end side this core meeting happens using nft port and it is made on rinkeby so now we have our nft we can check it on either scan for rinkeby we can have the details that are stored on ipfs the score and all the details for the scoring are all on ipfs we've made an integration screen that we couldn't finish but the idea is to make that that scoring protocol accessible from other platforms the the ideal would be to have a an integration button that would give access to some limited content maybe an article or something we could imagine memberships on unlock or better landing grades for ave or an airdrop system management or using this call so now we'll get back to what's under the hood so we've used covalent api we've used the ens api to check if the address has an ns ipfs has been used to store the nft metadata and nft port for the con nft contract contract deployment and the nft minting on the front end the next steps would be to go mainnet make the integration thing that we mentioned with unlock make a library for integrations for this very button and then write the integration docs for to be to make it accessible from other platforms and then build the dow to make uh to enhance the criteria and the criteria make the criteria selection decentralized the other thing that we didn't mention on this slide would be to add the details of the scoring so thank you for listening to us i hope you liked our project and bye bye thank you so much that was a incredible demo and uh congrats on making this work thanks so yeah hopefully we get to see this on mainnet soon and with that we are ready for our last demo of the day so without further ado let's welcome our last team and that's ahaz who's going to talk about seashells whenever you're ready hello everyone so there has been this meme if you know going around which goes like i'm gonna right click your nft and that basically marks the nature of energies just being an image and how it can be saved now we know it's much more than that and recently a lot of games have started to emerge in the space around those mfps and trying to put these in interactive spaces sometimes it's 2d nfts in the gallery but the mft is still an image there and 2d image in a 3d environment and just sometimes it's in an interactive nfd space or a full 3d nfp so this experiment is to promote those kinds of usages in games so if you are interested in those or are developing games then you'll find some interesting things in this presentation and project i am search and this is seashells seashells it's made on top of lobster down nfts which are 2d mfps on a fixed layout it contains some different characters and some different properties so the idea behind seashells is it's a visualizer and the idea is to wrap these 2d nfps in the 3d interactive environment and put these in a game engine which then enables a lot of possibilities for the visual part they have been uv unwrapped and for collections following fixed layout if we just do it for different characters our rest just lines up properly with this we also need uh we also want our metadata in games to do interesting things and maybe some extra properties so here we showcase use of ipfs as database for immutable systems and games to define character properties um objects or part of logic etc and a few different nft apis based moc in square unity 3d so within lobster we have a ranking sheet created by michael one of the lobsters and this sheet not only contains all the metadata but it also contains a lot of extra numbers based on rankings and we can use this very creatively in our games so this sheet has been hosted over ipfs now what this has done is it has made this sheet immutable and every time we need to define our character or properties we refer to this sheet and in this sense we can use kind of similar approach to create more complex systems and games so it's live at seashells.embracing.space and let's jump right in so here we are in the space and we can put in any of the numbers from our collection [Music] so what this has done it has read our ipfs database it fetches the image also from ipfs each time it assigns the model accordingly it wraps it onto an image [Music] and it assigns other character properties accordingly which can be seen on the right and left sides of the screen once it runs so from here on they can be we have all our metadata image everything wrapped in a 3d interactive enviro environment and it can be used in games or just have fun in interactive environment so alongside this within unity3d we have examples of nft port covalent and openc api to get all nft data in unity which can be used to get more dynamic and live data and here we have all the attributes backgrounds images etc and from there on it was the visualizer which you saw so i think all these step together nft with their metadata and attractive real-time environments has great potential to be expanded on and we know um this is like a lot of the next upcoming trend which is coming into space that's my presentation thank you thank you so much that was an awesome demo to see um especially when you worked live with the pulling in the data directly um i can't wait for more of these to uh to come on and uh yeah hopefully we get to use more nfts and cut them from 3d congrats all right so that was our 10th demo in our 10th final list i just went live this makes all the demos we want to show today um to to all of you so i want to connect with all these 10 teams one more time that's tweet third three feet die factor seashells crypto murals tis nfts voter ens.me and backer the one thing that's kind of super interesting to me and i want to point out is that all these things have uh two very thing very two similar properties in common the first is they're all in a position to be live and be used by everybody very soon whether it's mainnet or testnet currently and they're all targeting mass adoption of web 3 and crypto and this is something that gets me excited every time because i hadn't been in this space for so long and seeing how we make progress from a developer and a product standpoint seeing the outcomes here for web3 jam brings me a lot of joy so i can't wait to try all these products out in a couple of weeks and with that we are ready for even more good stuff and that is all the prizes that all you've been waiting for so um i want to quickly thank all of our partners here for this event to our uh might be a fastball coin live pier ethereum foundation ceramic fluence nft port unlocked protocol vns covalent gelato and navigrand style they are they've been here for this event helping out everybody participating to really get their products accomplished and also giving out a lot of credible prizes so uh we cannot jump right into what everybody received so for the very first ipfs and falcon prize uh scitime gets ten thousand dollars for the best use of ipfs legal nft will receive the second place five thousand dollar prize and omnivision will be receiving three thousand dollars for the best use of ipfs third place for the best decentralized media hack match app will receive

them equally so that's hong chain huddle one lord of computer nfts nft hour pottery seashells tis and tweeter and all these projects and all the prizes that everybody's won are now available on the individual project page for each of your projects so if you missed any of those lists or you couldn't get a screenshot fast enough don't worry they will all show up on on your project page as well as we'll be announcing them on discord and notifying everybody over email over the next few days and there's also a couple projects that we haven't been able to uh to announce yet because we're still working on figuring out the logistics for it so if you didn't hear your prize for the sponsor don't worry we'll be sharing that info on discord shortly so before we wrap this up i want to quickly say a few quick thank yous for everybody that helped make all this happen and that includes all of our judges mentors speakers volunteers sponsors and of course you all the hackers so quickly these are all the judges that were there to get feedback to all the projects and do all the hard work in making this event a success and showcasing the 10 projects that we saw today so thank you to all of our judges and then also want to thank jeff discordia and durable james and montfay for being our technical mentors they were there answering questions hosting office hours and really helping you get unblocked around the clock and getting your projects working so thank you so much and an incredible set of amazing speakers that were here giving talks workshops the summits all these people are incredible in educating what's happening in web3 and encouraging more people to get more excited in the space so thank you to all of our speakers and all the amazing partners that were doing all the work behind the scenes to make sure that the events of success for all of you here whether that's being able to help you with the the sdk integrations or bugs or helping you come up with a good idea or giving you feedback for the feedback sessions all these amazing people were there to make sure that you all succeed and of course i want to thank some of our volunteers who were here doing the the work behind the scenes to make sure that everything went smoothly whether it's this call or the judging sessions or any of the asynchronous things that you all have experienced in making this event more global without the work they've been doing you would not have a smooth experience so i want to thank all of them here as well and lastly i want to give a quick shout out to anna moaz nisha shangan luke emily andrew jacob heather and liam from youth global team um who are there to make sure that all the events that you experience are absolutely amazing and invite the best people to get all of you excited again to continue building in web 3. so the final list so we saw 10 amazing projects here talk about what they did they did a live demo they showcase what they're doing as well as making sure that you get to also remain excited and try them out at future and live and if you've been part of any global event before you know that um we don't have innovation at first second third we don't want this thing to be a competition it's really about making sure that people are here to learn and experiment and really improve um and just better themselves and what's happening um whether it's just for curiosity or for a career change so uh when we call somebody a finalist uh to us there are our first place winners so all ten of these teams are officially our first place for for this hackathon and as part of that each team member will be receiving 1500 dollars uh been nominated in endy or another stablecoin uh for being our finalist so congratulations to all these teams uh if you are a recipient of a prize or a finalist we will be reaching out to all of you over the next couple of days in discord and on email so keep an eye out for that and we'll be facilitating all the price distribution with you accordingly so congratulations to everybody again uh this has been an exciting and incredible amazing event for uh for all of us um and on top of that this is our last event of 2021 so i want to thank everybody who made this happen and i can't thank all of you enough for really getting everybody else excited about what's happening in what three so before we go i want to do a quick 60-second note on how this year has been for each global as you kind of mentioned me saying this is our last cycle of the year um we will be continuing a lot more things in 2022 and i can't wait to tell all of you about what's happening in uh over the next few months and all of next year from our side but before we kind of close off today's live stream i want to quickly give everybody how this year went from the global side we started off and we finished off this year by running nine hackathons and eighteen summits uh this is definitely the most amount of things we've done in any given year um and we were thrilled to be able to not only do this stuff but also invite so many incredible people throughout these uh events we hosted over 5 700 hackers just this year alone who contributed over 1337 projects we gave away over one and a half million dollars in prizes and hosted more than 450 talks workshops interviews and discussions and when we pulled the numbers last night together it blew our mind on the reach here so i i'm still shocked by the incredible amount of people that are excited about web3 because everything that came out of each global this year has gone over 360 000 eyes of just all the people watching the talks and interviews and workshops we had over 65 000 people come and tune in on the summit content and over 50 000 hours worth of talks has been watched collectively from all these people who we've hosted from 117 different countries spanning 21 different time zones so i am blown away by how global this community actually is and i couldn't be more excited to continue doing more things for everybody here as a team next year and years to come so thank you so much to everybody who was part of all of our events whether it's on the live stream or as a participant or as a speaker as a judge or as a sponsor or as a mentor you all made this happen and you got thousands more people excited about everything that's happening in this space so sincerely thank you so much for being part of the global community and i can't wait to see all of you again next year and with that i want to sign off on web3 jam and we'll see you all in 2022. thanks everybody hope you have a great rest of the week and happy thanksgiving to those who are celebrating we'll continue back very soon and you'll see what's next in the next few weeks signing off congratulations again you
