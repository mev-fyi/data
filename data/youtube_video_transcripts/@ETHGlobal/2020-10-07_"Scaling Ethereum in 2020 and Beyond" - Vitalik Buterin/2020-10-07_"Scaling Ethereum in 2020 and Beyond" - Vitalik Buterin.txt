okay well we'll just take it away then um i want to introduce metallic who needs no introduction um his talk is about scaling ethereum in 2020 and beyond and i'll just let you take it from here b thanks very much excellent great um just checking you can hear me you can see the slides fine everything's great okay great um so hello everyone um good to be speaking to one uh wonderful ethereum people again i'm definitely sad that i can't see you in person um hopefully we can fix that up um next year in august in pagoda as apparently got announced uh announced overnight a few hours ago so yay but today i'm going to be speaking about some ethereum scaling uh so i'm basically taking a look at where we are in terms of uh the our ability to scale where our we are in terms of the need to scale and just what the realistic paths are that we can take to get there right uh so major piece of good news uh is that roll-ups are here right so um i'm sure many of you have tried uh doing a git coin grants using zk sync as a payment option and it actually works like surprisingly conveniently right like when you go through the git coin that kind of checkout thing that you requested your quadratic funding donations uh you just select check out with ek sync and you have a couple of sign ins and if you've never used dk sync before you need to send one transaction again basically just to i'm going to top up your um i can't zka sync account as part of the process but if you've already done that then you don't need to send any transactions you just they assign these three um cryptographically signed messages so basically metamask signs some data that's not a transaction and then that gets uh included as part of the zk roll up uh so the transaction fees are really low it's like basic for like the 10 cents over here it's somewhere between 100 and 200 bytes on chain it costs much less than even a single transaction you know really nice and really fast um loop ring zk roll up based decentralized exchange it's existed for a while it also has a built-in uh payment system so if you don't care about um you know trading one random crypto token for some other random crypto token you can just use blueprint to pay people and i've actually used delivering well to receive money myself i yeah i paid i paid for lunch for a group of people and one of them was uh kind enough to um unsolicitedly pay here i pay me back for his share i'm just uh directly inside blubring which was uh really cool and the uh the transaction fees were and pretty negligible as expected um diversify starkware base based as a stark-based decentralized exchange using um starks so this is uh trusted setup free quantum proof and all of those things or at least potentially quantum quantum proof i don't think they used the internal signature algorithm as quantum proof yet um but this has also been seeing a lot quite a bit of usage um omg uh so who here has heard of plasma who here has uh kind of um quietly forgotten about plasma well plasma's back from the grave and it's going strong so uh if you go to omg.network they have a wallet over here and it's not a rollup it's a plasma but it's still a scaling solution you know it's still crypto economically secure and all that and you can use it and finally and optimism the optimistic role project launched a test that and synthetics is running a test on it so you can go and use it so roll ups are here but they're not completely here right so most activity that's being done on ethereum is still being done on the ethereum layer one um in turn these um three roll ups are just payments and decks so zk sync is literally just payments um but um optimism is supporting full evm uh smart contract so you can just kind of click a button and redeploy your contracts to it and uh it is a test that now but they have plans to you know move over to being a main net soon uh starkware i should mention they have this project called cairo and they've been starting to compile solidity contracts into a stark which is just really amazing and so a lot of progress even on that front v0 is almost here so eth2 yay the first phase of eth2 is very close to being here the madasa test net has been running for a while um and we've had spadina as a kind of a live test of the launch process we're going to have uh forget the name of the zinken um as another um live test of the launch and next week uh so uh clients are doing really well a lot of efficiencies coming in a lot a lot of bugs getting getting fixed and the bugs getting smaller and smaller each time so phase zero is almost here um so a lot of progress happening right and at the same time you know there's a big need for this stuff right and the reason why there's a big need is because well demand for using ethereum is really high um a lot of people want to use the ethereum blockchain and there's just not enough space in the ethereum blockchain for everyone so how is that getting resolved well right now it's getting resolved by gas prices going really high right and you know at the start of the year gas prices of like maybe two to five grey were pretty common but today if you go to gasnow.org right now i think i'm not gonna check now but last time i checked it yesterday it was somewhere between 50 and 100 and a couple of weeks ago it got all the way up to about 700 or so right so um you know gas fees are crazy um i tried out uh making a trade on the auger prediction market um a couple of days ago and the transaction fees were to make that one trade were a total of uh 17.76 um so you know it would be nice if uh trade uh sending transactions was cheaper the only way sending transactions can be cheaper is if we have more scalability and so how do we get more scalability right so this is a kind of the path over the next one to two years that i realistically see it um basically right now we have the ethereum layer one um and it has somewhere between like 15 to 45 transactions a second so the 15 number is um if uh just to look at current usage the 45 numbers if everyone stopped hearing about smart contracts and just send you know 21 000 way and have simple transactions 1 000 to 4 000 tps as if you um go to roll-ups on top of each one right so if everyone moves on to roll-ups whether it's ziki roll-ups or optimistic roll-ups um then you get up to about a thousand to four thousand transactions per second each transaction only requires somewhere between like 300 to 1000 on chain gas so the 4 000 number is for either simple sends or simple trades or anything that can be fit into about 15 bytes which is a lot of things and the 1000 number is if you go up to about 64 bytes which you which is where you need to go to um to do a zk ck roll up uh so you can even get a thousand dps with privacy potentially if you do as a kck roll up and then this is so this is using technology that's basically either out there or almost ready today and then this number crazy number 100 000 tps for relatively simple transactions and 25 000 tps for uh privacy preserving transactions um and this is uh rollups on top of youth two right so when you have eth2 and we have phase one that adds sharding of data on top of eth2 then roll-ups on top of that have a much larger amount of data to work with uh some something like two mega bytes per second and that's at the beginning i expect it'll go up even beyond the two megabytes per second over time and so on top of that data you'll be able to do a huge amount of uh transactions and basically just combine the scalability mechanism of sharding with the scalability mechanism of rollups and you know you basically have like enough capacity on ethereum to get pretty close to you know being able to run to run the entirety of wechat on the thing if you really want to or something like that uh so the question is right like what can we do to adapt to this reality i think my first major point is that this is a reality right i think if we want to have an acceptable user experience for users like there isn't really a choice per se right like roll-ups are basically the only technology that's there ready to scale ethereum applications uh from the their current level of scalability to um something um a hundred times greater uh without compromising on the security right like you know you can have your side chains with your two-way bridges but for any of those systems like obviously you have to trust whatever committee actually runs the sidechain with roll ups you don't have that problem so roll ups are basically the only path that as far as i can tell is just there to allow for this scalability improvement that we really really need and we really need today and so the only question basically is like what can we do to adapt to it right and the biggest part of the answer basically is that we need some kind of comprehensive ecosystem level push to improve user experience and in user experience i'm including security right it's it's never user experience versus security it's user experience of security um it's so improving user experience of security for lawyer two protocols and there is uh a few pieces to that puzzle so first of all wallets uh so you know if you go back to this zk sync inside of git coin like it's it's not the best right and the reason it's not the best is because the zika sync thing is being uh kind of instantiated inside of the gigan web page and so if bitcoin was evil then git coin could just make a fake zk sync sidenote page and like basically ask you to sign in to zika sync and you would sign in and they would be able to just steal all the assets that you have inside of zk sync um which is not very nice the correct approach to solve this problem is that the support for optimistic roll up and zika roll up and plasma needs to be pushed up to the wall wallet level right so metamask needs to include native support for zika roll ups optimistic roll ups and plasma some status needs to do the same thing and im token needs to do the same thing like no the wallets need to all do the same thing um and an old this requires quite a bit of work i think we can mitigate the amount of work that this requires if the a layer two providers write some some kind of plug-in and standardize on some kind of plug-in solution um but um you know these are discussions that need to be had um ens is another major one so ens is amazing right um lots of us use ens um i give and i even used ens to pay someone a few weeks ago uh so the so so we need ens to work not just on layer one but also on wire two and and uh smart contract languages uh so zooming in on some of these right wallets uh we have already talked about this um ens um you need to be able to register administer or transfer and renew domains entirely inside of lawyer tubes right we're talking about an ecosystem where users are in generally going to be living inside of layer 2's right if we talk about using ethereum to go up to uh you know 4 000 tps on away or twos then what that means is that average users are not even going to have a quote account on layer one right average users are just going to be living on layer two and so ens name resolution needs to work even for names that are registered transferred renewed administered everything happening to them entirely inside of robs and i have a proposal for this um there's the link if you and if you don't want to manually copy the link you have this fun little qr code thing that you can scan um i don't know hopefully people are familiar with qr codes by now um there's basically it's a kind of general purpose proposal that allows um resolution of ems names and more generally static calls inside of arbitrary layer two so this would allow both ens and a lot of other applications to kind of live inside different way or twos and not even have to standardize on a single one a pretty seamless one and smart contract languages right so we have a kind of three different tiers of languages in the ethereum ecosystem the first here is low level languages so the ethereum l1 has the ethereum virtual machine evm optimisms optimistic roll-up has the ovm which is basically a subset of the evm that restricts operations that break out of their sandbox um stark wars cairo yeah they have their own you know arithmetic and immediate representation um so and like fancy blah blah blah math finite field star crime if you want to learn more we go go read the blog posts um and so we have a lot of these different compilation targets and at the same time we also have high level languages right we have solidity we have viper where we have um serpent we have mutant we have ll um we have bamboo and there's this big long tail of other ones that people haven't heard of so we have a lot of high-level languages we have a lot of low-level languages and it would be really nice if we could have a common intermediate compilation target that's easy to compile to and that's easy to compile from and so you'll is the thing that solidity already compiles through and it's one option and maybe there's other options right so this is another thing that probably needs to be and i've talked about it and standardized through the ecosystem um economic benefits so this is a interesting and fun uh kind of corollary of a layer two-centric road map right so so far i've been talking about needing to make this coordinated ecosystem push for people to move to all two is um basically for technical reasons right right now we have uh 15 to 45 transactions per second people wants to do a hell of a lot more than 15 to 45 transactions per second the technology that lets people do that with ethereum global security guarantees is rollups and so you know we need to move people into rollups um and in order for that to happen and all all of the infrastructure that currently exists to make life easier for people on layer one needs to also work for people who live inside of the various different way or twos that are starting to come into existence and are gonna keep coming into existence over the next year or so but there is also this interesting a kind of economic benefit right so ethereum in general has a public goods funding problem and it arguably has a problem uh kind of attracting kind of creative researchers and uh and developers to and help with the scaling process and there definitely is a strong team and like justin is great and danny is great and dan crowd as zechariah is a great and shalway is great and a whole list of people that i'm gonna offend by not mentioning their name are all great uh but you know there's i there's also this very large set of researchers and developers who i think first of all just feel more comfortable and kind of wants to be to kind of have the freedom to build their own island and not just be a small piece in a yeah in a big ecosystem and have to debate with everyone else over every protocol change and also from a funding point of view like core development is currently funded just by the ethereum foundation the ethereum foundation has a one-time limited pool of funding which is totally fine for the next few years or so but you know what's a long long term uh sustainable solution and layer two projects have much more leeway than ethereum in both of these dimensions right if you create a layer 2 then you know you as a researcher developer founder have the ability to kind of build your own island so to speak and experiment with a lot of different options and and i kind of come up come up with your own path of various different improvements and at the same time layer two projects have the ability to monetize right so um layer two projects have the ability to kind of fund themselves by making um mev auctions so for example this is something i've talked about there's a lot of they can charge transaction fees for state rents and there's a lot of things that they can do and layer two projects um then it could either charge for these things directly and they could you know potentially do the token thing and create one of these decentralized community tokens that gets backed by future transaction fees collected by the system there's a lot of things that they can't do and so basically if the ethereum roadmap has a kind of big space in it for layer two projects then the ethereum ecosystem and a lot of these other projects can kind of align instead of competing right it's not you know are you part of ethereum or to build your own thing it's no you can be part of ethereum and build your own thing and so i'll say yellow too you have a huge degree of kind of economic and technical autonomy and of lots of opportunity to do things so this is the short term right and i think the short term is at least my impression is that we don't really have much choice except to do this um basically just because you know we need scaling and roll-ups are the technology that's here and we have done our kind of due diligence and we've done this huge exploration of the entire scaling space and we've looked at plasma so we've looked at channels and philosophers are going to continue to be used and plasmas are great and channels are going to continue to be used in their particular context some channels could even be used for things like moving between different roll-ups and plasmas quickly um you know and but still out of the kind of design space that we've explored roll ups make up this the kind of really big part of it especially for applications more complicated than payments and even for payments like kind of a layer twos of some kind are the thing that needs to be making this coordinated effort to start moving toward but this is so long term right and this is the more controversial part of my proposal um so first of all e3 phase one right so not controversial yeah controversial was next slide um use eth2 shard data for rollups right so if instead of the roll-ups pushing their data on to the um eth1 chain uh roll-ups can push their data um so the uh of 10 to 16 this to 50 depending on your application bytes of data per transaction that have to go up um go on chain um in i'm in a rollup because that's a rollerboard so if that data goes on these two shards and the if those two shards have two megabytes per second collectively then you can get up to uh you know 100k transactions or 25 for more much more complicated ones but we need a bridge so that the eth1 chain can verify which these two block routes and therefore with each two blocks are legitimate and then after phase one in phase 1.5 eth2 shard data can be proven to you these one chart within one slot because these ones are going to be part of these two now this is the the challenging part right so i claim that we have a bit of an awkward inconsistency in the eth2 and uh scaling roadmap here is the awkward inconsistency right that i think hasn't really properly been addressed yet today uh we have no layer to well we have some use of layer two right but look okay let's say we're here in the chart six months ago we were here six months ago when um you know 2020 and uh and the world burning and and so forth had only just begun and we were still living a relatively um uh happy existence in the great stagnation um the scalability of ethereum was about 15 to 45 tps because we had no layer 2 and we had no sharding um in well very soon we're going to have a thousand to four thousand tps because we have no uh shorting but we do have roll ups in um a one or two years we're going to go up to 25 to 100 000 tps because we are going to have sharding of data right so the shards are just going to be again if data logs blobs but for a roll up data blobs are all you need plus uh roll-ups so here no starting no roll up here short um no sharding yes roll up here yes starting yes roll up and then what comes after this well if two phase two right eq phase two basically says well we're going to allow shards to have not just data but also execution and this was always marketed as you know this is the place where applications can come over and actually properly properly live inside of these two but here's the problem this phase offers uh twenty five thousand two hundred thousand dps because it has starting and roll-ups so it has scalability squared but over here if we're going to say well we want applications to move to east use layer one well being on eth2 layer one means you only have one level of scalability right you have sharding but you don't have the roll-up and so the question is well if the ecosystem is already accustomed to roll-ups and because the ecosystem has to be accustomed to roll-ups because they will have spent one to two years over here living in a basically roll-up centric ecosystem then why would people even wants to migrate back to the main chain when the main chain has inferior scalability and when they're already accustomed to roll-ups having juicy features like for example and a sequence of pre-confirmations and no sequencers being able to do crazy transaction verification so you have full account abstraction without all without the complexity of account abstraction the eap and all these other goodies like why would applications want to move back to the main chain and this is the challenge right so like basically the question is like what if the scaling road map is really done here at the twenty five thousand to hundred thousand tps step and we shouldn't even be uh kind of adding more complexity to ethereum by allowing more computation on every single shard now there's actually risks to allowing computation on every chart right and the risk basically is that if you want to kind of fully verify correctness of a charted blockchain then if he wants to verify data availability you act it's data availability verification if you do it with either polynomial commitments or zero knowledge proofs is actually not that bad the reason is that it does not have any network synchronous options right it does not rely on fraud proofs it's just a matter of like send a bunch of requests and wait until all those requests get answered so no matter how slow the network is no matter what happens to the network you know you're fine but if you want to verify computation in a scalable way and in a robust way and so like for example the network uh you know like half the notes temporarily going offline and the attacker kind of taking over a um a large portion of the room of the remainder and then and then have being able to take over a few committees like if he wants to verify scalable execution without hitting those kinds of issues then you need fraud proofs and the problem with fraud proofs is they depend on this hard latency assumption and so fraud if someone manages to kind of sneak past an invalid block because the network is doing really terribly for 12 minutes then you would pretty much have to roll back the entire e2 chain uh so i would claim that potentially leaving scalable execution up entirely to layer two could even kind of improve the stability of the ethereum to blockchain and make it a more a kind of limited and retrenched tool that does one thing and does one thing well now there is an opportunity for a compromise here right so and the compromise basically is well i talked about having just one execution chart and the current purpo well the status quo kind of proposal is to have a kind of 64 execution charts like every chart is an execution chart well the copper bytes proposal is what if we go in the middle what do we have like four execution charts or eight execution charts and this would allow somewhat more uh base layer applications to exist if people really want them to it would allow somewhat more room for error if um things inside of a particular roll-up screw up and people have to use the base chain to migrate to another one it would allow like it would really relieve pressure on a lot of those things but if there's only four to eight execution charts then in extreme circumstances it's still within the power of a lot of individual users running nodes to uh personally verify all all of the computation that's happening in the network right whereas if there were 64 execution shards then personally verifying all the computation would be impossible so that's the kind of area possible compromise approach and so challenges right so there's a lot of challenges that are i think inevitable in the ethq migration and as i mentioned in the migration to roll-ups there's a lot of challenges that are pretty inevitable as well but um probably the biggest one is a user experience right basically making sure users only do secure things by default and don't accidentally do insecure things so one example of an insecure thing would be as if every application required you to sign into zika sync inside of that application and then users ended up by kind of giving away their zika sync secrets and the application stole all their money that would be really bad right so we want secure things to happen by default and so we want um you know metamask or status or you know like i am token or these wallets to try to support layer twos directly instead of having a kind of less secure application interfaces for them um ecosystem coordination um and that includes the wallet stuff that includes making ens work on layer two it includes kind of high-level language uh things it includes also having efficient infrastructure for jumping between different roll-ups so we're gonna have cross-roll-up exchange um is going to be a really important topic and so there's a lot of these uh challenges that do we're gonna have to be solved regardless um one interesting thing about uh kind of cross roll up exchange actually is that i think a lot of the challenges are very similar to the challenges around cross chart exchange um basically roll ups and shards are both kind of what i call synchronous domains they're both these areas where you can have synchronous communication between objects within one of them but you can't really have synchronous communication between objects that are in different roll-ups or in different charts and so the challenge of making index between them is basically very very similar regardless of whether they're roll-ups or or whether they're shards which i think is interesting right it basically means that we don't even needs to have all that much certainty of uh kind of which scaling path ethereum is going to take in order for work on cross domain exchange to actually start and so cross domain exchange is something that people should actively start looking into you know go if you want to build some hackathon projects at some points then you know make a dex that works between uh say uh zk sync and uh the optimism test that for example or just try or even between loopring and zika sync or between the lubricant and the optimism tested or or diversifier whichever one of these systems right just see if you can spec it out see if you can make that uh make that work because this is a category of thing that we're going to end up needing um so that's the so that's the presentation right and i know there's a lot of ideas in there it's ideas that i think we're all kind of familiar with i mean if independently right we're all familiar with is hopefully you know eth2 as a concept at least of the basics of it and then the fact that there exists these layer two protocols as a concept but actually you're kind of concretely thinking about well what would a world where we migrate till year twos and then what would world will be migrate to layer two is on top of youth two and how all these two and layer two is interact and all that these things are in a fairly new one i think it's time that we do start to kind of much more seriously and proactively thinking about how we kind of push the ecosystem to actually be able to take advantage of the scalability great thanks natalie um thank the presentation we do have some questions that have been submitted so as long as you have time for it uh we'll we'll stream through some of them uh all right so first question um layer two is always about to solve all of blockchain's problems uh something that you know we've been writing and talking about for years um but at least for now has you know failed to really materialize and there have been you know notable disappointments um in the layer two space um how confident are you that roll-ups are you know for real and what makes this time different uh so i think i talked about this a bit in one of my blog posts about a year ago this was um i think the one that talks about base layers and functionality escape velocity um and the argument that i made was basically that like roll-ups are a somewhat different class of scaling solution than um channels and uh plasma right and channels and plasma we're kind of the two major families that like the bitcoin and ethereum ecosystems in the bitcoin ecosystem case adjust channels that we've tried so far and the difference is basically that like when you scale you have like there's two things that you're scaling and you have to scale computation and you have a scale data availability and my argument was that channels and plasma both like don't solve the solve data availability they use very application specific tricks to try to get around the the problem of not having data availability all right so if you search up on my blog post of italic.ca based lawyers functionality escape velocity i can make this argument in a lot more detail there um and so within the case of rollups on the other hand like the way rollups work is that they're a kind of more compromised way or two right they say that instead of doing like everything off-chain for every transaction we're not going to do the computation on chain but we are going to publish like about 10 16 50 bytes of data that go on chain and so this is why the scalability of a roll-up is limited um but what this gives you is it gives you the ability to basically run arbitrary state machines inside of a roll-up right and this is something the thing that we initially thought we'd be able to do and then eventually realized we can't do in plasma is basically run arbitrary state machines inside of them but for rollups we already know how to do it right and once you can do an arbitrary state machine then it's kind of like touring completeness that's proof that you can do basically anything so we do have a kind of tech mathematical and technical sort of proof that rollups are capable of doing things that we're claiming they're capable of doing um and then in terms of uh just in practice right like roll-ups are just so far along you know you can there's already like three decentralized exchanges running on them there's uh you know you can use it to check do like checkouts of uh your git coin donations and then there's a synthetic synthetics as participating in a test at a roll-up that can support the evm so like it's basically the problems that we never even got close to solving in channel and plasma land i think in raw plants we actually have managed to solve as another exhibit okay um so um you know one of the one of the virtues of the ethereum system that exists now is you know we have this kind of interoperable composable layer one which means that everything gets to talk to everything else um can that vision still exist in a world of many rollups or do you expect there to be a winner take all here where you know one or very few roll-ups uh end up having the most economic activity on them so you didn't hear the last sentence do all of us again oh uh you know do you expect to be in a world of many rollups or do you expect a winner to take all dynamic um good question i definitely expect to see a a couple of roll ups end up dominating um i do think that rollups have both network effects and anti-network effects the main anti-network effect that a roll-up has basically is that the more transactions per second happening inside of a single roll-up the more uh the harder it becomes to run a full node of that roll-up um and so that basically kind of degrades its usability to some extent so that like that's one pressure to have multiple of them and then the other pressure is that there's just different families of technology that are being explored right you have the optimistic evm family then you have the zero knowledge proof using elliptic curves families and you have the zero knowledge proof using stark's family and and so i definitely expect kind of all of these technical families and some of different internal features to get tested in the short and medium term um in the long term i mean it's possible that one of them will win um i don't know yet and right are there fundamental problems that happen like if there is a winner take all um dynamic like what are the the downsides of of that happening right i mean i guess the main downside would be that if the winner that takes all ends up being a project that just uh try and starts being really extractive in real in nasty ways and you know it has like fairly centralized control by a small group of stakeholders and those stakeholders try to basically maximize their benefit instead of you know doing a good thing for the ecosystem i think if that happens the ethereum ecosystems response may end up being to kind of quote nationalize it so what i mean by that is basically just like take that code the code of that particular roll up and just like enshrine it into the main chain and make that be phase two um of uh u2 scaling and so when that happens like basically people that are like it will just be the default behavior of ethereum users to be living inside of that role but then that roll-up would just be you know using eth as its base asset managing that um that roll-up would be part of a part of managing the ethereum protocol and so forth uh so like if you are a winner that takes all and uh you know and you're too mean like you know there's always the possibility that that'll end up happening and so your kind of position at the center of things will end up just being sort of removed overnight as a result okay another question that was submitted so i at least the the assumption of this question is that you know when you've been talking so far about transactions happening on rollups uh those are still you know public transactions um that you know anyone that's kind of watching the the roll-up chain can see um what would like a a private roll-up uh world look like or you know how would like having private transactions in the roll-ups uh maybe impact the scalability properties that you've talked about so far right uh so this is where we get into the family of zkzk rollups um the first is ek stands for null for zero knowledge and the second zk stands for him as i now claim as zipped by cryptography um so you know it has a ck for for both the privacy and the scalability um and basically um so this is a family that's already being explored so the aztec protocol is um working on a zkzk up i believe matter labs might be i'm not sh i i forget the details and i'm sure they can angrily correct me on twitter if they want to um which would be great um and basically the idea would be that like if you imagine it would like something like tornado cash then imagine you extends tornado cash so that it doesn't just do moving coins around it also does basically supports an internal smart contract language and then you imagine that living inside of a roll-up then did you get some pretty powerful privacy and scalability at the same time i think the main challenge though is that there's inherent trade-offs between like privacy and composability and between privacy and just having applications that everyone can use um and the trade-off is basically that if you want to have private smart contracts then like for that to work you need to have this kind of encrypted state object where only some people have the key right and the idea is that if you have the key then you can make transactions that involve that state object but if you have the key then you can also see what's going on um and so like basically there's this kind of inherent tradeoff with zero knowledge proofs where you know you can like basically either you can see what's going on or with a particular object or you can't um you can't use it and that's totally fine with coins right because if the coins are yours you can see them you can use them if they're not yours you can't see them and you can't use them which is why you know zcash and tornado cash and so forth work fine but with smart contracts you get into multi-user objects and so this sort of stuff gets more difficult right so going from perfect privacy of um you know simple payments transactions to perfect privacy of more complex things and i think perfect privacy of more complex things is not possible but kind of pushing the frontier up i think is something that's uh going to happen over time and and yeah and wonderful people like the aztec team are working on it um okay so changing topics a little bit uh another question that was submitted um so in this vision you know which is one possible vision you described in this post when would you expect the you know the base layer of ethereum to stabilize um is there a period where you know um becomes stabilized and virtually changes their mage or would you expect iterative improvements in perpetuity in my rodent proposed the road map here i expected the basic structure of the road map of the of ethereum to basically stabilize potentially forever in phase of 1.5 um so like in the in the magician's post that's why i say phase 1.5 and done uh but there there would be continue to be kind of iterative technical improvements but this would be things like for example just adding more zero knowledge proofs in a few places to improve security improving efficiency changing the consensus from ffj to cbc uh eventually migrating to post quantum so kind of improvements that are not uh sort of economically substantive or that are not kind of substantive in terms of changing basic security properties and then like i definitely expect some degree of ongoing technical change to keep happening for for a fury a long time but it would be a a low level like definitely much closer to just being maintenance mode okay um so the last question which i've just got for you is um what do you want to see in hackers build at the online over the next three weeks if you maybe you've got something already in mind maybe you have long-standing things that no one's built yet but if you could name a couple things what would those be for the hackers who are watching looking for inspiration i mean one option is definitely just the things that i talked about so kind of readying the ethereum ecosystem for layer twos uh so this could include like the ideal awesome thing would be like make a metamask fork that just supports you know loopering and desync and optimism which would just be awesome if someone does it um another example would be a decentralized exchange whether it uses like channels or whatever other technology going between multiple rollups um an ens resolver that works inside of a layer twos um [Music] other interesting things would be like layer two is offer the ability to do things that you can't as easily do today uh one example of this is smart contract while it's right like i've always been like in this big advocate of smart contract while it's in multistage and social recovery and all of these things um but i've this stuff is still underrated by the way like even a few weeks ago i just um um had a friend and have come close to losing two hundred thousand dollars just from my kind of misusing their or misplacing their wallet see it it was uh eventually uh i had to go digging quite a bit and uh figure out that it was uh the um it was like basically it was uh the bib 32 derivation path was wrong or something um or something like this but like it was a big scare for a while and people i think people don't talk about this because like there is this mentality that like oh if you admit to losing two hundred thousand dollars because you lose your i'm your key then you're stupid um and so you know nobody wants to admit it but it's a and so it's a serious problem nobody talks about right but basically like i think if we want to scale ethereum to five billion people you can't have this design where you have one private key and if your private key gets stolen you lose your money and if your private key gets lost it was your money um so you know you want to have multi-cigs you want to have like the asset self cancelable transaction vaults you wants to have like social recovery and all of these things and ideally try to solve it with a minimum amount of centralization as things like social recovery do but these things are all fairly hard to achieve in the current context because you know unfortunately these one blockchain isn't really that well designed for verification schemes other than single elliptic kind of elliptic curve signature verification but inside of like the optimism roll up for example you totally can't do it um and and you know sequencers can just support account transaction abstraction manually uh so that's another example of like this sort of thing that you could try to start doing on lawyer two is that you can't easily do on layer one and hopefully and if you use the layer two switch as an opportunity to simultaneously encourage people to move to better things um so yeah and i guess another exam possibility would just be making a kind of migrating applications to layer two so for example like something like imagine making a bot um that where if a market gets opened on auger then you know you can you would just immediately um you know go to foundry create like a a huge amount of yes tokens and no tokens and then push those tokens into the layer twos and then just like open up a market for both of those uh tokens inside of the lawyer two so people can go do their predictions market trading inside of the layer two right so there's a lot of application simple application specific things you can do like that and then you know i'll be able to do my projection trading with paying less than 17 hours of transaction fees so a lot of options awesome thanks for talking i hope that i hope this people are listening i hope that someone works on those problems um okay well i think that is the end of the day stream thank you so much metallic for coming on with us and talking about this um we look forward to having you back on the final davies online on the 30th um and until then talk later sounds good enjoy
