forward first I want to thank optimism World coin Zora base hyperlane layer 0 mode chain link safe the graph etherscan EAS conduit and covalent these are some of our incredible Partners they're giving away a lot of prizes as well and you get to build on top of their infrastructure so you don't have to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel but let's talk about what the next two weeks are going to be all about my goal here is to talk about how everything works and how everything is structured that means theme formation how you can get help all the prizes of course we're going to talk about the Summits the talks the workshops that are happening and the most important piece how all of judging is going to be taking place foreign everything that we're going to be doing for this entire event is going to be on the Discord this Discord is managed automatically through your hacker dashboard on 8th global.com and all the permissions are granted to just people who are participating at this event which means if you have not connected your Discord from your profile just yet you won't be able to see any of these chat channels on the left in the screenshot you'll see a super head category with all the channels that we have laid out for this event which means these are channels to see what's going on with the event all of our information announcements you can see all the channels for all of our partners we can ask direct questions to these different companies all of our mentorship and support channels so you can ask any questions about where you're stuck or if you have any bugs that you are trying to debug and any of our partners here or around you can see all of them directly on this channel so just make sure that you can see a super hack header in your Discord sidebar and if you don't message us but you should be able to just connect to your Discord account through our dashboard and you'll see all these things automatically this is also only available to people who have successfully rsvp'd for this event so if your team members are not able to see this thing that means they need to RSVP in the next 12 hours and on top of all of that we'll also be going to sending calendar invites for every talk and workshop that's going to be happening for this course of this event and the calendar invite is going to follow everything that's on the website the website will be the source of Truth and our goal is to make sure that we account for everybody from all across the world so we're going to be repeating some of these things and a lot of it is going to be designed to be asynchronous which means that you can catch up on anything at any point and we're going to make it super easy for you to do that and you don't have to stay up at different times to watch some of these talks or workshops if you are not able to and to make sure everybody is aware of the website it's just youth global.com super hack this will be our socially true so any prize information any schedule related information anything else that you want to know all of it will be first communicated on the website and then broadcast it to all of you on Discord and email so let's talk about how the hackathon works officially the hackathon has started which means you can start working on your projects and you can work on them with your team you can have a team of up to five people which means you can go from one to five people in total and you have the next week and a half to hack in some of your projects submissions are due at 12 pm noon Eastern on Sunday August 13th so make sure that you spend the next little while to understand kind of what's what's going on here and how you can best use everything in this op stack universe and the rules and criteria for the sackathon are also very straightforward everything that you do must be done from scratch which means you cannot add features to an existing project otherwise you will be disqualified from this event and you cannot build anything else on top or add anything or resubmit your project that you've been working on before some of you have emailed us about certain edge cases if you fall into one of those categories and you're not officially informed us it's well or gotten Clarity from us please send an email to hello.com or message one of us on Discord and we'll make sure that we can address all those things before you get started and you also need to make sure that your projects are built on top of a super chain or the op stack so everything must be specific and relevant to the goals and the the purpose of this event and make sure that you are all including the rest of your team members confirmed on your hacker dashboard and each of your team members actually show up on the team section because once you submit if somebody is not assigned to a team or if somebody individually did not RSVP they will be automatically removed from their accounts and if you win a prize and your team members are not listed there they will not be receiving their share of that prize so only people who show up on that profile under the team section will be the only ones receiving any of the prizes so make sure that you have all that checked in in the next day or two and if you have any other questions you can always message us on any of our communication channels the email Discord anything else and get any questions clarified immediately now let's talk about the important part which is judging submissions are due on Sunday the 13th at 12 pm Eastern that means you get exactly 10 days to work on your project the way everything is set up is that you are going to be submitting a four minute video of your demo video summations will be required and you will have to make this video as part of that official submission and we really really remind you to don't do this thing last minute it takes a lot of time to condense everything that you've done into four short minutes which means you have to cover everything about who you are why you got excited about this idea how it works do a demo make sure that you're waiting for certain transactions on chain and conclude about what could be next all in four minutes and that's not easy so really take the time to think through what the content of this video is going to be walk through of some of our submissions that we've seen in the past that we've highlighted you can check out previously well done videos to use as references and take the time to make this really concise and informative for all of our judges all of this thing will happen on your dashboard which means that in a few days you're able to see all the steps and the information that you need to be ready for during submissions and then you'll be able to fill in those fields and upload the video and everything else directly on your academic Sports after you submit this is what's going to be presented to you as part of the final step of the submission process you'll be given a choice to go through the main judging and or just a partner judging option if you select the main judging route you will be put into two rounds of judging and if you don't want to go through that you'll be automatically entered into the partner judging prize pool category which will be asynchronous so let's go into what all of this means so the first round of main judging will be another asynchronous round which means as you submit a project and you want to be part of the main judging track which makes you eligible to be one of the top 10 teams from this hackathon all of your project submissions will go to a set of Judges who are going to be reviewing everything asynchronously and they'll be filtering projects based on Prototype of the the video and the project from anywhere from the links to your source code the quality of the MVP we'll be checking through some of your git commit logs which means that you should be using git and Version Control properly do not commit just one thing with 500 000 lines make sure you are sequencing things properly and doing uh proper Version Control with all the routine members and also the video presentation quality we've reviewed which means the easier the video is to understand what you built and why and how it works the better your odds are of convincing everybody else that this is something interesting and that we can understand how to think about some really creative ideas as that round one judging happens you'll be selected to move on to the live judging which will happen the next day which means a short list of those projects we're trying to go for the main judging top ten we'll then have to go present to some of our judges live on a zoom call and there you will be headed to round two where you will get seven minutes to present your demo this would mean the same a different set of judges are going to look at the video that you presented and it'll be asking you live questions about your project and the projects that go through the second round live judging are going to be then considered for the finalists top 10 team selection this will take place on Tuesday August 15th and this will be a live Zoom call which means that in in case you are in a different time zone that is at odds with 9 12 P.M to 2 30 p.m Eastern you will have to kind of be up to be present present live on the zoom and we'll kind of give you a heads up and also try to accommodate as many time zones as possible to make sure that you get to go early if you are in a really different time then if you choose to not do the main judging and you want to only do the partner price judging you will be put into this category which means as you summon your project and you select which prize you want to be eligible for from our partners each of those Partners will get a notification saying they have to review your project for this price and then they will take the next two to three days from the submission deadline to review all of your projects they'll be looking at the same things as the rest of the judges which is your video demo your source code if you have a live link your project descriptions with all the specifics on how you've used different protocols and and why and they'll be reviewing and making sure that they get to select which project best represents their prize categories if they have any questions about what you did or if they're confused about something or if they can find something that you're referencing in your project description they'll be messaging you directly either over email or Discord and they'll be using that as a means to reach out to confirm anything but you don't have to present live to any of our partners for those prizes they'll reach out to you if they have questions and all of this will be then finalized at the end of this event at the closing ceremonies we'll be announcing who won what prizes so I want to summarize everything about this judging and don't worry you will be sending a lot more emails about everything as well but you want to make sure that the video is really really good and you want to make sure that you put in time and effort and attention into getting the details right in this video which means make sure you're in a quiet background make sure you are using the right software to record everything make sure you edit out some pieces that do not go well and really make it concise in four minutes and of course coming back to people who are trying to do this thing for the first time as their first ever hackathon or first time working with the Super Saiyan ecosystem don't worry we have a lot of things here that will make this easy for you and a lot of this is workshops and talks and sessions to help you really get comfortable from depending on your skills as being a beginner or intermediate developer or an expert all this stuff is happening throughout this event it started yesterday with some of our talks and workshops we have a big Summit next week on all the new things that are happening in this ecosystem with the info center specifically for you as a tab on your hacker dashboard which has all the resources that you can catch up on to understand what's going on what's in previous talks tutorials read up on different various blog posts and get all of that um on demand to catch up and learn about anything that's happening and everything that we're going to be doing including this specific talk is going to be recorded and instantly made available after it ends which means that if you miss this thing or you are late or it immediately ended when you joined you're all fine because you can just head over to youtube.com youth Global and watch it on demand and go rewind pause zoom in whatever you want to do instantly so you can catch this catch up on all of this thing on your own schedule and if you're still looking for a team member or an idea we have a lot of opportunities for you because there's a lot more other people in the same position as you so you can head over to find a team channel on our Discord and reach out to people who are posting there to either join their team or recruit them to be part of your team and really see what everybody's excited about and what they're looking to get started with there's also a super hack chat Channel which is what we're going to be using to communicate everything and having a conversation so be sure to say hi tell us where you're from what you're excited about and we'd love to some of you joined this thing yesterday there's also going to be another session later today on team formation as a live call where you get to pitch your idea or tell us what you were able to do to other hackers who are looking for teams and you get to form teams and join other group of people and even think about different ideas that you can hack on for this event on a live Zoom call so you have to do this thing on Discord you can just talk to people directly so check out for those links on your calendar and this will also be available on your hacker dashboard under the schedule section and don't worry you don't have to have a team if you are excited to do something on your own or just challenge yourself and use this event as an opportunity to learn you can do all of that and still participate at this event and you can hack solo and submit something that you're personally proud of so next thing I want to talk about is Project check-ins there will be two check-ins that will happen on your hacker dashboard these check-ins are basic quick surveys and forms that let us as the equal team know how you're doing which means we get to understand what's going on if you need any help or if you are stuck on something and we then get to anywhere from paying some of the people that could help unblock you or help you really uh get moving with submitting your project and finishing up your idea this will be a quick check-in which is you answer a few yes or no questions or give us some details and these will take place next week so we have an understanding of what you're excited about and you also get your stick return as you respond and finish these check-ins all this will happen asynchronously on your dashboard but you will get only 24 hours to finish your check-in so keep an eye out on that email that says check-ins are now open and will also be notified a lot of you or all of you on Discord a lot about all these things I'll also be using uh project well two things if you have any other questions so far please answer ask those questions away on Youth global.tv and we'll be happy to answer some of those things for you as I see them I do want to address one question that we've gotten around what does it mean to use existing Library uh your idea and your own project must be from scratch but it doesn't mean you cannot use something that's already open source as a library or something that's a boilerplate template so using something like third web as the question says um is totally okay you can easily use those things they are part of properly licensed tools and get started and simplify your life so all of that is fine and if you are looking to build on some of our partners here for this hackathon you can also use the code that they linked as their sample repos and use that as a boilerplate to get started another common question we get all the time is can I do both main judging and the partner judging uh I want to make sure that is less confusing as possible uh if you do the main judging you're you are still eligible for partner judging that's still asynchronous so the second you select I want to be eligible for this price it automatically notifies our partner so you don't have to worry about will it be able to do the partner judging or will I be qualified for a prize or not the the top 10 judging track automatically enables you to also be considered for all of our partner prizes all right let's get to project feedback session our goal is to not just see cool things but also make sure that we help you succeed and get the right feedback from the people and from the ecosystem that you're excited to build on top of so we'll be hosting two project feedback sessions as part of this event the first session is going to be on Tuesday August 8th from 3 P.M to 5 PM Eastern and the second of the feedback sessions is going to be on Thursday August 10th from 9 A.M to 11 A.M Eastern this is a live call where you get to join and show us what you've been working on so far get feedback from our mentors get feedback from some of our partners from from the representatives of Engineers at the companies that you're going to be building on top of and really get that live comments and just general excitement from people and use that to improve or get your questions answered or get a better way to solve your problem if you've been stuck on something and just join these calls to see what else others are building so you can check out both of these feedback sessions the links will be on your calendar automatically you can see all that specific details directly on your dashboard or your calendar and I also want to remind people about our code of conduct so everything about this event and how we think about rules and how to behave here as part of this community is outlined on youth global.com rules but the summary and the gist of it is that you please be respectful to everybody here even though we are an online community harassment and abusing any form will not be tolerated this applies to not just hackers but every single person that's involved in the event and anything that you built as part of this hackathon is solely owned by you which means that neither youth Global nor any of our partners have any rights to this IP that you create so you and all of your team members will equally own all inventions as part of this hackathon if you need any help if I missed anything if you have any other questions please ping us on Discord or email we'll be happy to answer and question I clarify anything for you another question we just got is these open sourcing a requirement the answer is yes as part of being eligible to win any prizes you have to open source your code this helps us verify that everything was done correctly and that's just a set of criteria we want to enforce to be part of our community where everybody is building in the open so to be eligible to win any prizes or to be qualified to submit a project it must remain open source and public on your GitHub just a reminder to everybody the website AZ global.com super hack which has all the things that I talked about including links to all these videos so if you want to walk through how judging works again you can just rewind this video after the live stream finishes and just pause and catch up all that information is also available on your info center there's a judging tab where you have all the information that I said listed out in a lot more details than what I could say in this video and catch up on everything and see examples of past submissions to really understand what it means to make a really good submission as part of any of the hackathon submissions all right so let's get ready for some of our partners and what these prizes are we want to bring on some of our amazing Partners here to really tell you about what they're looking forward to seeing this over the next two weeks and why they're excited to be part of this ecosystem so we're going to start off with Maddie from optimism to tell you about what they're excited to build and hello my name is Maddie I'm here to talk about optimism and I have three things for you today about optimism I have a challenge for you and I have three tools to help you do that challenge so thing number one is op mainnet this is the blockchain that we make it's fast it's cheap it's rapidly growing and an important thing you should know about it is it's ethereum equivalent that means in addition to being faster and cheaper than developing on L1 just about any tool that you use for making making things on ethereum should work here an OP mainnet is powered by the op stack now this also Powers bass and Sora and any other op chain this is modular open source software that has everything that you need to run a roll up and we want you to mess with it break it build some infrastructure for it and most of all try to make tools that work across any op chain and make it feel incredibly seamless and the third thing retropgf this is the engine that makes optimism go we're starting our third season of it the collective will be giving out 30 million op to teams people and products that grow optimism this includes developers protocols and open source software that has an on-chain impact and that you might make at a hackathon and so the challenge is to think like a super chain that we want you to deploy on op mainnet but we also want you to deploy on base on Zora and we want you to make it feel great so this Vision only comes about if navigating from chain to chain feels seamless so think about the ux think about the infrastructure about the tooling deploy to all three and then make it feel awesome we have some tools to help with that and this includes an SDK the optimism SDK that makes it really easy to deploy on op mainnet or any other op chain you have a new faucet that gives out half an test net eat the day and so head to the link to start getting that we're going to add a way to start getting it up to an eighth per day so check out the Discord for that and we have the starter kit so this is connected to wag media to Foundry it has everything that you need to get your Gap going and hook it up to the blockchain so download that to get a head start and that's it good luck have fun we'll see you in the Discord and let us know if you need anything awesome that was Maddie talking about all the things that you can look forward to as part of the super Chan ecosystem so check out those resources they're also available on the prizes page on our website and she's also on this chat so you can just ask any follow-up questions to her and on YouTube TV and get those things answered all right next up I want to bring on Jesse from base to tell you all about the base ecosystem hey everyone it's 7 15 p.m we are in Idlewild California we were up late last night we were up early this morning we were uploading on chain summer via starlinked the Internet on chain uh we actually have the entire base team here behind us let's [Applause] [Music] just wanted to take this moment to say thank you for being a part of this with us we're still at the very beginning we have a crazy month ahead of us um but we are feeling so grateful that you have believed in us that you have believed in the idea of the world coming on chain this summer and of us pulling up the timeline of this adoption curve and making it happen faster than anyone else believes and so thank you over the next month I'd ask that you keep being an incredible group of people to work with that you keep believing in that Vision that you keep building um and that we create something really special here and that this is not the last Unchained summer that this is the first on-chain summer and that we are doing Unchained summer every summer for the next decade as we bring a billion people on chain so thank you thank you thank you thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and let's do this let's do this that was all the base team and you could see they're super excited to have all of you see what's possible on the base ecosystem so can't wait for all this to go live next week for all of you it uh this is gonna be fun next I want to bring on pendrin to talk about everything World coin everyone I'm pedrin I lead in developer relations at tools for Humanity supporting the world core ecosystem and I'm here to tell you a bit about we're looking creating the largest financial and identity Network by giving its ownership to everybody but if you've ever given away anything on the internet and store you're probably asking what about Bots we've thought of that we've built the orb which is this device to verify that you're a unique human in a privacy deserving way at the sale of all of humanity it does this by taking photos of your irises and calculating your unique Iris code on device without having to ever store those photos and we can check to make sure that Iris code is unique the world app is the first touch Point into this world client ecosystem it has a crypto wallet where you can send in receive news followers instantly which is super useful in many different parts of the world without overwhelming people with all of the crypto native features of some other wallet it also acts as a home for your world ID the self-custodial identity that you use to verify that you're a unique human well lady it is its group of person and protocol that we've built that you get to build on top of in this hack World ID supports multiple proof of personhood credentials right now both or verified and the users proving that these are outside a cell number in the world we have over around 2.1 million verified humans and that number continues to go up and we've had lots of little things already built on top of world ID now over 1500 developers and 400 projects at if Global hackathons and otherwise with use cases including reputation systems lending Regulatory Compliance there's always always really cool things that you can build when you know that your user is aging it's human and that they're only doing an action once that you don't have to worry about dealing with which unique human that user actually is we recently finished our migration to optimism and the super chain makes that quite a lot easier now for us to support more chains and to back that up we support base test net for superhap Microsoft as well after three years of building we're already at sdks are now publicly available if you want more information about how to build on top of World by the template repositories things like that you can visit worldcoin.org super hack follow us on Twitter and SNR Discord and I'm always here to meet helpful for all of you hacking in this hackathon thank you awesome that was panoran talking about world coin and last but not least I want all of you to get excited about Zora we are moving towards a world where five corporations control the entire internet and everything we create on it actually we're already there spiraling further into the I'll go shouting for attention and a bit of money if we're loud enough trapped in the platforms we created who would they be without us our imagination and Creative Energy spent there for one and for whom how the fact that we could hear how do we get out we go somewhere else same but different on chain on ethereum new Sovereign domain somewhere that's ours we create there we find each other there we support each other there we surprise ourselves with what's possible when we come together and create together that's what we believe it's what we're creating in a place called Zora pure internet re-invaluable resonance and Connection open and shared Independence and expansion for all creation ours truly those were some of our our partners who are really excited to be part of this event when I think optimism World coins or uh and base again for making this event possible but let's get right into all the things that I know you've been definitely waiting for and I want to cover the last thing which is all of the prizes I'll quickly walk through what all the prizes are for this event and you can follow up with a lot more details here

total where the first place will be receiving four thousand dollars a second place team would receive two thousand and a third place runner-up will get one thousand dollars so we're looking forward to seeing a lot of consumers come in on the base ecosystem and play with a lot of these apps so this is a really good thing to get started so then the best native projects on top of Base will receive three thousand dollars for the first place and two thousand for the second place this means if you are integrating with everything that's already inherently native to the base chain you get to be qualified for these projects or use anyone from tooling or existing infrastructure that's deployed or services that are available for you on base to to leverage these bass also is very excited about

winner is going to get two thousand and third project for runner-up we'll get one thousand dollars and we also want to see a lot of node and developer experient related uh improvements to the base ecosystem which means that if you look at the documentation on how to set up your own nodes on base or if you improve the documentation or make something a lot easier to replicate or get excited about from a developer experience standpoint two teams are going to be eligible to win one thousand dollars each next up we have World coin so the best overall hack that is on top of world coin or uses the sdks will receive five thousand dollars and then two honorable mentions are just the most interesting best overall products on worldcoin will receive one thousand dollars each there's also a governance app category so 2500 will go to the best governance app the best AI integrated use case will also get 2500 the most creative use case of the world ID or the SDK will get twenty five hundred

chain so give that a shot a lot more specifics are written down on the prizes page so you get to see a lot of those specifics and details and understand how you get started on the 8th level website and then hyperlane chain link mode and layer 0 are going to be giving ten thousand dollars in prizes each and save the graph es and covalent are giving five thousand dollars in prizes each all those specifics are listed on incubal.com super hack if you click on any of the prizes you get to see everything that I've talked about how those categories are broken down what it means to qualify or not qualify how you can check out the documentation some sample code you can watch the workshop video recordings they have a lot a lot of them have already done how to use uh their repos or the protocols you can watch all of that on demand and use that to get started to qualify for any of these prizes and finally last but not the least we want to make sure that you pace yourself you want the next two weeks to be really fun and we really care about making this event all about learning and experimentation we don't want this thing to be exhausting for you this is not meant to be a competition this is
