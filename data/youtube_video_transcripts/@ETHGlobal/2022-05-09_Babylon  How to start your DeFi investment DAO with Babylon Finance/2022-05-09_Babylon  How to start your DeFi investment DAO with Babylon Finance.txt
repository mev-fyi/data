great we're live so we have ramen here from babylon finance and he's going to give a session on how to start your d5 investment on dao i let you take the stage thank you you can see my slides right yep perfect hi everyone yes he said i'm ramon one of the founders of babylon finance and during this session we're gonna explain a little bit what's babylon what can you build using babylon and how to do it so let's get started first of all babylon finance is a decentralized protocol that helps people invest in b5 together through babylon you can create investment clubs defy investment clubs that you can also call on chain investment dials and the goal of this investment house in the end is to provide deals to investors and they invest together through these investment clubs in different device strategies and through those different device strategies they build wealth together so you can see babylon as this at this conglomerate of different investment clubs that we call gardens and they are all united by the bubble token that is the governance protocol governance talking of our protocol and they are all united by this shared goal of creating wealth for people and every garden can have a different investment thesis different risk criteria different investment time frame for example you can have some guardians some investment clubs that are formed around finding geo with a really low risk tolerance for example just landing dye or lending stable coins and you can have some other gardens that are going to be really high risk and they're going to take leverage positions on several on several farming protocols to achieve the highest yield so babylon finance started from a desire a personal desire to share all the things that i was seeing in the fight with my friends and family because there are a lot of benefits of invest investing together versus going alone going solo first of all right now and for the last few years it has been really difficult to invest in ethereum because every defy operation costs several hundred dollars so for example if you wanna deposit money to curve and then stake the lp tokens on convex that will cost you like 300 but now imagine that you're pulling together with 99 other friends so you are 100 people investing together so now the garden or the investment club will execute this operation just once for all hundreds of you and then the whole operation will still be 300 but then the cost for each one of you will be three dollars so it would be like 100 x gas savings for each of you of course it depends on the number of members on each investment club another good benefit of investment if investing together through this investment class is that users will be able to consolidate taxable transaction because when you do it on your own every every transaction is potentially taxable this depends on your tax jurisdiction and you should go on the details you should research the details with a with a tax expert but um what investment clubs on chain can do for you or what daos can do for you is like they can execute hundreds of operations on your behalf but the users they just care about depositing into the investment club and then withdrawing because is when a taxable transaction happens because it's when you change an asset like die to get in and you receive the tokenized share of that represent your participation in the in the club and then when you exit the opposite view you get back your participation in the club and then you receive back the original asset ah another benefit is that the krypton defies a market that never sleeps it's 24 7. so it's really impossible to keep up with it even if even if you stay all day glued to the screen so by investing with others you get to split the fees split the gas costs share the profits and also learn from each other and share the load of keeping up with all the things that are going on so now that we know a little bit what is the vision behind babylon and what are these investment clubs that we call garden let's go a little bit deeper into how they work mechanically so these gardens are tokenized erc20 funds where people deposit assets like stable coins or ethereum or bitcoin and they get a token an erc20 that represents their participation in this in this club or this investment now so once people have the token that represents their participation they can suggest a strategy and this strategy can be for example lending die on compound or investing in this year bond once this person suggests a strategy only the other members in that in that club or in that garden that have the erc20 token can avoid or download this strategy if this strategy gets approved by enough members then it will receive capital from the garden or from the club so it would receive capital from all the members so gardens in effect they have they don't need to have a single manager that manages everything and then needs to take all the decisions where to locate the capital this is different non-traditional headphone we are reinventing uh funds on chain from first principles at the same time all the participants have a skill in the game because from the person that creates a strategy to the people that vote those strategies depending on how the strategy performs what the profits are and depending if you voted for it or you rejected it then you will get rewarded and same thing for the person that created the strategy if the strategy did well the strategist is gonna get rewarded and if the strategy is really poorly the strategist is gonna get penalized the same time gardens are non-custodial this means that not even the managers or the strategists the people that create the study they don't have access to to user farms directly only strategies when they get approved by all the members can receive funds from the club finally all the information some of the transactions are are available on etherescan or on ethereum blockchain and is permissionless everyone can create an investment club and everyone can create strategies within an investment club although some investment clubs can be set up so only some some addresses have permission to do so another feature of the gardens is that the gardens can create the strategies using a knockout ui that plugs into more than 15 d5 protocols like comeback scarf avec compound uniswap pico gear or lido so now that we know a little bit how gardens work let's go deeper into the architecture and how the protocol is structured don't get overwhelmed by this by this graphic basically you can see that there are two main entities here one is the garden and the other one is the strategy one thing to take into account is like the garden that is the investment club is where the funds are pulled so you have the lps that are the people at the deposit capital and they receive the current tokens in return and the creator of the garden that is the one that is also a contributor an lp because needs to deposit to to be a normal member and is the one that sets the initial thesis of the garden and then the lps when they want to exit they will return these garden tokens and receive the the capital they deposited plus the profits and the performance fees if any and then any within a garden like we talked a little bit before people and strategies can suggest these strategies and then all the other members in the garden can vote to approve these strategies that are what we call still works here in this graph and they will need to stake and be a member of the garden to be able to vote on them then finally these strategies once they finish they will return the capital the capital to the garden with the potential profits or all the losses and then when a strategy finalizes we'll also return and allocate bubble rewards to the to the members of the garden depending on the performance because every strategy receives like a a stake of the protocol depending on how how well it performs because the goal of the of the bubble token and the mining rewards that is 50 of all the token allocation all the total supply is designed to reward the people that create the most wealth for others so the the more capital a strategy receives the the more mining rewards it will receive depending on the on the profits the higher the profits the higher the rewards the longer it lasted the higher the rewards and the more capital you received the higher the rewards and the treasury of the protocol receives also like half a percent management fee and five percent of the profits if any and that's how the the treasury of the protocol accrues value and becomes self-sustainable for the long term so from a data perspective and these entities that we mentioned the gardens the babylon protocol is this collection of gardens that are the investment clubs and their focus is to and their goal is to pull capital from a bunch of different lp's or members and these guardians can be created from the ui and support from the smart contracts directly it's totally permissionless as we said before then at the same time every garden can have one-to-one strategies and these strategies uh basically allocate capital from the garden to the investment ideas that were approved by the members and the strategies can be created from the ui from our no-code ui or from the smart contracts directly then every strategy can have one or more operations for example a default strategy can be as simple as just lending on the compound but can be more complicated than for example be a strategy that lends ethereum on ave then borrows borrows dye and puts that dye into into this curved pool and then uses the curve lp tokens to stick them into convex so that the strategy will have effectively four operations and these operations are created through the ui as part of the strategy builder or can be created again through the smart contracts and then every operation has an integration that is basically the adapter to connect with each each d5 protocol so now we're gonna see a quick demo of the ui to see how how you can create a club in just a few minutes using our ui because it's a lot it's a lot easier to understand all these things if you actually see them working so once you go to the um to our website you will see you will see the list of gardens that are verified by governance and you will see all the other gardens that we have so far we have around 100 investment clubs uh around 22 millions in tbo and we release publicly this month so here at the top you will see that there is a button so you can create your investment dow in just a few minutes so here are a few instructions but then basically you will be able first to say okay my er long lfd so you can create you can set the name of your investment club then you can sell the symbol of of the token that the people receive when they deposit capital is like then you can also set which one is the reserve asset this means which asset users will need to deposit to become a member and also this asset will be used to measure the performance then you can say what is the basis of the garden that is like what is the the time period what is the risk criteria and other time preferences for for the investors so so they know if this this investment club fits their preferences or not another thing you can do is you can also set an nft membership and you can also set like a minimum time in the garden so then for people that have stayed within your investment or within your investment club for example for for 10 days you will set like um something like 10 days on it and then they will be able to meet the nft after that time has passed and then we will have a lot of other features regarding what is the minimum amount of deposit what is the maximum amount you can deposit how long you need to see in the garden before you are able to withdraw that is this deposit heart lock then some protection measures like how much has the can the share price of the garden change this can protect against oracle manipulations and make the two apps even even more secure and then you can also modify what is the performance fee on top of the five percent that the protocol is getting you can control here how much uh how much for every strategy the strategies will get of the profits if any and the same for the voters and you can also do things like okay you can you can make the call garden private or you can make the guardian public so everyone can deposit and then you can make the balls public which means that everyone can vote on strategies to to approve them so they receive capital and then finally you can also set open strategies so then that means that anyone that is a member would be able to to suggest investment ideas or strategies finally we have a few more settings that control like the guardrails for the for the garden that is like okay how long the strategies can last and how many people need to vote for a strategy to to make it happen so it gets approved and resist capital and a few more a few more risk settings finally this will give you the review of all the things that you set up and that will be it then you will need to deposit the amount and you will be able to create a garden and in one minute you will have the you will have your garden created on chain and right now it costs like at the at the karen gas prices it costs only like a hundred dollars or so to create to have your investment downtime so now quickly i'm also gonna show you how the the strategy no code ui works once you have a garden this is a test garden that that we created a while ago to test things it has just a little bit of capital in this case you see that there is only like 0.3 ether you can see the share price you can see the rewards you can see which strategies are active that in this case it's nothing there is only idle capital you can say the performance in the past the thesis this just test all the all the criteria and then which people are in this garden but let's create a new strategy an investment idea example let's do is like we want to do we want to enter a card pool and then let's take the the lp tokens onto convex so in this case we will select an operation that is adding liquidity with select curve and then once curved you will we will find the curve that we want in this case try pull and we see that then we can we're going to be able to chain and let's take the lp tokens in convex scarf and pick up in this case after this we're gonna have a new operation and we're gonna say okay we're gonna stake it we're going to take it into convex and select it and that's almost it then we will set a few more parameters that how long we want this strategy to run how long i'm willing to how long i'm willing to to put my stake and how how much stake i'm willing to risk to be able to to qualify for getting the ten percent of rewards that the strategist gets and then a few more settings regarding the slippers and gas to make sure we don't we don't spend much of the capital located to a strategy on gas and that's it basically you will be able to submit the strategy on chain and this will be like pretty cheap at this carrying off prices uh 240 dollars right now because it has a fico bit and then you will have this strategy created and other other members will be able to vote on it and if they and if they approve it then it will receive capital so now that we got demo then let's go a bit further and let's go back to the presentation so now we're seeing that that this really is to create this defined basement from the ui that what babylon offers also is like it's basically a new primitive so you get this tokenized uh on-chain funds as a primitive and it's a new primitive on default and you can use them as a legal block and from your contracts you can react to market events or to things that happen on their protocol or your application and for example create the strategies on demand and have them running based on market events to fetch your positions or or create an investment that automatically whenever a hack happens or the sky is the limit so some ideas of what can you build using the garden and this actually have relation to communities that are already created for example this is the fountain of fifth that is is one of our bigger communities and is all focused in accumulating ether and without being exposed to the fear price and we have a bunch of active strategies one of them for example right now is he's lending his teeth on a bit then borrowing from it and then the borrowing width and then getting more more more steep and then three times to achieve like a leveraged position right now today st is a bit depec versus ether so that's why it's done but as soon as it recovers it will the profit will show here and you can see that there is another strategy that is lighting the fuse that is island in ether and then you can see the performance over time the thesis the properties and the so this this garden showcases really well how you can you can have an investment goal that in this case accumulate ether and then use different protocols connect to different protocols to achieve that that goal then another thing you can do is create an index of a pro of the offerings of a protocol using a garden and one garden that we launched last week is the pickle field right now pickle has like 30 or 40 yards available but you will need to spend gas to get into in each one of them but using a garden you can just deposit die and get exposure to all the top pickled jars in a single die deposit that actually also our deposits are gas free because we have done a bunch of work to to make it happen and then you will get exposure to all of these jars at once and this years are actively managed to make sure that you always get like the top jars managed by the community so you can use babylon to create like an index offering of a defy protocol finally you can also use babylon to create like a staking mechanic and a staking mechanic that you can use to so then members will need to deposit that token in the garden and then basically the garden will use that token those deposits to generate more return and it's something that our our heart uses we are the dog food in our garden technology to create the heart of babylon that is uh he's our staking mechanic and it's also our our our garden or her garden and it does a bunch of things we have uh we have a detailed medium post explaining all the things it does for example is buy back backs the token it also invests in the gardens it also has liquidity to uni swap and it also has liquidity to our fuel spool and to our treasury so that's a bit about ideas that we you can do with babylon then uh regarding our sdk we have a a website with detailed documentation about all our api or interfaces or deployment addresses and then we have a we have a repository that is babylon.financeslash contracts where you can see all of our interfaces some documentation the architecture and we also have already set up a test file with all the things you need to be able to create gardens strategies deposit into a garden bot for them execute them finalize them and be able to withdraw so quickly i can show you this in in the code sure this is too small but basically in this code you will see how to call our controller to create a curtain and you will pass the parameters like the name the reserve asset all the ones that we see so in the ui then the same thing about how to create a strategy then how to deposit to a garden how to vote for a strategy how to execute a strategy how to finalize it and how to withdraw and at the same time we also have created tests in this in this repository and you can run them executing johnny run test the only thing you need to set up to run the test is to grab an api key from alchemy and set it up in your environment variable you have the documentation here and that's pretty much it if you have any questions and we we are going to be in this score available during the next few weeks and you can also go to our to our babylon discord if you if you have anything else that you you want to chat about ideas suggestions feedback um and just to to re to reiterate we have ten thousand dollars in prices that are going to be awarded for the top three uh uses of gardens and that's it i think we can stop there and share there are some questions so i'll stop right there thanks ramen i think there's a question in the chat um carl asks on which network can you create a garden yep thank you um right now we are on mainnet ethereum only and we took this decision carefully because we think long term you probably want this investment class and this investment does on the network that has the most security that for now is ethereum that said long term uh we plan to deploy to other protocols and to other chains starting this summer we're gonna deploy to layer twos on ethereum uh arbitrary optimism and polygon but a few more actually a few more months later we are gonna we're gonna look into cross chain liquidity because our ideas like the gardens will still be on maintenance but these gardens will be able to deploy capital to strategies that may be on avalanche or maybe on solana or maybe on our bedroom or other so you will still be able to to get the security benefits of being on ethereum but being able to find where the best deal at the moment is yes of d5 products built on babylon or password yeah and the first the first one i saw that is the the fountain of fifth i think is uh to take it to account that we just released this month publicly and the fountain of fifth already has like 10 million in capital that was uh and is during this bear market is quite quite difficult to achieve that and but you can see the fountain of fifth and all of our other gardens that are up in our website and you can see the heart as well that the heart has done really well uh the heart has already accumulated like around 70 000 bubble tokens that is our governance token and has returned so far like more than a hundred percent apr to to to depositors and i see another question as well is the voting dollar chain yes the voting is not unchained but this is free for users is it's based on signatures and is is basically a store on a database but then all the all the signatures are submitted on chain and we do some some smart things to be able to to compute all the signatures to make sure that that the strategy is approved oh i see i know another question about a superfluid superfluit is actually something that we are looking into and is an integration into superfluid is really interesting and i i would encourage you to work on it something that we're gonna release that is almost ready but i did i didn't cover it it's like right now babylon uh integrates with 15 d5 protocols but we're also releasing this wednesday uh the custom sdk so you can build your own integration and you can also connect babylon to your to your own protocol or to your own smart contract and that will be available starting this wednesday um how we system is to interact with other chains it depends on the chain and the avm compatible chains it should be relatively straightforward the most complicated things there is that the d5 protocols that are on different chains are different so although many of them are forks some of them have different logic so you need to make sure that for example our protocol depends heavily on compound of a uni swap curve convex some of these protocols are on are on optimism arbitrary but some of them are not and we need to find replacements and being able to because babylon depends on integrating with a lot of defects we help other d5 protocols get more tbl and by helping them is how we grow so we depend on having this mature ecosystem so that's why we're waiting also a little bit to see which ecosystems mature yeah you can create hackath for example using our test you can create the gardens on [Music] on hard hat that is a local test test net but then you can also configure it to use drink by if if needed um [Music] there is a minimum two and a half if deposit it depends on the garden the minimum different gardens have minimum deposits but right now some other verified gardens so mainland is true that they have around [Music] two thousand or three thousand dollars not not ether i think is yeah i think it's a wrong one if the fountain of fifth and i know we are over time but if you have any more questions please uh follow us in on twitter and then go to our discord and we'll be there for the next few weeks so and we're pretty pretty responsive so yeah please let us know if you need anything great thanks a lot ramen um have a good day everyone thank you
