is everything electric when you actually enter the academic Paris is one of our favorite cities so it's a great match this is just one of my favorite events at crypto the hackathon is amazing it's my first time in an IRL hackathon here in Florida Welcome to eat Global Paris I think the venue is insane really historical venue with lots of History regarding economy my definition of a hackathon is like exploration trying to prototype out that you can present to the people hackers are pretty outgoing here and they engage and actually exchange ideas and try to work together so it's a pretty amazing event there is a lot of things to do a lot of talk to have also with people that is here since a long of time in this ecosystem so I really like this this events and this week basically my advice for first-time hackers is to just enjoy learning this is the best place that they can have to learn about so many different Technologies there's so many different people trying to support you and your process of learning and in the process of building the people who are here at the hackathons from these companies are here to help you like my job's developer relations I am here to help if you have questions come buy the booth ask in the Discord we just want to make sure that you have a great time you feel like you're growing and learning a lot and that you build something cool everyone is really really friendly make a connection to the sponsors make connection to teams which are sitting with you because you don't ever know who will be the founder of the next unicorn tomorrow you have so little time to build like the MVP of the product and at the same time to pitch it to the churches so it's quite exciting but at the same time it's so interesting when you're building something as quick as possible with the community so yeah we're in an awesomest yeah uh experience everyone wants to build something actually new and that works for everyone so it's really nice to see all of this energy from everyone everyone is trying to find a way to integrate something into something and maybe it works maybe it doesn't but I feel like in the ethereum community people are driven by a mindset by a goal by Vision by a certain idea of a future or a potential future and this is what makes this community so beautiful so it's just a way to like meet new people explore new ideas and build really cool things and then sometimes what comes out of it is people get really excited about pursuing it so I've actually also talked to a number of people that just want to keep building on it so it's a really great like starting point for building in the space so what I'm looking for a project when I'm judging is a combination of factors it can be the quality of the code that they've been writing the best practices followed while hacking but also the ux for use users and how polished the UI is for you know the first time user that doesn't know what the project is about and also the presentation that they gave when pitching the project just to understand in depth what problem they try to solve and how they addressed it with the technology that I developed the hackathon is as always incredible it's not the first it will be hackathon that I'm attending and every time I'm thinking well that's perfect like I can I cannot see it becoming better and every time I'm again and again surprised by how well organized everything is by the locations that are chosen right the team and the communication and the prices and yeah it's every time it gets better and better and it's incredible I can't wait to go to the next one this community has built some of the most compelling and important infrastructure for Humanity broadly and now that all these Primitives are here you as builders get to shape the next big thing the next important set of components so it's really up to you it's really up to what you want to build and what you make and what you scale that will Define the future so go make it a good one [Music]
