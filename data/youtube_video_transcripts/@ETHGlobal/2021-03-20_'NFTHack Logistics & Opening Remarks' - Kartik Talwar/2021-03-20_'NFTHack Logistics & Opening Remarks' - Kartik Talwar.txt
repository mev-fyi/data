good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to nft hack we have an amazing day and this weekend plan for all of you today and i can't wait to get started and tell you all about what's going to happen for the next few days so there's a lot of things we want to cover today we have a summit going on we have uh the hackathon happening and there's a lot of things about logistics with the hackathon specifically for all of you hackers and a lot of preview on what we're going to do uh the summit on that i want to share but before i get into all of that i want to really showcase um the eve global tv that we're using for this event all of you are looking at this video and talking to me here uh through with global.tv i encourage all of you to uh to log in and check this out we designed this specifically so we can share an experience together this will sync based on what's happening on stage and we will get to do some really creative things and also talk to all of you on the chat so if you're on the live chat please log in you can send any questions as we do all of our summits if you have any questions for our speakers you can ask them here and we'll be able to relate them to our speakers on top of all of that so a lot of cool things we planned for the rest of the weekend as well and be sure to stay tuned for some of those details so nft hack is a 8th global event and for those of you who don't know eath global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem this event is especially really dear to us because we've seen the most excitement that we've ever gone for any of our events and as a result we structured this weekend to be a mix of two things there's a hackathon going on which starts today and continues until sunday and we also have a summit on nfts and the potential of what could happen in this space which is probably presented by zora and we'll be doing the summit right after this uh kickoff and we'll have some great talks and some great speakers coming on so i'll walk through what we have uh planned for uh and lined up for each of those uh events and uh let's start this off with talking about the hackathon so this has been a mind-blowing event for us we have over 550 hackers participating this weekend and on top of all that we have over a thousand people joining us for the summit um the the hackers from uh the 550 plus hackers are coming in from 55 different countries and uh they spend 19 different time zones so it's going to be an interesting way to kind of figure out how to coordinate all this thing and keep everything live uh for the next 48 hours and we are super excited to see how this experiment goes we decided to plot where everybody came in from um these are all the cities that all of our attendees including the the summit attendees um are diving in from and it's just incredible to see the diverse crowd and the representation we have from all continents so on top of all of that we have over 70 mentors who are going to be available over the weekend on discord helping you anywhere from getting unblocked as you work on your projects whether that's technical help ui ux help you need uh to think about how you make this a better pitch for your demos on on sunday or just anything else you'd like to know about this space or how to use a specific protocol we also have 26 companies um some of the best representation in the nft ecosystem sponsoring this event but also partnering with us and i want to talk about what each of them are doing and how they'll be here to help you succeed for the weekend in addition to all of that we have over seventy five thousand dollars in prizes uh this is uh in uh collaboration with all of our sponsors and uh i'll be going through some of the details of the prizes as well so again a jam-packed weekend and uh let's get started so the first thing i want to do is thank some of our sponsors who have made this event possible and especially thank zora our presenting sponsor they've been incredible to work with for the past couple of weeks and they're also our summit sponsor and i'm just super excited to see what everybody builds on the zora protocol i also want to thank rarible the ethereum foundation protocol labs circle nftx and nft protocol for being our pillar sponsors they're also here and they're going to be sharing about what uh what they do what they're excited about for this weekend and how you can use their protocols and their websites in the marketplaces to really integrate your nft hacks and then we have our provider sponsors that's uniswap ens dp covalent charge particles heatblock art polygon decentraland super rare near pinata uh the graph uh nyftec superfluid and boson protocol all of these companies are here to help you they'll be able to hang out in the mentor channel you can ping each of them on the discord and learn about what they do and how you can use anywhere from their prizes to their apis and lastly want to thank our participating supporting sponsors foundation nf tao ipvs main and niftify so the thing that excites me the most about this entire event is that we have a such a broad spectrum of the skill sets of the attendees for the hackathon there are people who are interested in building stuff with d5s and nfts we have so many people trying to do cool and creative things with generated music and generative art there's a lot of social and gaming apps and there's a lot of apps and additions and improvements and marketplace related projects that that people have talked about and are planning to build so whether you're developer or you're a designer or your creative artist or your physician this is going to be a really cool way to collaborate across across teams cross skill sets and really build really interesting things uh together so let's quickly talk about this weekend so i have a lot of jam packed logistics for the next 10 15 minutes and then we'll talk about some of our prizes and then we'll roll into the summits so friday saturday sunday how does that look like i'll cover that in just a second a lot of you have asked us about team formation and how you can still find teammates if you're looking for them or if you're looking to get any help what prizes you can win all the talks and workshops that are happening today and tomorrow how judging particularly is going to work for sunday and and lastly the summit that is going to kick off in an hour so the most important thing here is everything is happening over discord um a lot of you are on this chat walking watching this uh as a hacker uh some of you will start joining in as summit attendees for all of you who are participating in the hackathon from your dashboard you would have been able to link to the discord and that would have given you access to all the private channels for this hackathon this means that only he was participating whether that's our sponsors and our are our attendees which is which is you um you'll be able to see the specific nft hack channels and and talk to everybody there and then everything else is still available on discord but the the nft hack channels will not be visible to everybody and and everything on the summit is already open to the public so you can just come in and log on to etherglobal.tv and and watch all the talks there and we also have dedicated support channels for various topics and various protocols the other thing for all hackers is that for all the talks that are happening today and tomorrow you would have already got a calendar invite with those details and links on how to join them and where you can watch the live streams and the entire schedule for this event summits and hackathons is already on our website we want this thing to be really asynchronous and we recognize that there's a lot of time zones that have to be accommodated so the way we're structuring everything is that if you are not able to make something live and you really want to everything will be recorded and will be instantly made available on the global youtube channel you can check out the youtube channel by just heading over to youtube.com youthglobal and everything else is also going to be again posted on discord and lastly just as a reminder to check out the schedule um the agenda who's speaking and everything else you can just head over to nft.edu global.com that's going to be the most up-to-date place to see everything that's happening and that's going to be a resource for the next three days so let's quickly talk about how does the hackathon work the hackathon officially begins now which means as of me signing this sentence you can start working on your projects and that gives you 48 hours and 17 minutes to work on anything you'd like and submit that on sunday you can work with teams if you are working with a team you can have up to five members on your team and as i just said it's 48 hours from here to some of your project and that becomes it comes out to be noon which is 12 p.m eastern on sunday march 21st and the rules and the criteria for the event is as very simple um your submissions and what you're working on should be related to nfts that is the biggest qualifier here we want you to still have the full creative freedom to build whatever you like but you don't have to do something specific or take something from the list we also have a list of ideas that you can pick from or receive from and if you're looking for inspiration and we're happy to share that and it's already shared on the discord and the info center that you have access to and uh the only other condition is that everything you're going to be doing and submitting for this weekend must be done during this hackathon that means even though you are free to use any open source libraries or for work in the existing project especially in in the web3 ecosystem you should not be working on or continuing a project that you've already been working on before today so you can start something new today you could have specced out something but you should not start coding anything or should not submit anything that was coded before this event started uh and what we'll be doing is in order to qualify for any prizes you will be asked to submit your source code and we will verify if the work was done before or during the weekend to actually receive the price and again there's a lot of edge cases in there so if you have any questions you're going to clarify something please message anybody on the 8th global team on discord and we'll be able to look at and address your concerns and the other kind of common thing that we got asked a lot this this week was what if you're new to ethereum a lot of you are trying to understand how you can anywhere from use nfts in a creative way to a developer from the web to your site transitioning into learning about smart contracts and solidity and we want this thing to be as open and as welcoming for all of you so what we really do is if you think you need help or if you would like to work with somebody who has complementary skills whether you are designer looking for somebody with with development skills or or the other way around uh we really encourage you to find somebody and work with somebody to really collaborate and do something that you both would enjoy and get some insights and skills out of so you can head over to it to find a team channel on discord and really paying a lot of others who are also looking for help or ideas uh you can also introduce yourself in the nft hack chat um and talk about what you're looking forward to and what you're excited about and how you're thinking about your ideas and hope to meet others and and by the way in case if you were not able to find somebody today or over the the course of the rest of the day it's still okay you can hack solo you don't have to have a team this is very much about building something and trying something and experimenting with what's possible in this space and we really want you to create um over over anything else so if you can't find somebody or if you don't know what to do or you really haven't been able to figure out exactly how you want to get to where you want to be we're here to help feel free to ping us the mentors are here to help our our sponsors are here to help and we'll make sure that you get everything you need to accomplish what you would like to get out of this weekend on top of all that there's a lot of talks and workshops for all skill sets for beginners for experts uh we did a lot of workshops yesterday uh for how to get started with certain protocols or if you're getting started with solidity for the first time um and we have some boilerplates as well you should really check out each scaffold repo and and use that to really reduce the amount of work you have to do on the setup and getting everything started um if you were not able to attend some of these workshops from yesterday they are all recorded and you can check them out again immediately on youtube and you can use that as a way to catch up on on that content and there's a lot of summit talks today that are going to be really broad and on a lot of different themes and we also have a lot of talks on saturday so all these things will be happening you can check out again uh everything on the website and for all the details on the workshops and how to use specific apis and protocols all that is linked on the info center from all of you hackers and one more time the full schedule workshops the youtube links and everything else is available on nft.edu global.com the website for this event so i want to quickly walk through how judging and submissions is going to structure be structured this is a really important piece so i'm kind of covering this immediately and we'll be sending a lot of messages reminding everybody about the structure because a lot is has to happen in parallel for all of this the key takeaway is that submissions are due at noon 12 p.m eastern on sunday the 21st that is 48 hours and 12 minutes from now and we really want to make sure that everybody submits everything in that timeline because everything after that will be done live and synchronous so we really have to get everything going in order for all of your projects to be judged um for us to work on what some of the best teams in the projects are from this event so there's two main things that are happening for judging there's a main judging that every team will go through and that's where you'll present to the main judges and you'll talk about the project and who you are and what you built over the weekend and then there is a sponsor price judging sponsor price judging is for every project that is looking to integrate or qualify for a sponsor price you will have to separately also present to the sponsors after you've done the main judging the the key thing to note here is that when submissions are due which is at noon eastern the main judging starts one hour after submission deadline whereas the sponsor judging will start 30 minutes after the submission deadline and the way it's structured is as follows for the main judging you will have four minutes in total to demo your project we really encourage you to take aside some time and record a video of your demo this way there are no technical difficulties there are no av issues all this will happen over zoom and if you are relying on um anything from a live transaction on on mainnet or you have to wait for certain transactions to confirm um we don't want you to be penalized for the time it's going to take for those things to happen so we really encourage you to record those things so you can just smoothly play your video and get to the heart of your demo but of course you don't have to necessarily do that we strongly encourage that to happen but you can also present live um it just means that we are going to be running on a very tight schedule so as soon as every team hits a four-minute mark we will cut you off and move on to the next team because we only have a limited amount of time to process possibly hundreds of projects so don't do this last minute please be sure to uh take out some time before submissions are due to really think through how you want this demo to work and how you're going to talk about it and we'll be sending all those instructions again in a lot more detail on discord but all these instructions are already available in the info center in terms of how the sponsorship judging works if you are presenting or if you are submitting for a sponsor prize the key thing to notice here is that you have to specify which prizes you are applying for on your dashboard as you are submitting the projects and for every sponsor you are going to be presenting to you're going to have to go to their discord there's going to be a audio video channel on discord for each sponsor so for example if you have two sponsors that you're applying for the prizes you will have to first go to the main judging and then immediately after that in that same window which is three hours after submissions to do go to the sponsored discord for each sponsor you're qualifying for and present your demo to them you'll have the same amount of time for uh your demo to each of those sponsors and then the sponsors would independently determine who their winners are in that same window so be sure to really specify these prizes and because there's going to be a lot of things happening in parallel you'll just have to keep in mind if it's worth going to a sponsor before you go to the main judging or after uh we'll do our best to give you an estimate for when your number is going to be in the queue for presented to the main judges so you can coordinate this and really present um to sponsor or main judges first again a lot of these details are already on the info center and you can check out all this stuff if you head over to if nft.edu judging and we'll be reminding you all these details over and over on discord and if you have any questions we're also happy to answer all these things in discord we just got a question on on the chat um you your demos don't have to be on mainnet um there is no requirement for you to deploy everything on mainnet it is a question around if you are going to be judging and you do require a mainnet transaction um we just want you to make sure that all that still happens in time and you are not waiting for something to happen in order for you to move on with the rest of your demo because if you hit your four-minute limit for the judging uh we will cut you off and move on to the next team so uh you can do everything on testnet you can do everything locally but you don't have to do anything necessarily on mainnet and lastly i just want to give a quick reminder to everybody on our code of conduct we have rules on how to participate and behave um in our community and you can check out the rules and the code of conduct by heading over to youthglobal.com rules but in summary to keep it quick we just want you to be respectful to everybody around you and harassment and abuse in any capacity or any form is not going to be tolerated we will take immediate action against anything that resembles harassment and if you need any help or if you need anything clarified or you're you want to just ask us anything or mention anything to us in private uh please reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be able to address your concerns um immediately over discord so before we get into the prices and everything else i want to really remind everybody that um even though this is a weekend event um we really want you to pace yourself uh don't optimize working on your project over your health or your sleep um we don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we don't want this thing to be a competitive thing we really want you to have fun and really learn this is this is more about experimentation and in seeing all the creative things we can do when you combine developers creators artists designers and everybody and such the the diverse crowd we have for uh participating this weekend so try as much as you can even if you don't get to finish what you wanted to do i still encourage you to present and really talk about how close you got to our judges because we want you to learn and keep working on um your projects so all that said let's go talk through today's schedule the first thing i want to cover is uh the summit um we're gonna just very soon roll into our summit and our talks the nft summit which is proudly presented by zora is going to have a super wide and amazing set of speakers covering a lot of things in the nft and the artist ecosystem we're going to kick off today uh with our crypto media talk from jacob and dee from zora then we're going to have a far side chat with gary vaynerchuk then we have a discussion on the value of nfts from with dylan field and tubador we have another panel on what comes after nfts and how we can make them productive which is going to feature linda linda shea jesse waldman and marguerite coin artist from neon district and then we have a panel on how theorem is for artists uh featuring some of our favorite people in this space uh latasha bobby hudridge rac and mike chinoda from lincoln park and then we have an amazing panel on the creators behind a lot of the initiatives in the nft ecosystem uh we're going to be talking about mint fund um so we have carlos mikhail jess samantha and cersei who are going to be sharing their insights into what it takes to build this community from the ground up and lastly we're gonna have a an interview with rohan from dapper labs and he's going to be talking about top shelf flow and how dapper labs is thinking about going and taking crypto and nfts into the mainstream so we're really close to jumping into our very first talk of the day but before that i want to just give a quick um overview of some of the prizes that we have and some of the sponsors who are super excited to share um how they supported this event and and each of you this weekend and uh we have some videos that we asked all of our sponsors to record to greet us uh greet all of you and uh and really kind of cover who they are why they're excited what they do and how you can get involved anywhere from using their protocol to building uh with them and along them and uh what we'll do is we're going to kick this off with our very first in our presenting sponsor zora so we're going to share a video that's our prepared for us and we'll then jump into their prizes really quick so we'll pull that up and uh [Music] hi there we are zora well i'm all alone here but i speak on behalf of the people who are zora so i am part of zora as well at least for now we are not what you think we are we are not a platform and we're not a marketplace either you are the platform in fact we believe that there should be 1 000 platforms like you maybe a million even all as weird and wonderful as you are with their own communities and their own ideas valuable ideas that can change the world or at least change the way how people look at it we want you to be able to manifest those ideas put them out there build on top of them make money with it or think about completely new ways that value means to you and your community and how you distribute it we can't make this decision for you but we think that you should have all the tools to make these decisions we believe that this is the only way we can achieve the big things that weren't possible until this very moment because until now we were not able to build them together and that's what we do we are building these tools open source transparent and accessible for everyone we want you to use them to shake up things stick it to the mail as they say change the world sounds complicated it's not the opposite it's the easiest thing on the planet as long as we do this together are you getting it i hope you do now some official information if you feel alone or have questions you can talk to lily breck or ethan they will be waiting for you on our discord channel on saturday lily will be there from 11 a.m to 12 p.m pacific time wreck from 2 p.m to 3 p.m pacific time and ethan will be available from 10 p.m to 11 p.m pacific time say hello from me i have not seen them in so long they're really fun and i miss them speaking of fun we have three prizes of 2500 usd each but only for those who really get it we hope to see smart contracts that enable crowdfunding crowdminting pro collection and more go as galaxy brain as you want big small precise universal i know you have what it takes i believe in you i believe in us good luck [Music] amazing that was a very creative introduction to zora and how they're excited to be supporting all of you this weekend uh you already heard a bit about the schedule for the zora team uh to be available to answer and address any of your questions and they also talked about the prizes they're going to be doing i want to quickly repeat some of these prizes and uh just to give a quick overview zora will be giving 2500 in usdc uh for building dowels and crowdex to really build any contracts or applications that enable crowdx and there's going to be 2500 usdc for making developer tools and making it simpler and easier for store-related developer tools to be built and then a prize for 2500 usdc again for building your own marketplace um we'll share all these details again um in the prizes page and over discord but here's a quick overview for what's coming for zora next up we have wearable and uh super excited to see what the wearable team has to say dear hackers it's alex from wearable i welcome all of you here today on this east global nft hack event we're all witnesses of how blockchain world undergoing massive developments and the nft is deleted and the largest developments of that of this year and the force behind this development is you hackers builders designers product managers i welcome all of you here today we at rarible started 1.5 years ago as a platform that democratized access to nfts to creators we welcomed everyone to try to experiment of what will be the next big thing inside the nft market and we've been always tracking community sentiments and and and being and being community oriented previous summer we launched the governance token and and the liquidity mining program that massively increased the liquidity on the marketplace today we just hit 2 million dollars of daily volume with 30 million dollars of the volume over the last 30 days and and almost 60 000 active traders buyers and sellers on the platform we are continuing our efforts into democratizing assets to the nft world and progressive decentralization and today we want to pre-release our our nft protocol we are taking all the all the infrastructure behind wearable and making it accessible for everyone wearable protocol supports nft issuance trading and there is the api indexing api that tracks all the nfts ever created on the ethereum blockchain out there in every collection and making them available for trading under our decks our issuing tools allow you to to to set an arbitrary royalties for several addresses our decks respects that royalties even if they were created without using wearable issue and tools uh we support front-end fees that that you can you can pass arbitrary front-end fees when contributing an order to the protocol variable supports indexing of all the blockchain data and providing the metadata to it wearable.com would be the largest client of wearable protocol you we have all these 50 000 traders that would would be using using the shared order book so that's that's the single best reason to try to build a wearable protocol because we know it's that it's really hard to to grow the marketplace with the supply and demand growing simultaneously and and moreover we have the wearable dial and we've been always a community oriented and community owned marketplace so by building on wearable protocol you can be sure that you will have all the support from the wearable dial and you're starting early on you can help us the team to design incentives that would support all the projects building on top of the wearable protocol we specifically designed protocol to be agnostic and agile to allow you to express all your or all your possible creativity and building projects on top of it we support lazy maintaining we support collaborations we support arbitrary royalties just as a map of addresses that need to receive downstream royalties so let's let's try to build something great together uh the documentation available at docs.bearable.com you can find me and our team under ithack discord sponsor wearable channel or on twitter under insider xerox or telegram can not be i'm pretty sure that you will be able to get all the support from our team most of our team lives under european time zone so we will be able to get you supported by early u.s time and late hour time good luck building let's let's do something great together amazing that was alex from wearable and to sum up their prizes they're going to be giving five thousand dollars in total for the best variable protocol and uh the first uh price first place will get 2500 and runner runner-up will get 1500 and then a thousand dollar prize for the third place at the best use available protocol

product marketing for circle welcome to nft hack i don't need to tell you that nfts are skyrocketing in popularity and it's making blockchain technology more mainstream the moment that we have all been waiting for as crypto ogs has finally arrived consumers are rushing into nft marketplaces the ones that can facilitate crypto and non-crypto consumers are the ones who are going to stand out everyone i know who doesn't know what bitcoin or ethereum is are trying to get their hands on the latest nba top shot moment or the next kings of leon album which was offered as an nft but we all know that most consumers don't really know how crypto works and that the process of buying an nft um is intimidating how many people will know how to complete a checkout process that requires them to have a crypto wallet have an east balances most consumers don't have a wallet or know what eth is yet they expect the same experience at with consuming a media [Music] just as they would when shopping on amazon or shopping with spotify to listen to music and that's where circle comes in circle is a global financial technology company that enables businesses and developers all over the world to harness

and sellers on your platform as the infrastructure for payments and wallets for companies like dapper labs we've been in the middle of all of this crazy nft momentum and action um helping scale companies when there is demand and this is why we're super excited today to sponsor nft hack this weekend and our unique prize for all developers is to award a total of 5 000 usdc to the projects that

which we'll shortly talk about in a second so next up we have nftx and alex from the nftx team is going to talk about their protocol and platform hey everyone i'm alex gausman the founder of nftx i'm not very good at speeches or promotions but i've written down some points which i will now share the adoption of nfts over the past couple months has been truly staggering for a while now i've been quite bullish on nfts but even i have been checked by the recent mania and it has really only served to strengthen my belief that nfts will be a revolutionary technology this decade i foresee a future where the concept of a digital collectible is as ubiquitous as the concept of a selfie is today just as the web 2 revolution has made everyone a photographer i believe the web 3 revolution will make everyone a collector in truth i do not think the real nft mania has even started yet because there are still so many unexplored possibilities bringing this back to nftx our goal as an open org and a protocol is to become a black hole for all non-fungible assets whether they be in-game items digital art collectibles physical property deeds tokenized legal agreements or other forms of nfts every time a developer deploys a new nft and increases nftx's total addressable market which is one reason i encourage everyone listening to consider building an nft related product at its core the nftx protocol itself is actually quite simple anyone can call the create vault function which deploys an erc20 fund token that is linked to a particular nft contract for example vault 13 manages the glyph token which is linked to the auto glyph contract after a vault is created the fund token can then be minted once for each nft item which is transferred into the vault it is also possible for a fund to target specific token ids from a collection such as the punk zombie fund which targets specific ids from the zombie crypto punks at the time of this recording we are working hard towards launching a version 2 but nevertheless we encourage developers to try building on our current nftx contract it is my hope that documentation for version 1 will be ready by the time this video airs but regardless we are keen to offer assistance to any developers who need it feel free to bring general nft questions to us as well during the hackathon if you have any and we will do our best to answer i am a true believer in decentralization and it has been amazing watching nftx develop as an open org these last few months there's so much work being done behind the scenes and there are always new people joining us in our mission to bridge the fungible and non-fungible worlds on ethereum i urge anyone interested in nfts whether you're an artist developer or collector to come check out our forum or stop by our discord chat and say hello we look forward to meeting you thank you for listening amazing that was alex from nftx protocol and just to sum up their prizes they're giving away five thousand dollars for the best use of nftx protocol where the the first place gets 2500 the runner-up gets 1500 and third place will get one thousand dollars and lastly we have nft protocol and uh we'll have joseph from nfc protocol talk about who they are and how you can work on the nft protocol hi everyone joseph here from nft protocol nft protocol is a generalized protocol for nfts and what that means is we're building a number of features on top of different evm chains and different blockchains for decentralized architecture for trading facilitating the creation of and building on nfts and the economy that's supported by nft trade so the first thing that we're doing with the nft protocol is building a dex that has many unique features it's web3 enabled uh we'll talk a little about that a little bit later we have also an idea to create different types of nft galleries for example in archaeology and a lineage of memes and internet culture that can be represented by nfts we're also looking at making a price index for nfts so you have not groups maybe let's say an art nft group or you have like insurance nft groups or specific things like a specific artists nfts can be bundled into an index and then given a price and traded on a regular exchange that would be like a decentralized like amm or something like that so let's talk a little bit about where we are now with nft protocol and right now we're creating a dex uh it is not like an automated market maker decks it is more like order book decks so each of the trades or each of the orders on the decks will have an index and that index refers to either a 721 to 721 swap so you can trade one nft for another or a 721 to erc20 trade so as the creator of this swap i can specify which nft that i have for sale and i can specify which erc20 that i'd like to receive now because it's web3 enabled we can have unityswap that routes trades through into the erc20 and then it'll make it so that pretty much any your c20 can be used to purchase any nft and the creator of that trade will be able to get a uh the erc20 token of his choice his or her choice so that's one of the things that we're doing with the nfc protocol right now is creating this order book decks we're going to be expanding this into the 1155 standard and other standards that come out to support nft trades and currently we're in beta for this dex at the moment and if you'd like to sign up for the beta please go to nft.org check out our discord or telegram and you can get connected to us through there and once we release the beta it's going to be live with three features 721 to 721 trade 721 to 20 trade as well as minting which is going to be pretty cool some of the unique features of the decks are going to be web3 features like for example you'll have uh some sort of like feed of entities that would look like a social feed or some sort of uh timeline where you can see the recent things that have been posted all of it will be completely decentralized we also have the whitelist feature which means if i wanted to trade one-on-one with another person instead of creating an order that's open to the public i can create a private order and then only they are able to see the details and only they are able to trade with me in that instance so we're looking at some privacy components and otc trade components as well as having web 3 features on the front end so if you'd like please come participate and make suggestions we also have a 1000 nft reward for anyone that's going to be making it the best suggestion and the best plan for what you could do with the nft protocol based on the things that i have outlined here and in our one hour workshop on saturday we'll also be going into how nft protocol can be used to facilitate trade and enhance the nft community as a whole so that's nft ticker on coin market cap and coin gecko that's nfc protocol see you guys later amazing so just as a creative way to get people to learn about nft protocol they'll be giving a thousand nft tokens to the hacker who has the best engagement with an empty protocol saturday session which is tomorrow and you can check out the time on the youth global website so those were just a few of our key sponsors that just talked about who they are and why they're excited to be part of this event but i also want to just do a quick shout
