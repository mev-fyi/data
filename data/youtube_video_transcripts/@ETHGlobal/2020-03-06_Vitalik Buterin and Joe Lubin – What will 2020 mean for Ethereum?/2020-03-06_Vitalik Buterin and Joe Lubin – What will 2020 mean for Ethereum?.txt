please welcome Joe and metallic onstage [Applause] hello hello are you guys doing next one I'm next one - what a coincidence well this is gonna be fun so I have a handful of questions around a lot of these things are kind of covering the history of how you two met and in the theorem project in general but and we'll get to some controversial stuff closer to the end but just to kind of start off this chat how did each of you initially meet each other and what was were the history around you joining Lutheran foundation and just a project and yes so I grew up in a mythical Northern Territory called Canada as did Vitalik and I regularly went back home over essentially the Christmas December vacations to go visit my family and I had been living in Jamaica at the time I'd been paying a huge amount of attention to Bitcoin for a bunch of years already I'd been reading articles from this very clear expositor of the technology and something called Bitcoin magazine and I later on came to understand that this was actually a remarkably young person who I was learning a lot from and there was this Bitcoin foundation thing that looked sort of shady and then up north there was this other Bitcoin group I forget was what was in the Bitcoin Alliance affluent Alliance of Canada and so there was this guy up in Canada guy named Anthony Diorio who was taking a more bottom-up grassroots approach and so I hadn't really made myself expert in the technology by reading all the time and I hadn't really been part of the community at all and so when I went up to visit my family I called this guy Anthony and we chatted for a while and he said oh by the way there's this guy Vitalik and I knew who vitalik was and he wrote a white paper that people are excited about and we're gonna have a meet up I think it was January 1st 2014 why don't you come by and you can check it out and so talk to Vitalik for a few minutes about it Vitalik said he'd send me the white paper I read the white paper that night and then and it was quite a big energized meet up he was at this place called D central and downtown Toronto the dance in Iran and for the next few days and weeks there was a ton of activity on skype and people were just coalescing into essentially a project and Anthony rented a place in Miami in advance of the North American Bitcoin conference at which vitalik was set to deliver a paper describing the theory of implant form remember any lunch ya know that meetup was great and so throughout between that meeting and the North American Bitcoin conference there was just an insane amount of mostly Skype and and Meetup activity and so in UT or the whole team globally it's awesome so if I'm not mistaken I think this is the the first time you're together in London since DEFCON 1 which was in 2015 what are sort of some of your highlights from that event what do you kind of remember a lot of surprises there I would love to kind of get your take on out DEFCON one was four and a half years ago a bigger events than the etherium community had ever had before then there were some where over 300 people at this big hall and essentially in central London at the conference and came together for a week look gloriously or and also more ornate than this even it was pretty special a lot of excitement all around this was also when some of the some of the Microsoft stuff was being announced for the first time in since then Microsoft is and if obvious we've done quite a lot of things for the etherium ecosystem yeah just it definitely felt like a big coming-out party yeah so my recall was that we felt that we were this tiny niche community talking still on skype a lot some meetups and just doing something that felt like it had real magnitude that that drew in a lot of people so that we actually that event was arranged and then canceled and then revived and so it ended up being I think an inflection point in our ecosystem because we all arrived and there were so many of us and we were so excited and we were so excited that there were so many people that were so excited about being there and it really just injected so much energy and momentum into our ecosystem the other really remarkable thing which I think we all started realizing in a bit of a buzz on Thursday was that in the main room or in the back area we were all talking and then everyone realized relatively simultaneously that four days into it nobody had talked about the price of ether and so it was it was just so obvious that there was a group of builders developers etc and so that's that's exactly why these events are great because people specifically care more about building and it's always excited to see that no that's amazing so we talk you're with ether and Foundation Joe you lead consensus I wanted to ask this to each of you which I like what do you think consensus does better than anything our foundation and sort of similarly Joe what do you think foundation does better than what consensus does I think enterprise outreach is a big one against census has brought in they've brought in Microsoft's and brought in a quite a lot of other company has said to the etherium ecosystem and and they're definitely starting to contribute more and more and that's something that I definitely think the etherium foundation this does does not do nearly as well so early on consensus was pretty much focused on continuing the the vision and the mission of the etherium project and we had license to do whatever the F we wanted to do so that the foundation is a special animal it needs to be it needs to be a neutral steward of the ecosystem it's sort of a selling point for certain things in our ecosystem consensus could run crazy experiments and and do splashy marketing events etc and it didn't you know we worried a little bit about statement statements that we're making or how were perceived but we did have the luxury of essentially exploring a lot of different pathways and making lots of noise and we do need a very strong foundation in my opinion I like the minimalist approach but I also think that we need a clear voice that is the the center or Shepherd steward of our ecosystem and we play pretty complementary roles I think so maybe it gets to digging a little bit deeper on that what would you say the role of the foundation is right now and kind of how do you think about what the priorities are for what you need to do as the project I think in general and have support things that are valuable and really important to the ecosystem that don't have a way of finding and supporting themselves and so historically that's involved a lot of research a lot of things like client developments and if outreach communications and I mean over time like the way that the foundation has done some of those things has naturally changed so like for example over the last of two and a half years the Foundation's use of grants has really ballooned a huge amount but I feel like in general though those goals are still the same so we're in London today this event there's about 300 people here a lot of them are hacking on new projects anywhere from a 2.0 to to defy and what I want to kind of do is just get your take on what do you think about the the UK etherium and the web 3 community are there any projects are excited about what are your general comments and how this specific country in this region is evolving with respect to anything from regulation to develop interest just just what are your general comments and thoughts around the space UK has always been a big center of the etherium community and even at the beginning we had a fairly sizable communications team here and then of course a big part of cilok was built out of here here and that was a big part of the ecosystem early on and right now as tech has been doing a huge amount of great work there's a lot of other companies I mean there's like dramatics doing things on the enterprise side for example there's quite a lot of just different smaller projects yes so consensus has quite a big shortage office obviously there's incredibly strong academia in the area lots of cryptographers we have a handful of projects that span enterprise and main that focus so there's apex 3 data analytics soon trading platform there's at Hara there's trust ology there's drum G they think they're a little more enterprise-e Aztec protocol spectacular enterprise-e and main neti at the same time for sure and I do think it goes back to to what vitalik said there was a madman Jule smoking Stephon t'wall who did a spectacular job of essentially driving so many people especially he maintained just a massive meetup list and ran lots of events and so I think he created a really strong foundation for the theorem community way back then a theorem London meetup group is still one of the biggest you know groups in the world that's definitely true up can I just kind of being on that theme I feel like the word enterprise being thrown as a as a negative thing or just like not as excited but like I don't think that's the case but I actually won't understand so how do you see the enterprise world on blocks use anything specifically can i evolve over time and and both of you've kind of made comments around Maine that an enterprise kind of merging eventually and over time kind of how do you see that going forward or kind of what do you imagine that looks like yeah and I guess among some people kind of was aboard Enterprise has definitely had a bit of a historical connotation of trade earnest because it's like oh it's the centralized people they're coming in oh they're gonna and they're gonna use private blockchains and in reality I think in enterprises have in many cases played a quite helpful and of complementary role to the etherium ecosystem even like Ernst & Young kind of built sand if night fallen it's been open sourced and even like dramatics as ever for example and and sometimes those projects are kind of on private and consortium chains no even when they are the beauty of the etherium ecosystem is that a lot of the work can be in a transferred over to the public ecosystem pretty easily and also increasingly there's been more and more and if Enterprise activity on on the main net starting to happen just as people are realizing that public auctions are a trustworthy thing that is here to stay so I think just like young humans essentially need to explore their own path they need to differentiate themselves they as they mature they first individuate from where they came from and then they sort of incorporate the new good stuff that they've discovered with the old good stuff that millennia of society has discovered I think ecosystems are very similar to that so if you take a look at the internet ecosystem it was a bunch of radicals as well who built out different protocols and essentially wanted to change the way the world operated and many an enterprise liked what they built and many an enterprise started using SMTP and HTTP in HTML etcetera in more constrained environments in Internet's and that all effectively merged into enterprises or new kinds of enterprises or you know brand-new companies built by those young people that have effectively become the establishment and so I think we're gonna see a similar pattern here I think I don't know as coinbase Enterprise at this point in a sense they sort of are and so we see the technology becoming mainstream at some point soon we see private permissioned networks continuing to exist I like the idea of use case sufficient decentralization where it is sufficient and I also expected lots of permission systems and they're already our permission systems they will all probably move to may net or layer two that connects to Maine net and so basically see the page I find moving to to public blockchain is that just relying on them as a central source if you build a logical logical construct for your system it can sit on a disconnected private permission version of the etherium technology or it could or it could be lifted to a different version if if privacy confidentiality scalability usability are all addressed well and they've all they're all being addressed extremely well then there's no reason why you couldn't lift a system and lay it back down on on may net we anticipate that lots of private networks will link laterally to one another so the Congo commodity trade finance network is doing that with with fact which is commodity trading network we already see linkages down to main net from these private systems just to pin the state for anti collusion purposes we see most enterprises there are many enterprises that we talk to some of the biggest in the world getting very serious about tokens issuing tokens bonds wide variety of uses and anything of real value needs to be on a maximally decentralized platform you can move it to another platform for different reasons but if you if you try to put something that ends up with real value on a much less decentralized platform it's going to be a tact that that's just not going to be a viable solution going forward for for the financial world we have one project which we're actually going to announce March 4th with two of the biggest companies in the world focused on building a system that takes private information and processes from either private chains or even just private data stores or documents in entangling those in those pieces of information among different counterparties in interesting ways using zero-knowledge techniques and enabling that information to be tracked on main net so I think it's gonna be it's gonna be driving driven from within the enterprise of theorem main networking group and I believe it's gonna be a pretty significant breakthrough and how enterprises he has made net next week that's exciting it's like a few days that's awesome yeah my question would have been when do you see that happening and you already answered that days very soon it's all like so we're coming out with a with a POC it's a supply chain POC that will introduce a new protocol awesome they sound like mr. buuder and that's also my name dr. Breuder and what is he 2.0 and and could you give us an update on what's going on with the development of 2.0 sure so eath 2.0 is a set of very significant upgrades to the ethereum blockchain that's been researched for the last few years and will be and if implement layers well is being implemented and will be switched over to over the course of the next couple of years and I like what the yeah so the two biggest parts of it are proof of stake and sharding so proof of stake and naturally being this you consensus algorithm that replaces a proof-of-work mining and sharding being the scalability technique that allows many more transactions to go on chain because not every in node and the network has to verify all of the transactions and the current status is that so it's the upgrade is broken up into a multiple fee there were phase zero creates a proof of stake chain phase one adds basic sharding and then there's this likely proposal that a kind of merger of the two systems will happen after this and then there will be some further upgrades that add more head of computation capacity to the sharda chains and phase zero is getting quite close to launch so it's extremely close to having multi-client test nets it's already had single client tests that's for quite some time it's already everyone have run through a couple of rounds of and of security auditing and client optimization and it will have a few more rounds so generally and quite optimistic about that becoming a real thing very soon and you know and from there the network well and if it become more and more shorted and will have lots and lots of scalability can you quantify some of these improvements in terms of what is scalability mean here relative to what we have I'm sure so I think in general were estimating like somewhere between a factor of a hundred and a factor of a few hundred for sharding by itself and it's actually per second yes by a factor of so going up from the current numbers which are like 10 to 40 depending on what kind of transaction it is but then of course like this could end up being multiplied further if people use roll-ups on top of sharding we'll get to that soon that's awesome can I jump in there yeah so one thing I'm excited about is that unlike say the x86 upgrade life cycle this was a brand new design space so it's able to it's a new network it will be a fundamentally much better set of solutions unconstrained by what happened before yet right from the start both networks are essentially going to be linked and so there's going to be a pretty smooth merging evolving from a theorem one that was actually my next question yeah yes so so with respect to the tokens moving across with respect to staking on one chain or moving tokens to another chain with respect to making use of data from one chain in into another chain with respect to building backward-looking bridges with respect to finalizing blocks on the first chain so there's gonna be this synergy between the two which will make it feel like it's one system yet it'll be a slow migration to essentially a much better system over time no it's awesome and that's over the next couple of years or rather after phase one I guess great we kind of talked about things that both of you kind of generally share the same opinions on I want to kind of say or ask what is something that you Joe disagree with telecon and was how like why you disagree with Joe on yeah so we were we were discussing this a little bit before and we were having a tough time coming up with something I generally agree with vitalik because he's very smart and and we are philosophically generally quite aligned one piece that that I came up with was round on chain governance where I remember multiple meetings in the first year where we talked optimistically about how we could get rid of the foundation and replace it with a set of smart contracts and we just needed to to get to the point where we had sufficient functionality so that we could do on chain voting around protocols etc I described myself is on that issue somewhere between Vlad and Gavin wood oh I look between the North Pole and the South Pole - what a coincidence exactly and Vitalik is also bit between those two I think we're all much closer to Vlad or that the two of us are much closer to Vlad so I I think I've heard Vitalik say that he doesn't think there should be on chain governance and I feel that we should strive to moving some governance on chain some voting systems etc and so I don't know if that's still true if we can prudently build enough infrastructure over time so that we can start making decisions in that sort of context I think that's fair that's no fun we're not very good at waiting for him to answer that ya know and I just really can't think of anything else on this one unfortunately there's a lot of stuff that's happened in this space from kind of what we initially saw the DAP ecosystem would do to where defy is now out of curiosity kind of having been part of consensus and kind of seeing that evolve over the last few years what would you say Jo just kind of some lessons learn from how defy is evolving and kind of where do you think people should focus on in this base as projects that are working on TFI - like some lessons anywhere from regulation to the development side of it that they might not know as new entrants into this space so the ico phenomenon was awesome yet problematic in certain ways one way we tried to address some of the difficulties was by starting up a project called true set which was designed to source and masari's sort of similar design to source information from the ecosystem so that we would have the critical pieces of information about different protocols new icos who the actual human beings are you know what the what the total number of issues issued tokens are etc and so so that's one thing we're trying to do with a project called defy score where we essentially rate different money lego parameters essentially and so defy is just so spectacular I I feel like so aetherium and maybe some other massively decentralized protocols are a new trust foundation for the planet on that new trust foundation we need to build a financial plumbing layer and and that's what defy open decentralized finance is doing and so we have all these protocols for so many things from prediction markets to insurance to decentralize exchange to derivatives to synthetics to licensing to payments to pour tomato portfolio management it's just astonishing and all of that once we work it out and get it really functional is going to be a massive magnet that draws in the rest of the world either new business models or legacy businesses and essentially becomes the decentralized global economy and so that layer needs to innovate somewhat hopefully permissionless Lee and and I hope we can do a lot of that around the world but it also needs to pay attention to what regulators are thinking and doing because they're all watching now quite intensely and so plus those projects are our VC funded and so they're they're gonna have to figure out how to balance innovation and being in a regulated environment and that's something that consensus is pretty good at and so we're taking perhaps we have a lot of lawyers that spend a lot of time in Washington so we're we run all of our ideas for better or worse through that group some hay defy is definitely one of the kind of topics and talks at the town right now what are some other things that you're kinda excited about or hopeful for and then next year or so with respect to theory Amiga system growing when one of them is just and have increased privacy so we've been seeing like tornado cash has one example and I think we're going to see better one soon and this is something that the etherium ecosystem is starting to really recognize the need of and especially since you know we have a lot of things like ENS popping up and we have more and more kind of richer types of transactions happening and I think there's definitely an ever-growing realization of the need to not have all of your activity be publicly linkable to all of your other activity and so that's one thing and another thing is also security and there's different kinds of security like for example we started caring about smart contract security quite a bit more after the Dow and I mean so far it seems to have paid off and we've seen much fewer kind of unfortunate splats recently then we then we have before recent flash flow and stuff notwithstanding um and but then there's also a user account security for example and I've been a kind of consistent evangelist for things like smart contract wallets multi-sig social recovery and all of these things and you know we've seen origins we've seen tools like the gas station network to help facilitate these things and a lot of other interest in smart contract wallets so that's been good an a and have hope to see more of that also exchanges another big example so the non-custodial exchange is happening more and more so Eunice WAP is obviously and over the first one and that now is completely decentralized but now more recently in loop ring just launched a few days ago and they're based on ZK roll-up so yeah should we have this property where and if even if the server misbehaves or the server disappears they can't do anything bad and users can still take all of their money out which is amazing and that's something that I I hope that all exchanges will have adopt in the medium term and I think if they do then we'll see and if a lot of what if you were kind of a large as large splats of people losing funds of a different kind and yeah just use your experience and all of those things improving at the same time I think we'll just see you know if ongoing great improvements to the is the ecosystem in people's ability to use aetherium it's a lot to be excited about so I'm gonna go with two one is I probably stop calling them Enterprise let's call them maybe non blockchain native companies I expect to see many large ones and medium sized ones getting real getting really excited about doing some something significant some piece of their business on public may not the other piece is a little more esoteric so we have a very large number of people at consensus who are working on different etherium to projects the quilt team is working on Phase two and we even have a designer who has some specialty and developer experience and so being able to make some statements about what developer experience will be like on a theorem 2 and what some of the early execution environments might be like I look forward to seeing some interesting releases on that and maybe q3 q4 of this year that is a lot of stuff to be excited about and I guess the best part of this is that because so much of his composable you do get a lot of compounded pace in terms of development and that's you still hope for a lot of things happening and in just a few months the next section when I actually cover is a section recall underrated overrated and the way it's going to work is I'll throw out a topic each of you have to comment on is this underrated overrated and then one to two lines on why and you can kind of feel free to answer however you please and then will throw off will kick this off actually with public goods funding I have no I think you've been talking about it a lot but probably still underrated on net you know public goods are important man so underrated I think we have mechanisms that can massively magnify that as we've seen on on get coin and also mechanisms that can identify externalities and bring them under the tent essentially to be calculated that's great I like the brief responses ZK roll-ups I think underrated I mean I think roll-ups in general are cool and we've seen in the last month and if a lot of well-deserved hype from on optimistic roll-ups with teams like arbitrament optimism doing a lot of great work but and so the thing about ZK roll-ups in particular right is that I mean they have some advantages like you don't have to rely on fraud proofs and instead you just rely on these and obsequious narcs to just prove validity of things immediately and over the last few weeks in particular there's been some kind of quiet but very significant improvements in just zero knowledge proof and ability to quickly verify and more general kinds of computation so the general problem with CK roll-up says that if you historically like even for specific applications I remember and if the loop ring gave the numbers that their cost of a transaction was a 0.3 cents for on chain data and 0.3 cents for the proving time and recently they've just optimized a look that without that proving time by more than an order of magnitude and frig general-purpose computation which is that I have much more expensive now and as I've mentioned there is any of quiet improvements along the pipeline happening that look that seem like they'll have bring us considerably closer to having enough general-purpose virtual machine that you can do zero knowledge proof silver so I'm quite excited overall yes so underrated will be more will eventually be more elegant more Universal more immediate more comprehensive will take longer to get all that done proc Tao I have a I have a better suggestion for how we do aetherium governance how about Joe and I have a fistfight on stage and if Jill wins brought now guess what that did yeah yeah I'm worried about crow Navarre and can we kick each other sure no one answer that question or we call that diplomacy flash loans so we're not Renetta answering pro that's a really interesting like it's interesting because you have this new kind of financial primitive the just doesn't exist in any other context just because of kind of fundamentally what it is they get some loan that you have to pay back within the same transaction and it seems to have had some really cool effects we'll see how that survives and of sharding and more reliance on asynchronous transactions there but we'll see you where are you gonna go with that are we still on prog power prog flash loans or what's what's my question flashlights lashlines flash loans are just awesome there will be so much complication in figuring that out I think we're gonna have to go slow and have a lot of cross-project communication and collaboration and maybe even dumb down some of the protocols a little bit and make slow progress that's great similarly I guess on the same theme decentralize Oracle's I think we definitely need more work on those and definitely outside the the kind of how we want this to work but what's kind of what's kind of missing what does it mean to get more work done is it just when people should be should be working on them or we need structural problems to be solved more different kinds of Oracle designs and if explored the design space better try to come up with Oracle's that are more secure and more decentralized and a good ways of using them yeah so what I haven't seen yet is a framework for what kinds of use cases need what kinds of rigor with respect to Oracle's and so whether it's with respect to value or the valence of decision-making in a political context or something like that if we had that framework then we could come up with classes of Oracle's where it's fine to have anybody send in some information or some sort of branded entity that has stake in their organization could be useful for for some things like ESPN for for sports or something like that all the way up to something that's very rigorously or massively decentralized for for high value things next step is a IP 1559 and I guess before you answer that would either of you want to tell the audience about what that is sure so EAB 1559 is this proposal for reforming the way that fee markets work where instead of having a fixed gas limit emulative per block and maximally volatile transaction fees you have this kind of flexible system where you have a gas limit which is twice as large or possibly three times as large as ANF gas target and so if there's short terms bio spikes and kind of volatility of demands then instead of all of that turning into transaction fee volatility is some of it turns into just a volatility of black space usage and so transaction fees become more stable it also fixes the first price auction problem that we have with key market design right now where it's just really hard to figure out like what the transaction should include and then most people end up putting fees that are fairly low and they end up waiting a few blocks and it turns out that that waiting doesn't actually do any good to the blockchain it just means it gets load a bit later instead of getting a load of it earlier and so like there's a lot of and of inefficiency that's there for no reason and EAP 1559 just and it fixes a bunch of all of those things at once so I underrated yeah I got underrated yeah so vitalik came up with the idea Erik Conor rands a bit of bias here it wrote it up one of the few ideas in the a theorem ecosystem that Vitalik came up with and so it's it's a really exciting one we early on we took various advice from professionals about not talking about the atheria thir the theorem token in certain ways and we were really interested in promoting building developing rather than focusing on the more financial aspects a say of the Bitcoin ecosystem and and it is simply a fact that a strong ether secures our ecosystem better draws more attention to our ecosystem draws more talent to our ecosystem and we've never tried to do anything artificial to prop up the price of ether this is a pretty exciting natural way to improve the protocol that also has probably very positive impact on on the price of ether and it's kind of just from that the last topic for this section Bitcoin on etherium underrated overrated I think I I think underrated it's I think it's definitely it would be nice to see more versions of enough Bitcoin on top of aetherium happening with enough difference and better kinds of trust models like right now we just have basically centralized ones like can we go out we stopped to a federation can we go up to something crypto economic you'll be good to see more of those things yeah so ether is currently the bandwidth for permissionless decentralized finance and more bandwidth for permissionless finance is a great thing so underrated I just noticed that there were no overrated answers here so since if I tell like one comment on proc pal what's one thing that you think is overrated in this ecosystem right now overrated underrated questions to be to be fair I think some of the some of the answers kind of implies that we were correctly rated there's an S to be binary but I mean even like defy in general is correctly rated I think mmm I guess our entire ecosystem and everything we do is presently under rated I'm looking for specifically overrated can anyone out there come up with something in our ecosystem that that's overrated since everyone repeated it's not on the audio that's alright well we'll get this to the ideas questions nobodies nobody came out for them nobody came up with an answer I'm not sure if it's an ecosystem that is still immature still nascent and still massively underrated that's actually exciting final question before we move on to to the Q&A from the audience what is both of your favorite memories of working with each other through the early days of ethereum do you have any don't really do favorite memories but no no just like a lot of like time we spent together in places like Switzerland yeah just getting done together it's kind of what we both do so two things and just have to be careful how they're expressed because people are involved and stuff one for a long time people didn't think that vitalik had a sense of humor and it was obvious from early on that he has a a a pretty impressive sense of humor so as people started realizing that and being just shocked by it that that was kind of amusing to some of us who knew him in some cracking jokes all the time and early on just some of the politics on the project was interesting where people were starting to manipulate each other and Vitalik one time just said something about how like these different patterns of how people were trying to manipulate him he just said it in a meeting it was this is very funny to everybody that he was just so aware of what was going on mm-hmm and yeah atheria maximalism is slightly overrated that's great straight from the source with that thank you so much wool proof-of-work is overrated piffle work is over okay there we go this is this is gonna get me found one i love proof of work but it's overrated by some people wonderful thank you so much we'll move on to the Q&A from the audience so what we'll do is a raise your hands if you have a question we have some questions from from Twitter and other social media networks and we'll repeat those questions directly but if you have a question here raise your hands we'll pass on the mic cool yeah so we're trying out this new thing with Peppo pipo basically taking a bunch of questions from the audience so it's the official community app of youth London and eath global this year so for the first question from pipo is what are your current thoughts on kind of the Dow explosion recently and in the growth in that space and those are and if great long-term the current iteration and also probably slightly overrated um the I guess no in general and of experiment all of these experiments would be centralized government governance are great and in things like Moloch Dalek for example have done pretty Union of greed and valuable contributions and Ethier in the ecosystem I guess I might mean worried about the space that I do and is that people and if get lazy and they assume that a Dow is basically just like a multi sequels 12 people voting and that has its place but it and it would just be nice to see more people experimenting with things that are not that so people when they get together to do something generally need some form of governance we're building all these networked collaboration platforms that we're gonna live in together working together playing together and so we're gonna have to make use of these new hopefully more transparent hopefully more granular hopefully more imbuing of agency to more people both financial agency and political agency and so yes it's gonna take a while before we are able to translate some really good ideas into robust code and I think it's just an incredibly powerful concept to do all this governance programmatically and it's going to take quite a while to build layers and layers of that sort of infrastructure there's one project that our open law project is doing called allow a legal dowel and so we're gonna we're gonna see real dhow structures that are actually embedded in legal infrastructure and so that's going to give a bunch of projects comfort and I I love how Lao is the Chinese word for old for gold oh that's what's old is new again so I'm gonna start back here anybody have any questions what do you do you think the world is moving to a post-scarcity Society and if so do you think that the education system is is actually doing a job but allowing us to like essentially do the things we want for more lives like I didn't hear that so what were your views on that current education system and how would you ideally want it to be so that we could be prepared for our potential post-scarcity society so education system and post-scarcity society basically yes mmm I don't think it's a post-scarcity society I think it's sane we're definitely moving toward a different kind of scarcity Society zero marginal cost society is one of the enough characterizations that I really agree with ultimately and think there's still a lot of ideas a lot of inventions that it would be nice if we had and unfortunately we still don't have and that's a kind of scarcity of that I think we're still going to be still going to be stuck with for quite some time but it is the sort of thing that's already leading to and will continue to lead to significant social changes and even make for example thinking about like public goods within a theorem ecosystem and and of what kinds of models would be good for encouraging and if more for more development of them and as far as what educational things can help people to adjust to the senior this new kind of world in it depends and I don't feel like there's a single big thing I feel like there's more of a lot of small things so I think many technologies are gonna move us towards something that could be described as a post physical scarcity society or material scarcity society and we're still humans we're still gonna need attention so that that will probably be a scarce resource potentially unless we have some really great simulations or robots or something like that so maybe not and and we're gonna be working together learning together on these collaboration networks and so I think I think we're gonna be going to festivals and it's gonna be art about art and gaming etc and so this technology is is going to be a way for us to keep score keep us engaged while not needing to kill each other or do destructive things in order to to be humans basically a Vitalik Joe good to see both my question is about decentralized identity which I think has you know since the beginning of the project being considered a really important Network primitive but perhaps hasn't quite materialized yet so what do you think of the challenges to materializing real decentralized identity and when that does come about what innovation do you think that will unlock in the protocol sure so first of all it depends on and if what you mean by identity because people mean different things by it right so like for example there's this no weaker version of identity that basically says or is about people's ability to maintain some kind of persistent accounts that has a high level of security that they can use to interact with things and that's something that we're seeing more and more of already both in the form of and in a fairly explicit initiative soon and also just tools in the etherium ecosystem growing in general then there's also identity and as in creating account like some way of detecting accounts that correspond to a unique person and I've written a bunch of things about how that's a very valuable primitive for building many kinds of governance mechanisms basically because if you have coin driven mechanisms which is basically the only thing you can have if you don't have a way of measuring people directly then you can't distinguish one person with a million dollars from a thousand people with a thousand dollars each and so I think because the one person with a million dollars is better at coordinating with themselves and thousand people are with each other like the the one person with a million dollars is always going to kinda steamroll over anyone else more than he should or yeah I guess statistically it's still usually a year but I hope that changes the age whereas if you have governance mechanisms that do kind of counts people more explicitly you can do things like quadratic funding you can do other kinds of voting mechanisms just your space of different things to choose from increases quite a bit and I know there are a bunch of projects that are trying to do this I solve this kind of unique human problem in a reasonably decentralized the way there's things like social network social graph analysis there's that of different kinds of and if challenge and response verification there's ideas around how to combine this with stronger support for privacy yeah it's generally seems to be a very interesting space so very early on in consensuses life we realized that we needed an identity construct to represent people organizations things content etc and just access to different systems as well we started a project called you port a long time ago you port has built a bunch of different interations of what we thought was state-of-the-art at that moment and we have iterated for a bunch of years along with many in the ecosystem developing a deep understanding of the subtle complex thing that that you could call identity so we were one of the founders of a group called the decentralized identity foundation which has created a specification for dids decentralized IDs those are identities that are constructs that don't need blockchain but they make blockchain better and block chain makes them better we also derive the w3c verifiable credentials working group and so credentials are things that you cryptographic attestation x' that you can make between one identity and another identity or some behavior or various other things so this identity credentials or claims construct is going to be the identity reputation system for the world I think there's so much that still needs to be built out and so are you port team is working with different enterprises mostly there there are there's alas tria which is a Spanish nation-state blockchain infrastructure there's lack chain Latin American countries that are getting together to do this there's the European Union blockchain services infrastructure and so all of these are now making use of this this construct which I think the world so IBM join that organization Microsoft and Accenture etc are all I feel zeroing in on this this notion of IDs and credentials and I think so we have a product called certo that enables companies to set up identities for themselves and identities for for people so that's that's one vector where we can push identity out into the world just making use of or enabling people to log in to blockchain based applications we have we have internal software that we use to sort of help run and understand the shape of consensus and basically you're your you port ID can give you access to that also content is really interesting so we have a project called civil that is enabling content to have a identity and so we'll soon see some major media organizations represent their content in registries for licensing and a test of the fact that this content was was real it's not fake content time for two more quick ones hi both I was wondering how how do you see the interface between the theorem ecosystem and the legal the traditional legal systems develop in the medium-term future and whether you can picture a healthy legal approach and regulatory policy between nation states and blockchain systems as more and more economic activity starts to migrate towards decentralized blockchains I think one big question as and what part of this is a blockchain wobble concern and what part of this is an application-level concern because different kinds of applications pose different challenges in terms of their interactions with the legal system like financial applications might have one set of challenges and then applications for like raising funds might have another set of challenges things that have to do what identity might have some third set of challenges there's privacy issues and there's have a whole bunch of things that I'm just the different applications do you have to do the kind of deal with differently but there's also an extent to which having good relationships with existing legal systems is and if a public good across the ecosystem because unfortunately if every single project that does enough lead to one of these kind of splats where people lose a lot of money like even if that's entirely their fault it still and it reflects badly on the entire blockchain ecosystem and so there are things that we can and just do as if together to reduce the chance of those kinds of things happening more broadly so it's kind of both there's both applications specific challenges and also things that we can all do to address all of those different challenges so blockchain and decentralized protocols more generally are incredibly powerful technology that will enable and drive the RER connecting of economic social financial political systems the planet over the next decades that is an exciting proposition and a terrifying proposition to too many people who run companies work at companies are part of governments our regulators who are charged with keeping all that working properly so we've been engaged in so many conversations with politicians and regulators and business leaders around the world in how their contexts can make use of this technology and different nation states have different philosophies different different systems and so they'll probably adopt the technology differently it this technology CEM can be embedded in legal systems there's this notion of Ricardian contracts where you have a document representing a legal agreement that points to a smart contract smart contract points to that document and so you've sort of embedded this new architecture into the old legal architecture the old legal architecture has to change to to enable some new ways of doing things and so many conversations have been had and will need to be had over quite a long time I just spent the last two days in Paris at the OECD as a member of the blockchain policy experts board and that was about writing a document that all the OECD people in countries can use to sort of guide their thinking and dried new thinking but also it's a set of principles that you push out into the world and just cause lots of discussions to happen so it's not prescriptive it's just these are all of the things that are going on and that's what's happening and this is what you should pay attention to I think Germany now has a blockchain national blockchain policy Australia the same and so this is all happening and it's about driving so many discussions about how nation-states companies etc want to transform themselves to to make good use of the technology many are already many will others that won't Darwin has stuff to say about them so my question is about funding innovation and in the past few years we had crowdfunding mechanisms like you said funding funding invention or innovation innovation that we had crowdfunding over the last few years including the way aetherium was funded in the way some of the ICS happened obviously there were a lot of flaws and bad ones too but now that regulators have cooled the ICO market and the crowdfunding in general and have principles against people putting in money into something where they have an expectation of a return that's possibly going to cool innovation we've had this massive last few years of lots of excitement and protocol development and application development and maker and status and so on and will we have that again in the future when the regulator's have called the crowdfunding mechanisms so will we have new funding innovation well we've got the benefit of a lot of crowdfunding of innovation in the last few years including aetherium itself with those mechanisms now curtailed what's going to happen in the next few years so I don't know that those mechanisms are curtailed the world funds so many projects using legacy funding mechanisms and it's just a question of bringing new technology and and novel ways of funding projects into prominence and so tokenized securities haven't really caught on in any stting way it doesn't mean they won't I mean it really is a better technology with which to issue equities to do portfolio lifecycle management etc we need to mature that technology we actually have just bought a broker-dealer that will enable us to issue securities municipal bonds in the United States and that's an ecosystem that is massive but sort of captured by major financial organizations it should be about raising money inexpensively for local projects it should be about the people benefiting financially potentially by putting money into those projects local people benefiting and and having more control over over that whole process it just costs a tremendous amount to raise five million dollars for a local pool or something like that and so by bringing this much more efficient technology into the situation and enabling the local people to have control over that process rather than some major financial institution I think it's a really big market and I think there will be impact there and I think we're just gonna see this technology sweep through the entire financial system over the next five years ten years I think in 2017 was definitely was a bit of a and of temporary dream time for many kinds of coin funding because ultimately and even if regulators had not shut it down what would have happened is that people would have realized that these projects are and of raising the money on the back of kind of possible revenue that's where the hopes are much greater than the amount of revenue that's actually possible for many of these projects and you can't have just keep on creating new assets forever and and so I think regardless of what happens we'd be in the situation where we are today which is basically just realizing that there's a lot of different kinds of valuable things in the ecosystem and some of them I mean it can be potentially funded and if on the back of future revenues of different kinds other things can't and for those things and that's basically why things like get coin grants quadratic funding and other kinds of and decentralized and other kinds of and of grant me making mechanisms exist and it's definitely the sort of thing that I think the ecosystem will and if continue to iterate on over time yes so our our ecosystems moment of irrational exuberance wasn't the first one in in history all the way back to tulips and probably way before that and so the the internet had its own moment and there was a tremendous amount of creative destruction that happened after that all those projects that failed after the initial excitement which was based on some pretty exciting ideas and visionaries who saw what could be in what inevitably will be lots of those projects died there was lots of learning those people move to another project some of those died there was lots of learning and I went 2020 and we all live on the internet with that Joe metallic thank you so much for for being on stage thank you
