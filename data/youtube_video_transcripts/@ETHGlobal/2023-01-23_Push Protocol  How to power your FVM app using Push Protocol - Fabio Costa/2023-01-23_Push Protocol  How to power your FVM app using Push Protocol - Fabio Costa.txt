all right good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you're calling from uh we have Fabio here from push protocol who's going to be doing a workshop on how to power your fbm app using push protocol if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and Fabio will be more than most happy to answer them and with that being said I will pass the mic off to Fabio yeah thank you Anna hey everyone thank you so much for being here today so my name is Fabio I work at Bush I'm working on the back end team and so today we're going to be talking about what is very technical Workshop so first off we're gonna be talking about what is push and I think most importantly what problem push is solving and in the end we're going to be doing some Workshop a code demo to show different ways on how you can integrate push Barrel flow into your debt with your back end your smart contractor suppressed so first of all something that we always say is that everything starts with a notification right and push was a project from if Global back in 2020 and almost three years later we're happy to be now sponsoring the hackathons something that we came from and it was yeah it's very nice and looking back to see how much has happened in those three years so the I think the most important question is um so there are a lot of missing pieces in library and I think one of the missing pieces that we have we're currently having is improving user experience and let me just give you an example so more specifically an example about notifications so for example everything that we do in our digital digital life everything starts with a notification what do I mean by this it's not like I'm constantly on Gmail refreshing to see if I have a new email right so how do I know I have a new email well I just received a notification and from the notifications I can see that I received an email or when someone sends a message on telegram I receive a notification and then from the notification I do some action I go to the telegram and I can see that someone has messaged me so in web 2 that's how we go by Our Lives we receive a notification and then based on the notification you can take some action if we think about it in web 3 we still don't have the same user experience that we had in web 2. so for example pro quality expect users to come back to the protocol in fact the information themselves so for example how do we know today there is a new governance proposal for your favorite doll well you have to be very active on Discord or Twitter to keep to keep keeping yourself updated if there is any new proposal for each results for or for example how do you know if you're about to get liquidated in 85 protocol well you as a user as a liquidate provider have to constantly keep checking your collateral ratio to see if you're gonna get liquidated would be much easier from the user perspective to receive a notification whenever some whenever an event stay interested me instead of me going to the protocol and flashing the information myself and this is exactly what bushboro call is doing so we're bringing the web the web to user experience into web3 and the applications for this are pretty endless so as I said for governance you can receive notifications Whenever there is a new governance proposal verify whenever you're about to get liquidated you can get a notification you can get a notification whenever someone outbids you on an nft Marketplace or for example you should follow an nft artist it would be super nice to get notified whenever this artist publishes a new collection and I think the beauty of the notifications powered by push borrow calls that they are completely customizable so if you have a use case in mind for notifications how to add a notifications for your protocol is completely flexible I'm going to show you how you do to do this later but they're in different ways how to do this so what is the solution that push protocol is building so it's a digitalized communication protocol it's an open communication layer so that means is anyone can simply tap into the network and fax the notifications to themselves and I think very important it's very important to note that the notifications they are tied to wallet addresses in web 3 your identities your wallet address so we're sending notifications to your wallet address and this is since it's an open network anyone can simply tag into the network network and say hey give me all the notifications that I have for this wallet here the notifications they are completely Dynamic that means that what's going to trigger the notification how the notification looks like it's all customizable by you you can you have 100 control of the look and feels of the notification and the notifications is multi-chain so we started on ethereum but now we are in multiple evm chains it's gasless um that means that for assignment notification if you want to send notification off chain it's completely gas gasless all you have to do is just to sign the transaction inspect for agnostic delivery for me that's the beauty of this it's because any front end can display the notifications so you don't need to install a push protocol browser extension or a mobile app to display the notifications we have set of react components that you can import into your tab to display notifications right there so users don't need to know that they have received a notification for push protocol they just receive the notifications right so because that's how we do in web 2. we just received a notification we don't care how the notifications delivered I just want to get notified about things that I care and that's what we're we are doing so in push we have sent over 80 million notifications we have over 60 000 subscribers subscribers are wallets they're opting to receive the verifications and we have over 100 Integrations that means over 100 different use cases for notifications and I think it's most notifications by itself that they are only useful if you see value in them nobody wants to get notifications from things they do not care so notifications should have different use cases things that care that you as a new user are interested in so we have different use cases for notification and this is just one handful of notification but the types of notifications that we have we call them friends of bush so we have different case for notifications for example for unusual all together key dial or git coin cryptocurrency jobs and I can give an example another example of notification imagine for cryptocurrency jobs Whenever there is a new job post you can get notified on your wallet address that there is an Impulse for you for example for the Defiance let's say whenever there is a new post you can get notified on your wallet whenever there's any posts for you to read so Bush we started back in 2020 we were previously epns ethereum push notification service and now we have rebranded to push and we started with notifications back in 2020. almost three years later we're now happy to announce that we took the notifications one step further and now we announced something called push chat so with some web true messaging platform provided by Bush that every notification sent on the protocol they have a long a notification so if I send a message from my wallet to your wallet you will receive a notification there and the idea is we're taking all the web true experience that we had for example for WhatsApp or Telegram and then bringing this web tree so the experience for sending messages and receiving messages are receiving notifications on your messaging platform will be the same as you do on those web 2 platforms that we are we're used to so this here on the left is how that looks like so it's just a classic message platform unless I we added here that's how the notifications look like on your phone and here on the right we did a demo on Defcon this is a demo that we did for push video so we added on top of wallet wallet messaging video calls as well so you can not only message receive notifications but you can also receive video calls on the pushback so we have well this the date of 2020 and the beginning of 2023 is going to be a super exciting year for push protocol um I tons of new features are coming so we have that's the key so to integrate push protocol we're going to go over the SDK um different ways how we can begin with publishing our SDK we uh we have mobile notifications we also have an SDK for this we're currently working on group chats and very soon we're going to announce the SDK for group chats privacy chat as well where all the the information all the metadata for the chat is going to be encrypted and so on and so forth and here the right is just a prototype of how the the mobile app for the chat uh looked a couple months ago but now has completely changed yeah so let's start with the demo so first off I just wanna show you guys how how the depths look like and I'm just logging here to metamask so let me switch to magnets cool so the the app for which we'll call this app.bush.org so on Bush protocol we have a concept of channels right so and the analogy is the same as a YouTube channel we have so we have different channels here and you as an end user can opt in to receive notifications from those channels here so for example we have maker down lens protocol let's say for example I am interested in receiving notifications from cheetah let's say hey I want to I want to get notified Whenever there is a new notification I'm interested in receiving those notifications me as an end user all I have to do is Click into opt-in all I have to do is just sign a message and then boom now whenever there is a new notification by key Bell protocol I'll get notified so for the end user they don't pay to receive the notifications and for the center of the notification then if you send off chain notifications then you don't pay all you only pay to send all chain notifications so now let's take a look I've opted to receive a notification right so in this example I just opt in to receive notifications from Key down now let's look into the other side let's see how we can send the notifications so once I have option to receive the notifications let's start sending notifications so to set a notification all you have to do is first to create a channel so I have a channel that I have previously created here but what I can do I can just create a brand new wallet here just show you guys how does it look to create a channel it's great here and just connect cool so this is the UI experience Channel all you have to do is to state 50 push and then you need to pay the the transaction fees for this but if you go to staging.push.org taking.coach.org that's our test match URL so we can create n channels here um for free no let's say push it's fake push and fake if so all I have to do create a channel is just in the channel name you set the network you add a channel description and then you add here the URL from your Channel once you do this you just update it upload the logo and then you have your Channel created I have previously created a channel here once you create a channel this is how it looks like this is how the new why it looks like and I have a channel here now let's send a notification let's show you guys how it looks like so if I come back here so I have here on the right what I'm gonna do is here on the right I'm going to opt in to receive notifications from this channel here on the left and then I'm going to show you how we can see the notifications so I go to staking.coach.org click on the channels so how does my channel it's got my channel is called demo channel so I just went back here demo Channel let's move from my channel and I already opt into my channel so whenever this channel is saying the notification I will receive it so now let's receive the notification I click here on send notification so there are three types of notification there is broadcast targeted and subset a broadcast notification that means hey notify all the subscribers of my channel a targeted notification is hey notify that address and the third one is subset which is notify this array of addresses in this case let's send a broadcast notification to notify all the subscribers of my channel verification can have a title I'm gonna call it hello world okay and this is going to be the payment of the verification here below we see how the notification looks like now let's click on send notification all I have to do is sign a message and the notification has been sent so if I go to the other browser click my inbox here and I see the notification that I just sent it's here not only this we have a mobile app so you're going to receive a push notification on your phone whenever there is a new notification you're gonna receive we have a browser extension here as well so you're gonna see see the notifications here hello world every and you don't need as I said before you don't need to rely on push front ends to display the notifications you can display those notifications on your own tab as well all I have to do is just import the reaction components that we have so we have sent notifications manually now let's see how to send notifications using the SDK it's a JavaScript SDK let me show you guys when you click all this code here is in our repo um it's another docs actually I just took this from the docs and where is the docks so if you go to docs.org you click on developer Docs and these are the docs so if you just send a notification here we have a section called send notifications and here we we have different demos um or different ways how you can send notifications let's send notifications using the SDK so we can't click here sending notifications using push SDK and all I did I just copied and paste the code from here and I have it here so all this code is doing here is I'm going to zoom in this so all it's doing is to send a notification using the SDK you just need three information first of all is the private key from the channel you're sending a notification from and the private key is going to be the private key from the wallet you create the channel so in this example here from my channel here called General demo channel the private is going to be in the private key from this wallet here so just export the private key I added this environment variable and I just prepared to 0x yeah just using ether just get the signer and now we just need actually one more information but in this case I have two here I have the channel address and the channel address is going to be these others here and I'll just copying paste here and as you can see the address has eap155 column five column so we're just adding here it's a we call the Skype 10 format we're just saying that this address is on channel 85 which is really so we just paste here address and then in this case in this example we're assigning a targeted notification which means hey notify only this address here and this address here should be this one which is let me just copy this yeah we're just going to copy this address here and we options that you know again yeah right option cool so I'm just going to copy this address here and that should be it the rest all of these are just copied from the docs so if I come here and I just run this code so I sent a notification so if I come back here click on the inbox and I see this notification with a bunch of ads that's what I added here and that's it so if I come here to the brother extension and all I can do is log in with my account here and let's receive notification here why you receive a notification on your mobile app or whatever you want to see if you see the verification [Music] um my second couple questions here how does push broker work under the hood to get messages from any matters can you talk about underlying mechanism a bit of course so how ultimately how which group of work under the hood we have something called push notes it's a natural cuff we call them communication modes and all they do is to index communication so whenever you send a notification for example using the SDK all you're doing is talking to the push Network and then the question actually it's called Index this notification and then we have a node called delivery node and these nodes responsible for dispatching the notifications so all the indexing inspecting the notification is done by this push Network and as of now it is a decentralized network and as of now it's a natural that is run by push protocol and we're in the work of decentralized this and the end goal is for the community to be able to work this this network and actually get incentivized um by running it by for a contributing to the civilization of the network though the key part of here is the the push node does it mean if you don't cause a repeater message angry as ask this question and yes correct so the demo that we did in Bogota for which video is exactly this so on the dab itself if you come here and push on the push tab we have a section here called chat just click here just to log here this is how push chat looks like right and the demo that we did on on Bogota was there was a video but up here I just clicked here and I just video chat to the other address so the other address to receive a notification exactly how we're doing web check we receive a notification say hey this address is calling you and you just accept and then you start the video call I'm just doing some audio um I see the third question here I created a channel using the wrong website and update the Channel with localhost I just totally Edward asked this question if he can update um a channel setting yes now you can before you couldn't but now you can cool so let's move on with um with the demo so we send notifications using the SDK I want to show you guys something very very nice that me personally like a lot which is how to display the notifications on your app um let me show you so I haven't created a code here avtm star so this is how to display the notifications on your own data right so here so let me show you where this code is from so the code to display notifications I just got from the docs as well so if you go to darkstalk Boost store you go to receive notifications or Integrity formats integrated notifications [Music] so all the codes that I showed there is here on the docs integrated front end patch user challenge players so all this code is doing here show you the end result we have a reactive component that displays the modification exactly like this so these were some demos that I was doing you can say notifications can have YouTube videos they are pretty dynamic so we can practice in your own app display notification there so you don't need to tell your users to go to push for opportunity locations and the code to do this is pretty straightforward it's just [Music] so all it does is we have a reactional component called notification item and these notification items responsible for grain reader notifications like this as we can see here and this is getting called [Music] we're calling this location yeah and this is called by the depth here [Music] that's three hours yeah and that notification components here it's being called here that Js and all it's doing is we're using the rest is rest API SDK to get the notifications [Music] yeah we're just using the push SDK get feeds function to get the notifications and then we'll pass the notifications we get the array of notification and that we pass the array of notifications to the react component that we have foreign but please if you have any questions just ask we can ask us when you Squad me personally I'll be in this first answering all the questions and we have a lot of team members there as well to help transitioning any questions there are other ways to send notifications but I'll just briefly touch upon them first of all you can send all chain notifications as well and what does it mean for example let's say that you have a smart contract and from the smart contract itself you want to notify another wallet that something happened on your smart contract and you can do this click on sending notifications using smart contracts and here all you have to do is to do a function call to the push for a call Smart contract and all the rest taken care of we take the the events and transform the event which are notification and then we inspect the notification we also have another way to send notification which is by using sub graphs so if you have sub graph if you if you already have an existing subgraph you don't have to change anything to start sending modifications from the subgraph itself we haven't we have a helper function that you can import and from the helper function itself they will provide we take care of getting the money getting the the events and respecting the notifications for you I see a couple more questions here uh it's pushed for a collab on fvm yes so we're on fbm as of now so I think we're gonna be deploying this on to our main that by tomorrow so I'll say probably by tomorrow morning UTC we can already start sending notifications from fbm whether they are all chain of chain manual using the SDK the the bridge protocol has been developed from the ground up to be VPN comparable and feature we're going to be on another VM chains as well known if M chains as well but yes much more you can send applications for that yeah um it's another question here SDK can we make which group chat ourselves basically instead of using the chat components if you use the sdkz-2 butch maker push group chat that's a good question um you can so basically you you infer you can replicate a group in a sense that for example I send a message to a group and we have three members I can send the same message to all the other members so you can manually create a group all you have to do is just iterate over the the people want to send message and send to them um yes they'll do um or ask this question the answering yes would be possible to do um all you have to do is to group over the people who want to send a message and then send a message and they're going to get notification Whenever there is uh they receive a message but what I can say is we're almost done with the group chats um implementational SDK so what I can say is um a couple weeks we're gonna launch this so you you can just use the the chat reaction called it and we're going to be doing on your behalf so we just care on your logic but if you want to do in the second of this please go ahead and you have to really do this I hope I answered your question um another question here during his in your hackathon conducted recently my group had used which protocols and you guys had provided as an API key with the API key also work no oh that's an amazing question yes um it's still gonna be uh you can use the same epeki no problem no you should need any uh another just figures on this card does this work with smart contract address as well or only with EOS since we do not have interface this is smart contract like we do for iOS totally you can send notifications from Smart contracts as well um Melissa at all if you just want to see how it looks like go to darkstalkpush.org send notifications using smart contract and then you can all you have to do is um check out this function on our contract and we have a sample code here that we can just copy and paste it is how the notification platelet looks like but you can trigger a notification on check and we ask the question is it available in hyperspace currently no um not currently foreign [Music] action so that whenever I send a check message is they are not stored on chain so they're guest list because the chat message in their store online DFS on the BFS Network so there is no cost to send chat messages so each check message or notifications not they're not stored don't change their stored on the push method or ipfs it's completely flexible so for this reason you don't pay per message that's why um you don't have to pay anything we can really gases yeah I think that's that was all the questions I had any other questions just up and Discord um for my side I think that's it um thank you so much for for being here awesome yeah thanks Fabio for doing this awesome workshop for the space War Packers um this will be a great resource as people do their hacks and for the future um and thanks so much for the rest of you for tuning in uh we do have another Workshop in a couple hours so hope to see you there um and with that being said I hope everyone has a great rest of your day
