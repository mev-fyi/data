racial life so welcome again to our session with emilia and kevin here from immutable and today you're going to learn how to build the future games with emilia and kevin i'll let you take the stage fantastic well welcome everyone um we are super happy that you are joining us um for the hackathon um which we've titled building the future of games with immutable x um we've got a little bit to get through today so let's jump right in um but before we start we'll do some quick introductions so kev do you want to kick off yeah sure thing hey everybody good morning a good afternoon depending upon where you are and happy international women's day for anybody who has crossed over into tuesday already my name is kevin mchugh as the slide says i'm the director of engineering for the immutable x engineering team here at immutable i'm not sure when i should stop claiming this but i'm reasonably new to the business here at ebutable i came on board almost five months ago at this point uh i came across from another fast-growing tech scale up here in sydney and um yeah very much looking forward to and enjoying everything that we're doing here at immutable thanks kev um yeah five months doesn't seem seems pretty old hat these days i've been that immutable for 10 months and it feels like quite a while um in the best possible way so um i'm millie millie brown i'm a senior customer success manager here at immutable mostly focused on our self-serve customers so our small to medium customers the the djn audience um and i joined immediate people after being a management consultant for five years originally to do strategy and operations but i found that i really loved working with founders and developers um so i moved over into our customer success team and it's been a fantastic time and i'm really excited to do this hackathon event and continue to do more of these events in the future so for the agenda um we're going to do an introduction to immutablex kev is going to run you through a little bit about our technology and what makes us um different and um so special compared to other technologies out there um i'm going to look briefly at one of the existing game integrations um with immutable x to give you some ideas about what is possible with the middle x nfts um i'm going to go into the the hackathon and what we want you to do and what we're looking for and then finally give you some resources for when you're you're building your project um we've agreed that if there are any questions that come up through the um during the workshop please drop them in the chat and kevin will pick them up as we go along all right let's get into it kev awesome oh thanks for being here with us here today and yeah like milly said at any point if anyone had a question just jump right on in interrupt me we'll answer questions as we go i'm going to tell you a little bit about the platform itself immutablex and what it's about why we think it's awesome and a little bit about the history and how we got to where we are today at immutable we're developing the leading web3 ecosystem for next generation creators and today that's really focused on the gaming cohort we are and have uh in by way of immutablex a next generation nft trading and ethereum scaling platform which is targeting or built for developers i'm sure people on the call know a little bit about the scalability limitations of ethereum globally today ethereum itself the mainnet is capable of processing something in the region of 15 transactions per second globally 15 transactions per second that's it and obviously this is completely insufficient for high volume gaming applications in a world where we want to trade hundreds thousands tens of thousands of in-game assets really quickly and effectively inside of a game experience those 15 transactions per second are just not going to cut it because the demand globally far exceeds 15 transactions per second on the ethereum network well that means that gas costs are really really high anywhere from hundreds of dollars from at times even into the thousands of dollars for individual transactions and obviously that again just doesn't make sense for high volume high frequency gaming applications immutablex is our solution to this problem and what we've built is a layer 2 solution which allows us to work around or get around or supplement i guess if you could think of it that way the the scalability challenges that are inherent in the ethereum ecosystem the technology itself is referred to as a zero knowledge roll-up operating in layer 2 i'll tell you a little bit about it essentially what we're able to do with immutable x is take thousands or even tens of thousands of individual transactions and create a batch so many transactions go into a batch and off chain excuse me in layer 2 we produce what's referred to as a cryptographic proof or a mathematical proof that that batch of transactions is valid it's correct and verifiably correct and it's that cryptographic proof known as the xero knowledge stark that gets published back onto the main chain which then ensures that that batch of transactions is verifiably true and is published for availability on main chain it's we are the first application uh of its kind in this space we have been uh learning as we go and certainly it's been a it's been a really interesting ride for all of us here at immutable in implementing this technology and learning as we've gone through the interesting experiments that we've run over the last number of years you probably know that vitalik himself has come out and said that the ethereum ecosystem is likely to be all in on rollups as a scaling scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future of ethereum they there will be some changes to ethereum and improvements as we go and what's colloquially now referred to as the ethereum 2.0 release that will improve the situation and things will change but not to the extent that we are currently capable of of doing and of producing and providing with our layer 2 solution really next slide i mentioned that we a platform for developers we build for developers if you build for developers you need to make sure that you've got the best in class experience for those developers the developer experience needs to be seamless it needs to be frictionless and the product needs to be a joy to use a lot of what we do is about abstracting away some of the complexities of the blockchain the smart contracts development of smart contracts and interacting interoperating with smart smart contracts a lot of what we do in a lot of what makes immutable x the platform itself so easy to use is that we actually remove a lot of that complexity or hide a lot of that complexity via the provision of rest apis and rest apis will be very familiar i would imagine to anybody on the call who has been a developer or works in or around software development and really the idea there is to provide the capability to interact with the blockchain interact with our product in a way that's really familiar really similar and seamless and frictionless as it possibly can be so the developer experience always has and always will be front and foremost for immutable x next five million i'm sure the people on the caller are familiar with the big well-known broad aggregators the open seas the looks rares of the world they've obviously been very successful in what they do but a big challenge here is that they have i guess in a sense created what we think of as walled gardens and what that means is that if you go to openc the assets that you see on openc are only interactable with on openc if you list an asset there it can only be traded there if you list it on looks rare it can only be traded there and this obviously has a huge negative impact on liquidity for nfts that a project a person an individual or a company would like to make available and would like to see traded so you can see from the diagram here what this looks like we've tried to represent this as essentially each one of these verticals here being what we think of as a wall garden each of these marketplaces can only have bought sold and traded assets that have been created and are listed in that marketplace and obviously that results in a substantial drop in overall liquidity for your nfts and for your projects next slide our solution we have what we refer to as a globally shared protocol level order book for immutablex and i mentioned that immutablex is a developer platform a developer product and what that means is that we have many integrators building their own marketplaces we want to encourage as many marketplace builds on top of mutablex some of those marketplaces will serve particular niches some will serve specifically gaming some will serve even smaller more nuanced niches inside of that gaming cohort we have our own marketplace the immutable x marketplace but the beauty about this solution the global protocol level order book is that assets that are listed anywhere on the protocol on any marketplace can be interacted with and traded on any of the other marketplaces that have been built on top of the protocol so this obviously is a big boon for liquidity in the space if your assets can be found searched bought traded anywhere on the protocol in any marketplace that is available or will be available in the future you can imagine the reach that that then results in yeah next slide please i talked about the developer experience and obviously aside to that is the individual user experience we're building products for developers but those developers are then building products for their end users to use and it is really important again that that experience is frictionless um one thing i haven't spoken about so far is the fact that uh there is instant transaction confirmation and we'll talk a little bit about this later on as a competitive advantage for immutablex and how we see that as being a really important facet of the product that we've built but really the most important piece about this slide is the products that are built on top of immutable x by any integrator really the focus here is on a seamless frictionless user experience it just makes it easy and a joy to use this slide just tells you a little bit about how we see ourselves and how we see the competitive space i talked about scalability and the fact that we are capable of processing many thousands of transactions uh many thousands more transactions rather per second than is capable on ethereum mainnet specifically we're capable of processing 90 000 transactions per second using our layer 2 zero knowledge proof solution so that obviously is a standout capability for us we talk about purchase time and that is the ability to purchase assets and see that change reflected in near real time security is obviously one of the most important facets or aspects of the ethereum network itself the security that comes along with being in the ethereum ecosystem is something that users want many products don't offer that same security as a result of the technology approach that they take whether we're using a side chain or a proprietary chain those solutions will tend to offer a lower grade of security than what is on offer or available to users who are in the ethereum ecosystem and because immutablex is built on the ethereum ecosystem that same security is available to to all users who are using immutablex the ethereum network the ethereum network and the network effects that come along with being in that space is a huge competitive advantage for us really we see immutable we see ethereum rudder as the winning network in the space for developers who want to build either in-game experiences or or any other niche experiences any developers that would like to build into their applications the network effects that come as a result of being in the ethereum ecosystem are really important to us i spoke about the developer experience it is core and crucial for us we want an absolutely seamless and frictionless developer experience we want to ensure that our apis are a joy to use it's frictionless and you can just get up and running really quickly and really easily to test out whatever it is that you want to build and last but not least a carbon footprint this is something which has been spoken about at length in uh in the blogosphere and and beyond the carbon footprint of blockchain solutions is something which is well known um there are some really interesting stats that show that the bitcoin network for example now is using more electricity globally and i think new zealand at this point and that's obviously a challenge for for all uh blockchain products immutablex is carbon neutral and how we achieve that is by purchasing carbon offsets for all of the energy that's used in immutable x or by immutable x we're purchasing the equivalent carbon offsets in order to cover the carbon production that is that is a result of that usage and next slide is that it yep so like i mentioned if anyone had any questions i see it as a chat icon has just jumped up okay that's just um a reminder to put questions in the chat but if any questions do pop up either now or through the rest of the presentation just jump right on in and thank you very much for your time thanks for that kev um i will add that we will be taking questions in the um the sponsor dash immutable discord in the um global discord so if you have any questions that come to mind later um or if you're watching on the stream feel free to pop them in there and we will get back to you um so i did want to show you one of the examples of how immutablex nfts are used in game um and that is in god's unchained so in god's unchained you're able to use two immutable x nfts um use the in-game currency flux and then forge them into an additional and a a separate nft which is then immediately minted into your immutable x wallet um this is just one of the many ways that immunox nfts are really kind of transforming transforming the the gamer experience but i think it is a really good example um we've put a few more examples of that into the discord that you can check out as well but i did want to highlight that one because it's definitely a favorite of players so now for the exciting part um getting into the hackathon um what we want people to do for this hackathon um is very much aligned with our mission um at immutable x and um as the the title of the presentation suggests which is building the future of games with immutable x so we want you to have a go at it and we would like participants to build and present a proof of concept and or prototype for an incredible game integration showcasing immutablex nfts so we'll go through a few examples of what that might look like in the next slide um but what we're looking for and what we will be awarding prizes to is projects that are that are really innovative that potentially shows us something that we haven't seen before um that demonstrate a really strong implementation of the immutable x apis and most importantly representing a novel exciting and valuable proposition for players so these are a few thought starters some ideas of what you can do you could build a game around an existing nft collection um you can go into the middle x marketplace and see the hundreds of nft collections that exist already and you can build a game around those entities that already exist you could create a proof of concept for a unique game onboarding experience so the my favorite example of this is planet quest if you haven't signed up to planet quest already i highly suggest that you do um their onboarding is super smooth super sleek integrated into mutable x and you meant to free out of t um just by signing up which is really cool um you could create a proof of concept for a new game integrating new imx nfts or you could integrate new immutablex nfts into an existing game so on to the prizes um we are very excited to be offering 16 000 us dollars in imx tokens as a prize pool for this hackathon the prize was broken down into first prize being ten thousand dollars second prize being four thousand dollars and third prize being two thousand dollars um the other benefit of being a prize winner for the immutable x hackathon is you have an access to an hour-long strategy session with another senior customer success manager chelsea um and her full-time focus is integrating um games into immutable x so you'll be able to strategize with her and figure out the best way to make your project come to life and you'll have an integrations engineer on that call as well so finally in terms of getting support as i mentioned we've listed a whole bunch of resources in the discord um there will be myself um kev and some of the integrations engineers checking in the discord to give you a hand if you have any questions that arise over the next couple weeks and i'd also suggest that you check out the immutable x developer discord there's a link to that as well there's a really good community of devs there that have built on immutable x and um help each other out and answer questions and problem solve together so i highly suggest that you jump in there um as well as our starting points we've got the docs um there's a link there um the immutable x medium so in the medium owl um cto alex that does deep dives into various parts of the midweeks protocol so why we chose a zero knowledge roll up as our scaling solution how the order book works how the architecture works um how we manage to be gas free carbon free rather um and it just it gives you like a really good sense of the project in a lot of detail and then finally there are a number of github links with um contract examples etc that we've linked in the discord channel so that is all from me uh i'm wondering kev do we have any questions that have popped up no we do not really no no questions at this point and that would be good if you do have any questions okay fantastic well we've managed to finish the present five minutes early um so we will end it there thank you everyone for for joining us can't wait to see what you come up with thanks everybody it's kevin
