foreign [Applause] [Music] hey what's up my name is Mark I'm the founder of Philip Zine never really know how to do these things where I'm supposed to introduce introduce myself or something like that and then I am up you know okay so uh this you know this may or may not be another take because I realize you guys could see way too much information on the other one um anyway like I was saying you know if you just check out our website belovedine.us-f-e-l-t-z-i-f-e dot us you're gonna see a bunch of you know just a bunch of different uh uh our projects that we've done everything from the latest news on our energy collection so also um artist Collections and collaborations that we're doing such as this one that aren't even necessarily nft collections but are just you know full collections of art that we're supporting um and dropping so check us out sometimes we've got nfts sometimes we've got dope you know what I'm saying events for y'all like this one that we collaborated with you know to bring y'all especially um during nft NYC we've done events during our Basel um like I said we're always dropping collections trying to do cool fun stuff whether it be in web 3 whether it's just you know General um you know internet or stuff 3D art stuff we're always trying to just like you know drop cool uh interesting at least that we think is interesting uh if I click here at our top you know I'm saying you can see our nft Art Shop uh and you know this for us is something that's really important um obviously yeah we are artists we are creative but we're also um you know very big into you know people have an independent ownership and the fact that you know web3 is a really good opportunity and platform for for artists such as us hopefully creators who are also watching this tutorial right now to really get into um you know like sort of thinking through their own means of like ownership their own means of traffic um so for us having our own secondary Market is really dope because it kind of just like completes I think like this cycle for us uh where we can like drop our uh you know we can like we drop art on our own contract people meant them um and then directly from our own contracts on our own minting Pages um now they can live in their own secondary uh on our website so it's really cool sort of being able to create this ecosystem um of art for our collectors um and for our community so uh you know if you're a collector of any of these collections uh and you know if you happen to collect any of our future collection that you collected any of our 101s I just of course want to say thank you and if you're here because you're like okay Mark shut up I want to know how you make this stuff um and not just talk about what you've done um you know wait no longer this is what we're getting into now I just want to get into what we do who we are uh and just you know give some context some people know us for one thing but they don't know us for the other so like I said check this out um you know of course all the nfts that that are found on our page here can also be found um you know anywhere right they can be found on open c um you know whatever anywhere you're looking for nfts you can find our stuff of course first tools that um that I want to tell you about is something called pixelator This is a tool that I think is um is is pretty slept on and actually I really only found it recently uh this is a really dope Tool uh you know like you can pay 25 if you want to go for the commercial version but uh if you just want to use it out the back there is um you know there is a free version and I think the free version is great uh I I do want to know before I start to drop in to the tutorial that um that I'm I'm using the the full version um and for some of these programs uh I did get lucky I was able to maybe download them like really early and got like a um for some of them I was able to get in before baby they were charging or um I got like an early version and was able to download an upgrade but uh you know for a lot of these apps even if you see that I'm using like a certain version um you know please you know don't be afraid just to try out the free one and then you know purchase it if you feel like you need a certain um feature but um for all of these uh tools you should be able to pretty much open them use them and create um you know very high quality art even up to you know literally like 4K Dimension art um or whatever so just know that like uh even if I show you some piece even if I'm not using the exact version or the Virgin number that that might be available to the public whatever whatever um that does not mean that the one that's available to you isn't isn't great um so yeah so you know with that like I said you could find this well at um at a pixelator uh just if you look up uh so there's two pixelators actually so make sure you get the one that's pixelated by um by Ron Ness and um I'll make sure that you know when I load it up you know you're able to find it and see uh make sure that that you you get the right one but there is another app called pixelator which um which I haven't used so just make sure that you know when when you go to download it that you actually um you know that's actually your page looks like my page if your page doesn't look like my page and you're opening it up soon um you might be using the wrong one um and then you also see the Creator Ron Ness is he's in like the top right corner so I I would a ronin this I don't know whatever um so just make sure just make sure that because uh I I had that confusion I also want to know that this this um as you can kind of see here says like um foreign [Music] like you know young devs this app is free for anyone under 18. so um yeah even if you're under 18 and you want to use the commercial version you can so you know this is like the kind of stuff that I just want to sort of stop and like talk about because like for me I think that like um to keep it real you know you sort of get like like you're gonna you're gonna get from like the world like what you attract you know what I'm saying and so like if if you're kind of like working with people that are doing dope stuff such as this like going out of their way to like make sure that young devs can can use their app um like like in general like when it comes to open source when it comes to web3 just try to surround yourself with people like that try to try to use their application because if we support them and they actually get used that's like sort of like the biggest dopest type of resistance that that we can do right if people create these free apps um and then nobody uses them or people don't utilize them to make super dope art or make very impactful things um the same way that we would use paid apps then um you know things are essentially going to stay the way that they are like people are going to continue to like um to make sure that like the best technology is always used in the context of like um you know or whatever like uh of driving the most capital of like whatever exploiting the most people right and I think in order for us to get to a place where open source stuff is used more and we got to use open source stuff more we got to use free apps more and we got to definitely support people that are doing really dope things like making their apps um you know totally free commercially for young aspiring devs um all right so I'm gonna jump in I'm gonna show you kind of how each layer works I'm gonna show you some stuff that I think is dope to do with it as you see you can do like you can make pixel art in like seconds um you know with things like uh leave with things like mid Journey it's just like the whole wave of AI we're seeing a big Embrace of tools that make art creation easier um so I think like like with that being the case you know I'm a big fan of like not just caring about the technology but actually also caring about the the thinking what is what is the what is the underlying philosophy behind why people are using like these sort of tools right so if we're gonna be thinking about decentralization we're going to be thinking about you know making sure all of our projects are open source um let's do the same thing here and if we're going to be thinking about using tools like AI which may the process of art creation easier then we should also do the same thing and and use apps such as this which make things like pixelating anything a thousand times easier so I'm gonna jump into that let's try it out uh and let's see what we could create I'm gonna try to create something new on the spot with y'all and so maybe I'll have a couple flops maybe we'll make something dope and maybe you'll we'll go through the whole process of making something that will still and then you'll see it become whack and hopefully we can bring it back by the end uh who knows maybe maybe through this whole process we'll even make a piece I don't want to stick to anything because like I said if if it turns out to be Ash we're going to abandon the piece because that's a part of our creation as well so maybe what we're going to do is just make a bunch of ads and then we're not gonna even post it or share it and we're gonna be like yo that's that's the name of the artist that's the day of a true artist wasting a ton of time all right y'all let's let's get into this okay y'all so you can see here we got I'm saying we got pixelator opened up um I you know there's a couple ways you can add images you can either drag and drop an image or you could click um where it says like source file either way works a person had to drag and drop my image um I can give you guys a quick rundown sort of just of the panel here just so you see we got a couple things happening here you got like this pixelation Factor this basically controls like the size of like the pigs the way like basically the size of you know your average pixel or whatever like how much you're gonna like pixelate it basically so like that this is on a one you know I I tend to like play with a lot of different styles but like even you know one is cool but like if I bump it up to 50 you see what that looks like and I'm saying it kind of has a Cool vibe something you could work with if you go down the link see like seven looks like uh you can see you know I'm saying this sort of has like more of like a little bit of like like whatever 8-bit feel whatever I'm gonna bump it up to one again because I think this is more this works more for what I like to do artistically but um yeah they all work and I think like all of them have like especially when you get to the bigger sizes they get like a little bit more experimental um you know which is really cool in its own way too so yeah all right so so let's keep it pumping um colors you know this this piece is like pretty simple um it's probably like not even eight colors down here let's see one two three four yeah there might only be four or something like that maybe maybe like five or something like that so um not that many colors and that's all together so like I bet actually if I bumped it down to like five let's see if we see a difference we probably I think um with a lot of pixel art stuff probably a good idea to like have as less colors as possible because that's that's kind of like more true to the actual medium um in my opinion like I think you should try to keep your I think you should try to make if you're gonna use a program like pixelator which is automating stuff you should try to make your automated stuff look more like handmade stuff and your handmade stuff is dope if people can't even believe you did it by hand that's kind of like five I like to go with at least um so anyway like you said like look I just dropped to five colors and you see that like it looks so weird now so let's see what happens if we open Bubble to six uh it's interesting because eight just might be our sweet spot so like I said try it out and like mess with different things it doesn't look good I'm not gonna do seven I'm just gonna go back to eight but um I could even bump it up to like I'll go to eight so that y'all could see eight and then if even if I double it it's like 16 or if I go to like you know even 256 you're gonna see like there's no major difference there so yeah you see at six we're starting to get the eyes recognized again but um here boom I'll go to eight um just so that we remember what it used to look like and so now he just popped up we're looking pretty dope um and yeah so that's like that's what eight looks like so you got that that set up there like I said if I bump up to 256 you you really want to see a difference you're going to stop slowing you so that's cool uh your smoothing factor you should see what that does that does interesting stuff it tries to smooth things out um the interesting thing is like sometimes it ends up sort of like knocking stuff out your swimming Factor your your factor is sort of like how strong it's going to be and then the iterations is like a multiplier of the smoothing factor so I can show y'all what that looks like as you see 256 colors is it doesn't look different from from eight especially not at this size and you know it's probably the size that we'll be using something like this especially given that as pixel art and even if it gets bigger um what's cool about Pixar is that like this view stays consistent basically stays the same so that's lit um all right so we have our smoothing factor and I can kind of show y'all you know what this is going to do I'm just gonna Max it out all right so we're waiting for that to go in you know background opacity I know what that is keep that high I don't personally want my background uh outside outline type you know you can have it outside line I'm gonna go to nine I really don't need one here um but you know you got outside lines inside lines y'all know how that goes size in size out this stuff gets really interesting when you start working in um pixel art so I think like if you have if you're if you're really into pixel art and you want to get down into like you know make yourself look more or less realistic there's interesting things with sides in and sides out and like the ways that uh different pixel artists different thing about um her like side pictures and stuff like that and we don't really have you know that's not what this is about I'm not trying to get that like a pixel art rabbit hole but um some of that stuff is cool if you don't say if that's what this was about to get into it um and then you know what I'm saying you got your online capacities um outline on change um I'll color change that's cool stuff it basically um you know as colors change it'll add a line so whether it's like blue and white is it'll like boom put a line there um same here if just take different color palettes about my nose and then you know you can have like a diagonal outline rather than a um you know it'd be thicker and that's what I was talking about with the sides and sides out as all that kind of stuff so if we kick if we click a palette online here we might actually end up seeing um that sort of like divider line between the the blue and the white of the eyes let's see ah now we didn't get it this time I mean sometimes that happens we probably bumped it Up played with those things a little bit more um oh actually it's because I didn't uh that didn't happen and let's see if we pick inside line type if it comes up um yeah so you see here you know I'm saying just like Play and play around with your with your settings try different things out um I wasn't trying to like strip this or do anything that was like two can so I didn't um you know like I said in the beginning like if if we if we have experiences where we see certain things or we don't it's what it is see it came up I know what I'm talking about I was trying to prefer it preface it like you know but I don't care I need to start being such a scared of myself scared him I don't feel like I know the truth I know what's going to work but I act like I ain't know it's gonna work well I second guess myself y'all see the line let's go back let's go back what we both do y'all see the live minute I know what I'm doing with this app um all right cool so look man that's that's kind of like my main point I'm gonna add the line here so that my bubbles is like a little different you know what I'm saying that's some individuality to talk too much um yeah this is what I mean I mean you know what I'm saying you just have the opportunity to do cool stuff kind of switch it out if I wanted to bump up um I could probably like deep fryer make her like a little Snookie um those snooky bubbles and I'm saying um we can do that you know what I'm saying we could we could orange them out it's all good we could you know saying Mar-A-Lago Mar-A-Lago to home girl she had the blonde hair this kind of fly she got the blind error ready and then the orange tan all right look this is what we're going through is this what I mean this this is one this one this becomes fun again I think this is one thing I kind of want to also touch on like I think using a tool like pixelator just allows you to have so much fun in a way that like if I had tried to recreate that like by hand I don't think I would have just messed around and you know I'm saying created the the mara liable version of a of the homie here so uh that's what I mean man just just have fun with the art like when we call our art up shirt that's what we mean like we're embracing it bro like I mean we got we got we got Ivanka Bubbles and like you know what I'm saying like that that in itself is like uh it's amazing so I just yeah I just want to say that like I just think that you know I'm saying just just just have fun with this  and just like uh I'm having fun I I like this is like my favorite thing I've made in all the time okay so I'm gonna export this so we have and I'm just saving to my desktop I saved the previous bubbles I'm going to call this uh bubbles Trump because we know all right so there we go um this is fine so all right where do we go from here all right so we we got we got the orange person um let me drop another one of these okay we can do this again I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an example of one that I did recently and then I'll show you how I how I used it in a piece and then you know you could see sort of like I'm not depressed with bluffing you know I really do like Africa all right let's drop this in boom so we're copying in another one we load this one up um it's gonna do its thing um yeah so you can see it gets kind of funky this one I didn't really obviously I didn't want a saturation enhance this one I think this one I might even kick zero Zero's a little show I want this one yeah I might have kicked up a little anyway um this this is one I've already made this one so I'm just gonna get into that and then I'll show you what I what I ended up exporting and then um I'll show you how I ended up using all right okay okay dope so now you can see the Mickey that I created uh and yes I do have Photoshop open whatever I never said that every single thing I was going to use here would be free uh you don't use Photoshop then just use whatever free program you're already using to edit images I know that you will have editor that can open pngs Okay so don't don't beeping me about this I didn't feel like finding like a fake free alternative just to lie to you I'm not gonna do that uh okay so here we go with Photoshop uh you can see here's my pixelated Mickey uh gosh about homie here all right here we go so as you can see here he's pixelated whatever whatever he looks good 100 he looks good he looks good when he's smaller it doesn't look great when he's bigger it happens um now what did I do with him I placed him in here now what is this this is a promo for one of our at least collection there's also a piece I mean sometimes I mean pieces which can also service promos uh pretty much you know just trying to stay efficient here y'all you know trying to say creative at web three you gotta work hard yeah you gotta work smarter not harder we're all working too hard already you know especially especially in these bear markets you don't feel me I know what we're doing here you know what I'm saying the bear markets yeah you got too much time to just be making a lot of a lot of that's that's disconnected from everything else uh all right here we go so um yeah here we are I mean I used it you know what I'm saying I used it I posted it this was a promotion for everything that we did uh you can see like there are tools like uh you know pixelators that are currently have always in my rotation of tools that I'm using you know this was this is the focal point of the image um and you know what's really cool I didn't even plan this the way this came together is is so good I swear I I couldn't have planned what's about to happen next this background this background let's just shove everything up I'm and I'm I'm going layer by later let's just take everything off later by later y'all are going to do this with me when we are left and we are left with nothing but the background nothing but this this thing you see here this was all made with artificial intelligence not not the big famous one that you currently have to pay for uh this is made with a free one which performs comparably I will note that uh By the time this comes out there might be other types of AIS that are out which also do a great job so I don't want to say like this one's the best or another one's the best this one is free um it will always be free because of the way that it is uh it is available so I would just uh I would just heavily just say like try this out uh the the suede that I'm about to show you how to make AI art is really useful even if you do have like a an apple if even if you do have like a um an account on Dolly even if you were able to get an invitation um this is still usual because you get test out prompts the way that I'm about to show you and then if that prompt works then you can try and delete to get uh you know to get something else like I said it's not necessarily something that's better but something that's different and so um I like to do that especially because you have to pay for the dialing once and you can't kind of iterate on different ideas as much um this one also doesn't have anything you know that will get you bad no one can ban you my web three people you know how important this is if we were going to talk about decentralization and we're going to talk about some very very interesting things when it comes to open Ai and when it comes to these certain systems that people are building I understand what they're afraid of but are they afraid of us or should we be afraid of them y'all feel me uh all right so uh what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get this whole AI thing set up there's some like background downloading I got to do on my end that y'all really don't want to see um and uh I'll probably just get it started just so I could see what I do to make it happen but truthfully that stuff is very boring you'll see I'll get it started I'm gonna have to speed through that and and you know we're just gonna go through it we'll make some really cool AI um and yeah then we'll see what we're Landing okay y'all so um you know the first thing I wanted to bring up especially when it comes to the AI stuff is that um similar to Dolly um all of this can be done in the browser so um really I think the best way to kind of find this and approach especially the the style and the process that I've been talking to you about that we're presenting is um is just to sort of go to this um right if you go to Reddit r slash big sleep you can find one of the main posts areas the centipede diffusion notebook um I guess I have this post saved this is like a you know really great post I I I'm gonna go ahead and upload it I didn't even add it before but um whatever I I really don't use Reddit like that besides once in a while to grab stuff like this um so yeah you know you can kind of learn everything you need to here it kind of gives you the Deep details into like um the different types of diffusion some like latent diffusion and disco diffusion just one piece um whatever you may or may not be impressed by that that's not really my point you'll kind of see and and there's a really big thread where people have added a bunch of things asked a bunch of of questions and the um the uh you know the the the op has done a lot of really great work answering everybody and making this a really great um collab notebook for people who don't know about collab I'm gonna click over here this is the actual um what we call a collab notebook these collab notebooks are very similar to um like python notebooks just like regular python notebooks um pretty sure that's what they are um so if you use something like Jupiter to um you know to like uh to create nfts or something like that then you're probably actually like familiar with something like this so um you know I like for me the first time I tried it because I was familiar with using Jupiter python notebooks uh I sort of caught on really quickly but I've also showed this to friends of mine who um you know weren't familiar with with making with with python um and they you know they thought it was really easy to use as well so you know I and I'll show you an example I get for anybody who doesn't have access but um it's not as easy as Dolly it is harder than Dolly but I think that is still um very easy I mean Dolly's just incredibly easy and Dolly is a you know a one out of ten on the easiness scale then I would say this is probably a five um so it's certainly not a ten but I do think that um because you know it does have these sections that um you know where you could just add in text but um for instance it is important to keep these brackets in these quotes and um you know if someone isn't really from familiar with this world I could see where they where they get caught up however if you read step by step and line by line you should not make a mistake and um the other thing that I will say especially because you know we're probably gonna have to do some sort of like quick fast forward thing I will say that the most important thing is these props um yeah and you can get into sort of like if you see here and you read a tutorial you see that some you get one some steps you can be more detailed than other steps um I say try that out try different things once you uh once you're used to this once you get into the full phase um we'll try different things out and you'll sort of see what it looks like but like I said I mean I think in general for me personally this is the best tool um the best free uh AI generation tool that I found as you'll see you can create high quality images um and by that what I mean is like like literally like hi uh high resolution High you know high dimension big big file size uh you know up to like I think I've been generating things here that are like 10 megabytes plus easy like not even um stressing so um yeah I I do want to I do want to note that it says that you may require a pro account um I don't find the pro account to be um necessary unless you start wanting to make like videos and um and stuff like that which which I don't do um but once again you know this is like a somewhere um a similar thing with like pixel leader if you if you want to support something like collab um you know I I think it could be a good thing I think that there are a lot of really good reasons why you should and you can um but if you if you know if you don't want to um great you know what I'm saying that's dope if you don't want to hang out and you don't want to do and if you can't um that's okay as well you know what I'm saying you shouldn't feel any shame around that but just want to say that like you know with all these things they are free and they are really great free you know resources but at the same time if you do pay um a lot of times things maybe just like work faster or you could you know you you could create videos uh maybe a little bit smoother maybe with like less like needing to do less coding or something like that um yeah like I said just just look at things and figure out for you and like your workload um what makes sense for you so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna show y'all like how I how I usually would run one of these things you could read this if you want um I I've done like probably I mean I know that I've generated over well over like a thousand images in the thing so I'm gonna skip this for now there's credits in here that are cool you can check that out okay change all tutorial the tutorial is useful I do think some of this stuff is outdated and I think they mention it at the top yeah the section below is outdated as a V2 so these are updated but I think it's also still like helpful just to get a sense of like what's what um text prompts image prompts just get a sense of of what it is uh all right so are we out of here yay let's keep going um all right so this setup this is really important um you pretty much click play here and it'll do what it needs to do uh and if I click that okay yeah so now I need to run anyway it's gonna tell me authorized I'm gonna run it anyway you see up here it's going to auto connect and it's connecting and we are waiting for it now um all right and now it is cooking and that's gonna add right you want to access my Google Drive I'm gonna let it access my Google Drive just because um I have I have a big enough Google drive to do it and and uh there's some really cool stuff you can do like it auto saves your images if if you do it on Google Drive and then also um it saves the image it saves the image model which is what it uses to sort of like you know if you say bring me up a painting of you know the king Napoleon uh trampoline King Caesar whatever Napoleon wasn't a Cambridge you see well I mean did he make himself effort whatever uh whatever Napoleon fighting you know Caesar painted in the style of uh Da Vinci um you know that's the model is what says okay who is Da Vinci what was his painting like um etc etc so what's cool is like if you have that on your um on your drive loaded it makes it makes these processes of loading it up and getting it out way easier and way faster um like I said I'm gonna speed this up anyway but just trust me if you can connect your your drive do it uh I didn't do it for a long time and um now I regret it it automatically saves your images um it's just so much better it's just so much better so if you if you have the ability to put it on Drive Do It um there's a lot of troubleshooting if anything goes wrong and you know just just do it like I said I had I've had experiences where I had to do the troubleshooting and I will say like being on the other side of that it's definitely worth it to just get on drive maybe get a collab Pro account if you really feel like you're gonna make a lot of a lot of AI art um the collab Pro account um and the Google Drive is probably cheaper than doing the dolly images especially um you know if you find yourself doing a lot I know a lot of people that have um you know spent through even I did I spent doing my first I went through my first round of free credits um a lot of people have done that and you know now they're doing four Images instead of six um with this you can you can determine how many images you you get per batch and like I said they're all Freedom so even if you only did one per batch it doesn't matter because they're all free so anyway like I said the setup is going to go on um I'm gonna holla at y'all on the other side of this we're gonna generate some cool AI stuff and then um yeah I'm gonna show you guys how I made like that that previous background that I showed y'all um yeah this background right here I'm gonna show you how I how I you know put this stuff together and then um you know I think once we have that up yeah wave on with it oh let me switch to it boom that background right there once so I'm I'm going to show you how we could get uh you know like like something that looks pretty close to this um I could I could probably even just go ahead and try to get I could probably put in a very similar prop that I put on when I put this one in and we could see if we could get something like really close to this again um that's always kind of fun to see if the AI can repeat itself and then also to see how the AI completely diverges from it so um I'm pretty sure I know what I put in there's some there's some like there's some tricks there's some secrets to my art that you're gonna get as I put this in so this is gonna be fun if anybody actually well I know a lot of people are but any of my friends are actually sit and watch this um have fun with this because this this is just this isn't part of the sauce so it'll be fun um I'll drop it in there and uh yeah we'll go from there so I'm gonna let this I'm gonna let this model and all that stuff load up uh as I mentioned you can kind of like see that there yeah it's showing up it's still cooking the setup's going um yeah just so y'all see I'm gonna show you something real quick if I go down here to my diffusion and clip settings this is the model that it'll download these different things you can check they make them like like uh kind of like like more advanced but it also like it like I've seen like you get you get like better results sometimes they're like more detailed and um you know maybe they look like more realistic or something but the problem with clicking all these is that when you're going to make your images it's very very slow and then sometimes when you go to do the the final part um which is like I think it's the uh I think it's the Disco diffusion for yeah when you go to do the Disco diffusion part um sometimes you're not you're not gonna have enough RAM um and enough memory to get it done so I would just say like I would just say try it try it on what's here first and if you if you actually find yourself running out of ram maybe um unclick one of these and just try different things or unclick all of them and only try one so you don't need all of these checked to get these I can only actually need like one so uh yeah so while this is running you could even just go ahead and click that play button there so that you can get this running and as once once all of these are finished if you click here you know it's like moving through you see these are done check marks here uh stuff like that check mark there this is the one that's processing um and if you see it like if you have a whole table of contents here as well so you can see what you're gonna do um once this is done then we can move on to you know putting on our prompts checking things out and we'll and we'll go ahead and do that um and we'll have a lot of fun with that stuff this is the this is the stuff that pre-loaded um you know that that just happens when you whenever you open up the notebook so don't mind that um yeah so look let's just see what happens um this is gonna go I'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna you know say me back up and we're gonna try to create that that piece of background um or low key just pick whatever we like and then I'm gonna probably put like bubbles on top of that background and then we're gonna have uh we have a new piecemate and then um if it looks like we still have a little bit of time left in this tutorial and then I'll go ahead and do um I'll add like a 3D component in there so we can go ahead and cook that up all right all right see y'all soon peace okay y'all it didn't really take too long thankfully we're basically done all the models are ready and we are at three latent diffusion part this is where you want to go this is where it gets lit this one gets fun um this is the basis this one just you just start creating so uh yeah let's go ahead and start doing that give me one sec sorry about that y'all um all right so sick all right so yeah let's go ahead and let's just let's get started we're just gonna erase this prop we don't need this one like I said keep the quote and keep the brackets uh just I mean you need them so I think it's easier to keep it um this one I'm gonna do we're gonna do so we're trying to create the piece that we saw earlier so uh you know I don't know that is Waikiki Beach location um my wife and I lived in my cgb's for like six months it was a very very beautiful time in my life um she was pregnant with our firstborn son who just turned one so this is a very also like sick time to be revisiting this right now all right so here we go so this is our first prompt um the steps we're gonna take 50 steps steps are basically like um how much it's gonna process it if you do too many steps it starts to become um I don't know it's not as interesting so 50 steps is really cool too many steps it just starts to iterate on itself and um kind of just becomes a jumbled mess some people like that aesthetic but I feel like um I don't know whatever like I said before I try to make my AI not look like Ai and I like my art that I make personally to feel like it's robotic I don't know why that's just that's just how I like to get down with things so I'm trying to show y'all the way that I genuinely like to create and then y'all can just figure out whatever y'all want to do I don't think it's better than anything else it's just what I do um iterations are three I'm gonna keep it real with y'all I will keep most of this the same the same ones in parallel is free so you get three you basically get three for three you get nine pieces when I saw it set it done you'll see what that looks like the diversity scale I actually like to play with this if you feel like you're getting something at your light you can go higher that's like you know 10 15 20 whatever um that's cool because you get things that are more similar but then if you go down like let's say to like five or three um even seven and a half you get things that are like pretty pretty just uh pretty different from each other which I liked a lot the seed stuff minus one I would keep that the same you'll get a random number probably enter the Nazi for work threshold I'm gonna just go ahead and put mine on one um if you put it on zero then it'll stop you from getting anything that's not safe for work if you put it on one it doesn't seem to stop anything personally I'm like very against this whole thing around like AI censorship that's happening um uh I don't know I'm not even trying for myself I'll do it like that I'm trying to cause like shoes or nothing but like my first two days on open Ai and darling I already got like strikes so and I didn't mean to I don't think I was trying to make anything that was like that bad or anything um but uh you know there's some pieces that I have that have artistic nudity in them um and I was trying to like get variation made of those and I couldn't do that so I would just be careful like if you have any type of nudity or raunchiness to what you're trying to create sometimes things like Dolly will block you and so I really I mean I can't say enough about like artists being able to like create without being censored um so yeah sorry I stopped there I didn't even stop there I could have ran this so okay so you press play um that's what's gonna happen um this is the folder name you can keep that the same as I said as you start to mess with these things you can tap in more and try to personalize it it'll make a difference so we're going to go ahead and boom let's click play let's run this late into Fusion you can skip it the end painting mode stuff we're not going to get into that now um so it'll start cooking you see the sheet number pop up and now it'll get started to get rolling um as you see it like you know it does it moves pretty fast it does this thing pretty well um you know the whole thing itself should maybe take the total of like 30 seconds it looks like it's gonna take um and yeah look y'all like you know basically um like I was saying you know just I I really believe in something like this because of a lot of different reasons uh it's open source you can see all the code uh you can click right into the right into its um you know right into to GitHub I could copy it to drive so I could save it myself um and yeah like like the fact that you know I could save this and and freeze it as what it is um no one can ever take it away from me um and you know just take it off the internet like they can with something like Dolly um I think that that means a lot and so I would just you know the same way with web3 where we talk about things such as like Independence Etc um you know we have to we should follow that same dude with with like all of the means to our art creation so if if every if you put up an nft and yeah the nft is like you know uh it's on ipfs or it's on chain um yeah that's great but if if all your means of creation are you know controlled and um and can be taken away from you at any moment then um you know at its poor you still have the same issues that you have before right so um as we know with AI we don't always get things that we love so I rolled the dice I didn't love what I got I'm not getting a lot of stuff that looks like what I have before so we might have to make some adjustments um let's check out let's see what we do we can kind of adjust like the prompt a little bit and uh and see what happens so let's go ahead let's go up there and have some fun all right keep okay so here's the other thing about this right um I bet you if I drop the iterations and I drop the parallels let's see what happens if I go up in size here because this one might also be um this one might also be be in case of of that needing to change so let's see what happens we're going to run these similar uh but I think it's also like another really cool thing to see like you see here that like um I was something like with something like centipede diffusion um just changing the dimensions of what you're doing at the late in diffusion Park can give you drastically different results uh so I'm excited for y'all to see that soon because um yeah let's see let's see let's see if they're even different you never know what you're gonna get when you roll the dice with AI so it should be really fun um so yeah as you can see here Origins we're getting more of like this pattern type thing so here let's do this um I'm gonna I'm gonna change the prompt a little bit um and then I feel like we're gonna start to do something um that starts to resemble I'm gonna I'm gonna switch it to like landscape photo just to see what comes in just to see like what we get uh you know and uh yeah I think I do in my second land on Sunday now we start the fire with it I'm gonna adjust these back to to what they were before 3 and 256 on the width and the height boom [Music] boom all right so we're just we're gonna we're gonna let this rock um I like that this one was fast enough where we can do this together because uh this is cool you know I'm saying like it's it's cool to to be like continuously like roll on the dice with this as stuff are not normal what we're gonna get and doing it together uh that's really cool I feel like uh this is usually a pretty solitary experience sort of like do it uh with y'all and to get new stuff and look at that look at that we finally got what we wanted um this is this is where AI gets so um oh man this is where I this this proves my point I love to say that to me the art of AI is in the prompt right look at that just by adding landscape photo but we changed the whole like Vibe of everything that we got and we finally got what we wanted um now I don't even know which one I want to move on to the next step I mean we have so many good options five sounds like you're gonna be wave that's coming to destroy the city you know what I'm saying number eight this last one has a crazy vibe to have building that similar to our last one number seven on the building in the distance like that Superfly like um since that feels like like diamond head or something anyway I love it we're gonna go on number four uh because I think it might do the most when we go to the next level um but hey look let's go you know what I'm saying under different circumstances I would run this again run this again save some blah blah blah blah blah you know what it is um we're skipping this step so I can just click play here it's not gonna do anything cool that took a second now we're here at our disco diffusion set settings as you can see here y'all you can get way deeper there's stuff to do I'm gonna I'm gonna show you another kind of dope Secret in shortcut a lot of times you can just copy your first prompt um and bring that in and like I said you you can get detailed I'm not saying that this is the right way to do it another way is the wrong way I'm not getting into all that all I'm trying to say is that I found really good results closed captioning not available pretty much basically you open it here drag it you could do like oh whatever boom copy past copy path paste it oh you're good uh We're not gonna do that today we're not doing that right now we're definitely do that another time uh we'll have a lot of fun all right so I'm pressing play we're running our disco diffusion this this kind of people it takes a little longer um this is why I was kind of saying like and what not only what I was saying but why you saw me like you saw me earlier like I I didn't I didn't rush to this section I I kept rolling my advice up earlier at the latent diffusion stage I would definitely like suggest that like run the light into Fusion Run the light into fusion and then like when you feel like you got ones that you like then move to the Disco diffusion and then you'll you'll you'll save yourself a lot of time as you can see we're still running the Disco diffusion the Disco diffusion it's going to take a while it always takes longer than um than processing the the lay-in diffusion part but um also with the other settings that we put in um what's cool is that you're gonna see that like the the image it's gonna be like a really big file I think it probably this one's probably gonna end up being like um 10 24 but like I said you could you could push them out as big as like 4K um so yeah so just give that a shot like I said you get good quality images as you can see right now it's going through the process so make the image it starts off here um and then um it builds samples it speeds through it does its thing right now where like maybe it'll take about like a minute and a half I'll speed through this so you can get to the end result you can see uh it's popping you can see what that looks like all right okay here we go let's see if we're all done that's like all right let's check this out let's check this out yeah all right so that's our whole outfit he sucks fire um that's basically it y'all we made we just we just made an AI background uh I'm loving it we're gonna use this to boot with our uh we're gonna combine this with the bubble piece that we made Ivanka bubbles AKA uh bubbles Mar-A-Lago we're gonna throw her into the Waikiki Vibes and then you know what we're just gonna we're gonna go ahead we're gonna add a 3D element to that and you know basically have everything that you need to make any kind of digital art piece at this point um all right so boom let's go ahead and do that thing maybe we'll just kick to some like random crazy 3D stuff put something random together and we'll just slap it all together and uh yeah a lot of piece done and then fermented to post it whatever we want to do from it so all right let's get into that hey y'all so as I alluded to you know I just wanted to give you like a quick quick uh dive into like some 3D stuff I really don't want to spend too much time on here because it's definitely not a 3D tutorial it's really more of like General throwing you into stuff but you know a lot of times people ask me about how to get like really dope looking realistic 3D figures um and you know that's 3DS is really sort of like the leading standard for that and it's free um you know the cool thing about it is exactly that you get started you can download basically you register you do everything you need uh they drop their own nfts and stuff uh whatever I don't uh I don't really know much about those but um all of this stuff that you see here they also have like a um they have like a place where you can shop buy models buy cool clothes and stuff and you can edit them and do really cool with them um like these bandanas you know what I'm saying like I could cop that flip the texture out make that a fellow Jean bandana or whatever uh they do cool stuff just you you know there's also for anybody who's interested there is free stuff um on here I forget how to search for it or find it um right off the top right now but obviously there's a lot of things that you want on sale and stuff but you don't you don't you don't need to uh buy anything to use Dash the music completely free um and the free stuff is good oh and here we go look this whole free model section look at this all this cool stuff you get from free um do whatever you want with it have a lot of fun this is what's free this week but um yeah there's always free stuff just sort of happening every week but it's even cool that just like every week you know you're gonna get like you know however many like 10 different items that are like completely free um so yeah check that out that is 3D very fun you're getting very like really quickly right off the bat start making like really dope stuff um can I show you an example of that I'm going to right now so let me uh let's get out of here let's close that out let's hop into Daz and um I'm just gonna make something random I have no idea what I'm gonna make but what I'm gonna do uh hopefully this this turns out pretty decent yeah unless I have this I'm gonna just throw it in with the with our our bubbles Mar-A-Lago and our um in our background and um see what we get and uh but it'll be fun anyway we're making absurd art we're not thinking about it too much we're just going with the flow we're just building we're just creating um and yeah basically everything we've used so far has been free has had a free option um and we have just been embracing all of those vibes um so yeah what I'm doing here is I'm just kind of like playing around in Dash um like I said this this is really not meant to be a tutorial on like how to use that or how to make 3D art so I'm just going to kind of like click around and just tell you some of the cool stuff that I like um now I'm just gonna put random stuff together you know I'm saying like we have the ski mask why not let's go ski masks on the homie let's see what happens yeah whatever nah I'm not liking it it's looking funky let's keep it moving this kind of stuff we do y'all I don't um you know I don't get too caught up in like something doesn't work I take it off right let's see do we have wings uh oh do we have them for Genesis we do this is gonna work out perfect all right so like now look at that we have wings those like fly um like I said y'all I'm not I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna stress go crazy about a lot of this you know like we know we're just having fun we know we're just we're just kind of vibing and putting stuff together so um that's exactly what we're gonna do We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna stress too much we're just gonna explore this  and see what we come up with um shaping this is where a lot of fun stuff happened if we go back to Genesis shaping like you can get into like a lot of um you see here sort of on our right side we got all these like cool features that come with these cool little icons that come up and I'll tell you what you're gonna do as you get into these other ones there's other stuff here like um you can see like oh you see them inside the face part um you can see like I was I was uh I was like impacting that you see what I'm saying um so all these do something like that so we're gonna go back to the ones that we had there before we're gonna see like what we can pull up that'll be kind of interesting I'm gonna buff homie out and we're just gonna yeah we're just gonna go super absurd here I'm gonna buffer do it up and uh all right here we go let's zoom out wow um if we zoom out a bit we see our homies of monster it's a beast um I lick so like yo let's go over here I'm gonna drop in some I just need some materials y'all I'm really trying to like not I'm gonna make this as like fun as possible I don't want to have to like do no speed through this because I just don't want to uh so I'm trying to like make it here so that we could get some like good stuff without needing to uh do too much I'm gonna just make this like I'm gonna make him all gold that goes along with janky when we fill it out but like whoa whoa whoa I'm freaking crazy uh let's get a little janky but now it's gonna look good metal sober let's just get a random posing here um all this stuff like as you see I'm I'm moving quickly there's a combination of me being very very familiar with dance 3D but also that that street is like kind of this easy like it kind of is uh like I'm just gonna pull this pose and then he does that well this pole now he does that but now I'm like wait my wings aren't sticking so I gotta parent my wings let's change the wing parent um the winged parent is Genesis except that I don't know am I able to do that let's see if we know ah not have my hand on if I go back so I can get myself let's do this see now now the wings are fine um all right what do we want to do I don't like Andy's poses I'm gonna have to do more with the wings I know but we'll get back to that um all those poses are actual let's see what else we got [Music] uh let's see this [Music] again [Music] let's replace these Lanes as These Wings Are not being nice I also don't like that pose that was ridiculous uh [Music] is very strong for the first one because he's going to be the Beast bunnies are so like ridiculous ly and I'm gonna have to do this this ridiculous Bros all right it's fine we're not gonna do my very nice I just have to do this ridiculous pose uh there's a little lot of what you know making all right let's let's let's let's go I'm double clicking it's all right we're good our wings are in there am I gonna close the wings uh sure I'm gonna just crawl them in and we're gonna call it a day like I said this is not true too much about um about like uh you know about trying to do something like this that's like three so we're really just trying to uh uh we're really just trying to get something made here and just and just share and just try to show you all like honestly man I'm trying the power I'm trying to show you how easy it is to make some so like the last thing I'm trying to do is get caught up with something I'm gonna show you I'm gonna zoom out I'm gonna get the full body getting the full body is going to be way easier like when we go in and we add this and we add it to the to the piece mostly because like if I crop it in like as soon as I crop it in like I'm so limited into what I can do with it so I'm Gonna Keep it one by one I'm Gonna Keep the full body in a lot of circumstances I would say keep the full body and just upscale the piece and just crop it if you need to um I'll give you an idea of what I mean um and this is probably a good trick yo I'm going through this and the tricks are getting better as I don't so this is like um all right so we're just we're just gonna push this out I'm actually gonna pump it so this is like 1080 now I'm gonna do like I'm gonna do like 4K hopefully it didn't take like forever forever so I'll just do a still image or a frame and I'll save it to a file I don't need it there I definitely don't mine I'm just gonna save it directly to the desktop it's not the best thing to do but you know I just want to make this piece uh [Music] oh um oh this is great now we now we're here we'll putting the pieces together I can say this much [Music] we deliver okay we said we were gonna make mature art and here we are okay first things first we started strong all right so let's look at our first element here looking beautiful um really all we're gonna do right now is put the three elements together we're gonna put this piece together okay our our pixel art that we created I we got the 3dm on me that we just rendered you feel me oh yeah y'all didn't see that but um we I read the thing you feel me we I rate it we took it to the top um we did the damn thing with it so I'm very very very very very very excited about this okay hey leg that's one element hi what's our last one here we go baby here we go our background our background our Aaron background is lit we know that we know what we're running into um Waikiki Beach in homes in Hieronymus Bosch vibes um I'm excited all right so let's just put these things together okay we got our girl bubbles bubbles is tanning the beach sorry haji's there grab the wrong element right here we go we're gonna she's chilling on the beach can I um perspective let's see all right foreign yeah this is great already you know what we're gonna do with our homie give me a little bit off here I feel like yeah oh God our God is emerging from the sea look at that look at that already um yo I love this piece I love this piece what I've seen it for now um you know if we really wanted to get funky with it we could open up like a you know gpt3 right and we could like um we could even like see what it would look like to uh to potentially like get some like AI text you know what I'm saying cooking in there um I don't even have I don't even have I don't even have one of those set up or anything like that yet but I'm just saying there's so much we could do with this um I can't wait to post it I'm gonna post this once once we actually share our um you know what was actually share that that we're doing this and then this whole thing comes out we're gonna I'm gonna be like yo here's our bees we might even admit this um this is sick y'all and and if you want to know something with that that's really dope in my opinion um I mean I hope y'all y'all are as excited about this as I am but um everything that I showed y'all like we we have you know practically um seriously put into play um and so I will give y'all a look here um hey guys really quickly as we wrap up here I just wanted to just let you know that everything that we uh did uh today was actually utilized and um the fellow scene's latest collection The Garden of felsen's the light so uh check that out when you see here like these elements were made in the 3D programs uh similar free program similar once to the ones that I showed y'all and then as you see these backgrounds uh were made and using the exact AI process that I that I also outlined so you can see that's one episode you can see another example here so yeah definitely check that out um I just wanted to show you that um you know all the same things that went together to put together the piece uh that we just made together um it's also here uh and these are the same elements that we use to uh to put together you know active collections uh that we currently have available on our website and you know that people are collecting that people have supported so um you know get out there you know the you know success to open source and um you know free programs and um you know long live the creators y'all just good luck please feel free to reach out you know you can find us at boat scene f-e-l-t-c-i-n-e and me personally and you can find me at m-a-r-k um my name is Mark at markdigital d-i-g-i-t-a-l-h-d um well I hope you enjoyed this I hope to do this more this has been really fun um and I'll see y'all later peace foreign
