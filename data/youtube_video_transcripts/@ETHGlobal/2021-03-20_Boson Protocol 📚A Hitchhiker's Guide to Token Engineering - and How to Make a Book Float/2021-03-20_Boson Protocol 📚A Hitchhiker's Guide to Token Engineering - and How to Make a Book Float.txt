fun or taking part of your saturday with us um you know you're in the middle of a hackathon so i just wanna um quickly introduce jeb ben from bosan protocol who's going to give a talk and workshop on a hitchhiker's guide to token engineering how to make a book float from medivers to universe we'll be taking questions in the chat um you're you're welcome to turn on your your video if you want and participate um it's kind of free-flowing and we'll also can take some questions at the end um so with that i will um hand it off to shebin and we'll be good to go thank you thank you so um i'll go about it like this i'd love talking about this book uh i attack his guide to token engineering which started with the idea of creating all of the knowledge that floats around in in token engineering in different uh very beautiful and polymath minds and bring it down to you know a living book that that helps us basically to bring knowledge together and the boldest idea with which we started was it's going to be a community-sourced book it's going to be crowdfunded through git coins it's going to be a living book published on on github and we're going to have a token model of course because this is what you want to try this meta mega pattern of crowd sourced crowd funded resources and networks around those and the book was just perfect to to try that out for good and basically with the token model initially and we just wanted to um yeah published book and you know sell it on amazon like everyone else does as well and basically yeah create a revenue reward sharing token model for the book as well so you know have it all and and test it all and after we started on this journey a lot of things became clear and and uh this very dynamic non-linear path opened itself up uh we just started with this blueprint of the book like what content need to be there and over this year we worked on projects helped them had our own had token engineering academy courses which in which we applied some of this knowledge with the project etc so the content uh you know checks out definitely uh and we still have to go um we're still at that phase the our ability to basically source that knowledge from the community that also checked out so we have regular co-authors and and leads of chapters the open sourcing of the content and really having having a um living repository of um of this knowledge uh thanks to gitcoin grants will also check out we need to you know find a good process to get the the content from whatever wherever the writers are happy writing into github and then from there basically crowdsourcing it what really blew my mind is that we actually you know in december so that we could actually with all of the um you know nifties and royalty sharing aspect of of the attribution that one can keep track on in a programmable manner we we thought that web 3 publishing is possible and around the corner came one of our uh very strong token engineers tanner and and their team at pictosis basically saying yes this is absolutely possible and you know where i thought okay this is a basically top and we can't even you know can't even think beyond that is when i joined actually bozon protocol for um many different uh reasons but then uh you know after one month working with boson protocol i realized oh my god these guys are hacking away with the really cool game theoretic approach uh for actually solving uh e-commerce and this digital to physical distribution how you get things commerce going on online in this digital space actually connected to the physical delivery of goods and services across the globe in a decentralized manner i'm like could that be could we actually you know ditch amazon for real without any uh repercussions and actually have a local publishers you know blossom or spring-like mushrooms it seems possible so at the end of it i want i want to go there um but um yeah and we won't have time for the token model but i'm guessing you can imagine uh how it will play out and yes but uh as i mentioned i really love to also talk about the content inside the book and the people um who are writing it so the first half is going to be a bit about that a bit about the publishing process uh basically what needs to be done what is the attributions etc and then at the end we can basically uh um you know look at our first graph of how this could this this book created online in many many uh different media actually also has a physical distribution channel through bozom protocol in the near future and uh yeah i would love to hear back some ideas maybe even hacks uh from from you uh over the weekend so definitely come back and i'm super interested with whatever this this talk triggers um okay the token entering book a hitchhiker's guide to token engineering um was pretty so these chapters were pretty stable uh since the beginning because you know it started out of one's own itch literally that we need that content somewhere so we don't have to onward every person into a project and uh you know just all really explain them how how we run token economies how we deploy how we create the token models etc uh and during basically the last year also it became for me super intriguing to really look at the transdisciplinarity of token engineering we have engineering heavy fields where we draw from like ai optimization theory systems engineering and all where you know where i come from and feel happy but we also have on the other side really legal engineering economics game theory ethical engineering political science all of that weaves in into what we call a cryptoeconomic system and that means in teams we are working in teams with people who come from so many different directions and how do we go about that right now it's an art so uh that's one chapter that is just starting but uh we have them the basics covered uh crypto economics patterns uh um written by vasily is coming along really well and he's been through you know uh all of the ico craze and all of the defy craze and uh he's an engineer systems engineer uh background so he looked at it and its patterns at its atoms and back to actually created a really nice um template for figuring out those patterns token model generation is the chapter that i provided because it was my biggest pain to actually explain and not sound like a crazy person about all of these value flows that go around in a very complex adaptive dynamic system that tokens economies are then we have a big chunk that's coming up next previously preserving participatory architectures sect devops in in token networks and decentralizing organizations i will not go deep into that but keep it for next time when we have more content there but there we are writing together with anish um on the first two and with uh marina lawrence and others on decentralizing organization and basically all of token engineering commons is a living um um and breathing experiment that is currently being undertaken so there will be a lot of insights there legal engineering by sni uh she's having fun with all of the insights these design legal design and basically weaving that aspect into the token model generation from the start is one um topic of uh interest and i hope that you know that the epilogue will open up you know a portal to a new dimension for many of you like it did for me it's an interface to moral philosophy for token engineers it's like when we become algorithmic policy makers are the legitimate and how do we make the trade-offs you know it's not just budget and time we have to look into we are creating participatory token economies so how do we go about that and that part deals with a lot of uh soul searching but it's still super practical um as you see i could talk about this book i just love it for the entire half hour i will not do uh just an overview like the breadth of each chapter um okay tokumoto generation is the biggest and it's been one where we have you know tools that we look into like computer edit design cad cad and token spice um have links have tutorials ecosystem design is something we created during the past year uh it really moves uh people from uh these typical canvases what you know the business side is rather rather used to into you know design thinking slash systems thinking and moves you to how do you actually define that for um specification of computer simulations so it's pretty neat okay i will stop right there um because i want to go into how do you go about you know coordination of content of the funding of the sourcing of content decoration and the publishing in a decentralized way um well you know it doesn't start with an anonymous crowd obviously never it's really people um who went through the course even meaning inside the book those people were the ones who were around you know since the beginning of token engineering community and those are the people who are actually contributing and i am curating this initial first edition but definitely there is uh you know when we want to scale we have space for token and curation then the crowdfunding part of it is that git current grants just came around uh at the right time and we're currently running our fourth round so uh make sure to check it out the hitchhiker's guide to token engineering on bitcoin and that definitely will help with um all of them um open sourcing and and maintaining of those parts and also you know involving the bigger crowd not just the community who sources the initial contents etc and um definitely also see there that we can scale with a bonded token which we of course are going to call towel that's the most important token an interstellar hitchhiker can have um yes and the community sourcing part again it started uh as an initial gift economy and i think this is how how it is because we the contributors the initial ones are really driven by the intrinsic motivation to learn and to share to learn with the others so uh that works out fine and basically one can see then when the content comes together how we can go actually do special editions sponsored editions uh you know opening up to translations etc which is basically which has been proven to work already by others um but here again as i mentioned uh you know with all of the nifty systems coming up and and showing viability um we realized that web3 publishing house is a reality and we should really just go for it so we dig a bit deeper into the publishing process um again the principle is the creator coordinates um attribution content import quality checks um is manual because we said you know at the beginning i wanted to you know standardize everything but that's not how creative uh you know and then writing works so now everyone is doing their own thing most of them are writing in google docs yeah and uh for example i am all over the place like mirrorboard and so on and so forth so uh one um coordination piece is really getting that information and putting it into evergreen notes uh in in the open source repository and then from that basically from the content there and the design can also be there um we definitely see that the tracking of attributions is is not a problem at all you know google docs has history um get up get get celebrate uh has history so every contribution uh gets their attributions definitely but uh when we talked uh with tanner actually and and their design how they want to actually enable this creative economy with pictosis it's all about the attribution of of creation and remix of content etc no matter which media they are basically absolutely bullish that this can be done in an elegant way without us having to actually you know pull right now manually uh data and and metadata from everywhere but actually have this nicely you know reflected in their process so the attribution will go to lead authors cause there is contributors in what form ever and the editors and curators um basically all of their you know um everyone is leaving a trace in in a book chapter so that's nice part of it the designers that's definitely something as you saw hitchhikers get a definite style uh at least this edition will keep that style and also the developers uh be it you know just on on pictosis the ones that actually create those nifty policies um that determine how we uh you know accomplished the royalty sharing etc um they will be also part of the attribution of this creation of the digital book and basically anyone who is involved in the distribution of it literally from the the first uh words to actually getting that into the hands of people in whatever format um and then you know in grayed out we said okay forget amazon this is so exciting you know it doesn't matter what if you don't get any revenues at all or if it just costs us we don't care we want to have this webs republishing uh and uh basically um you know we even thought we we will have to fund peak doses as well but right now as you can imagine they don't uh really need help with such a great idea of supporting creative economy with a nifty system and that is pretty smart um but yeah we were like you know the token model if you look at it it doesn't make sense at all that all of a sudden 60 of the revenues that you actually want to flow back to all of the creators and contributors get stuck in amazon just because they give you an ispn number which is absolutely uh how do you call it obsolete um and then the fact that amazon has over 70 market share in ebooks and 64 in print sales and we're literally writing a book about you know creating economist that will distribute value much better than that it was like i had to listen to jeff and you know don't live a life full of regrets don't do that so we said amazon is over we are not doing it and uh web 3 publishing it is and as i mentioned then bozom protocol came around the corner and it's actually amazing how they create through their system with commitment tokens basically uh with an embedded game theoretic approach that this whole um keeping promises of okay i'm going to you know i'm going to take the distribution um grant of hundreds uh 100 of these hitchhikers and i want to distribute them here munich my network so i'm going to uh give that promise and the commitment token and the game theoretic approach actually takes care that you know someone who says i'm going to take the local distribution of this book actually delivers a good print of a physical book and actually sells them or gives them and brings them to the person who says i want to have a copy of this book in munich into their hands and you can imagine this can be literally um distribute this whole amazon or demand on print process so again this is the newest part and it's still in the future um but still let's look at it and as you can also imagine when we started this meta game was just starting in april june and it was just coincidence we had the same style and i just love meta fam and although i don't show up often because i got sucked away into uh these projects but i really look forward to the day when we have a meta factory storefront for uh the digital version of the book and as you can see like the digital site will grow you can you can already see what can be done with the content we have um we have the open source repository with the evergreen nodes the design and so on and so forth but then other format creators can come in and create digital media like podcasts courses webinars based on the content of the book and we did the courses with the academy for example and works like a charm and distributing that through people who can actually provide those contents um formats etc is super exciting any form of media designers uh look forward to to uh you know drawing them into a hitchhiker's um publishing as well and uh yeah and the digital um attribution and royalty streams uh seems like a problem that can be tackled uh right now and as you can see basically then the business as usual part of publishing all of a sudden seems so you know handleable like we need to get them um these rights of distribution to distributors and basically have them you know keep their promise to print that book and put them on any shelves they find or give them into the hands of the readers you know in maybe local meetups etc whenever that starts happening again and in the meantime we can have fun in the meta worlds basically um um yeah so again when i look at this i see that there is a lot more things that can be done with content with knowledge sharing on the digits on the digital side um yeah and basically all of a sudden this um you know selling a book a physical book which currently is the actual revenue generating part of or selling a book or publishing a book all of a sudden seems something that could you know become less and less over time and when you see uh i will also also share the slides there are some good links to some numbers as well you see that over the years actually it has started to to the digital publishing and digital content and media started to actually especially in the publishing started to eat up a little bit of amazon a little bit but i guess uh something like this um a crypto native distribution channel coupled with this digital nifty system of something like pictosis this could be of course fantastic um i am not being interrupted so i guess there are no no questions um so i can maybe just give you an overview where we are at now um yes so basically uh first of all content first community first like i care about the people who write the chapters uh at first and and then basically everyone who who can help actually create this infrastructure that we need to to scale and and make this book you know float from in the metaphors and from the metaverse to the universe um yes we have a new slit letter if you want to uh you know um keep up with anything that's upcoming uh do subscribe which is co-owned by the chapter leads uh we're organizing an outreach series uh you know with techies and kind of good writers but a bad at pr so uh feel welcome if you have have a hang and like this knowledge sharing and the the way we're doing it uh make sure to to ping me i think there are a lot of crowds uh pr or even community pr where you know small families still the the token engineers and token practitioners um there is definitely a pr opportunity i would love to chat and um i said thanks to git coin um there is um yeah there is a nice amount that uh with which i definitely see that we can keep uh the repository up started get the evergreen nodes from the initial drafts into it and get into this crowd sourcing mode even and have maintenance and have a source cred instance that we have um people from token engineering commons who are supporting with mateo and santi so and if you are you know more into into that and are curious and want to know how to get involved in this right now definitely click on these links and asset you know towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar token engineering hitchhiker can have we started about a year ago and and um yeah not quite and then right now it feels like by the time we reach the year we will be able to have this you know attribution tracking this decentralized uh system that actually takes care of creation of knowledge and putting it into different formats and getting it out out there into the hands of people who who want that knowledge so all right thank you thank you that was super interesting such an interesting moment in publishing right now thanks so much for that um quick question um what's the best way to reach you because you mentioned ways people can get in contact can they reach you through the boson protocol sponsor channel or do you have a twitter or what's your preferred way yeah so twitter is okay token engineering commons is the way if especially you're coming with uh i want to know more about token engineering and this book and basically bozom protocol and we have uh people from the team actually at the hackathon and active you can also ping them and they will be able to bring us all together if you are particularly interested in making this book float in the physical universe that's great that's awesome um so if there aren't any questions at the moment you can contact um the whole boson protocol team in the nft hack discord channel they have their own channel but that thank you thank you so much for the presentation everybody enjoy your saturday day morning evening night wherever you are and we'll be in touch have fun
