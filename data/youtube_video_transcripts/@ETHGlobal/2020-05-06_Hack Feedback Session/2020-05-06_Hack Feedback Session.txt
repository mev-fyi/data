Oh lotta a lot of camera faces this is great typically people uh people like to hide I mean I know I do when I can hide behind my camera protector three people turned off cameras inside well don't let me scare you guys all right Liam's here great all right so I've got a short intro and then we can we can jump into it's it's gonna be a little confusing just because we're gonna be moving people back and forth between rooms but we'll keep everybody here for the so welcome first of all everybody it's about one and a half weeks yeah Austin's got the right idea punch the air welcome everybody to the hack the first head hack feedback session we're likely gonna have several of these time permitting in the future just so we can get people in the cadence of presenting their idea and framing the projects but this is the first one so apologies if it's a little just a little disjointed we're still figuring out what the best format is and how we can best give feedback to hackers in their projects so like I said it's it's we're halfway through week two people have been kind of settling into their teams we have over a hundred and eighty teams which is pretty amazing for where we're floored by the number of people that have showed up for this again and what you may have noticed is that we've organized you into cohorts if you check the discord you'll see that there's another channel that you've been added in with a bunch of teams boards are usually around 20 ish teams so you're with a bunch of people and that's where we're gonna be doing check-ins from now on so if you haven't done your your week to check in please make sure to go to that channel and drop a same as we did the first week just drop a little summary about where your projects at what you're thinking about any sponsors you're thinking of integrating stuff like that and it was pretty like I said it was previously done through DMS but now we're switching just it's a little easier for us to manage so about the hack feedback session so it's still early but hopefully by now you've picked an idea to settle on and you either started building it with your team or if you're if you're on your own you've sort of you have a clear strategy on how you're going to be doing this if you are integrating a sponsor you're always your best bet is to just go directly to their channels and and ask them there they're pretty responsive and they're very happy to help people integrate stuff for this event we're going to be having just five minutes lots given given the amount of people that have showed up in the future it might be a little bit longer but we're going to keep it short and remember that the intent is to again just like gate make sure you're expressing your idea clearly have some time to make sure you give your name the name of your project what your general intent is any sponsors you want to integrate stuff like that and and the other thing to consider is that this might not be a super deep technical review like we're not going to be doing excuse me we're not gonna be doing code reviews and things like that on this session that that might be better served in the discord or one on one with a mentor but we will be just giving a general assessment of where your project isn't giving you some time to talk about your ideas with other people all right that's my spiel any questions from anybody before we jump into it no questions alright so to start let's let's consult our list I believe Everett said that he's unable to join he was first let's see if we can we can add some breakout rooms why don't we start with so the next person on list is Jeff Bennett Jeff are you here yeah you are awesome so you're gonna present my d5 pie I'm gonna let you take it away if you have a screen share that's fine you can you can start with that but if you just want to talk for a bully go ahead and I'm gonna try to add some breakout rooms and then we can sort of split people off into different things so go ahead and so but before that so let me just get a quick assessment of the mentors we have Alex Austin Franco who else Liam Liam from Heath global [Music] okay let me know let me know if I miss any mentor so just feel free to briefly to give a wave and say hi Jeff go ahead we have five minutes all right yeah just introduce the idea so I mean finance I've always been interested in these innovative products and a company has a thing that just optimized personalized portfolios do you tell it which you care about which rejected czar and then it will rank and create optimized portfolio for you so but of course there's no crypto but we have a theme here is hos ability we have all the tools we can wrap physical gold with back so it's a noble task that's what do my and Ito kids let's you wrap Nani theory and block chains and tokens you can swap things one basket of coins for others and then of course that balancer has the portfolio mechanism itself so what I'm trying to create here is something like PI Dow which I didn't know about until I started this pide I'll let you do a similar thing but it's covered by a Dow you have to pick the pies are accreted by the by the down so this is like PI down - the Dow part but it's also hyper individualized something like m1 finance that lets you pick pies and compose them into portfolios in a traditional world you can also copy successful portfolios and triggers like it like eToro and then putting on the budget so that's what their general ideas so I let me try to share that is that coming through yep I see if my chart yep just showing the other windows - I'll see okay yeah so so yes like I said it's like this Plus this Plus this plus a lot of inches on chain analytics and things too so you can first you could do settings so you can my company happens to do ESG cuz that's a trend in the industry so he could biosocial governments you can tell it you know I care a lot about the environment and you know not about social at all and a little bit about governance right and then this is what simple maybe you also could do your risk tolerance both potential you can give it which okay which kind of quickly you want to focus on what stable coins want to use right and then you can also look at so there's different portfolio some other people are conservative might be different allocations other people have done let me let me go back to this though so basically you have you can have physical gold which is got which goes to Paxos you can have which cryptos you want and then you can begin adjust your how much you wanted each one and it uses wrapped Bitcoin for this and then the cash a stable coins you can see which proportion you want and then also you have traditional stocks so you can say stocks or ETFs and these are ranked according to all the this is real data this is right according to preferences in here and you can add and delete things and update your allocation there and then yeah it also picks them you can pick your collateral okay so it's gonna use the Ummah synthetic for the if you have equities that we use that otherwise in the cash is the stable coins crypto uses these and gold is taxes and then you can test it tests it so you can go to the back test and well first and this will show because it's kind of a weird thing to daily rebalance nobody does that in traditional finance so this tells you what that would have done over the year and also the volatility like how much ahead so luckily we had this little debacle here this was kind of a test to make sure it was working you know when the price is very volatile it has to do a lot of work to rebalance and it also it also just gives you the standard returns which is the regular return if you didn't rebalance and then so you can see you know the proportions of what each thing is and then when you're ready you can say okay I want to make a pull from this 5,000 create this and it's gonna go oh it also it figures out if your address is E&S and which means that it's gonna go to your that your wallet and figure out what Shogun's you have and then you can and who knows what kind of random airdrops you have like like this thing so you can say I only want to use these and then you calculate and yeah it's gonna figure out how to get from what you have to where you want to go all right that is five minutes looks like Liam Liam had a question who classifies all these assets is it just done on your end I mean they're traditional ones just not you yeah you and I think you ESG read this environmental social thing like a Yunus yes because that's arbitrary it's what I happen to have because that's what this company does so that's the data I happen to have a picture it's it doesn't yeah it's it's in the setting and the settings you can say so whatever data you had whatever data provider you wanted to use you would do whatever you can do here so I also we're also merging with an infinite bait which does a lot of more of this kind of like standard beta alpha stuff and and then of course I could do this I don't want to go too far down this because I need to have I need to do the Unchained stuff but I wanted to make this worse they are launching by coming are you just mock doubters is actually dating like local contracts and gonna ask you something well I'm using the the only way I can do it with large token balances I went down a little bit of a rabbit hole trying to do it on a private chain first and it didn't really work and now III I'm working on a builder and forking the chain with ganache because that's the only way I can get large balances of tokens which I need for this alright see you need that yeah I know a guy who's working on a system to like take a snapshot of only defy stuff on maintenance and then regularly provide an API that you can sync your local ganache to so it's like you just are can - and like sync define it runs in like a second because there's only a subset of the entire chain why don't you do that guy in the chat ok it's still trouble so the idea is - yeah I've done some work with the uma and there you can also see some of the things that we do I need for that so basically the I wanted to frame it I wanted this is the sort of easy I wanted to do the entire the entire off chain app is is implemented in the data feed comes from my company so that's all done but now it's kind of the hard harder part of I need to have some actual dinosaurs on the dinosaur tour here so I do have some start with uma and I and the idea is to have a balancer which is not finalized so that you could so when you have your when you create the and this this is this doesn't go to the real wallet either yet but it is in JavaScript like it is everything is a Jeff yeah yeah no we're just gonna have to keep keep moving along I think Liam will connect you with one of the persons yeah yeah Jeff the end me on I'm kind of trying to find that people DM me on discord or just like Matt mentioned me somewhere and I can't use do that and then also like I seemed like visit it seemed like in general like there's some technical of next steps for this like just integrating it correctly it's such that this is like testable like I'd love to be able to again this like I'm Robson for example like for real and I can help with that also okay yeah my conflict was I didn't know how to get large balances of tokens to actually do it mmm-hmm yeah I'm saying no guy who's literally one of his project like his project is to make any guy for that that exact these case okay great alright awesome so it looks like I'm mistaken I don't think we have breakout rooms enabled for this so [Music] correct me if I'm wrong anyone from youth global I don't I don't think we have it enabled unfortunately so what I'm going to we're gonna do an audible on the field and I'm going to ask Andrew can you for a second yep yeah would you mind dropping and starting another zoom call and then just DME the link and I will drop it in the chat and maybe we could have a few mentors and I'll send people there sure how's that say yep oh I made a do same let's see let's keep Liam and yeah yeah why don't take abuse Andrew and he will drop the link will keep Liam and Alex Alex how's it going man let's see what other mentors we've got here cause you wanna make a third group but maybe I'll simple that's nice wondering you want should we just throw another zoom Lincoln and just take yeah third faction off yeah yeah I guess we could just presume Lee Austin the MVP will do alright um so let's let's have the next person start where we at Julia are you are you ready to go hey yes I am awesome cool hi everyone I am Julia and I'm an engineer based in San Francisco California so what I'm working on is a wallet that earns you interest basically and kind of the main goals behind all this there are many one of them is I want to make it more intuitive for folks around the world who want to own assets that let them hedge for example currency depreciation and their local currencies so especially during kovat my friends who live outside the United States in some developing countries have expressed concern about currency depreciation and so we also see a lot of people for example going after gold and so it's a time when people are thinking a lot about owning assets that maybe aren't just like cash in their local currencies and then another goal that I have is to work on the UX in just overall well-trained apps but also the onboarding flow so your ability to use adapt or acquire different kinds of assets today you kind of need meta masks or an existing wallet but we have more and more tools to make that easier so I started implementing over the last couple days so my demo will be fairly short but let me share my screen click alright cool so this is working with a compound and and the content that we're displaying here is it's a wallet everything is running on my local test net but pointing to the compound contract and so this is how much I haven't eat test e and then how much I've supplied to compound so far what that means in terms of C E and so with the compound protocol my C tokens will continue to earn interest and grow in value so so far I just use eat as an asset but as many of us know there are lots of options to play around with but to quickly share with you how that would work I could decide how much I want to supply so say I want to supply two more let that finish so I have almost three eats applied to compound my wallet balance is updated my C tokens are updated and I can also see that at the current exchange rate how much my C eat or C tokens can be redeemed if I were to redeem right now what I also want to show is the exact APR that you're earning so you can get a very easy very quick view of of that return on investment so I can also redeem right now you would redeem everything I'm seeing an error in my terminal right now so I'm just gonna restart my connection real quick okay let's try that again so we will supply again let's see let's try I'm a quick question we're going to this what's like the like I use this thing called staked personal like sticking I guess what's like what do most people do right now like if the goal is to get more people to use this web interface that's web wallet what are most people do now extent to be using compound and why would they choose this over that yeah so one that's a great question one idea is that the onboarding you would be able to fund a built-in wallet I was thinking of using Portus as like a built-in non-custodial wallet that you could fund would say a debit card or your bank account and we do have some projects that are working on that already however they're all fairly new and I also want this to be very international friendly and so you would be able to ideally fund this with like an international and debit card or bank account let's try it redeeming again okay so that's that's kind of like providing a Dharma lights you are correct yeah so I've redeemed and so now if i refresh the page then my eat is zeroed out and my wallet balances back and liam to your point I was very much inspired by Dharma I think that there are some so even with compound there's some more experimenting that we could do here so maybe not just not just eat right different types of assets they just announced support for us DT for example we could work with die and besides that there's also other protocols that we could play around with as sort of like an integrated fool and yeah one like a tiny piece of feedback that as anyone else can get feedback if they want I'm just kind of putting in but one thing for me like like I mentioned I use this thing called state like for like a web interface like put some crypto in and hope it gets we're like I haven't ordered their contract I think they actually give me something called ray token that I don't understand at all if like one property I would want out of a thing like this is the ability to very quickly verify that this website is not somehow I'm going to screw me over without having to trust some brand right or reason I use Dharma is because like I trust Dharma I trust in the dog like I don't even if I don't look at a code I don't know what they're doing they probably have access to it like it's fine but if I'm using something like this which is like some open source or maybe just like a landing page a spot with no company behind it necessarily I'd want to be able to like within five minutes get some kind of confidence that this thing is not going to lose my money so I don't know what that exactly translates into but that might mean like is the code open-source is the code is the actual literal code that's implemented they're so small that I could literally read it myself if I wanted to like that kind of thing because if it had that property I can see myself and a lot of other people just making it their go-to staking UI or lending UI nobody looks at that stuff anyways though right isn't it really marketing it's what's gonna make people feel good yeah in general in general yeah that's my point like about if a company's but I I don't know how to pretend you lose intention maybe you can talk about that but if if it's like if this is gonna be like a my ether wallet or something that the brand is not as established or it's not as a company behind it necessarily but it's just on the internet then people won't use it unless there is an easy way to get that trust and I'm just saying it's the if the actual view showed like that some way that I can get confidence about it then I think it would be good it just depends of the audiences is the audience everybody in the world there's the audience like people that have money to put in a crypto but don't really want to have to use some service which may be taking a fee yeah yes the audience would be more mainstream users but even for those people Trust is very important and so I think you bring up a really good point if it's not it could be a in source code some people who ya are more familiar with everything can can look at that but I do have to think about for the mainstream user how to communicate that worker yeah do you think if any anything's like UI approaches or anything specifically tailored for an international users you said you wanted to keep in mind so for international users I was thinking this would have to be more targeted rollout maybe focus on region first I don't know maybe Latin America or yeah like you focus on region and then think about kind of what their concerns are um one of them might be okay my currency is depreciating value against the dollar and so you know I want to invest in some assets that could expose me to that same stability as a dollar for example and that would go a lot into the marketing message but also yeah the overall like I don't know if it would be through ads or through some other type of communication but I would have to think about a rollout strategy yeah did you have any thoughts around that hmm I mean I'm that target demographic so it was just curious because there there a recent that much that's Taylor which is curious no no specific thoughts you may be able to find some cheap ad placements in places like Africa or some mark basically skip the whole laptop in PC generation and went straight to mobile all right I'm calling it Thank You Julia I'm sorry just in general for just which we're figuring this out as we build the machine so looks like five minutes might be a little too short for teams but we're gonna try and we're gonna try and get as many people to present as possible so like I said before Austin Griffith has started another room you scroll up in the chat you should be able to find it I think they have like four teams there now and we just had Sina join welcome welcome yo thanks again good I think what we might do is put you in a room with Andrew and then we might direct some hackers to you and then they'll present directly to you that sounds alright sounds great let's do it alright so just before I I send you off um let's see who's next we just said Julia percent Thank You Julia next up was hey soos Perez are you still with us or did you go to the other room let's see I don't think I saw his name okay he might be in the other room so we're gonna move on to Drago's team do t see are you still here hey yeah yeah perfect alright take it away man sure so hello everyone I'm Josh I'm a student and I'm trying to build decentralized peer-to-peer loans and how DC derivatives markets for knowing fungible tokens so the main idea is to have a way to get loans for your non fundable tokens as collateral and I had just started building I don't have much progress yet because I had some time constraint but I started building the front end and a next step would be to have an OTC derivatives to have over-the-counter derivatives are using non fungible tokens as collateral as well and I'm still researching how I could do that so let me show you as I said I haven't done much it's just the front page that I built until now but the idea is for anyone to get peer-to-peer loans using the 100 tokens as that as collateral so for example you could have ENS names as collateral or any other enemies basically and that would be a first step and next I would like to look into over-the-counter derivatives so yeah that's all I have basically you know what are you going to use right go ahead alright what are you going to use as the Oracle for EFT so are you going to price them to know how much they're worth as collateral yeah sure that's a good question so my thought behind that would be that being an open peer-to-peer market people could do their own pricing and agreeing on the pricing so you could create a new order and price let's say have your collateral and ask for a certain loan and people could agree on the terms basically BT providers will end up yes like approving the price of the colostrum all right yes so how would you actually handle liquidations like would you essentially need to have like the liquidity provider by the end of t like during a liquidation process or would there need to be a source of liquidity for this entity yeah how you'd handle that so could you please explain a bit more about the liquidation so if let's say someone defaults on their loan you mean okay then if someone defaults on the loan you can think for a girl you get the NFP thing okay so that makes sense I was gonna ask one thing yeah he mentions outstanding you earlier you mentioned that you wanted to follow some common financial standards in the regular world I guess you talked a bit about that yeah sure so at the first step as I said I was thinking of having loans for an MP's and then I was also thinking about having derivatives like options and futures maybe using again entities as collateral and I found common domain model by ISTA they are typically regulated normal financial market and I was trying to follow their approach to building those derivatives but the first step would be to get get it working for loans first so like rather than it being like an automated system where you can get loans it's more like a marketplace where like lenders can underwrite you for n n of T and give you a loan and then they keep the NFT but so it's not like it's not like compound where you can just you know automatically get it's more like a marketplace right yes exactly it's not it's not like compound you can't get the loan instantly you need to have someone to thank you the tokens or just lend you eat for example for your NF t basically because the T you have onion s name that you want to that you still want to keep but you need some liquidity and you don't want to sell it and then get it back you just get that liquidity for your very special ENS name for example um one thing that sounds to me like in the implementation detail might be an issue is that how do you ensure that when they give you something as collateral that it is like I guess is it expected that that nft has any sort of use for the person that's taking it on as collateral I guess I guess so so my idea would be that it would be transparent what kind of entity and if you get so if you want to offer that person alone using that an empty as collateral that means you are interested in that and you would use that it would be good for you even if they default to get that energy right okay so it's okay I don't mind just not you know actually yeah there's no way that there's no way to actually provide them any sort of usage of it it just like it's locked and you might yes like transfer depending on the outcome of the loan I guess that's my idea so far yep all right Drago's thank you sorry - sorry to cut off the discussion but again if there's any questions definitely keep it going in in the discord this first sessions just cement like a tea your general idea out there and get you used to presenting but awesome this is good stuff let me just consult the list again any just as a reminder we have two other rooms set up the the links we have Austin and Jacob in one of them and then Cena and Andrew in another so if if you would like to jump ahead now I'm hopefully we don't have everybody leave this room and then go to the other ones and then the lines the lines keep shifting but we'll see how it goes the links should be in the chat somewhere but we're making good progress so our pit for with defy dollar are you in this room still yeah yeah I'm right here yeah so let me just show MSP can you guys see it yep okay so we don't have a UI as yet because we had been working on the spud contracts so I wanted to put across the idea that we are trying to build and then get the feedback from mentors and fellow hackers so that would be nice right so we are building defied order and that aims to bring stability to stable coins right so that issues with the current stable coins and I would like to discuss them briefly so volatility so stable coins are volatile because of you know the peg is one dollar but what really grow and surprise is the supply and the demand so often you would see that the demand for dye is quite high or sometimes it's low so basically they don't really put the peg similarly for another stable coin another recently stable coin called s USD right and then with the centralized stable coins like USD to each other or USD C there is a custodian risk which is you know like banks might ask banks might seize all their assets or they might ask them to close their operations so there are always these ongoing discussions about you know which coin do you think is the least safe and so this is an issue with centralized point and then yeah with coins like die there is extensive governance so quite often you would see governance polls happening on Twitter and then people have to keep interesting the stability fee adding new collateral and things like that so what we are trying to make as a stable coin which is governance minimized and also really stable so what is defied order so yeah in short defy dollar is a stable coin and how it works is it is an attempt at being an index of current stable coins like Dai s USD Q SEC and that gives us the motives to stay near the door llama and subsidize the collateralization virtually so how it works is so we have a user so what they do is because the $5 is an index of stable constant so for example let's just take two assets for now so user deposits hundred US DC and hundred dives in the smart contract so this scroll looking thing is that defied all a smart contract right and what that does is it puts the coin coins in avi and then our V returns the a tokens equivalent of the coins so these coins with like a little have a logo in them are the RB version of those coins so the smart contracts get that gets that and then it puts those are bitcoins in a balancer pool right so right now the balancer pool has 100 USD c100 have a USD sees and hundred hundred he dives right and then there are two ways by which the smart contract is receiving fees so one is the interest from avec and another is so basically this balance of pool is like a curve dot Phi poon it's meant to be for stable for efficient swap or stable coins right and if you just do that there will be some fading fee by you you just would do that I'll discuss that shortly right but assuming that they are using this balance of pool to like swap between stable coins so then there will be some fading fee and then there will be some interest so all those income from these two income streams are being directed to the smart contractor right so now what happens this isn't that the price fluctuates so let's say let's say you as you get C goes to 0.9 and I goes to 0 1.1 these are obviously hypothetical values so now what happens is because that is more valuable as compared to us DC now right but in the balance of pool right here the ratio was 1 is to 1 so balance of whose C use and automated market market making function to determine how much coin is worth relative to another coin right so in the original pool the ratio is 1 is to 1 so when the place fluctuates it opens up an arbitrage opportunity which means if you give 0.9 worth of the USD see now this is 1 USD see you get one day which is one point one dollar so there's a profit to be made there right so arbitrage arbitrage will try to arbitrage this and what would end up having is the coin that is less valuable they will be more in number in the pool right because people are people sent in USD C which was cheaper to get that which was more expensive and I will be less and number in the pool but what happens because of that is so these are hypothetical values but something like zero hundred twelve us he sees then once we buy it by 0.9 will give you hundred dollars again and died which was at one point one but because there are only 91 coins of that in the pool that was two hundred dollars all right so $35 originally I think I forgot to mention that so so when you send in one hundred of each you get two hundred defied orders so yeah because there's a one dollar bank so now what happens is because individual pools are at hundred dollars again so two hundred defy dollars are at one dollar again right even though the pools that are backing them have moved and they will move because there is an arbitrage opportunity if there is a fluctuation but now there's a more interesting case like let's say both of the coins are going below the one dollar mark so if one was going above and one was going below the dollar mark it's more straightforward right because you can simply remove the coin which is more valuable and add the coin which is less valid but in this case let's say both of these coins are going below that dilemma so what really happens so because I is still more valuable than you ACC arbitrage will still make a profit out of this so let's say the pool ends up with hundred and six of us DC and then 99.5 dive which is okay right but then overall if you see the pool value has dropped from hundred dollars each and that is very natural because both of these coins have fallen right so now there's a second rebalancing mechanism and that is using an order P so periodically after the arbitrage are arbitrage people are done advertising and then balancing the pool to a certain extent Oh an Oracle like chain link which is the prices to the be $5 smartphone and it says that the price outside is 0.97 0.98 right and then what happens is so I mentioned that there are two income sources for the defied order which was from the trade from the balance of Google and other was from Ave right so changing tell set the prices and then now the smart contract knows that USD seafood was at ninety seven point five right so it needs to complete the deficit of two point five dollars so two point five dollars divided by zero point nine seven gives you two point five seven coins so because the smart contract is holding extra coins from the income it transfers that to the pool and similarly for time so a deficit of two point five dollars and divided by the die price which is 0.98 it's two point five five and those coins are transferred to the pool and that's how the pools are balanced again by hundred five hundred dollars each so again because there were two hundred defied orders and the pool is hundred dollars each again so diff i dollar stays at one yeah that's that that's what we're working on well thank you Arpit any feedback or general thoughts from people yeah i think like it's like a really interesting idea i think the thing that would be interesting to see is some kind of analysis of like i would like what how much pressures required for us to break down like it seems like it relies on having these fees and the interest from ave like how much does it rely on those things like at what what level of volatility does you know visit physically eat up all of the funds that it's stored and how much gain what were those funds is interesting like doing like some kind of analysis on but uh from from my like layman standpoint seems like a really cool idea to use these I was trying to yeah it's fine to run numbers so if you think about it like I don't think I fell to it's more than three percent like no but let let's say the value is five percent so let's say I'm expecting five percent fluctuation right so you need the backing pool of five percent to be there which kind of takes like kind of takes like an year to complete because unlearning protocols are giving like three to four percent per year so it's like after in here I would expect the coin to be fully stable so but but of course if there is more liquidity then it would need some more time to you know have the backing pool right so that is one thing yeah but yeah that is something that but in the worst case like even if there is not a backing pool so it simply the agreat stripping rating backs of stable coins which is like a damn stable of index funds so I would say it's still better than oh they need a stable going there are some good questions in the zoom chair also yeah looks like question from Mick and inside unfortunately we're gonna we're gonna move on to the next presenter just so we can keep the ball rolling and get as many people as possible yeah we should um make sure you like to go to the go to the showcase channel on discord yeah just like we can we can kind of keep the discussion going there and other people have questions you can also like we can keep it going in there session yeah and anybody who's made slides feel her to drop your slides in in just in any discussions because that'll be helpful for people understanding but yeah I definitely Mick and psy if you have additional questions he goes up in the chat okay thank you our pit thank you next up little Batali Paris and numerous are you here know hopefully he's Joe in the other room harsh epns hey there is awesome take it away awesome thanks Trent I all I am harsh I'm working on a system called the DNS which is a Canadian push notification system I'm working on this but my team members basically that's me and Little John she she's over here okay so let me start with what push notification system is it simply but it allows you to it allows dad's or smartphone racks to send push notifications to mobile device cells of the wallet owners who access great to those natural smart contract the way we have envisioned it to work is by beings of a smart contract interacting with the DA to store and broadcast a message the story has done true like the FS and to receive the message we are relying on server dock PP NS push notification server which will listen to the events generated by the respond contracts and then basically do some magic to allow that push notifications to be tell about to the user so they are around four modules which we had to work on so we just picked up the mobile module first and try to complete it it's almost done so hopefully I can show it to you are you guys able to see my device yeah oh great so by the way the hub push notifications they were working in a bonding but this is just a screenshot right now the Google notification server is in sending push notifications and we haven't finished our server implementation yet but yeah let's go to epns mobile app so you have your basic security feature and then you know I had already connected my wallet so you know it just deletes my wallet at dancing and it's name I know it's a I have my profile I can go to half the fields are basically what will come in the hello would we have finished the intern boarding courses so I'll just show you how easy it is right now this is a full screen double disease and open the APNs wallet the next step is signing in with the private key so right now we have two options one is the same thing the private key the other is just scanning data so as soon as it scans up the Apple basically asked for a security code the security code is used to encrypt this private key and stored it on the app the school the security coded service converted to sha-256 so that you know each of the things I restore stored securely okay so that's it after that you know this one more screen which is an app and skip the course I have already allowed push notifications but basically that's it once you do that you'll log in screening with okay just writing I stood the passcode s1 awesome so yeah that so that's the C in part basically the ball that is connected so the device tokens are generated whatever device tokens are generated on the device it is encrypted and uploaded to the server the server will decrypt star of all the tokens verify if it's coming it's just if it's coming from the intended wallet address if it is it stores the wallet and the wallet tokens on one-to-many ma feet and then self push notification is generated under server in verifies the bollocks which I subscribe to a app on a group and then the server talks to this service that converts those wallets to device jockey and sends the payload the promoter can be encrypted and unencrypted in case of interruption it will only work for a single user so let's say if I wanted to send a notification that you don't is getting liquidated for a wallet address they can send them they just have to interact with the DA the DA or interrupts 9 time as it split the users public key of the wallet and then the app receives that and uses the gives us by the key to decrypt a message so that's nuts again is in short I also wanted to talk about that in theory so we talked a lot about via put the users subscribe to the app on this group and how to make sure that there are proper checks and balances when it comes to a pony tropes and when it comes to users so what we came up with again purity but made sure that everyone is properly verified and everyone kinda has an incentive to find the speed in the system and you know to make sure the system works to start with you know the dapper or the smart contract allows you to be an app owner but in order for you to be an app America state 50 or a higher amount of that now that 50 or higher amount of time that basically goes to pave or it could also go to compound and you know interests getting generated on it so that is a way for the app owner to prove that you know they are interested and they're serious players in once that happens they are given up on the receivers and they are given out upon dry throat no module now let them so let us come to the useless part so of course the user has incentive to subscribe to push notification but you wanted to provide additional incentive to the users and that we do in terms of dankest which is getting going by this icon as and Davi so if a user subscribes to an app on a group basically the number of these they have been subscribed to they will earn that much interest on our owners principle amount the app owner can also you know destroy that group and if they do you know all of their principle diocese returned except for a small fee of 10 die which is you know taken back as maintenance and to further ensure that the app on those I see this players in the market so basically this version I'm gonna pause you for one second because it's right at 11:00 if anybody has dropped thank you for joining we're gonna keep going for a little bit Liam are you you're still good yeah good Franco if you can stay on then be awesome yeah a bit longer yeah yeah if you have to drop feel free to just jump in and say bye everybody that's not a problem and then the other mentors that might be in this room again same thing if you have to drop that's fine just just give us a wave or say bye in the chat does anybody have any any questions or comments and harsh yeah I want um like this seems like really nice and really polished and like I think that's great the one thing that kind of like the only question I have is like ha what's like the what do you think is gonna be the first use case or what do you think skin what is a really good use case that could get people like myself for a PE people on this chat even to start using this like frequently like what what's the what do you thinks the most exciting the sexiest use case kind of thing okay so III didn't know actually that's fishy I think of several new faces I don't think sexiest I can define them as sexiest but yeah let's say let's say you have taken our own from our V and it's getting liquidated of course you know one bears that you don't into our dashboard and you'd said that your mom is getting liquidated but the the seventh is something that you should really want to be notified of in Sinking so that's an use case so the other use case is let's say you're launching your own cryptocurrency token of course most of that dependency tokens they are taking your emails and they're sending notifications over there as to when the event is happening or than the launch is coming or any other important event document so you know that can be totally offloaded to PDMS then you know that interesting new skis I was thinking about the V I have designed the P Lord over here it's not just a push notifications I need my deserve type one and go for push notifications but you know let's say there's a type three push notification or just type three notification now this notification is basically this adjacent payload of all the addresses which has to be blacklisted or no whatever reasons you know they could be they could belong to hackers their stolen phones and whatever now perfect scenes can come together and form a trusted upon the source and this upon the source and you know send this payload out to the NS server which will in turn be broadcasted and of course everything it's also stored in the smart contract but so the Xing this can also listen to it so you know just like how that if I had happened later than 25 million if I was taken Ali 25 million dollars were taken away so whenever that sort of thing happens it's very slow and manual process at least in my head it is that you know people will first find out that the heart has taken place then they will approach exchanges or interested owners and you see that you know put a lock on both points and you know once those exchanges respond to the security concern only then they are able to lock that properly Pollitz but because this service will be all automated and it's all on smart contract of very nice use scales would be you know this rusted upon their way then all these exchanges are subscribed to it can instantly send a notification that you know this side versus one from extent one process so the payment and you know that can happen as well I have a question harsh yeah so do you see this as a protocol that other projects will integrate or is this a standalone app that you could in a census of wallet that also has push notifications okay so yeah this which others can't integrate very easily as I said the push notification messages they are stored on the ipfs server and I went abroad casted so basically anybody can build a service like this and you know just use it for the owned app or you know just use it for their own purpose at the same point you know we also have the ens service where in the dots can subscribe to or the users can subscribe to and you know it can work like that so it's going to be all open Souls I'm not very sure about the server part as of now but right now the app the smart one right ended out they are all open source so anybody you know can just clone that Aleppo and I'm sorry bill that they want to okay question 20 yeah yeah it's a good perspective I'll have to dig a little bit more into the game theory part of it cause I I didn't realize that was part of your concept or you have people sneaking but yeah I'll read about that after this any final comments from Liam or Franco all right let's keep moving friends a situation so Liam did you find any of these things sexy or you know I should keep on no I think you know for the use cases I think you described some good use cases I think though that like they're not this I don't think at least for me for the for the majority of people we're probably going to be less likely to matter to them these kind of alerts are like they're gonna be not likely want to think about them but I don't know I have to think of a better bit more carefully I was also just gonna like suggests because I work on like layer to stuff a lot and one thing that's relevant in layer 2 is like you need to make sure that you're watching the chain because someone might challenge or put Old State or something like that and so you want to have some way to avoid that and there actually there's a lot of stuff now that does that and one of those things is this service called any dot sender that Patrick McCrory and some others are working on and it seems to me like what they're doing is kind of similar and it puts more influent it as an API as opposed to a mobile kind of concept but there might be some ways you could work together with them or they could in some way you guys can work together because their main a value prop is they have a automatic triggering systems like if this event happens then automatically submit this and only this exact transaction to the chain so you can guarantee that some transaction will get submitted so it kind of has this alert system but then you have the beautiful UI on top of that so maybe there's something that could be merged where it's like you know on top of what you've already built if this notification occurs then we want to automatically do this action and then you could you can hook up to some kind of a automated action system so maybe I got a push notification saying hey there's alert happened and we took action and now this is safe don't worry about it just letting you know and that would be interesting for me to see awesome definitely looking to any sender cool thank you harsh alright let's let's jump into the next one we've got Charles Bayer are you around huh can you hear me hey how's it going man right so we are the Tim block hub so we I'm working with Vincent Timothy and Steven in this so we are currently building telegram bots which allows user to generate tyrion smart bullets to receive unspent funds quickly and to interact with the interior and device so we are still building so I hope that's okay if we are just discussing the idea right now and what we implemented right now so as for now we built a first proof of concept of the telegram bot which can create an interim smart or let's display the address as a QR code and receive funds so in terms of development we have a smart wallet manager smart contracts which is controlled by the private key of the telegram but which can deploy new smart wellit's each time user is creating an account and control the spending of funds so as of now it's still a custodial solution but we are looking at ways to make it more noncustodial and decentralized to make it chic secure we have the use of TP white one-time password with to two FA confirmations to make sure that the user that is calling the bot is the proper user and has the access of the smart wallet and we are working on a backup system in which users can send their if they're iam address in order to with a side message to retrieve the funds manually if the bot is not working I have two questions yes first question is is there anything fundamentally about telegram that is important for this to work the way you want it or could it also working disk or it could work on this card the thing is we worked on some different but previously on for other projects and telegram is the easiest one everything is open source so it's quite easy to implement we also know that a lot of the crypto community is using telegram so in terms of onboarding it's very straightforward you do not need to install a new app to create well that's you just need to join the the telegram but Channel and you can start creating over that and interact with it okay yeah I was just gonna say it might be interesting if the API is are similar or you could read some abstraction didn't discord because then like we have like you know these like you know hundreds of hackers and even like additional like thousand other people for other events in this discord it might be like a really easy like early user base to type try this out on because it's way more likely to experiment then having to set up a whole like marketing campaign stuff on telegram where people are gonna be like introduced to this cold so if you wanted to get users fast it might be a good strategy and then the the second thing I was gonna ask is what's are you familiar with a question wallet have you seen that we thought sorry it's called button in all caps button wallet oh no I just know that this is guys that have been going to a bunch of these global hackathons over the and one of them is a developer button like all caps button wallet and I think it is a telegram bought for crypto I don't know 100% how similar it is to what you described but there I was gonna ask what the difference is between what you're doing in that but I'm if you don't know about it yet then I would just recommend looking it up okay thanks I know there's at least one other team in hack money that's doing doing something similar where they're working on telegram but so I would actually was going to present earlier but he wasn't able to join us so I would maybe connect with him cos names ever Evie ERT maybe you guys can share some some strategy or something well any any of their comments or Charlie yeah so it is the are the things that you can use the world for limited to the integrations you've built or can you use it to sign arbitrate transactions allowing me to interact with all of you Syrian we will try for now just to only allow it the smarter lets to interact with defy so it's very centralized for now we are still trying to reiterate the the project see what we can do and what we cannot do so for now it's still a bit early yeah alright cool maybe you can find a way to hook it up to madam asked in some cocky way so you can use it through with a web app and use it to sign anything that'd be cool okay thank you Thank You Charles alright it looks like I skipped over Mike Jen team Titans I don't know if he's in here I don't see his name so we will move on to zero League of pools yeah hey hey man go ahead our game League of Putin is is named after league of legends but it's related to Delphi so people can invest [Music] can invest in different sponsors or we call them pool providers because the [Music] basically the user can invest in any of these pools and he can summon a character that will be growing we are according to the points that he earns and the points can be earned either by earning interest in the pools in which he has invested or by referring new people or by participating in a clan which is a kind of social social thing where there's a chat probably and yeah yeah and once a month there's a competition and a leaderboard in which the person the player like the champion that has earned the most points can earn a price that is still being thought about but basically there could be a governance token that that is allowed to borrow up til ten percent of the pooled funds and the what is earned with these funds the ten percent goes to the league to the governance token and actually the the once a month there's a competition that that earns the most points can occur governance token okay so this could this could integrate with any pooled liquidity protocol or do you have specific ones in mind well for the moment we've been looking at the documentation of UNICEF and we envision it to add also compound and balancer because they are sponsors but later on we also wanted to add futures web and other platforms were and any I mean any any pool the the thing is to earn interest or that the the amount she deposited is lower than what is being we throw at the end of the investment and that provides points to to the user and so contributions are tracked unchained through governance tokens or like the standings the user can see how much how much token he has of the pool and how much the pool is worth so he can know how much he owns we want to make the base currency die because it's easy to use that's pretty much I have some questions maybe if if there are no more questions from yourself sure go ahead I wanted to ask if for example I want to invest in a unit swap pool from my from my contract from the contract it's should I create a template for each pair or create a library that is given the two tokens or the parameters of which put in units up to or to call to see how much Holdings we have or to invest in deposit or withdraw and I don't know if it should be a template contract and to create a new contract for each liquidity pool or a library in which I pass the parameters of which liquidity pool we are calling and and the address of the sender or other parameters for what the amount we want to deposit for example the address of the sender of the depositor and the amount we want to deposit and in which liquidity pool to deposit yeah that's more like an implementation from a question we are reading either to create new contract and the buy them or try to if it is possible to do it with the library I don't know if Liam or any of the other mentors have a comment on this but definitely going to you know swap their channel directly would be the fastest way um Liam yeah I think maybe you want to like specify all the assumptions you kind of have and like maybe ask this and like a written waiting it so we can like a really comprehensive answer but yeah sounds like what you spend right one one last question are there any other games like this that you sort of used as inspiration or you are using as a reference point or is this all this is all fresh fresh stuff the are you asking to me or each other yeah yeah no we didn't see anything well there was a crypto kitty which has the same concept of creating new cards or buying the ones that have been created which are our champions and also there was another game that is called cheese wizards from the same and there was the concept of defying summoning wizard and defying each other which we also want so but with define now to be integrated with the fine we didn't see okay yeah I was just curious cuz I mean definitely gamifying things is it's a powerful strategy so I'm really I'm excited to play it so hopefully we can we can get it out there in the next few weeks alright um thank you but yeah no thank you let's keep going I realize I also somehow managed to skip over miles as well so miles if if you are present and ready to present take it away cool can you hear me yep oh so I'm part of team what the frack and it'll become obvious why soon I'm working with Mick and Theo and damos and so basically what we're building I'm gonna share my screen so you can actually see so I've actually never done this part before so I have to share screen and then oh it's just says Google Chrome unknown I see that makes me sad that this is okay I guess I could just share my whole screen is that yeah just make sure it's you don't have any private keys laying around yeah no that was pretty funny on the previous one oh my god I don't actually have access to do this yeah sometimes there are permissions to screen sharing if yeah announcing it or quit zoom that's not gonna happen can we can someone else on my team go ahead and show this that's really frustrating anyway I can just start talking about it and then we'll hopefully have this not by the end so so similarly what we're doing is so as more and more valuable NF T's come into existence people might want to fractionalize their ownership of those NF T's so for example if your encrypted box holes or decentraland and like these things actually start selling for thousands of dollars or even tens of thousands of dollars you might want a way to fractionalize your NF T so you can show your factional share of it or someone might want to buy pieces of a property and might not be able to afford an entire property if crypto art becomes more valuable people might want to you know speculate on art or buy portion of it etc etc so our solution then is to create a smart contract that allows someone to send their NF T to that smart contract and receive fractional or ERC 20 tokens in return that that they can that represent the ownership of that contract cool dammit else has this up and so we built this tool it allows you to do a few different things so the first thing it does is it allows you to actually ride the NFT and and fractionalize it the next thing it does is we're going to create a distribution mechanism which is to put the NFT into a balancer pool along with some dye and I say some dye because we're trying to keep the capital requirements really really low so we start with like a 2% 98% distribution of dye to the fractional NFT and then we slowly over the course we haven't determined the time period yet but maybe a couple of weeks we flip that so you need to put in very little dye and then our treasurer's can rebalance that portfolio for a profit as the distribution changes so that's kind of our low capital requirement way to get this these fractional entity tokens into people's hands and then we're also creating an english-style auction we're kind of debating between English or Dutch but English style auction to sell the NFT if the shareholders at the end of T so choose and then once the NFT is sold they can get their fraction of the profits back so Dave Moss here is showing some of the UI that we built none of this has hooked up to the actual smart contracts yet so we don't have to worry about okay I think going wrong and this is all just kind of dummy information so you can deposit the NFT specify how many die that you're going to deposit and that should be based on the approximate value that you see in your incentivize to accurately represent the approximate value because if it's inaccurate then you're going to lose money to other treasurer's in the balancer pool and then if you just click on waiting for confirmation damos so then I'll actually send it this is all just fake you at this point and if you click on the etherium icon at the top left it's kind of silly but very convincing for a fakey right yeah thank you I appreciate that yeah so so the UI has has C balancer pool just link to balancer comm or balance without finance right now but exchange so that's kind of what we're building so as you can see it's a work in progress we have half the UI built you have half the smart contracts built they're not really connected yet but that's where wrap so yeah what do you guys think what kind of questions you have I mean it seems like you guys are pretty pretty far ahead in terms of your attacking both the UI and the contracts at the same time a really cool concept so I'm excited to see what else you guys can integrate so you're starting with balancer is that correct yeah so I think Mick Mick from PI Dow who's on our team wanted to go for the auction first but yeah so we're gonna do an auction but we're also definitely gonna integrate balancer yeah yeah and I'm just thinking about like where you guys are now and how many weeks are left and like how can we supercharge this how can we make it make it super awesome oh I'm sure you guys have some ideas Liam you got anything I have a question so do you guys think that this would make sense for any kind of NF TS because so many of T's are kind of kind of like proactive assets that like an e NS domain is valuable because I can use it for my business or whatever it's a great my name but I need the whole thing and control over it to actually use it as my ENS if I own a fraction for contract that's holding it I can't really operate it so where does the fraction of these ENS derive its value if I can't use it for the reason it's valuable yeah that's exactly right so this whole thing is kind of predicated on the idea that these entities have value but if no one holds it then the NFT doesn't really have that value anymore so yeah kind of managing the the actual ownership of the entity and who has control over it is is something we're still trying to figure out exactly how we're gonna do it I know in from the 721 spec that you can author like you can have an owner which could be the contract but the contract is the the owners allowed to authorize someone else to have control over it is my understanding so we're still looking into those mechanisms and how we can leverage that to yeah keep the value up and as to which types of NF T's this is definitely kind of a forward-looking thing product because right now people can afford crypto argh people can afford a crypto block subplot but you know maybe in a couple of years maybe those things are much more valuable or maybe real real estate is coming online we're talking about you know a $200,000 house or whatever real world representations we are we are representing as MF tees that answer your question yeah well rings is what comes to mind is its ancient from Aragon Aragon nation I think it's called it's this thing they have that allows those that only exist this contract to execute arbitrary the intersections so that I can do anything that iam user could do so maybe like the the holder serve fractions for token are actually themselves a bow and they could learn the asset that's fractionalized I think that makes a lot of sense I think it makes extra sense when you're talking about a house or something like that and I think that just like a like a V to sort of Edition that we should definitely consider all right well I think we're just gonna keep moving along miles and what the frack team thank you for thank you for joining of course I'm sharing feedback for sure let me double check our list uh Ethan crowd link yep I'm here you hear me yes sir perfect I'll share my screen I get a presentation put together sue I'm also here with my colleague Ricardo he's on the call so what we're what we're doing is creating a peer-to-peer referral system basically what we discovered I even discovered this recently I was setting up her a referral campaign for a company and the current process is actually quite expense using software for it and especially if you're a beginner it can take a very long time to get everything organized even at the same time - when you use centralized referral systems you have to go through the software that takes a cut the payment gate and then the bank so what we the challenge we wanted to do for this hackathon was try to create a simpler solution for this that is actually cheaper would take even minutes to create a campaign and instantly connect to the referral marketers wallet so so here's a bit of the example of our UX what we're doing so you sign up with Portus with our web application and the first step you do is referral marketer is you connect to Google Analytics and this is through an API we just hit a breakthrough using we think potentially using you UTM parameters will be allow allow us to actually track every referral link through Google annex because right now all with all companies that sell products or businesses they use Google Analytics to track their sales so this is how we would know what sales would come from a link and then the next step is all they have to do is type the URL they want the fer link to be and then their percentage per sale or per click if they wanted a per click action and then you just pay with Portus as the referral market step so it's just a three-step process to create your referral campaign and then you're basically ready to go this link right here is what you'd give a referral marketer you know and you'll notice this the on the right side is basically you can withdraw anytime from the smart contract and that will end the referral campaign and then what the user side would see is just this basically whether this is live on like a news feed or they have they get the specific link they just have to click and generate the link and then they're ready to go and as they're connected with Portus they will would earn per percentage of sale from the for a week so if you get traffic from that link and someone buys your product you would get that Commission so basically under the hood how we're developing this is we're using an Oracle from chain link so this will allow us to track per click and per sale from the referral link we're using Portus to sign up but one thing is very important about Portus is you can actually pay and fiat so where that's a really good because we can have referral marketers not even be part of blockchain or understand it and can use the system and then basically from that before from the Oracle you the contract identifies the percentage accrued through the sale and so you're getting that sent to your wallet on Portus from the application the money and last part is just the smart contract basically a steps are you sign up to the Portus so that's the ID connection both referral creators and users you deposit the eff put a set a reward per click or sale through google analytics or through the per clicking of the URL we use the chain link Oracle which that is the link that goes to the referral when they create it and then they just receive per click or per sale from the link and that's that's that's it this is our our current team awesome any questions Mick next question is how do you prevent fraud uh okay well per sale that will there no fraud can actually really happen because you only are paying out if that link generated a sale so if so per sale click there is no potential fraud but per click yes that could be an issue so one option is you actually a lot of times when you're talking to an influencer they're gonna want like they say hey it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars I promise you five five thousand people visit your site so it would be more individual for probably per click where you they that would be your escrow to make sure they are bringing the five thousand people to your website instead of paying them upfront and then I guess there's other ways you can use cachi but yes the per-click probably would have to be private and not open to the public gotcha I don't really have a question but it seems it seems like a really good idea I think the census seems like the biggest thing to really nail is how are you like what the actual experience is for people that want to use it or want to try it out so like for example I can imagine a scenario where like for a future event that we do with youth global we might want to like play around with this making it like as seamless as possible for us to like integrate it with Google Analytics and they pass it to a couple motion partners would be like what we would need to work really really really well in order to convince us to use it my main point is just like is a really cool idea I think we'd want to try that just a function of like how easy how easy will it be to use yeah yeah I agree I mean the only way this works is it needs to be super simple so that's why we're trying to implement the three-step process so Jay you in one minute you could create a Pharrell campaign cuz right now it can take up to a week to do this on a centralized referral system it's a very difficult process so that's try to be cheaper and easier and also the revenue model is actually we take we want to take 10% of all referral money going out so if you make a sale the users getting 90 percent of that sale we get 10% so that's how we're trying so there is no the goal with the revenue model is there's no upfront costs for the referral marketer like all the other current software out there you use you have to pay sauce model subscription and Commission also another kind of piece of feedback we it would be interesting to see how extensible this escrow spark contract can be for example for our use case we use unlock protocol for all the staking of all the hackers right if I could build this system and somehow integrated with unlock so you know the trigger point was whether or not a transaction was sent to unlock as opposed to the specific contract that would be also a nice feature on Justin so maybe you happen to have some kind of like a proxy mm-hmm address or something all right noted cool cool all right thanks guys Thank You Ethan we're moving back up the list a little bit to issues just remember to keep it short just because we want to fit in a few more teams here but you are welcome to start talking and share your idea okay thank you but I will say my my my screen okay sorry okay so our idea we have right now like analyzing work right now well right now are financially configuring the product the idea is to do a destroys dinner so the main thing basically is we have in our environment we are supposed to artists spike training so that in traditional market is has been faced in the 90s and with the return trading as you know traditional market stops when Marcus trout goes down 15% so there are some kind of metals in order to avoid this kind of flash trading or class cracks that in trading is really in crypto trading is more difficult but that's sometimes because the market is not so efficient in order to to put the liquidity so in an efficient way in order to can really take advantage of this prices that we are priced are not real or in some way because they are there some kind too kind of trading one is the the frustration that the price move but they are not fundamental reasons to do it and there are another crust that I'd be corollaries creases for what a really fundamental relation to to this kind of hedge crisis what I would I we will see in in crypto market that there are laws despite trading because of liquidity because of different kind of fragmentation in there in the in the market so I think their opportunity to really to take advantage of disguise this kind of aspect ready so and with the flash lows it's even more easy right now to come to money to manipulate the prices as you can see really they are out of hacks right that's it try to manipulate the price because it's not so easy right now to manipulate the price so that's even I don't know if you remember there are some initiatives I I can really be involved in the market dial back stops so this recognition beautiful right now trying like to put us apprised were really people are going to put liquidity or they are going to be liquidy that price in order to buy at a price because in some times if that doesn't make sense and I think for sure all we have prices that will be eager to to buy in some kind of assets so how really architect to this kind of decentralized okay so in the durational market oil add red fusion in some way there are people who right now it's market making and they have like doing this kind of business with a spread but there are another kind of last resort dealers that buy like with some kind of bonds but so kind of range so the the idea is really to make a product that can really put capital in some kind of prices that also increase the cost of the force imagine I want to manipulate a price and if they are out of liquidity you might imagine you one trader wants to put the price of aphelion in I know ten dollars if you really have some product that really puts a lot of liquidity I know if 50 dollars it will be cost a lot really to to drive the price to this level so how can you do that so for our IDs first of all this kind of training are going not to it's going to happen not too much time so you we are going to have to have some capital allocation in some kind of interest rate protocols you know to have returns from that but in case there is like a flash cracks you have to have like financial product can put liquidy in that moment in the market you know to take advantage of this price so that's what we are trying to do they are going to have like a portfolio rebalancing that in like I said probably we were thinking in using set protocols you know they'd like to have some kind of rules imagine I I decide that if market price of helium drops to 18 I am going to buy okay I mean so the thing is in that kind of issue to put the capital in the market and we think balancer will would be the easy ways to be in that kind of pool that needs to be consumed before the the price drops and as balancer can also define some rules like conditions we also can hide the Commission in order to do the most costly to this kind of pressure so the idea is in in that moments to to have a very big commissions in that kind of moments in all that event to do it more costly to can really buy this kind of price asset at that price and to and to to wait for the price to go to the other a balance in order to to sell the the so in the main the main right now in order to summarize the main really reasons to take advantage of this spec trading in order to to do the a lot of Commission in this spice to can really define a price what we are able to buy and write to try to less the market more efficient in terms of capital at a certain little price and the people who have capital you know in other in other protocols can really have an option to take advantage that that moment of a liquidity demand okay any thoughts anybody really I do not have to plan it well yeah I might need to read up a little bit more on what your what your concept is I guess I'm a big I'm interested to see like like what's the MVP Kara version of this The Mercenaries is very very easy because it will be a product that you can invest it like I'd talked and said and the thing is how do you really to to manage like the smart contract in order to do this kind of balance when the Oracle denies that you have to balance and to put liquid in the market so you are going to put liquidity in that in that token they will return the token and the the smart contract what we do is a when a Fenian I don't know arrives to a certain price this corner contract put a liquidity that is right now in other or in compound imbalance in person in order to to buy all the other all the assets and they will return the the asset to the to the cash again when a certain price goes up you think that there will be like a version of that like when you think how long you think it's gonna take to build a version of that is that and is that something that'll be like good for like a demo next week I think right now we have to talk with with right now with the answer because we have all the issues we have to how to things very simple I know we are going to achieve and we can do like a balancing mark balancer pool that we can configure like I don't know it automatically or know in some with Oracle you know they can change the balance and you can see the Commission's that we can we do the finish if we can really get investment from one people and to to return the token so we have like several kind of cool and oh I think they then the MVP could be like a balancer pool and we need to know what what balancer can really are really the functionality that we can yeah that's the menu my point of view like it sounds like an interesting like concept I just want to see like I just wanna see working and Sun that's my main it is a kind of balance as you know it's it if you have seen the set protocol that they balance between a s88 theorem and I be depends of media moving average or RCI some technical issues if it's mostly the same we cannot even do it with sets okay awesome thank you for presenting thank you for the opportunity great so we're gonna we're gonna have to head out then was for me to put my discord in the chat but I say thanks for organizing everything yeah we're gonna we're gonna do a couple more hopefully end around 12:00 Eastern so looks like there are other mentors I was also about to top off no there aren't but if you have to go you have to go it's it's still good practice to kind of present your ideas I think for the hackers and we can get feedback from the other teams um but I think you have to go that's fine all right yeah I do alright thank you so thank you so much man appreciate it all right all right all right so like I said let's see who else think now let's uh let's get a few more teams in I know a bunch of people had already presented in the in the other room with Austin and Jacob so if you've already presented at night and I call your name please don't present twice but next up is psy for BL SH yeah hi hey so India so we have been working with a idea called buy low and sell high so basically this idea came out of like a lot of research from the users and I used to work when I use to interview with a lot of people in this space in the d5 space especially so basically there are two problems so one is the liquidity so liquidity is the main I think that defy space and the other thing is the users okay so what we are trying to do is so I have robot and Lukas working with me so yeah so what we are trying to do is combine these two factors and make a make up a protocol you know t5 protocols can benefit from the liquidity of the users and the users can benefit by the liquidity that they are providing to the protocols so we have took a limit over this as a basic concept to the liquidity so I think I don't like I think a lot of people have explored fiber swap and uni swap where you know people just place the limit orders and they use to purchase a very dope prices and that they sell it at a very high prices so so but the duration upto which is about to take place so that money will sit idle okay so what we are trying to do is utilize that particular money and you are the epr to the users along with the profits they get from from the order when it gets executed so for these we are using our way as as welding protocol and for getting the prices of different tokens so we are using chain-link for now and for the liquidations we are we are trying to use UV swap and Kaiba swap both at a time so that like we don't have any issues with the liquidity when it comes to the large orders yeah so basically I just want to shape the screen and show you the website that we have paid sure yeah maybe I missed it but what does the acronym stand for so basically it sits by oh I see yeah so basically it's buy low and sell high okay so it works other way around so you can sell high and buy low so yeah basically the long and short mechanism yeah so so here one can place a different pace okay let's say ether and you already see then we have a nice half then you just enter the by amount let's say 20 and the buy price I want to go with is $100 and the duration will be 28 days so for the 28 days so we will be getting the profit of 0.6 so this is basically not integrated with away as of now so yeah after integrating smart context we will take the exact number so it's just a number so when I when I submit you will just you know place the order and what happens now is so we will just put that particular 20 ether into into a V protocol so from where you can generate the API okay as long as as long as already still live and and the parameters are not still executed so let's say the my prices that I have placed is one country so till the heater gets at 120 so we will be getting the APR a peer on the on the twenty either so by buyer and also like seller won't end up with with you know actually the profits that he will get from that particular order but the extra APR that he will get from the Ave protocol so this is this is all about yeah this thing so let me know like if anyone have any queries and citations sure yeah so first question is like what is the balance between or how far have you gotten with the front end versus the back end or the contracts themselves so yeah in the contract side so basically there is one issue with the ave so in the deposit so let's say when I deposit so when the user deposits all the all the deposits of going through our contracts into Ave so it's really hard to find the what amount of AP exactly the user is getting so obviously the team is still finding out the bay so after this like most of the contract is done except this part so I think it will be probably resolved by this weekend so yeah smart contracts will be ready by this weekend the front end is mostly done the only part that is reminding me is the cron job that we should write on the server side so basically whenever the price hits so so there should be a trigger from the backend side to execute that particular order and the liquidate liquidation process should be automatic yeah so this is this is where we are at now so you guys your team will be running a server to power the liquidations yeah so we are trying to utilize the cron job basically which provides and later on like we can we can go with a decentralized mechanisms such as IP I don't know like there are many decent I suppose we can okay yeah I know there are also some there are some on chain liquidation I don't want to say pools but there are some liquidation bots that that are run by certain groups on chain so I'd be curious to see maybe maybe you could integrate those just to remove some too tendency and your team in case the server goes down or something yeah so basically it's not our team that will be running this job so it's basically the server that will take care of each and every execution process so so it's not a manual process it's an automatic process but only the thing is server is a centralized part right so so I'm not happy with the centralization so in the next version or four app so we will be moving to the decentralized servomechanisms okay gotcha that's great any comments from the the remaining people that we've got in the chat it seems like you guys are got some good progress for the past we can have this it's awesome to see a trend yeah hi so I'm one of the one of the partners here in the group with Lukas and sigh one thing that I kind of wanted to understand a little bit and what run through you is as it is currently it's kind of a defy platform four pairs of theorem and Bitcoin right and I'm wondering do you think would be a smart idea to somehow integrate synthetic assets onto this because really what it is is it's like a derivatives platform right so I'm thinking maybe we could expand that to different types of assets that's something that you would agree with or I think it would be a good idea yeah so it depends really depends on what strategy you guys choose if if you want to expand the scope to derivatives then that's that's sort of the choice that you have to make are there other sponsors that you could potentially integrate if you expand the scope or could you go like make up make the product have a few more features that focus on PTC and you said that chain link is your Oracle for now yes so we are we are using the chain link and moving forward like we are we are planning to have many different features also integrated in this so we also want to have integrated for the futures Conrad sort of thing but I don't want to go doing in detail discussion because for this act tone I I think so like it's it's good to have a very simple UI and and the benefits that users can get from this protocol to the entire device pace yeah definitely uh I'd be curious to see a written summary of what your project is in like a very clear statement of like whether if it exists what your product is better or or why this project is is a significant improvement or what what pain points is it solving for people and like what the ultimate value proposition is because I'm sure you guys have it all in your heads but that would be super helpful for me to see ok I have already explained you so basically we also think so from the user perspective so in everyday busy life so everyone don't actually you know go through each and every protocol and see like what's happening with a particular aside so they need to just you know place the order and that's it then after that like every work will be done by the smart contracts only they will get these profits into their wallet directly so only the job they will do is just put the order and submit the order after that like like they will be getting profits into their pocket directly when whenever the parameters are you know required and also like then the second thing is providing the liquidity to the defy protocols so why we should you know put the money idle on the smart contracts instead we can relay that particular assets into a different protocol so that like defy protocols and also like many different orders will benefit from the liquidity ya know that that makes sense alright thank you guys for presenting we're gonna wrap up here I'm sorry if if we there are a few people I know we didn't get to that word that had signed up to present so again apologies for that but this will be a session for this week it seems like there's definitely demand to keep doing this and just give people a chance to practice their the way they're communicating what their project does and and its its features so we'll try to schedule something if not next week then the week after just so people get in the habit of explaining their ideas and sharing their progress I think it's really helpful for everybody does anybody have any questions just general questions about the hackathon any problems they're having with check-ins anybody okay no problem Frank just wanted to know what will be the presentation yeah so we're still we're still figuring out the specifics of what the presentation will be but definitely one of the things we're strongly considering is we will probably have teams submit a video just a short video summary that way it's easier for judges to review asynchronously and we don't have to get everybody in the same zoom call and they will that's something we're considering but specific details I think there might be a few general guidelines in your hacker logistics page but definitely will be releasing specifics hopefully very soon I know that's that's not like maybe the exact answer you're looking for but will for sure have more info anything else yeah all right if there are no more questions definitely if if you presented something and there was a question about like which sponsor you're integrating head directly to their channel the earlier you start engaging with the sponsors and and seeing with if you're trying to pursue a specific sponsor prize the earlier you start doing that the better they can they can help you actually accomplish that yeah and I guess the final thing for me is just make sure you've checked into the cohort channel again like I mentioned at the beginning for anybody who just joined or joined halfway we've switched from doing individual DMS to teams and now all check-ins will be happening in your cohort Channel so they're all named after some economists you may or may not have heard of we have any duflot people here I think a serious you're you're my cohort yeah oh you muted I can't hear you no it's a your headphones might be unplugged a little or something no it's still very quiet but we'll talk later okay yeah so like I said make sure to check in we'll be doing these weekly every week and these are very important because if you miss check-ins you might be at risk of losing your stake at the end we want to make sure that people are successful and producing something that that is is valuable and the hackathon overall is successful for you guys all right this was really awesome thank you for showing up and presenting those of you did again we will try to have more sessions next week or the week after I'm gonna sign off here thank you everybody so much yes you'll have a good rest of the week
