good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I am super excited to welcome all of you to the hack fathom finale thank you so much for your patience this one uh took a long time we had people from 70 different countries so we're coordinating a lot of things with but uh here we are and thank you for joining us on youth global.tv everybody who is going to be on this chat you get to ask questions comment on things and we'll be able to look at it and then we'll also be giving out poapps for everybody that participated on this live stream so this hackathon is brought to you by eth global and our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and Summits and this weekend was no different this was our last online event for this year and we started this off by running an amazing Summit uh that had so many technical talks on how the fem is set up and what's coming and then immediately after that we followed with the hackathon and this was one of our most interesting hackathons uh yet and also the biggest and the first ever seven hackathon so just to recap how the last 48 hours went we had 400 Hackers from 70 different countries participating spending 19 time zones and they all spent the last 48 hours working on really interesting projects that Leverage The Fog one virtual machine and we're going to see some of those demos here today and kind of just to give some more visual context people came from so many different parts of the world and it's just still impressively amazing to me that we get participants from six different continents at these events so thank you so much for staying at odd hours and and working on cool things that you were excited about and hopefully also being some of the prize recipients today and we had 22 amazing mentors who were there helping everybody get unblocked for all these projects so today is the conclusion in the next hour we're going to cover a lot of interesting things including who won all these prizes and we had a 117 projects that got submitted this is absolutely crazy because this was the first time people got to use fem at scale and also just to be the guinea pigs to understand how the platform actually would work and the entire protocol Labs team was absolutely blown away by this and we spent the last few hours looking at all these projects talking to these teams giving feedback and choosing some of the teams that we're going to bring on for a demo I want to give a big shout out to the ipfists and Falcon teams for really being the MVP for this entire weekend they were there answering all the amazing questions making sure that everybody understood what they can and can't do and more importantly just giving the right feedback and and helping people actually on board and get more help even after the sackathon so let's get back to these 117 submissions uh we got to these these projects about five hours ago and then the last four hours were spent talking to all these teams in parallel and through all those chats are Judges came up with nine finalists we're gonna bring these teams on they're gonna talk about what the bills they're going to show you a demo of what they built and then we're going to go into all the prizes so without further Ado here are our nine finalists soul mates koyo's data market ckcig nfts catalog dial social wallets SPN Dow cred Lancer and fil Peggy congratulations to these nine teams uh they are the first and some of the really amazing use cases of Tevin and just being on fbm and we're going to bring these teams on one by one and they're going to show you what they built so all of you can in C and check it out a lot of them are also usable for all of you immediately after this so we'll kind of go into that too and before we kind of bring this on I want to take a second to kind of really thank the 108 teams listed here just because you were not one of those nine teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong with what you built we were able to just only showcase a handful of these projects and our goal is to really kind of highlight and bubble up some interesting ideas and we really encourage all of you to continue working on this project Beyond just this weekend there is a whole program available for you to kind of continue this as part of a boot camp and next steps there is funding and grants available you can ping any of us on the global team for any help or connections that you want to that you need to talk to anybody in the space I want to make sure that you're there to uh to kind of continue building on this thing you want to make sure that we can help you get there so please please please continue building these things because what you're excited about is what the world will be excited about in six months from now all right and of course for all of you who want to find out about specifics each of these projects you can see all of these things now on global.com showcase you can browse all 117 of these teams see some videos to demos to screenshots to live websites and play with everything that came out of this weekend all right enough of me talking let's start with our first demo without further Ado I'd like to welcome our first team soul mates hey everybody hello hello let's get started awesome all right so our project is soul mates and we became a little bit closer to soulmates ourselves throughout the course of this weekend um and the project soul mates is a soul bound token issuance engine that's built on feather we decided to build this project because we know that soulbound tokens are an extremely important on-chain primitive for many critical use cases especially as the narrative around decentralized identity and reputation has become increasingly important in the web 3 space over the last year we also wanted to build something that we knew would be an important primitive and would be useful on febim and fem day one and that could support a number of the really amazing use cases that people are more excited to build in this hackathon and Beyond to briefly touch on what we built um we built a set of smart contracts there were 17 files in total that touched on a number of different constructs which Carson is going to show a little demo of and also talk about in a bit we also built a front-end application for our contracts to interact with them and also some additional figma demos for how you might think about interacting with soulbound tokens at the application layer down the road we wanted to make sure that we were focused in this hackathon and building something that was a really flexible and usable substrate really focusing on the Primitive layer um and we aligned on kind of a core flow that all of the slowbound tokens which are sort of issued through the soulmates protocol sort of fall into so they're these three steps first creating tokens um second assigning tokens to other addresses and that's kind of the first sort of assignment or transfer moment and then after that those tokens are no longer transferable and then claiming the tokens that have been issued to you if relevant according to the rules that were set in place when those tokens were originally created and now a person's going to give us a demo of how this all works all right thank you for that so this is our website so we have this web app that was made with next.js wag me along with other Technologies we'll touch upon later so first step you have to connect your wallet and make sure that you are on the wallaby test net and you have some funds from the faucet so we go to create if we want to create our first collection and here we have a number of factories to choose from each one of these factories will have slightly different rules for this demo we're going to talk about the deal Factory so we set up the metadata we want like a picture of this laptop case and this is the cool laptop token for example and then we create because this is a deal Factory what makes that unique is that the only people who can create okay who can use this Factory to create collections have to be the client of an active deal within uh the file coin on-chain API so first step we have to store the files to ipfs and then for the sake of the test net here we're going to be prompted to create a deal with filecoin basically injecting into the mock API after that we can now deploy our collection and this will take a little bit of time so we're going to skip past that and go to the next tab assign so once a collection is you know is on chain and finalized you'll be able to see the ones you've deployed over here so if you want to assign a token to somebody for example this one you have to yeah you click on the card and then you can assign it to any valid ethereum address and we assign just like that different factories might have different rules about this but we'll get into those later so now I'm assigning in the pending tab you can see all the assignments you've made if it says assigned you know that the token is in their wallet whereas if it says pending it hasn't yet been claimed and I've sent this to myself so you can see that there if we go to the claim tab you can see the previous tokens I've claimed and these are the ones available to claim see that matches the pending and now I can click on this card and click claim and that is the full flow and now if we go back to a sign you can see a car card has been created for the cool laptop data and the ipfs hash came in so that was our first transaction it's all the way through so that concludes our demo now back to the presentation cool so the underlying contract architecture looks like the above we're just going to focus on these three highlighted ones really quickly because these are the ones that actually integrate with the filecoin market API deal Factory was what we talked about in the demo and then in the demerit Factory we have this expired deal this is a type of solebound token that you can issue to people and rather than claim it it's automatically claimed by the system if they violate a demerit policy so the example we had here is if the person has an expired deal bam they uh they'll be punished with this uh this demera for it so this is an example of what a demerit Factory would look like all of our factories uh have a create collection uh function that everybody can call what makes the demerit Factory unique is that we really tried to modularize it to make it reusable for multiple types of demerits so you can just register demerit through the register and then when you call create collection there's a demerit proper variable that you pass in to choose which demerit you want associated with that token and this is briefly our front-end architecture we built it using nextges for the front end wag me for the wallet integration and reading from the contracts nft storage for the ipfs storage and ethers for the contracts interactions awesome and um briefly to just touch on you know how this solution is different than where you know standard SVT protocols one of the things that fathom and fem really enabled for us was the ability to leverage filecoin deal data and how we thought about issuing spt's programmatically and also the example that Carson mentioned as well being able to you know issue tokens against the deal Factory required this verification step that you actually were the owner or the client on the storage deal um so you know there's some uh nuances there to working with filecoin these are some examples of applications we had thought of of how you might be able to use these in practice so this one is storage provider reputation the next is support for under collateralized lending protocols that might be built on filecoin in the future we also thought about education credentials and how these might look as well we won't have time to play this I think but um yeah and then also thought about a number of different ways we could extend this in the future and um this is kudos to our amazing team thank you amazing I was uh that's a lot the in two days uh I hope this becomes more than just a hackathon demo this is really cool congratulations thank you right and with that we are ready for our second demo so without further Ado I'd like to welcome koios hi everyone I'll share I am coils uh solo hacker here I'll share my screen what CR what I created was sort of uh a three-part devil one is what I really thought about was Data dials and data dials are one thing that fathom is making extremely interesting because you can put data sets on chain but also interact with them through uh algorithms or download them but one thing I'm interested in is always on the consumer side so it's great to have all of these dials but what other types of dials can we have to have really consumer adoption so the first step is creating a dial uh and so investment dials obviously is what a lot of people think about but also research styles are another thing imagine if you can have a professor in Chicago coordinating with professors All Around the World in South Africa and China sort of working together from that same data set creating algorithms things like that and maybe working on the commercial side with people who create algorithms I also thought about gaming in sports Styles I'll show one a little bit later from Clash of Clans but there's a ton of information that's needed in gaming and for professional professional sports that people use to sort of win championships so how will this improve gaming in the future I think that'll be an interesting set of dials uh another one that very few people think about when we think about blockchain but it's huge will be hugely important in the next five to ten years is in real life retail imagine if a retailer in New York could get data and use data from Shanghai without actually having to go through a large organization it's very decentralized all they have to do is join it out and lastly philanthropic so this isn't the only things that you can do but these were sort of four or five categories that I thought of at this moment of like some great dials that you can create through this app and so next we'll look at our Marketplace so the idea here is there's no dials currently on the wallaby test net but by February I'm told uh actually we might be the first and I think there's a few others so they'll be seen here but we also want to showcase some of the uh verify data Downs so if you're just happen to be coming to here you don't know what you what dial to join maybe you're interested in this one then this is live so I will push a lot of things here but uh let's look at this style here so this is sort of traditional where you'll be able to you know make proposals you'll be able to look at the Vault see how much you know money is in the vault who their members are XYZ change some of the settings I think one of the interesting things in this sort of point to in this presentation that we're really going to improve upon hopefully with all 117 hackers a part of this is that for each Dow we want to create sort of an app store well where if you have an interesting project or an app that might be usable by a dial we want to create an interface and this will be interesting if someone creates this next where we can sort of place this here you know if you're doing Discord modification notifications or something like that that we could add here so then the Dow managers and owners don't have to think and have to build their own Tech they can sort of the use Tech that's being built through these hackathons and install it uh in their dial and then the second part of the dial this is sort of the traditional part of the dial both dial in the App Store it's the second large part of that is what happens with the uh public data so I mean what happens with uh data because you are a data dial and so what we like and the reason why I switched over to this is that we want each data section of every data dial to be its sort of own website for obviously the person purposes of privacy gdpr XYZ currently I'm going to create this the coils public data dial where I'll take public data from different governments around the world and sort of put them together and see what's what interesting things we can find out it doesn't exist here but once I start uploading some data sets to that dial on uh on febum in February it'll start showing up here with which data sets I actually created which ones I save that I'm looking at and which ones I own but before then let's look at some of the dials that already exist oh click on this Clash of Clans one uh that already have some funding it should give me an error because I'm on wallaby test net and not polygon should happen at some point soon but yep there we go and then so what you see here is tons of the data about the dial you know what type of dial it is what labels they have you get to see some of the pictures some of the conflicting data so before you buy it and this is on the public side you'll be able to look at a lot of the different use cases XYZ so let's now go to the last part which is within your Dow how do you create uh data and so what we thought about at we isn't me thought about for a coils but I'm thinking ahead of time is what we'll do is each data piece will become its own nft and then that nft will create tokens that people could buy to access the data so let's say if I was creating one here uh I could go through call it like us Fortune 500 data uh it's the coolest info about the largest companies and then I can put me and I'll tag it as finance and we have a few things there terms and conditions then I can keep going and so on and so on uh this is the most interesting part I wanted to get to here because what happens is at the last piece art page I created the metadata here I actually create the token I see if it can be downloaded or computed I actually put in a file I'm going to go back for a second because this is live not only can you do a data set but you can also create an algorithm and I think this is actually a huge part of data dials coming on the federal network is not only can you just see data sets but maybe you have a data set but you don't have an algorithm or you don't have a computation or some formula you can you you can purchase someone else's to use and lastly sort of pricing and things like that the last thing I showed before I get off because I think it's already a bit five minutes is in the beginning when we're looking at these data sets up here this is all live these are all the networks I happen to be on wallaby as I sort of take these away you'll start to see everything change so this really shows how this can be sort of cross Network cross chain but able to have all of these dials sort of working together so we're both the Dow Marketplace uh app store for data dials and then like the actual data set and algorithm Marketplace so thank you that's Carlos amazing that was uh I mean that was a lot of stuff I'm I'm still two for two super impressed with how much people can do in 48 hours uh this was really cool I think we have a pretty active theme here for the rest of the demos on just leveraging data data down so uh seeing this massive aggregation and factory makes it a lot more easier to work with all right time for our third demo for today so please welcome Chris from data market all right hey everybody uh my name is Chris and for the hackathon I put together an app called data market now some of you might be familiar with like existing data marketplaces data exchanges where you can share and purchase data with other parties now the problem I have with this is that this platform is very very centralized and you more or less have to either agree to a long-term agreement where you're paying pretty much regardless of your your usage amount or you're sharing your data with uh this party who you know you may not necessarily know what they're doing with it um and I figured there was potentially a lighter weight way that didn't require the overhead of like having an entire staff of Engineers mediate and control a Marketplace to use the fevm to create a self-governing exchange um to enable anyone not with an email or username but anyone with a file coin wallaby wallet to create their own sales Pages for data and share it with other people out there in the world and and enable people almost like a Shopify of sorts to sell and purchase data in a in a in a community managed way and let me show you how that works so the first step is actually to connect the wallet so I have a simple connection here with wallet connect um already set up with wallaby hopefully that works all set and once you're connected uh you're more or less able to authorize the transaction to create your First Data listing and I have some example values here but this could be just about anything that you want to sell related to data on the filecoin network um so let's just say I had a Boston phone number data set with 500 rows of names and phones that someone might want to sell in the marketing world I hate this I don't know if other people hate uh people sell your cell phone numbers but uh you know there's there is a market for uh being able to commercialize data not just for this but for training sets and AI as well um so let me show that example so in this case I have a just a simple phone number CSV but this could be you know any any data any label data um that I want to sell um the way that works is you create the data market request and there's two steps to happen behind the scenes uh first the the data set gets uploaded and registered with ipfs filecoin and then the second action here which admittedly might take a little bit of a time because it is on the test net um it's actually deploying a contract to represent uh the actual hosted page that you will share that you could share with other users out there in in the world so it uploads the data um creates a CID for that it deploys a smart contract which contains Logic for uh both accepting's payments and doing escrow for people that purchase your contract and actually there's a mechanism as well if uh if if people go to your page and start flagging it as being an illegitimate data set the the contract won't release funds to the owner of that page unless they get three successful sales um and then once the third sale goes through and there's no and there's no additional Flags uh you'll continue to get paid for the data set that you uploaded when people come to that page um so I have an example one already here but let's see if that one uh uh confirms so when that confirms you'll get taken to a success screen just like this uh View files if you create a contract and view listing page we have a simple contract that gets deployed to wallaby um and we have a data set available for purchase uh yes so that gets refreshed with the contract so every contract creates its own listing page and this gets this data gets pulled from the contract and hydrates a view here so as a user I can actually do two things I can either flag the listing so I can say you know this data this data sucks and then submit a transaction uh to more or less that smart contract and it'll increase the flag count uh the other action I can do is if I want to buy it uh go ahead and agree to those terms and and pay the 0.01 t-fill and buy that data set um so when I buy that purchase gets registered I can access the data set contents or I can view the transaction on the Explorer as it's happening so this is still pending but uh now I have access to the data and so in in essence this data set is open so uh folks right now could in theory guess this CID so this is something that would need to be resolved about how do you secure data sets um but I don't know if people are out there just guessing Goods all day um maybe they are maybe they're in programs but uh uh this is more or less you would not find this URL unless you it was shared with you and then you could see that phone CSV file and be able to access it on your machine uh lastly for every uh contract that gets deployed you can actually come back to the app and look up history against that contract so I just bought it and you can see here I did a 1000 or sorry just a large number of uh I think this is 10 to the 18 of uh uh or the T the t-fill uh purchase from this translated address to the other address and uh yeah I mean once you get three three purchases you're all set um as for the code it's on my GitHub I encourage you to check it out but that's pretty much the data market project and thanks for your time awesome thanks for that yeah that's really cool and uh looks like another primitive that we got to work on is Access Control list so that just kind of unlocks a lot more things maybe maybe there's a solidity contract here waiting to be written and then also FM to be proved with a lot of these built-ins uh cool thank you so much and with that we are ready for our fourth demo and for that I want to welcome Ryan to talk about ZK Sig hello thank you let me share my screen here all right um so we built a platform to create nfts out of digitally signed legally binding agreements um all the information for these legal these Agreements are stored either on chain or on ipfs and filecoin I can walk you through how you go about creating an agreement um you fill out a quick form give the agreement a name like a Services agreement we decided to create an nft out of this agreement as well um upload a PDF and then from here you can add signers people who will sign the agreement have a provider and a client and then you can drag these signatures to where the person would sign the PDF and then create the agreement when this agreement is created the PDF itself is encrypted and stored pinned to ipfs and also store it on filecoin and some audit Trail logs are added to Fathom as well um from there we can see I already created an agreement a little bit earlier um this is what an agreement looks like this has two signers we're waiting for both of them to sign since the agreement is encrypted you have to press this button and interact with your wallet a little bit to decrypt the agreement PDF which shows up here um and you can copy a link this link is something that you can send to the person that you want to sign the agreement the link has this kind of long password looking thing in the URL that's what allows it to decrypt the agreement over here um when this person chooses to sign the agreement it's going to re-encrypt this agreement for this signer so they won't have access to the original agreement it re-encrypts the agreement and stores it so they can decrypt it in the future and continues to add to that audit Trail of the the digital signature once you sign an agreement your signature appears under signatures you can go back and see it again decrypt the agreement to see to see it at the same time behind the scenes an nft was created so an nft collection was created for each agreement that's created and each signer gets one of those nfts if we look at one of these agreements we can see an address here this is the address of the nft um for for this particular agreement on the other side we also created a few delegated authorization contracts that allow you to like um you know block deal proposals or or change access to control for deal proposals on the storage Market based on nft ownership so we made a little site and a factory so you can create these things we have four of these delegated authorization contracts a provider nft contract which makes it so a provider has to own an nft in order to create a deal proposal a client nft contract which makes it so a client has to own an nft in order to be part of a deal proposal a common nft contract which means both the provider and client have to be part have uh be part of the same nft and an agreement nft contract which means that the client and provider have to agreed on a digitally signed legally binding agreement um so any of these you can select if you drop in that nft address here and press create contract it'll deploy that contract and this address can be used along with the marketplace to ensure the provider in this case is the owner of an nft a particular nft um that's pretty much it that's our whole flow so nfts and nfts at a digitally signed legally binding agreements and these delegated authorization contracts we think there's a bunch of use cases for this sort of thing for example membership to a data dial based on nft so you have an nft which gives you membership to a data dial and then you can only make deal proposals if you're part of this data dial things like request requiring kyc to be part of some Marketplace um in order to store data and requiring service agreements so if you're a provider you might require your client to sign a service agreement before taking on storage that's it thank you very much awesome thanks Ryan that was really cool and uh yeah it looks like uh it just works really nicely with all the other demos we just saw so this is great all right next up is our fifth demo for today and that is catalog Dao So Daniel and woman welcome my screen sweet so we can get started so uh we are team catalog Dao Wilman and Daniel um so let's start with the problem we're trying to solve um nature-based uh carbon projects and by this you can imagine a reforestation project hoping to verify how much carbon um it stores and issue carbon credits uh lack efficiency transparency and integrity uh that's why they rely on centralized verification standards like Vera um the MVR platforms and that means um digital measurement reporting and verification platforms can help however these are also centralized entities and perhaps more importantly uh vmvr platforms demand lots of resources particularly data and Computing so you can go to the next slide so what's our hypothesis um we want to create a vmrb data now we call it catalog dial we visualize aidao that enables project developers and their communities to procure store analyze and self-govern their data in an incentivized pmrb P mrv platform so uh how would it work so for this version uh we think that uh members or potential members pledge their funds in exchange for a fractionalized NXT uh the nft is actually a geo-reference nft with coordinates and an ecological State variable and it represents a reforestation project once the project um has been uh has been very verified and it should carbon credits we assume that those credits can be streamed back to it allow using a project like super fluid um the CO2 equivalent tokens are basically that our revenue and it's what we use to incentivize all that our activities on work anyone can provide data which is voted in and curated by the members of the LL this data gets stored using a vpm uh for this active we create a simple dial contract that lets the dial decide on what data gets stored complete with um storage deals and storage deals verification data frame of chain sources uh like satellite data lidar and all types of sensors will be ported using chaining a changing Oracle and is stored in nft storage CO2 equivalent tokens can be used to from storage and data inputs um then there can incentivize scientists and researchers to leverage the data and submit Computing jobs we use project back allow for this Computing jobs and they are produced by those jobs can also be stored and funded by data um finally we think that a solution like this can reduce the cost of verification monitoring for um carbon projects and truly create a platform that empowers and supports local development projects so with that I will pass it to will for our demo and so for this weekend uh we focus on building the data lab and so we're going to and we need to go through the steps of the data level so here we're going to submit the transaction to the level and this is the the CID that I as a member of the Dow went to submit and this is the site of the CID that I'm going to need so we're going to go through all the process of the voting mechanisms on the dial and then we're going to simulate being the the storage provider and we wanted it is out there and storage provider will take like this and accept it and then we will verify that the ucid is be restored by a certain provider so we have a I have played this uh the context that is basically the catalog contract and the market API just to to do some some demos here I deployed it into my local network in order for it to be to be passive so the first thing that we're going to do and this and this dial right now it just has a two members and one of the requires one one transaction when when operation in order to submit the the transaction so the first thing that we're going to do is submit the transaction and we're going to to pass it the CID that we want to store [Music] and now we have the transaction here we can and we get some detail about the transaction and pressing here there is going to be transaction number zero that is here's the city that we want to store we have size and it was executed it's not executed yet and the number of configuration so from now if I if I try to execute in the transaction numbers here and I won't be able to do it because I need to clear the doctors and need to to confirm that once you store dcid so I remember the dial it comes here and say okay I I quote for this transaction 0 to to to be to be a story so with that here we have now one confirmation and we are going to a very good to execute this transaction executed let me do those now and so right now when the transaction is executed this deal is out there waiting for storage provider to to accept it so and now we're going to simulating a storage provided with Market API that's all and we're going to call it the Polish star sdo so the market API is going to need a data structure called siber that basically is a kind of a compressive deal that can that has all the information of the deal the provider and how long is going to restore it and so we're going to put these away and this View and the Kali is going to be in the client that in this case is going to be the dial so let's do this let's click here and then others [Music] okay so right now and and there's going to be a storage provider storing and the CID that the dog wanted and we can verify it here in the CID providers of the dial and we have to pass the CID that we wanted originally to start and they provider that is storing it right now and we then we get a value of 2 and that means that a or CID is storing it for the time that a this data structure receiver that structure is a was encoded in here so with that and that's all for the demo of the doctor that we built in this in this weekend so hope you like it and that's all for me yeah thank you so much awesome well Daniel thank you so much for uh doing that amazing demo and uh getting so far let's hope that you get to kind of continue building this and uh we get to all use it in the future all right next up we have soul share wallet Puerto Rico whenever you're ready you know I made a video for the presentation because my English is not very good I'm sure hello everyone we are the social team my name is Federico later time I'm a full stock developer and this is Claudia my community document on your dog inside now this solution will provide you with two Factor authentication on the blockchain and security to share your wallet with your heart attack team work or friends what we've been we are the number one wallet that allowed you to configure two-factor authentication with two different wallets increasing the security of your transaction and protecting your asset or possible attack how it works we create a multi-sync wallet that increase the security of of your asset this connects with two different wallets for example one on the cell phone and one on the computer working as adult authentication Factor since for any transaction I will need the approval of what device in other words in the event that our cell phone is down and they want to access or reward it they will know I will put in the Farms another year use guide is for example in a hackathon we are and always is recite each member entered the wallet and when withdrawing the phones they will need the approach of the team to carry out the transaction the main features we develop are two-factor authentication connect to valid for great security quality for hackathons everyone on the team must upload their price transaction manage those companies delegate can having assets as long as they get the signatures okay people let's go to the live demo the first thing we are going to do is send some money to the others of the contract you can already see that the phone cup enter then I'm going to connect to the wallet of owner one and I'm going to create a transaction to send money to another address you can see that the status of wallet 2 is pending now I'm going to connect to wallet2 and I'm going to upgrade the transaction finally you can see that they found already in the wallet that we send in the future we will working on the first functional better version that we allow adding more that choosing Network the option to create multiple wallet from the app and also apply to a if we would come to continue learning and be ready to launch or add into production thanks you're very much to all you can now scan the QR code to try the app or enter to a link on the screen have a great day awesome that was really cool and uh yeah this is such a really cool utility to understand what's going on uh and there's also a lot of test net for coins so that's amazing um well thank you so much and uh I guess you get to try it out for those of you missed the QR code you can just rewind that video on YouTube and on this live stream and scan that and pause it again all right three more demos to go so our third last demo is spindle take it away hi everyone excited to be here so we are a team of five across three time zones and we would love to welcome you to Spandau uh John could you switch to the deck please yeah so what's Spandau uh going back to the first page yeah so Spanish stands for spending we have created a data dial that empowers consumers to turn their credit card transaction data into assets and have true ownership over their data next our spend our spending data review a lot about our behaviors combined together they have they actually tell even more powerful stories about the economy for instance is there a spike in Netflix subscriptions or is there a dip in spending a hardware stores so among all the categories of alternative data credit card transaction data has so far generated the largest amount of Revenue and globally the market size for alternative data is anticipated to reach 143 billion dollars by 2030. so there are this is a huge market and it's evidenced by news we have seen in I was in the media for for instance we have known that well it's almost Open Secret that will hedge fund managers have spent billions of dollars in acquiring this kind of consumer data with the hope of getting getting better or more accurate forecast of stock returns and years ago Google spent millions of dollars acquiring this kind of consumers aggregated transaction data from MasterCard trying to link online advertising to store purchases now let's pause for a second and think about what about data ownership next John so we as consumers have little control over how our data in particular credit card transaction data could be used our transaction our credit card transaction data alone feels a multi-billion dollar industry but on the other hand we as consumers have have received almost no tangible Financial rewards in practice though the value of data from a single person is of little value and there is no Marketplace or platforms where consumers could coordinate and pull their data together next and this is exactly why we have created Spandau for this hackathon we have the first product we have released is it releases a dab that's built on the Fab chain that facilitates the creation and operation of a data dial I'm going to hand over to John for a quick product demo sure hello uh so this will be pretty quick um but some have mentioned earlier actually about the uh the SIDS and uh how we needed to uh keep them hidden um so we originally once used lens protocol that didn't work out um so we went ahead and used a pinata um so this is going to be a really quick demo so there's two sides to our portal uh you can either be a user or an admin the users are the people selling the data and the admins or the people paying you for the data um so let's go ahead and let's go ahead and sign in all right and so this is where you would upload your data for now we just have a standard test CSV um and then once that's data is gone it's uploaded to a private cloud in ipfs and then we get that Sid back we can go ahead and mint the token and and for the sake of time I have one in my wallet already it should take a second to load there it is um so what's cool about this is It's almost like you're leasing your data so let's say I don't want to give my data out anymore I can just go ahead and burn it um and it'll be gone so let's say I'm an admin I want to purchase data um what's cool about this is you have to have a special admin nft to actually access this portal so when I go ahead and sign in it'll check my wallet to make sure that I actually have it and then it'll go through and it'll uh it'll pull all the data it's really messy right now ignore that um this is what it would look like if it was nice and clean um so you could go through select the data you want and you could decrypt it and then you could take a look at it and then when you're done with it you just give it back um yeah that's about it all right I'm back to the Google slide please yeah thank you John so um to conclude uh the um for product demo here are two uh mock-ups of screenshots so the first one is a dashboard for uh end users slash Dom members so any existing Dom member could reconnect to the DAP and they will see the balance of file coins that they received from the dollar treasury um as rewards for contributing to this data economy and there this red button here it's so so this one it's um so um this this is a burning mechanism that allows down members to burn their so-bomb token and exit from the dial so this is to comply with data privacy regulations such as gdpr um allowing users uh giving users the rights to be forgotten and the second screenshots is just a mock-up of shows uh what kind of analytics we could create from from the aggregated data for instance for this one we have realizations of monthly spending by category and we could easily see some Trends here next slide um so we're really really proud of what we have built over 48 hours and Beyond the hackathon this is what we have in mind I feel product roadmap so the first will be approved or personhood to immediate the risk of civil attacks and uh in terms of encryption we considered liter protocol or Medusa so those two solutions are not available on fam yet but once they're available we plan to implement them and to replace place it to replace um the pinada submarine mechanism with those sdks and to have better governance outing governance for the Dow we plan to First give deploy Genesis safe on fam so that we can store the admin nft Security in multi-sec and reinforce majority signatures for decryption and also going to um a fork and build out a voting voting contracts on fam and to and also to make this uh data economy that all the members share we want to make sure that what the metadata tied to the sobound Token is upgradable user Dom members who come back in upgrade or refresh the data that they want to contribute to the to the organization and also for sure confidential Computing is is where it can be very valuable um and next so we also consider multiple revenue streams and business models the ultimate goal is to grow the um the downtrend rate so that we can continue um redistribute the revenue among data contributors for instance um Dom members could come together form sub-dials as investment clubs so just imagine all the legions on Reddit what On The Wall Street best Forum on reddit's coming together and joining uh spend Out imagine what's going to happen with that and and also um core contributors of the dial code work together in creating another reports and services that could that they could monetize from and also we can create time-based nfts and subscriptions that generate recurrental revenue for the dial so this is the end of our presentation we're really excited about our our vision and our product and we we invite you to join this this movement and this ecosystem that unlocks the value of your data yeah yeah thank you amazing thank you so much that was a really cool demo and uh yeah such a well thought out sort of plan on just making that even more integrated with existing ways that data works this is great all right two more demos to go next up is cred Lancer we're uh we're gonna get the team up just in a second and uh whenever they're ready feel free to get started there we go yes you're ready let me share my screen okay hello everyone we are Creed Lancer a credential freelancer protocol a trustless importing credentialing and payout for scan organization of course for example Dallas and a we can help to create a privacy forward function and create the lensing for the Freelancers and for example for the Freelancers we can come to the on chain verified a credentials maintaining identify a privacy and um obtain in what credential and budgets are displaying profile and of course access to work and with a smart contract layout and if you're an organization you can get the on-chain verified credential and trusted verification of Partners uh budgetary organization members and streamlining onboarding and training of course assist two lancers and smart contract it's our platform you can connect of your course with a metamask and create your fall and a you can check your different uh prices and your score please continue um Julio hello Yes actually Alexander going to explain the main smartphone Alexander please oh okay okay let me do that thank you I hope you guys got some ice cream okay guys I don't think uh the screen share is happening so I mean when I give that a shot one more time okay okay all right um so I'll just explain the contrast because my remix is up right now also we have three contracts basically one uh who's the SBT token which uh each dial member owes uh that would be the organization itself and the Freelancers and then we have uh another contract for the Geeks marketplace where uh the organization can list uh their uh the jobs or the gigs that is available and then the next contract is for uh the Freelancers to apply for Geeks themselves so basically uh the the the SBC token is basically uh so bouncing which uh each dial member holds and then that sells as a badge for all the Freelancers themselves so each time uh they complete the task um the organization gives them it back they can keep effectively born and then we have um the second or contract which is the Geeks Market the contract basically this contract just gives you uh the opportunity to set the price of the gigs and then uh users can then apply I mean the Freelancers can then apply for the gigs using uh basic uh big proposal which is just uh it votes and uh apply so um basically that's all for me I'm sorry I couldn't show you how to compile It For My remix because it's up but that's basically it Julie I think you can take it from here is playing the idea of the contract I got to explain more about architecture and in these two days we learning a lot about the every there are tools while we're learning and we see on the chats the 15 what we do we we was working in what is the fbm like happy no you can see we use compile no I use tested here we can see this uh tools tell us a lot because with using this Tool uh we can have the the a b maybe the most important part for the front end part no we need that one the contact number and the deployment and information in order to create the contract part uh the front end uh you can see in our solution we have the in the code track we follow the the hard cut hard cut to pick what you guys provide and after that we jump into the UI and the UI we're using the library what we hear in the chat to just yesterday about the rainbow kit now very very nice chat and where we try to implement that one in in the way to use uh wallaby no how do we considering the the configuration for the library and usually that one is you can see here the we used to run the application there that was a remix of weak compiling on this one on these two days we compilation remix because it was a little Challenger trying to figure out who were the the system from the chart we figured out we're reading the what every communication with everybody and here we have an application this is the implemented of the connection using quality network if you can see uh we can disconnect here we can change the uh the network and the system going to detect that one here and we can go back no uh this is selling warring progress and too much things happening too much limit in two days um we hoping we can keep going with this project thank you so much that's everything for me thank you anyways uh I know this uh a live demos are always a little bit tricky and uh it wouldn't be a live demo with that Murphy's Law kicking in at some point so um thanks for still kind of explaining can I what you did and hopefully we get to try this out soon directly on an actual kind of full website with that with the demo so thank you so much and with that we are ready for our last finalist demo for the day without further Ado let's welcome kk4 demoing Phil Peggy feel free to get started okay sorry oh wait wait a moment but brother is sorry okay we'll uh we'll just yeah we'll just exit the live stream we'll give you a second to figure this out and then uh whenever you uh are ready and things are packed feel free to start the future again okay it's ready okay okay perfect so we can see you let's try the screen share okay uh I don't think you're sharing a screen Let's uh you gotta share it uh again okay perfect there you go yep mm-hmm you can see this looking to get started we can see uh here's the fire Peggy and uh firstly and then my Miner and uhki uh want to solve a problem uh when when you want the cycle Miner uh firstly you need a count and a user account to create a miner then you hold the current private key that is just a problem uh how about how how will you do when you lost your on the priority then the collect cluster in the miner and your reward in the miner will be lost and if somebody installing your own key then your mind will be only can be destroyed you can do nothing and the second problem is that sometimes you will run a miner with some of your friends but you are free right you are not the best friend and you may you may not trust each other so so at that time maybe you can use some more things uh account to manage the miner but there's still a problem uh when someone in the illegal group some of the partner has a better relationship and they may be Union to to either and actually they can you can't trust each other okay and the third problem is that when you you run a miner and you need more fail for collateral but you can't uh the only way you can get the feel is to buy from the exchange um but some somebody somebody hold the field okay don't have a the technology technical to run a minus and the ones find something to run mine for them these two people cannot trust each other too so they can't cover it so what's the solution uh with the F win F win provides used to find programs uh with with stacking respect Queen so when we run mine we can use the smart contract address smart contract as the owner of the miners we can Implement all of the ability of them to many miners with the smart contract with the smart contract okay at that time you don't you you won't worry about the last your private key and if you want to cooperate with some of your friends you don't need to trust each other you just need to trust the code in the smart contract and you both of you all of you can reveal the process in the smart contract in a smart contract okay after that you can copy each other very well okay and then in this process we have some different role one is minor node operator one is token holder and minor node and the way develop a latest smart contract which can manage your minerals were real and in the native smart contract which develop voice as when you we will you will Implement all of the workflow or the workflow inside the smart contract uh for example when you use the smart contract to manage your manner the user can deposit to the smart contract then the smart contracts for the funds to The Miner for collateral when the miner gets a reward the reward just go to the smart contract and the Smart Control just distribute to the reward to the deposit account then nobody canceling the others money here okay so that's what we want to do in tarpeggy the Peggy will provide a series of tools to mention the miners and let the people who want to invest the minor uh way through the smart contract directly but actually we uh what what what what we do at this weekend uh we we do not finish everything we just do some beginning do some beginning okay so we just to do some uh demo uh here's the fat Peggy fatigue actually is the trigram uh the Peggy will provide a post program and a smart contract uh actually when we want to manage a minor we have so many so many uh functionality to implement we cannot Implement such functionality with the smart contract uh if we even like that we're weird but we will uh we will need more gas because we will implement so complicates functionality inside the smart contract okay so we just make a post program in which we will do the complicated work and the way also we also implement the on-ching and Qing functionality is titled inside the smart smart contract so and we combine these two and the way uh just release the two three a series of thought to the user user can just scroll or the Peggy and to deploy create the actor then to manage their miners okay ah so let's do something uh so the demo is the very beginning part of the the Peggy playground because actually uh what I finish at this weekend it's just the single nation part to create wallet and try to create a minus but actually uh I still not finished to create mine uh the time together is a bit tight okay actually you can call him wallet you can create a miner and you you also can do something to your actor actor here means a smart contract so actually for actor we can compile we can deploy we can create and after that we can take honor to the smart contract okay so firstly we just need to create a wallet one two POS and uh it's Miss different uh single nature of the account then we get a wallet get an account then we need to create a minor okay so the miner here we will need the owner account also we need a key for actually this is a private key of the owner okay well this is that the work address too and after that we need to select the reduce capacity proof type for your manner uh I will deploy this part code to my local test net so I just need to select 2K okay if that's uh you can say we select the two key as a British passive type then we need we need a artificial endpoint okay we needed the token okay actually it was still but uh schedule types and I don't finish everything so uh uh but uh with Phil Peggy playground actually you can manage your Miner with a smart contract of course the smart contract is based on fbm and if you use the Ability provided by the uh svm like storage power actor a connector mining actor to create a miner and manage them and when user want to manage a manner it does invoke the smart contract Master which is supposed to publicly and when you don't want to invest The Miner that's when deposit to the this is my contract then just wait for the reward to his deposit account uh even the creator of the miner cannot modify the modify the anniversary or distribution of the reward in the miner okay and after that the amount of the user take power in in the smart contracts could it be minted to be a ft and the Ft could be transferred to another user then another user can take the beneficiary from from the minus reward uh okay thank you that's my demo thank you amazing thank you so much I know uh there was a lot of things that I know you were still trying to make uh work and give in a short time but the last two projects are uh with my poor English poor English speaker you did great and uh and this is an early sneak peek on defy on fbm this is just really exciting so it's really a new lending mod to connect a token holder and the dark queen Miner and to let the token holder to get a reward from FICO Miner with minus the future reward yeah awesome well congrats and uh thank you so much for being our last demo of the day thank you thank you all right with that we are ready to move on to the stuff that I know all of you been waiting for so uh those are our nine demos when I give a big round of applause to soul mates koyo's data market zk6 catalog dial Soul share wallets and dial credit Lancer and Phil Peggy congratulations to all these teams and uh for those who are joining us now you can just catch up with all these projects uh those were just nine demos that we saw but there's 117 in total all available now on Aid global.com showcase you can filter by this event and see everything that came out of it all right so I know the last final five minutes of everybody that is preventing you from falling asleep let's go into the prizes over thirty five thousand dollars of prices are being given away here from the ipfs and fall coin team so let's go right into this without further Ado here are our amazing winners soul mates wins the grand prize for the best use of fathom deployments and then we have two runner-ups spins out in coils that are going to be receiving three thousand dollars each for the grand prize of the best fbm deployments I know there's 10 more prizes for the pool category there's 10 teams winning 500 each but it was not that easy to review 117 projects in two and a half hours so the protocol Labs team will be reviewing all of that later today and early tomorrow and we'll be announcing those 10 runner-up winners on Discord and on our Twitter in the next 24 hours so stay patient on that but we have all the other grand prize and category Prize winners on top of that the best use of having to enable lending and D5 goes to pull lateral and minor dealer congratulations to both of these teams and then data dials are super exciting so we have podp catalog dial and ancestry all as our three recipients for the best data dial project receiving three thousand dollars each congratulations and the best use of fathom to build the building blocks such as taxes amms or more goes to FNS which is the file coin naming system this is early signs of being able to now get your username finally on this network so congratulations to all those winners 10 more products are going to be announced soon so please stay patient they'll all be on the Discord and if you refresh now your own project page you will see which prices You've Won and the 10 prizes will also be reflected on your own dashboard in the project page on a global showcase immediately as soon as we get them in and then a quick note on price delivery is that all these things are tentative and not final which means that we will be verifying that everything was done during the course of the hackathon and not before and making sure that nobody cheated and these prizes are distributed by the protocol Labs team so you will get a separate email from them and not even Global about the next steps on receiving those prizes and there may be an element for kyc and compliance that will be needed here so make sure that you read that email carefully and you'll get all of those prizes delivered to you in the next couple of weeks so before we wrap this off I want to say a few thank yous and really kind of make sure that we put a big thing to everybody that made this event possible I want to start off by all 400 of you that stayed up for the last 48 hours making really really amazing projects uh it's just incredible to see the energy I know the Discord was like lit up entirely the entire time no matter when you joined in so thank you so much to all of you for giving us this weekend and building something that you were excited about so I want to thank all of our judges mentors volunteers speakers and partners that stayed with us as that with the hackers making sure everything was great to the judges talking to everybody for the last five hours getting feedback giving feedback and making recommendations on how to improve the projects this this will be not possible without you and these are amazing things that are being developed at the early stage so thank you so much to all of our judges so many mentors and volunteers that ran so much of this event behind the scenes and helped everybody out so thank you to all of the people here without you this would absolutely not be a successful event and people would be not doing all these amazing polish demos and to our amazing speakers for being part of talks workshops and the summit and sharing all of your amazing knowledge and now we all get to watch that on demand and catch up on anything that we missed that we're excited about and all of our amazing Partners from the protocol Labs team uh thank you so much for working with these Global to really make this event an incredible success and being the first seven hackathon out there and giving people Early Access to all these things and last but not the least I want to give a special shout out to Chloe Kevin Ivan Kevin K Cree Luigi mini Anna moaz Luke Emily Andrew and Jacob from the youth Global team who made sure that everything that you are seeing and experiencing went according to and if not exceeded expectations uh and without their help and a lot of sleep deprivation this event would not be possible so thank you thank you so much so last thing is our finalists we saw the Prize winners we went through two separate sets of judging with the partners and the main judging and we call them finalists because if you've never been to a need Global event before we really want these events to be able to be about experimentation and learning and we call them finalists because we don't have a notion of first second third anybody who presented here today officially is a first place winner and as part of that all nine teams are our winners for this hackathon and for being that finalist and a winner Eve Global will be giving 700 usdc per member on each of these teams so congratulations to everybody here who demoed in addition to all the amazing prizes that all the teams won but wait there's more uh not only the the amounts and prizes and tokens that you're getting anybody who submitted a project will be able to redeem this amazing t-shirt and uh you'll all get an email and you'll be able to just put in your email address and if you submitted a project and only if you submitted a project or if you're a speaker or judge you will be able to automatically claim this and we'll be we will be able to deliver this anywhere in the world so watch out for that email on Friday and hopefully we get to see some of you wearing these shirts in in real life and speaking of that I want to congratulate everybody here and close off this amazing hackathon this is officially our last online hackathon for this year and to wrap things up this would not be any Global events if we don't talk about what's next so join us or one last time next week in India as our final and last hackathon of this year happens in Bangalore for Eid India if you're going to be there and if you're here now I'd love to say hi and meet all of you and this will be the last event that we do this year and stay tuned for the 2023 calendar we're working behind the scenes to announce all the events that we want to do in 2023 and they'll all be available very soon on eveglobal.com so I want to sign off and thank all of you here and I hope all of you get some rest and we'll follow up with all those prizes and the next steps on Discord and
