foreign [Applause] [Music] welcome to this presentation on the cloud also known as decentralized Cloud migrating web 2 to web3 today's session is sponsored by Stack OS and the B Cloud Foundation a little bit about myself I am a finance major from Harvard University I have technical background from India and I've worked in the U.S for over 10 years in the cloud domain and uh you know I've helped to build a company you know Cloud compute infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies you know running literally millions to billions of transactions every day every month so I've also been in this space for a very long time and they've got three space for very long time I bought my first bit once in 2012 and lost the private piece for it no thank you uh for uh these lessons which I've learned and and you know moving forward you know I think or really what we stand for is you know trying to build this ecosystem together right and and stack OS is I think pivotal to this right I am the CEO and Chief Architect of Stack OS I'm also the chief counsel at the decal Foundation so one thing is that we're talking about stack OS star course is a decentralized cloud uh what that means is that it is a replacement for using AWS gcp azure in the factory space right because this is what it is what stack was really stands for is ensuring freedom of speech and expression ensuring the you know the true fundamental economic powers are retained by the web 3 folks the community members providing real value to the ecosystem and not some third parties right and that's what it is about and this is Turtle talking about a little bit of you know what the current landscapery looks like in the cloud and why it is important for us to really you know work in this direction of decentralized cloud as an example like just a year back you would know uni swap basically delisted all the security tokens from their website ironically uh uni swap as a protocol and the contract still support the security tokens but now since the accounts on which the unisoft UI was running was operated by you know of the foundering team of uni swap and it's very easy for the government authorities or the SEC to knock in the doors and say hey guys we need you need to shut the service down or you are going to be behind the bars for doing or running you know but it's providing a UI which all works or interfaces with security tokens or which they classify Security payments right and that's not really something to be decentralized was it that's a decentralized project decides the necessity or any or anything for that matter a second example right this is how the freedom of speech was snatched right for the ones who don't know parlor uh parlor was an application where all the followers of of Donald Trump migrated or flocked to when they were banned from Twitter and I mean that is kind of important to understand uh you know again this is not really a political issue right who's right who's wrong but the fact that the government authorities have control over what you say and how you what you speak and this is where it gets interesting right the moment you know first of all Twitter was forced to remove Trump Donald Trump from Twitter which means which meant that all the users of or followers of Donald Trump moved to an application called partner and everything was going great for them until AWS decided to shut down the services on which parlor was running and again this is you know AWS unanimously limited decision to terminate those applications and this probably was something you know a decision made you know in coordination with AWS and the government maybe who knows what right but here's what it is that in the true web 3's domain can you ensure that the freedom of speech is retained and we have control or the community it can govern the policies and the rules to run applications which could allow the freedom of speech to to exist so there again right again why is web 2 really failing from what we see first of all the real and Center mechanism is not aligned like for example if I as a developer I'm using AWS I don't benefit as a user but the shareholders of AWS are the ones or Amazon are the ones who really benefit from it right talking about you know it is very expensive to really set up Cloud infrastructure which is going to be secure right they've all seen Social Security numbers in the US lost by the credit unions and that's awful I mean that's something that that's a that's a very important private data uh which can have very similar consequences and here's ahead here's the fact will try to build infrastructure for in you know these Cloud providers it takes first of all it takes a long time and you require real Specialists who can do the job well and they are very very few in about third thing is that it is not really Anonymous if I have to go and deploy applications I have to give my grandfathers details and on what not to really be able to get access or to be able to use the web please use a services on AWS or gcp Azure just name it bye in true decentralized autonomous organizations or Dao's it is impossible for a for a governor governance to really create an account on AWS to deploy our run applications right how can you really be decentralized if you are still centered towards an account which is running on AWS or gcp on your own account because and does the aerial issues so the obvious question is is this you know does uh does it matter to you right there's a two decentralization matter and I think that's what web3 really is coming to play the blockchain came with the ethos of removing Central authorities and bringing up communities to really build ecosystems and let's give an example of like you know how to decentralize something like Facebook right and what are the current things so I would distribute this into two segments like if you want to make a real world-class application which people use like Facebook you need to make sure the user experience is there and for that you have these following things so here the presentation layer which is the front end which you always see when you go to the browser the data storage layer which stores information about your your history your photographs your friends and whatnot wait um for AI analytics it requires you know a machine learning and Reporting like for example uh you know Facebook tells you that hey this guy may be your friend you know based on your network of friends that's the news which requires some analytics and machine learning there Integrations how does anyone start to get give you notifications or messages for you know of for someone a friend of you just connects with you and sends a message how do you get notified about them and then how do you send messages like that which can be absorbed or received by you right so you need something like that data sources so what Facebook does is it has a portal people can go and enter the J data and they are kind of that's how they get data onto Facebook which is real world data and and can be used by users of Facebook so if you have to make something similar in the web free space I think it's impossible to do it without using Central authorities only thing which is kind of decentralized is that the data storage which you can use ipfs for for storing static files and then you have you know ethereum or polygon or all these you know layer one chains which basically act like a database right for storing information then of course your data sources like chain link which allows for real world data to come in to the blockchain and then store data and if you want to make something really such people use applications that people use you need presentation there which is found on AWS this is only choice now AI analytics again AWS Integrations AWS right again there are many many more different you know pillars but for the for the scope of today you know and just to make sure that you know we can cover these slides today uh pretend to cut it down to these you know five lists so but again it's a student decentralized if you're using something like AWS which can kind of be forced by governments or you know Cloud providers to shut them down answer is no right and that's where stackwiz comes in it provides all the different layers which are just not static right which are real applications which people use to really be decentralized so again the stack OS is kind of solves a lot of problems what are the problems does it fall apart from decentralization so it reduces or removes the high devops cost you know all of us know that to stop the devops engineers crossed hundreds of thousands to million dollars you know in expense for a small to mid-scale organizations right right um or stack was totally eliminate that environment preparation right you can take what seven weeks up to seven weeks to create a real production grade infrastructure or environment which again you have no guarantee is going to work the way you expect it to so in stock OS your environment is it gets running in less than 30 seconds right I will go through a demo of this thing after the end of the session ability to pay with crypto which is it is impossible right now to pay on any of the cloud providers with crypto and and stack OS you know is something which can provide that right our Dows and crypto first organizations they don't even have identities to share with right right and how would a dow or decentralized autonomous organization sensation include an account on AWS right governance right how how does how are infrastructure can be governed by a dow it is impossible to do that right and again that is something which stack was kind of solved as well right and what are the steps to really decentralize your entire infrastructure right so first thing is you dockerize your application or once you do not talk about something you must know right um Docker is the application it's a 10 line file uh which any I think all of you can learn and do second thing is you know you have to go to the UI and reserve the compute how much you need third thing would be you know import those configurations on the UI and then just like a button or call deploy and the application will be running in less than 30 seconds and that's kind of the karma which start was bringing in to decentralization and ensuring that it's very quick to run right again we'll go to the demo for you good background you know I think some you know cool facts uh start was a category leader in decentralized Cloud on dcloud and we are the world's most utilized at the fastest growing T cloud we have over 73 million websites served over the network so far by the time you probably you know visit or you've seen this video this probably must have increased substantially as well we have over 3 500 applications running and over 1 500 deployed projects and the version 2 is coming very soon keep an eye on it it's amazing I think the new architecture which is coming out and the new problems is going to solve and again the best time to really contribute and work with us is now so please reach out to us and you know all of us you know are here you know please reach out to us on you know uh you can join our master program and also follow us on and message us on you know on on Twitter on dcloud or Deploy on stack OS and on Discord channel uh please please comment right so let's get on to the second part of the session so all you need to do is go to app dot stack OS dot IO right once you're there you will you will see that you have like few options to log in with you can use error mask you can use a coinbase wallet or you can use wallet connect with your phone for this example um I will just use the metamask for my browser swipe glitcher and then I collect my wallet once up there I can pick a chain so polygon BSC with the new genes coming in like Avalanche and also Reef so you know for now let's click the polygon and then I'll choose subnet call Authority inside a transaction and Ebola takes to your dashboard and this is where you basically see all your running applications of which you have been which we have been deployed or using your wallet now if we go to the next stage like if you have a good deploy applications how do you do that so it is very simple either you could go you know you could you could actually look up here on your compute how much you have so it looks like I have 1 300 of CPU with about um 1200 300 uh you know memory you know and some you know or 1GB of storage remaining so I can just go and you know purchase them from the hardware section you can go here select purchase resources and you can just go and buy and once you do that you can just be next confirm make the payment wait wait for the layer 1 blockchains to take its time to do the transaction and you know to compute to you guys bam or you've got compute you close it so you see this we just bought 6500 here we got 6500 here so we're probably good with that now you all you have to do is you know go to deploy and now this gives you two choices right one is to deploy a custom image let's say you're developing something here right now and then your Docker image you can you know from Docker from token Hub you can just pull that over or you could go to the app store which already has like multiple apps already configured right for this demo we'll just keep it strict to like a custom deployment so Custom Image we give any name here you see you can say hi as a hackathon um let me put this example of Altius a light blockchain Explorer uh for the ones who don't know this you know if you go to Docker hub um it's a it's a you know it's a slight Explorer for ethereum and for the ones who wrote perhaps Docker Hub is a repository but you can just push your image once you've written that again it's a very straightforward 20 line file uh which all of you can just write and just completely dockerize your entire application as a container and and if you'd see if you have to run this application locally to test it out all you have to do is pass this command locally on your local desktop and the application will run on your local machine right how do you bring this on stack over some decentralized Cloud you basically just copy the settings here from from here to the app so once you come here you can give your application name whichever you choose give your Docker image name you'll pick the latest image right uh that will be the one which is kind of the latest tag which you have the start so you pick that you know you can if you have a private document repository you can also do that for now just keep it this way next here you can just pass the container you know ports so if you look at this right you have um actually I've showed you earlier that you have to pass your ports like you know from this case is 1880 so you just come to stack OS and then you enter 8080 if you have some you know path you want to really you know put you can you know um now you can give your own domain names um you can you can basically tell if you have a stateful set arguments you want to pass to run the app environment variables if you need at the start of the boot time you can pass that and then you can just come pick compute for your deployment so let's say I want 100 Milli code of compute 100 here uh maybe like one I don't require processing storage so I'll just leave it at that next and all I do is split deploy right now it already knows that I don't have enough compute it'll just deploy and hopefully in less than 30 seconds I'll have to be up right so that is kind of you know how easy it is to really deploy applications on stack osway only thing which you need to really know is how to dockerize your application right once you have that you're good to go so as you saw right if your own domain you just have to point a domain to that IP address else you can just pick your external DNS right if you're using the standard default what stack watch provides you you just copy that and then you paste it with your new domain there and voila the application is already up and running and serving traffic so that is how fast the applications on stack OS is Right deployments are super super simple and quick right um I should also do is I can kind of show you for troubleshooting and whatnot uh you can just click on this run shell and you can create a shell a terminal to see what is you know what's happening in that um so let's say I want to pause I'm creating a user and um you know with with these passwords and credentials I am just creating you know one shell but you'll be able to go and look into your application and troubleshoot them if you need to so it just starts in a few seconds um so now thank you very much all right confirm in few minutes it will be started so we'll just confirm and wait for a few seconds maybe if it's already upgrade if not maybe 50 seconds okay your second is up all right all right so logged in and voila you're able to completely see this thing running um you could then pass you see your get boards that will basically show you all of the running applications or just all pods in this Qi filter to crap you know um running through this should be running that's that's why I'm gonna put it not no rocket science but I I can actually open some of my external as well so check out so that you can see on the larger screen bye so you can see all your applications running here so if you if you noticed um this is the hack which you had uh this is the one which is hack so this is how you know you really see you just started like two minutes back so that is how quickly that usually you can just okay so this is how simple you know this thing is to to use in troubleshoot you could actually look at the logs so let's say Cube Ctrl get logs you see the logs um Dash F to follow the logs I can just copy that continue which is running paste it enter and I will see this app literally serving traffic in real time right and I just sets of enters here so if I just go and do a refresh you should see that coming here there you go so right I mean that is how together so you can troubleshoot and you know we go crazy with this um so that's for going to the bash and whatnot again you could you basically go against apps to like deploy an app in real time right right um so let's say I want to deploy a game called hexgl right also my favorite is Doom but I'll just keep you hex drill this time you do next it already has you know it's telling me how much computer need and how much is available so it looks like I've got sufficient more than sufficient um so I can just go deploy and um in a few seconds over 30 seconds your app will be up and running the game will be up and running um so we're going to be seeing this thing no shortly there you go that is how quick this is copy this enter paste there you go the game is up and running already so that is how quick stack OS is you can run real games you can run any application in the world you get an artificial intelligence machine learning uh messaging service data ingestion service all controlled by a down right that is how powerful stack OS is and you know how you can really leverage uh you know the stack versus decentralized Cloud right I hope this has been really interesting and you know you learn something about stack OS and learn something about decentralized Cloud this is something which is kind of very close to the you know to to us as a business and also you know as an ecosystem right again this is the only way you can really keep the entire world decentralized in control you know and in control of a community the Taos and help help us you know really key control of the ecosystem and not be you know at the mercy of other parties which will not have the best interest of us so thank you very much uh I hope you enjoyed it uh please if you have more questions reach out on Discord reach reach out to us on uh you know on Twitter and we'd be happy to help um you know happy hiking see you guys
