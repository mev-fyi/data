stand by great welcome everyone um yep all right good morning everybody uh welcome to the um covalent workshop with uh harish and ganesh that will cover scale with one unified api so without further ado i will uh let harish and ganesh take it over if you have any questions please post them in the chat um and we will get back to them if not here after the talk on the sponsorship channel i let you take the floor thanks uh catherine for that warm intro hey guys super nice to be here i'm here with my colleague harish uh who leads developer evangelism so the way we structure this is that i'll just give a brief intro to covalent uh you know what we're about and uh why we started the project and what we're focused on and then harish will take over and give us a product demo uh but feel happy to uh ask questions on the chat i will be actively monitoring the chat uh as we swap roles so uh i'm one of the founders of covalent i'm a data scientist by training and we built covalent to solve this problem that all data on the blockchain is public but is actually inaccessible uh to uh to a layperson like you need to download the node node software you need to parse and crawl you need to go fetch api's there's a lot of steps that uh if you just want to answer a simple question so we built this uh this product we've been building this since 2017 actually and we've been building this uh through the bear market and uh suddenly last year we started to get a lot of traction uh especially as the d5 project started to uh pick up mainstream and then this year with the nft projects picking up steam and probably uh dowse or other kinds of use cases on the blockchain so very use case agnostic that's really what covalent provides so uh a little bit about the history uh covalent is now a team of about 30 people we would love to call ourselves affectionately as data nodes we're very passionate about uh the transparency visibility uh so we do a lot of hackathons uh we do something called dungeons data which is another flagship hackathon we do one million wallets uh and we're now sponsoring uh scaling ethereum so what the product really is is it gives you a unified api to pull out balances positions and historical granular transaction activity across i believe eight different blockchains so the only change that a developer needs to do is change the chain id and suddenly the same schema and the same responses are now available across all of these other chains that we index so these questions could include simple questions like give me a list of the erc20 assets in my wallet now this is a simple question because every wallet portfolio app requires it but it's actually a very hard problem technically to solve because they're on ethereum there's over 200 000 erc 20 contracts and the only way to answer this is by checking the internal state of every single erc20 contract and seeing if your address has a non-zero balance and we are able to do that in sub-second response times so i'm very proud of the product that my team has built uh over the years of course this is you know it's we didn't just show up it's taken multiple iterations and multiple uh stumbling uh multiple times of stumbling before we're able to really tune fine-tune this api so that's just one example another example would be getting log events and one of the unique aspects of covalent as opposed to other kinds of uh you know data middleware products is that we index the entire blockchain which means the covalent database has every single balance every single position every single transaction every single log of it basically everything we've done an exact replica of the data on the on the blockchain to a database which is available through the covalent unified api which means that if you want to get the log events out of any contract on any of the supported blockchains which could be polygon which could be phantom which could be a tier main net all you have to do is give it the contract address and figure out the logs that are emitted uh from uh from that contract you don't have to do anything beyond that and if you happen to have the abi on our back end we'll also decode the uh the log events for you uh if you don't it's raw deco raw events that you can then decode yourself on the client side so uh who builds with us so uh we have over a hundred customers uh right now building with covalent and we're one of those few projects that's revenue generating and the use cases can come from the enterprise case where consensus for example consensus is one of the biggest companies out there in the blockchain space they have a token issuance token distribution platform called activate and so all of their data is powered by covalent so that's an example where you need access to compliance token balances uh access to resting schedules modus multipliers everything that's on chain so all of that comes from covalent uh we're pretty big in the wallet space basically every wallet in the ethereum space is using covalent to get out all of your balances uh we also have a very interesting end point to get the historical uh portfolio value of your erc 20 assets over the last 30 days so this gives you a beautiful uh you know area chart that tells you what the value of your portfolio has been over the last 30 days so uh those are the features that we built uh for wallets so we're uh you know pretty active in the wallet space uh we're also very active in the exchange space so if you're using coinbase or binance it's possible to go these exchanges and download a csv of your transactions if you want to do your taxes but if you're using a decks like kyber or one inch or you know sushi swap or unit swap there's no feature where you can download a csv of your historical transactions so we provide that feature so we have a lot of exchanges or exchange uis using covalent to build tools for taxation another use case is a portfolio roi tools so liquidity.vision uh there is folio vision there's a lot of tools out there that are showing you your impermanent loss uh the roi of your positions on unit swap all of that all of the information that's put into an investor to make the right decisions so we have a lot of those products building on covalent uh and then we have uh nft dashboards that's also very very interesting so things like figuring out the market gap of your assets within the nfd contract the last sale price the the trading price what is the uh the valuation of your of your portfolio uh stuff of that sort uh just a lot of use cases i would say at this case every new uh customer who signs up with us is a completely different use case so the the the product itself is is generalized it's uh use case agnostic and blockchain agnostic uh our the idea behind and the vision behind covalent api is to speed in that time to market so that developers are not focused on building uh indexing code or have to mess around with node software or apis or even write a single line of indexing code that's really the idea um and then uh yeah i think that's uh basically it the the high level uh during this hackathon is we're offering three thousand dollars of usdt to three teams that make the best use of covalence api all of this information will be on the on the landing page so uh you can look up it for further information but we have lots of interesting ideas uh that we want uh developers to build like multi-chain nft portfolio evaluation models uh that's an example that's very exciting dao financial management tools so the ability to track multiple wallets uh edly to use multi-sig uh free-form notes and transaction records uh multi-chain support so you're able to now support like polygon mainnet uh binance part chain uh phantom avalanche like because your assets are across all of these chains and you need one unified api to build that ui uh we want to build dow transparency dashboards so figure out how much money is in a treasury what is it being used for what is a run rate and so on and uh yeah so i think high level that's what uh covalent is about and what i'll do now is i will let harish take on with the demo and explain the class a class b endpoints and uh stuff that's more written to actual building thanks guys okay uh ganesh thank you so much for that uh that overview um hey everyone my name is harish as ganesh mentioned i look after developer relations and the bottom up ecosystem growth at covalent and really exciting to have the opportunity to to sort of walk through our product in a little bit more detail with the with the demo so i'm just gonna share my my screen here and i also shared a couple links in the in the chat ones to our api docs and one is to our overall um generic docs which have got a lot of other resources such as um case studies how-to guides information about our campaigns that ganesh had mentioned and some of our other tools but what we're going to do because we only have um you know 20 minutes or so here is we're going to start with the api docs and to be able to use the docs you can actually do it directly in the browser one of the nice features of what the covalent api offers is the ability to sort of test it out uh directly from the the browser you will need to register for an api key to be able to do this so if you haven't done so already you can do there's links from the the docs to be able to to sign up for your free api key um as ganesha may have mentioned here we've got basically two main classes for our api endpoints and we'll sort of walk through examples of both those two main classes the first is the the class a which are endpoints that are generic and can be used across multiple networks so if you're pulling out balances transaction log events by simply changing one parameter as we'll see with the chain id you're able to grab all this detailed decoded information across multiple networks and then our class b are more specific for uh specific projects and and protocols so we'll see examples of being able to pull out susi swap um network assets for example and and see the the the type of response that we get back um for anything that requires us to pull uh pricing information uh we do offer the ability to grab data in multiple supported currencies and so here's the the full list and the other thing that's really unique about our api is the fact that our responses can be in one of two formats you can actually in addition to getting the standard json response you can get your data back in csv and so you can literally copy and paste that data into an excel or a google sheet and do your analysis there if you if you wanted to so let's start with our class a or we'll actually start with some of the pricing end points just to give you a quick feel for how these end points work and and and the way our docs are are set up here so here's an example of where you can fetch all the historical prices for a particular ticker symbol we also have the ability to grab it by contract address if you wanted to have multiple addresses or ticker addresses um you can do that as well and so you can support we support multiple core currencies you would add in your ticker symbol and then you can actually specify any starting date and we would fetch not only the the current price but the historical uh price as well and so here's an example of your data being returned in csv format and we can also get this data in in json and use that in any any app where you're displaying prices i'm going to move over back to our class a so the pricing you've got historical prices by address by multiple addresses by ticker symbol or even getting some details around price volatility so with our class a uh what we're going to do is start with probably one of our more popular endpoints which is getting the change in token holders between any two block heights and why this is really powerful is the fact that you can fetch this information for a particular token across multiple networks so if we wanted to see all the token holders of ave for example uh here is the we used a chain id one for ethereum mainnet and this is the token contract address for ave and we've just specified a starting block and so this will give us all the token holders as well as the difference between the current block which is uh roughly this uh versus whatever we specified for our starting block and you will get the the full list of all the the token holders as well as the difference between those two blocks and we can actually just simply change the chain id as we mentioned before if i wanted to get all the ave token holders on let's say the polygon or the the matic main net um we just simply look at the the mapping between the ave token on ethereum and the ave token on matic and there's a token mapper tool that's provided for for all these networks you would just simply use that particular contract address and you would be able to get all the data associated with audi token holders on thematic network and so that's how easy it is to fetch information of block holders for a particular token across multiple networks uh we've got the ability to fetch token balances for any particular address and if it's a for the ethereum network we can actually uh resolve ethereum names so if you've got demo.eth we'd be able to simply under the hood determine the wallet the underlying address there and we can fetch all the balances if we set nft to true we also get all the underlying erc 721 and 1155 assets and so this allows you to get really detailed granular data uh related to not only just standard erc20 tokens but also um any custom nfts as well for a wallet we've got the ability to grab all the transactions so similarly specifying a chain id and an address and we will be able to get all the underlying transactions that have taken place for that wallet address so again as ganesha mentioned one of the common use cases is building out wallets across multi-chain wallets and so we've got these endpoints that make it really easy to be able to to fetch this granular data across multiple networks um for those of you who you know get into some of the the details with log events um logs that are emitted by smart contracts uh we've got the ability to pull out the decoded log event details and so you would just need to grab the topic hash of the log event that you're interested in and you can also specify the particular sender contract address so in this example we're actually looking at all the flash loans uh that have been issued by the ave lending protocol and so we have the topic hash for the flash loan we've got the sender address being the ave lending protocol and we've got our response in csv here where we can see all the flash loans as well as all the details about those loans provided to us here in in csv format a couple other endpoints i'm just going to walk through here so as mentioned we've got uh multiple endpoints here for supporting our nfts and nft data is notoriously messy and and difficult to retrieve and part of this is because you know you've got non-compliant standards and you've got some of this data that lives off chain and so we've we've spent quite a bit of time uh beefing up these um nft related endpoints so we can start by grabbing all the nft token ids for a particular contract address so i grabbed this one i believe this is a axi infinity uh in order to find the smart contract address if you go to a marketplace like openc you can actually just grab that directly from the the url and this would give us the full list of all the axi tokens that exist and then you can iterate through this where for a particular token id you can then grab all the underlying external metadata or you can grab the underlying transactions and get all the details of those particular nfts and how they were traded and between whom etc etc uh so those are sort of the high level um key endpoints that we sort of classified under our class a which again are generic across multiple uh multiple networks uh what we're going to do now is just take a look at some of our class b endpoints and again class b we started out by building these out for some of the largest d5 protocols and you know they were as last year early last year there were there were probably only a handful of these so it was relatively easy to focus in on the the top the top d5 protocols now that space expanded so much that it's uh it's virtually impossible to keep up and so part of what we're going to do is create this idea of a marketplace where contributors can build these custom endpoints for specific protocols or their use cases and then the marketplace will be available for anybody to utilize those uh api endpoints so let's take a look at the the sushi swap network assets and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna look at all these um the sushi swap assets on the ethereum net and here is the example response that we get back where we've got for example the exchange address and then the underlying tokens that make up that exchange address and what's really powerful about this particular um class b endpoint is the fact that we can actually fetch 60 swap assets across multiple networks again by simply just changing the chain id so if we want to look at all the assets on phantom which we've recently indexed now we've got all the data associated with the sushi swap exchange pairs on phantom and the last one we'll point out here is taking a look at all the detailed uh transactions uh related to a particular exchange pair so um again we're going to look at we've got a little just here that you can dive through if you wanted to get a full the full details but here i'm going to specify the polygon network and i passed in a particular address here and what i can see is you know all the the transaction events that have taken place and we've also got a flag here to be able to get the details for all the swaps so if i just set that to true so in addition to adding you know activities like adding liquidity um i can also get all the detailed swap information including the token details that were part of that swap so that's just a high-level overview of what the the docs provide or the api docs provide and again once you get your api key you can test all this and interact with our api directly from the browser you don't need to install any any custom software or anything like that and this is our overall docs page and we've got great references to our learning series for example if you wanted to go through a few of our how-to guides to get started with using our api as well as a couple case studies and then we've also got detailed information about each of the networks that we support and this might be helpful if you're intending to build something that is that is multi-chain okay well i'll pause it there if there's any any questions we can we can take that on now um ganesha i know if you wanted to wrap up with uh maybe talking about a few of the opportunities that currently exist with the with covalent around our alchemist ambassador program uh but i'll uh i'll pause it here absolutely thanks harish amazing uh amazing demo it's cool to see uh you know uh and outsiders look into you know what uh what the team has been building on uh we're usually very heads down uh building product um so we have a couple of things that that's pretty exciting that's coming up in the horizon so one is our alchemist ambassador program and think of this as a as a as an investment in the community's growth and leadership potential so we are recruiting uh 2000 people and you are teaching them how to crunch numbers how to work with csvs how to do pivot tables how to uh how to uh tell stories narratives with data uh so this is a personal passion uh of of ours and uh we are actually going to be distributing one percent of our token supply uh to drive this initiative uh so uh please go to covalenthq.com ambassador uh the third season just opened up and we are recruiting 700 uh spots uh for this uh but you don't have to be technical you can do content writing you can do uh you can even create memes uh but we do have a section for developers uh which is called developer augmentation and this is to to build uh to really uh you know take the message forward so um so that's that's pretty exciting and then um uh another big architectural change is that covalent so far has been a centralized system so it's a sas product uh you can sign up and it's centralized but we have been building the decentralized version of covalent for about a year now and so so hence the token hence the public sale and uh stuff of that sort but i'm not going to uh tell more about that because i want to keep this focused on uh on the product and and developers um now i think we can uh go to the questions here so the first question is are these ideas documented somewhere i believe you have a landing page explicitly for the scaling ethereum hackathon so maybe we can drop a link in here uh for for that how do you manage slippage uh for x crypto different prices on different exchanges so our price feed we have two sources of price feeds one is a aggregation which is a total volume uh weighted pricing from centralized exchanges so that's one of our price fees and the second price fee is from the from decentralized exchanges so what's happening with a lot of these newer gfi tokens is that the price discovery has moved to taxes not to centralize exchanges because they're first listed on unit swap before anywhere else so we actually have an endpoint coming out that explicitly uses or unit swap or sushi swap as an oracle and this is very important because these new tokens are launching on these newer chains where there's no liquidity and so you need to port over the prices for a mainnet or somewhere else so we have this huge problem like in pancake swap for example on binance chain a lot of the smaller assets there's no pricing and the only way to get that is to get it either to a centralized exchange or through ethereum main net so that should answer the question where can i find pricing of the api endpoints uh may the pricing change over time if so how much so great question so the product currently is free so you can sign up there's no charge uh to use the api so we have lots of customers who have gone to production with us so we're pushing like hundreds of requests per second so scale is not a problem uh with us what is going to change over the coming months is that with the launch of the decentralized network the pricing is going to be set by the network itself but what i can guarantee is that the pricing there's going to be downward pressure on the pricing and this will be cheaper and faster than any centralized solution that's out there because it's going to be served by professional people with actual data centers so we've recruited about four professional uh validation teams uh that have actual bare metal who will be serving the covalent api and so uh there's no way you can beat those guys on uh efficiency and pricing so i can guarantee that it'll be it'll be dirt cheap to use once the network is up and running but until then the product is completely free regarding cohen upcoming public sale is there initially massive prices threatening between the seed s01 and public sale at 0.5 are you guys sure there's this concern so i was expecting this question uh it's not relevant to this thing there was a typo on the on the uh on the coinless page uh which is a very unfortunate mistake uh it's actually uh 0.05 and 0.0.013 that got rounded to one uh this happened so covenant has been around for a while we've been around since 2017. and these are guys who uh invested in uh covalent before there was product market fit before there was revenue before there was any team so in the last eight months the team has grown from three people to 30 people the number of projects has gone from like four or five to over a hundred the number of blockchains has gone from just a theorem to over eight so they have been uh instrumental in in scaling covalent and in growing that so what we are doing an update is of course we're going to change that truncation numbers and also putting the date timestamps uh on when these financings happen this happened at a different time there's a bear market uh you know i was going out and begging for cash uh bull markets are different uh so that should uh that should address that concern i am going to be recording a video uh which is a community faq addressing a lot of these points so stay tuned for that video uh that's coming out later today are there late roommates enforced on the api the only rate limit we have is a concurrency later limit so we support 20 requests per second but there's no limit on how many apis you're able to consume in a month or in a week or a per day there's no limits on that it's just concurrently you can only make 20 requests per second max block range of 1 million blocks yeah so the size of the data is another challenge uh yes the request per second is uh is one limit uh but a lot of the endpoints uh people are just pulling out like an ethereum like 12 million blocks which you know why would you want to pull out the entire blockchain in one api i don't know why that would be a reason if there's a specific need for this uh please do get in touch uh we're very active i know we have a team that's actively building the product uh serving customers and answering the support queries so definitely get in touch with us if you have a special requirement we might be able to arrange something thank you ganesh and harish for this great session we are running out of time uh and i think we actually covered all the questions so thanks for all this if you guys have any other questions uh please go on the sponsor channel in discord uh the entire team from covalent will be there to answer your questions throughout the hackathons and today as well um so on this i will wish you all a very great day thanks again for joining us thanks thanks guys awesome bye thanks for having us catherine appreciate it
