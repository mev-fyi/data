good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eats global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the road to web3 finale so let's get started you're all watching this on each global.tv this is the platform we're using for live streaming this whole thing which means if you have any questions or comments you can just put them in the chat and i will be able to relay them uh to everybody on on the live stream as well as answer any questions for you and on top of that for everybody who signs in and says engages with us we'll be giving out nft apps for being an active participant for this event so this event has been brought to you by it global and for those of you who don't know what each global is if global is an organization with a very simple goal our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and this event is no different as this is the final day of our road to what three hackathon so let's talk about this event we've had over 1200 attendees participate as hackers they're designers product people developers from all over the world over a thousand people watch the summit we did on last thursday and the hackers are coming in from 84 different countries spanning 20 different time zones it's been an incredible uh amazing set of people that have come on and worked on really cool things over the past five days and we are excited to show you everything that came out of this event we put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and it blows our mind every time we see these things that we have representation from six different continents and so many incredible cities and so incredible perspectives that kind of brought were part of this event and built something that they personally cared about um and we'll see we'll be seeing some of these projects live shortly on top of that we had over 60 ecosystem mentors and 10 ecosystem partners that were here with us the entire time helping out all the attendees with their projects and blocking them as well as um uh giving them advice on how they can make their lives easier by using various sdks and open source libraries and to top it all off we did were this event had over 250 000 in prizes and we'll be going into who won what prizes and how everybody uh can see which prices they ended up winning at the end so the thing that made this event super interesting was that this event was specifically designed to bring on web 2 developers into web3 and out of the 1200 people that participated in this event 65 of them were brand new to web3 they were looking at anywhere from quitting their jobs to get into web 3 or exploring web3 so they can think about moving into this space full time and that absolutely blew our minds because there were so many incredible season developers with anywhere from industry background to decades of experience building cool things in web 2 and services that you probably use on a day-to-day basis and now they're excited about what's happening in web3 and we can't be we're equally thrilled to have them here playing and experimenting with incredible [Music] and the thing that blew our mind was we had 310 submissions for this hackathon this is an absolute incredible number of projects to see over a three and a half day window and with this number i am super excited to say that this has now been youth global's biggest event ever in our four year history not only from the number of participants but also from the number of just the sheer number of incredible projects that came out of it um what gets me even more excited excited is that we'll be seeing so many of these projects continue to be built after this event ends today and we are on track to bring on more and thousands more people into this ecosystem i also want to quickly thank polygon and our our partners including web3 odd sequence chain link the graph morales fingerspell grants program nft port superfluid and covalent for being uh incredible ecosystem partners for us for this entire event they were there the entire time trying to make sure that everybody is able to continue building their projects and get the help that they need and they also gave a lot of prizes and we'll be covering who won what prizes at the very end so let's go back to these 310 submissions after these projects were submitted they went through a judging process two days ago where we had 24 set of incredible judges come on and talk to these teams get feedback ask questions and kind of do the hard work of figuring out how we should think about who are some of the projects we're super excited about and through that process we landed on 15 incredible projects that we're going to bring on today and and they're going to come on live demo and these are our finalists and uh to before we get into that i want to bring on sandeep the co-founder of polygon to come and share a few words because this has been an incredible event in partnership with polygon and before we introduce these 15 teams i'd like to bring on to leap and have him share a few uh thoughts so welcome thanks thanks karthik for having me here uh uh hello everyone um once again like you know thanks for having me at the closing ceremony of road to web 3 hackathon i hope you all had a great time in building your projects for this hackathon as karthik also mentioned that the primary goal of this hackathon was to help uh you know the the excited or interested web 2 developers to get started in web 3 ecosystem and i'm really happy and that that you know i got to know that 65 to 70 percent of all the participants in this hackathons were previously web 2 developers and you know were participating in a web 3 hackathon or you know doing uh things in web 3 for the first time so that's that's really really encouraging um and it was also great to see the response that that you know uh we received from this hackathon as kartik also mentioned like you know we we also did not you know realize that this you know polygon hackathon or you know in partnership with eth global is going to be like the biggest ever uh 300 plus submissions and and things like that absolutely amazing and uh you know within 72 hours some of the projects that you guys have have churned out is like absolutely mind-boggling um you know i mean we we are going to have uh some of the other presentations uh right now so that that's why i don't want to say some of the names uh but i hope all of you uh guys learned a lot and uh you know more importantly you guys will continue your web 3 journey forward and we at polygon we we you know want to be we we the cultural value within us is that we uh you know we are at the service of developers to to help them uh to continue and and to build their amazing web 3 journeys so you know anytime you want to expand onto your ideas make it into a venture going forward or learn more and things like that we are always there and you know we are at your service um and you know the hackathon also had multiple gaming tracks multiple tracks like you know nfts gaming b5 tooling uh and you know i mean obviously this ceremony is going to announce the um you know the the top 15 teams and uh the the fine list basically so you know karthik over to you let's start with the with the finalists let's get started all right so the moment all of you have been waiting for so we have 15 finalists we're going to announce who they are and then they're going to come on one by one and demo what they built for all of you to see and without further ado here are our 15 teams i'll kind of kick us off and a no particular order congratulations to nft to apple wallet allocate gm space 2sq and the oyster and then we have bounty hash scan crypto wordle holy share scribe 0x corgis polysign apes two punks beep.xyz and ar nft explorer amazing work guys so these are our 15 teams we're gonna bring them on soon and have them kind of demo and uh the way when we looked at what some of the common themes were for these 15 projects but as well as generally for most of the submissions we saw we saw a crazy amount of kind of overlap and common trend on nfcs and gaming so there's a lot of that here we're gonna see there's a clear emphasis on consumer apps uh or just services are ready for everyday use uh but leveraging uh web3 technologies so we have a lot of stuff on infrastructure whether it's analytics or dev tools and then we also have protocols that are just here as new primitives for us to leverage um and and use them on a more frequent basis given anywhere from gas to scalability concerns being addressed so some of these themes we're going to bring them on the teams on as a in some of these grander sort of groups and before we kind of jump into our very first demo i want to quickly take a second to thank all 295 projects that are here who um putting so much time effort and work in honestly learning about what's possible in web3 whether it's using different tools and sdts and apis or just kind of understanding and building something they've been curious about or that that project that's been on their list for all this time just because you were not one of these 15 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong um we just wanted to highlight some things that were super creative and interesting to all of us and this is kind of the goal for the finale but we really encourage all of you to continue working and i know some of you are already interested in getting more feedback so if you want to get more feedback please send us an email about your project and we'll try to see if we can get some more direct comments from from our judges no promises but we'll try to make sure that everybody gets the opportunity to make themselves uh anywhere from more skill to to improve what they've been working on and we want to make sure that you have the right resources to continue building everything that you uh are interested and excited about so congratulations again and for those of you who are wondering what are these other projects and how can i catch up on what they did you can head over to showcase.ethglobal.com and you can see every single submission that was submitted as part of road to web3 hackathon and all the projects are now available on the global showcase so without further ado let's get started so i'm going to bring on five of these teams we'll have gm space nft apple wallet the oyster hd pumps and ar nft explorer come on and we'll just kind of do back-to-back live demos so our fingers crossed and uh let's let's get ready so without further ado let's welcome gm space for showcasing what they built whenever you're ready feel free to get started so hi everyone um we are the tmgm space and i'm hazel um so our project is an honor ownable virtual apartment nft in social media we're using unity and modulus web3 api to build this whole demo and so who are we so i'm hazel i'm now based in boston doing my degree in mit and another team we still have like edison quinn and catherine based in all around the world basically and um so the background of why we built these products is to put everything in a short sentence it's like we believe in web 2 world people say like come visit my profile page like my photos and posts but in web 3 things will be very much different um we believe that things will be convinced in my nft apartment and hang out in social methods like my nfts and my room design so the background is we believe that web3 is an ownership-based um value internet it's all about digital ownership instead of only news or photo feeds and web too so that's why virtual apartment nfd in web3 will be equals to the profile page in web 2. we are building this gm space which basically is a virtual apartment based social media verse we call the gm space because we imagine people come and say gm to each other every day here um so now we can move to the demo um we have built it um in the past week and hopefully things works well today so we can see that in the demo we can join again with a different name and then you can see like all my teammates are actually hanging hanging out in this room and we can move and move around the objects here and there easily for example we can move this balloon here and there to try to make it at a good design and then we can add for example add this christmas tree here and we can delete it easily and we can add it back so it will be easy for us to build a house build the apartment build the office or build a club that people can hang out so um people will have different preferences on how they want to build their house and what's more we can try to connect with wallet here and once we connect the wallet here we'll be able to see the nft and our wallet showing up as an object here so we can pull the nft on the wall trying to show off our different nfps and our taste and after building up the whole room at the house or at the club as as the restaurant or even as the um [Music] office we can invite different friends coming in so we can interact with different different people um right now we are still building out the um voice chat voice chat channel um but we as we assume that with a bit work we'll be able to talk to each other and um voice and video chat with each other when we are in the same space and if we go to the left-hand side we can see that there are a lot of other buildings outside this is our like mid to long-term plan we would like to build up a whole community instead of just one single apartment we want to build different malls different office different commercial space and different residential space and build it as a whole downtown place for people to hang out and social in the metaverse so if we go back to the slides we can see that in midterm plan we decide to launch around 10k virtual apartment and nfts we currently plan to launch these nfps as the key of the apartments instead of apartment itself so people will have the key to enter this space and then they will be able to design the space as whatever they want and we'll try to smooth the multiplayer voice chat voice chat experience and now we are doing the nfd importing experience and we will try to um connect it with different wallets with different nfts on different platforms and we'll also try to strategy partnership with other projects and even other brands so that you can come in to the mall and shop gucci or shop whatever brands that you want in a virtual space and the long-term plan as i mentioned we want to build a seat not only an apartment but also a city so we'll build in some other public spaces like clubs office malls and we want to come up with the whole community driven vibrant downtown where everyone can build his or her own space yeah so thank you this is our project awesome thank you so much hazel for going first and making that amazing game i hope you continue building this thing and we all get to uh play and be in this uh community yeah super excited about it great awesome so with that we are ready for our next demo so without further ado let's welcome nft to apple wallet feel free to present whenever you're ready hi everyone guys uh my name is jarek and together with artur we created an nft2 apple wallet um arthur is a staff engineer he worked at facebook and spotify and i am a yc alumni and i did design and front-end for for this project um so we wanted to solve the problem where nft communities are getting uh better and better tools to meet and work online they already have token gated content platforms calendars and discords but there is very little innovation in the offline side of the nft community building so we would like to allow nfd creators to build offline presence by enabling their nfts to be visible in apple and google wallets apple and google wallets instantly enrich nfts with geofencing nfc and qr code connectivity and push notifications so our target audiences are for example brands that are trying to build online offline communities using nfts uh like nike adidas or advisor also existing nfd collection brands that are trying to add utility for uh their community members like bayc um so we built three components first one is an ft listing site that a user can log in with metamask on desktop on mobile to see their nfts the second component is apple pass minting service with image manipulation element so you can actually create an apple pass and the third uh component is pass validation service so you can validate whether uh the pass that's uh in the wallet actually matches the the ownership of the nft that signal or sits in the blockchain um so we built this with an xjs tailwind morales polygon apple basket image magic qr code apis and metamask so i want to show you the live demo right now so bear with me okay so this is uh this is the website i'm gonna log in with uh with my metamask wallet confirm uh this is my address so this is the list of uh of my nfts that i have connected to my um to my address right now as you can see uh two of them are my son's artwork and i'm gonna send one of them to my uh to my phone so i'm gonna type in my email address and i'm gonna send this one so right now what happens is i'm gonna assign them send a message so we will be sure that the owner of the nft is actually creating the the apple pass and the apple password is being [Music] painted and sent to my phone so right now i'm going to show you my phone okay so you should see my screen and uh now you see okay i already get the the email with the pass so it's in my email i can open it and as you can see this is the uh this is the nft that i meant uh that i added okay so i add this to the apple wallet so i can quickly access this apple wallet pass by tapping twice uh power button on my iphone as you can see this is my my pass but also i have other things like you know you can have multiple different including the the ones that are being operated with nfc connectivity so in order for me to check this i need to send this to my computer so so i can scan the qr code with my with my phone i want to do this on one device uh so i'm going to send this to my laptop right now it's going to be here in a moment yeah it's downloaded yeah it's done okay let's open it and open my camera up okay so this is this is the qr code when you scan the qr code and yeah there we are um so my apple uh pass was verified i'm the owner uh uh owen smooth me uh so as you can see this um this apple wall functionality can be used for different things one of the things that we would like to uh to explore further is um prepaid nft based gift cards and this could be a really interesting way to pay with your phone thank you very much thank you to ethno and congratulations to all the teams thank you amazing thank you so much eric this is such an awesome demo i can't wait for this to become the go-to standard for us interacting with everything in nfcs and our friends this is great um next up we have the oyster and uh we'll get that demo started as soon as the team's ready welcome hello everyone my name is sixteen i'm a designer based in paris working with lawrence with a us-based full stack developer let me tell you about the oyster but note that for clarity i'm going to talk about the creators of design objects there are designers who have a multi-form practice sometimes at the edge of arts when they are famous you can find their work in museums or on sale at sotheby's for example there is a problem with the design market design work is expensive to create a chair for example you will need to have access to raw materials to create prototypes galleries and publishers give designers resources to create but they also often influence their creation and it's not uncommon for them to take more than 50 percent of the sale price designers don't always understand the value of nfts or how to integrate it into their practice without compromising their work designers are also afraid to devalue their work by exposing it between a monkey or generated pixel art characters on the design level side they are often passionate about the design studio they love but with all the intermediaries that exist they can't really show their passion so they follow their favorite designer on instagram and they create they create beautiful pinterest box they usually buy in traditional online stores that have poor ux experience when they understand nfts and are not into crypto art they can't really find anywhere to buy creative designs and when they don't understand nfts well you know jpegs this is why we think there is a space for market innovation in design and that's why we created the oyster the oyster is a marketplace where you can buy designs just like you used to do and collect nfts or let me put it another way you can collect energies and receive designs at home for your collection as a buyer or a designer you don't even have to care for nfts or to understand it as a buyer you can just buy like you used to do claim your nifties if you want your reward collect them or sell them on secondary marketplaces as a designer you can make more value from selling your work from the traditional cell and from the royalties from the sale of your nfts those energies can be sketches drawings photography 3d models this is all part of the design process so no extra work is needed but let me show you how it works all you need to do is to run the oyster you will find both unique and series from designer once you find that share that you are looking for you can discover piece of the work behind it for example this is a sketch that is part of the design process of the creation of the chair you can buy it by crypto or using fiat this is important because we really want to onboard newbies once this is done all you have to do is to fill your profile information to receive your purchase at your home and then you will have 10 days to collect your reward during the hackathon we managed to build a demo app of the oyster we used both morales and nfc ports to mint and deploy our nfcs on the polygon blockchain let me go back to the reward so the reward is an artwork itself for the design lover and collectors by purchasing purchasing a design objects you also get a piece of the behind the scene work of the designer for the designer it's also a way to evaluate the design process in the future buyers could even prepay a design from a sketch and it will help the designer to raise funds to produce their net design projects the next step regarding our product is to have a functionable mdp with crypto and fiat payments with wallets login and traditional login option but by now the goal is to onboard as many people as possible and in the meantime we will be working on a token a mix that makes sense the oyster makes the process of buying designs and nfcs frictionless for newbies by providing collectibles to design lovers and helping designers to get revenue from their work by evaluating the creation process the oyster onboard people in web 3 through culture because we strongly believe that technology isn't driving mass adoption but culture is if you would like to be notified of our launch or to contribute visit the oyster.xyz thank you very much for your attention awesome thank you so much for that awesome demo and this is such a cool person yeah just get everybody into design and also have a way to connect physical with digital so this is amazing next up we have sar from apes to punks so sorry whenever you're ready feel free to get started with your demo [Music] hello everyone my name is sar and today i present to you apes to punks lately i've been experimenting with unchained generated nfts and more precisely experimenting with dynamic on-chain generated evolutionary entities today i'm happy to present to you apes to punks absolute punks are dynamic on chain generated evolutional nfts the apes are living on the blockchain and evolving as time passes so why is it cool the nfts are 100 percent generated on chain meaning there is no offshoring data that can get corrupted or get lost the minting capacity the meeting pipe the midnight price bonding curve is a monotonic increasing function and with every mint call on the smart contract the minting price is increasing by 10 percent the nfts are evolving over time from apes to punks the back end and smart contracts are using solidity are that svg and morales and the front end is built with react.js node.js and it's js it is now live on the polygon network and you can access this website and mint your own h2 punks let's see a demo so you can enter this enter this website you see this button here you can press mint let's put it on i press confirm okay it's insane awesome so as you can see the minting price increased by 10 percent the amount increased by one and now we can go to openc let's give it a second usually it takes time for weapon c to refresh the metadata awesome and there it is our apes to punks number nine that just just been minted and because there is and because i don't want all of you to wait two and a half years um to see the old evolution from apes to punks i will give you a sneak peek right now to what is going to happen in the next two and a half years so once i minted this nft a snapshot is taken and gradually but truly the ape will evolve slowly but really into a punk and so thank you everyone we are now live on the polygon network and you can go ahead and meet your own h2 punks thank you awesome thanks sarah that's a this is such a cool concept because not only uh it is fully generated as well as on chain but yeah you did a live demo on main net and nothing went wrong so that's great yeah so congrats all right well feel free to try out and mention uh some of these apes on on the mainnet live and uh thanks so much and uh next up we have jasper and jasper's gonna demo ar nfd explorer so jasper whenever you're ready let's uh let's get the demo started and as jasper comes in this is uh one of the [Music] demos that requires a little bit of setup so we'll we'll give a few more seconds here and get everybody ready i think uh the the audio on my device is not working at the moment so i might when i walk i'll just talk really loud so everybody brace yourself that's perfect perfect so hello everybody i developed a little app called the ar nft explorer and finding interesting nfts can really be quite difficult but also it's really boring so i wanted to just make things a little more interesting spice things up and develop a little ar demo on viewing and exploring the web of interesting nfts so i'm going to just stand up here and uh how this app works is first you can select a network so right now either polygon or mainnet let's just stick to polygon and you can enter in a smart a an address that's either a smart contract or a user's profile and once you pick an address you can hit explore nfts and you'll enter the world of ar so here we have the baby eight polygon and we can see that this it loads in some nf keys from the baby a polygon contract and we can explore them here for any of these we can just click and do them in open c but where the real power of this app comes in is we can actually look at an nft that we find interesting like let's say this this ape looks a bit interesting to us and if we click it it will actually bring in other nfts since we're looking at a collection here it'll bring in user nfts from this user's collection so i'm just gonna if you if you lose my audio just let me know i'll try to yell so as we go and as we continue exploring now we can see some nfts from this user's collection so they have stuff like the polypunk's gang they have some from not monkey kingdom uh they even have some crypto mythics and if we see nfts that we're interested in like let's take a look at this crypto dolphins we can click and it should populate once it queries some uh the metadata from the contract in this case we can see more of the crypto dolphins so we can keep following this chain and exploring and seeing interesting nfds and creating this web of ar content so i'm just going to pull in some new ones here so some users they have very few nfts so we don't get much but slowly and surely we're building this web of nfts that we can explore in ar so what's fun about this app is you can use it as just a simple viewer for your nfts or you can also find nfts that you might not have known about before this is using web xr uh we're using a frame and three.js for the rendering and what's cool about this technology is it's just via the web you don't have to download any app but that also means that it's quite experimental so not fully featured yet but uh web xr technology really interesting something that i just started last weekend but i think has a lot of potential for interesting applications in the future i just want to thank the each global team for everything you do and thanks all to all the judges and sponsors it's been a great hackathon and yeah it's a wonderful time thank you all thank you so much for that jasper yeah i think that the thing that blew my mind first of all we heard everything really well no no issues the demo work really nice no legs and the thing that blew my mind was i did not realize this was web xr until you talked about it and uh yeah for everybody a couple people ask that they try it it's just you just go to a url and it works and this is definitely going to be incredible as it rolls out and becomes more stable cheers amazing cool well thank you so much and uh for people who are interested you can head over to showcase.google.com and find jasper's project and try out the live demo great so that concludes our first five demos and they covered mostly what's happening with nfts and metaverse and gaming so next up we're going to bring another class of projects here and we're going to go into these five demos so we're going to encrypt the wordle bounty 2sq 0x corgis and polysign come on and demo and without further ado let's let's get started with the next and our next category and our first demo which is team crypto world so whenever you're ready feel free to get started [Music] hello hello all right um all right hi we are crypto world my name is marshalls and here with me is albert my we are currently located in riga latvia it's a small beautiful country near the baltic sea we have delicious food and fast internet so you should definitely come visit us once during this hackathon we have created a puzzle game powered by blockchain this week was the most fun in the last two years so thank you really much for this great opportunity we started in what we believe in we appreciate the possibilities that cryptocurrencies give to society so we wanted to jump into web 3 space and this is our first crypto related project we believe that using cryptocurrencies for simple casual purposes is the key for technological development of the whole ecosystem we are very focused on usability and looking for ways to improve user crypto experience we think that we just discovered a way how many people will buy some crypto tokens to use so what exactly are we doing here the game of wordle powered by blockchain have you heard the world it became very popular recently and people loved sharing their successful guesses in this game you have to guess some unknown word you don't know anything about swear except the number of letters if you guess the letter correctly the squared with the letter becomes green if the letter is correct but in the wrong position the square becomes yellow what we came up with is slightly different we just brought wordle to the next level crypto level um to start playing you have to log in with your crypto wallet and insert one polygon matic coin there is a six there is a word of six letters that you have to guess but the amount of attempts you can make is limited when you guess the word correctly you can create your own word and share it with people if they lose you get their coins that's really good but if another person loses the same word again you get his coin basically from this moment you already can't lose you can win many quite many many coins and you only stop winning when someone guesses your word correctly okay let me tell a few words about our team we are a team of two people um and i'm responsible for playing fortnite i'm a senior fortnight expert my partner is a hacker with 20 years experience in i.t he used to be a development manager but has quit because he couldn't live without hacking he is actually thinking about joining some cool crypto startup in the nearest future so don't miss the opportunity especially if you also are in love with dot net and blazer okay how did we make it the technologies we used are net and blazerweb assembly we deployed smart contracts with polygon network of course the smart contracts were freedom with solidity and deployed retrainings to connect polygon blockchain from c sharp code this project uses open source library this guy is insane he didn't sleep last night again but was coding whole time to make it perfect some bugs are still present for example at this very moment you can automatically get back your winnings but still we came from total zero to a working app we have many plans for the nearest weeks or maybe the months like leaderboard with the most winnings some voting where users can vote for the next feature they want introduction about how to easily get coins we also wanted to make it more to make it completely decentralized also integrate other wallets for example we are definitely going to use sequence wallet we already wanted to have it but we were short of time and there were many things to do we're also planning to do some growth hacking the game is catchy and totally playable you will soon hear about it so you definitely should try and share to let more people participate let's make this viral and let's bring cryptocurrencies to masses this is it now i only want to say thank you very much for an outstanding event it was a lot of fun to do hacking together i hope you to see you in amsterdam soon amazing well mars wilson albert thank you so much for that amazing demo we're already getting uh comments from everybody that there they loved this little slide demo and everything you said so uh this is a perfect example of just a fun hackathon project that is just super cool and fun to interact with so this is great and i hope you actually get this in the hands of other people to try this out congrats thank you thank you very much we really enjoyed that we're glad that uh you were part of the events and you got to do this fun thing and and thanks for demoing so with that we are ready for our next demo and that is bounty so point whenever you're ready we're ready to get started awesome that was a uh that was a very cute demo guys all right um we are bouncy um so it's me and david and we're based in san francisco so what bounty is is a inverse kickstarter normally a creator would pitch an idea and you get to fund it but in this case we want fans to pitch the idea you can fund it as a shared treasury you can vote on whether the creator is fulfilling milestones and all of the treasury and the funds are handled by a smart contract um so we're going to role play this a little bit i'm going to be a fan uh david is going to speak on the part of the author george rr martin and here we go yeah wow i can't believe george r martin's on this on this platform that's uh that's pretty crazy i i really want him to do something for me um so you know i have a lot of options here i can change whatever price that i want to give him i can change his overall date his payout structure but i think i i just saw something that i really wanted to already get done which is to remake game of thrones season eight um because i think it sucked and so uh someone else has already made this i'm actually just gonna contribute to it um and in this case like i'm i'm going to give 0.1 matic um to the treasury and what that's going to do is add it to the shared balance and then if we go over here to george r martin's view oh boy another day another bounty for game of thrones eh oh i don't know it looks like well in this case it's zero but it should be 0.1 matic but uh so little off i think i i will only do it for 0.2 um and you know what i'm i'm actually just going to remake the ending so um that's that's too too long too too much for the entire season all right so when we come over here and this transaction is going to take a little bit that we'll see that the uh the bounty has been funded with what i put in um and when it goes into this negotiating status we'll see that george rr martin he's interested and he has these terms for me so what i can do right now is i can either get my money back or i can rejoin but i actually do want season 8 to be to happen so i'm going to rejoin and in addition i'm going to add an extra 0.1 so that's going to hit this guy's reserve price and what that means is george r martin's now he's committed right like he's going to have to do this um he's on the hook for giving me what i want and we'll we'll see what that looks like on his end well it'll take a little bit it looks like um oh it looks like they accepted it or uh this this submission has gone through so i need to create a new revision now and you know to start i think i never really liked the original casting for jon snow and i want to see if i can recast them for this first update let's see what the fans think of that and whether or not they'll give me my next bonus target you know i thought jon snow was fine the way that he was uh i thought kid harrington was fine i'm gonna take my money back i'm gonna vote no on this i'm taking that bonus target back and it's going right in my wallet um i i think george r martin's really phoning this one in and he needs to try to try harder so we're here refreshed and we'll wait for it to go through it's a polygon test network is a little bit slow today so we'll see yeah so so basically the steps are uh submitting revisions and we'll see what happens here and it looks like uh you know i gotta try for bonus target two this time um and you know here instead i need to work a little harder so i'll replace both of them both daenerys and john and hopefully this will get convinced them this time around uh uh you know i really hated that first picture this one looks completely different i'm i'm not really sure what it is about this piece of art that uh it's making me vote yes but i i really like it and george martin's he's gonna take my money right now um and so when we switch this over and this finishes we'll actually see well actually we can we can check to order martin's balance right at this moment we'll see that you know he got some money um he's gonna be getting some more in the in the form of uh bonuses once this goes through um and once it goes through actually what happens is that uh we'll we'll mention nfc at the end of this um and we'll show you what that looks like um so you know mentioning the nft uh george r martin does this but everyone who was involved in the bounty will get ownership of the final nfc uh the nft gets assigned to the bounty contract itself and uh we will show you what that looks like here so eventually this is on testnet you can see here's what we've minted and inside of the description uh you know there's a metadata thing and also the addresses and who owns what um and the idea is that you'd be able to do this for digital art um commission your artists and get some portion of their nfts uh the the idea um we're gonna keep working on it in the next week um you're feel free to please join our discord we have a little link here uh we're at bountyprotocol.xyz and yeah if you if you wanna reach out to us we're on twitter too so um thank you for the hack phone that's great david thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh i can i agree with all the comments we're getting anyway which is the proposed revisions are way better than the the original so i hope this gets accepted uh the next remake so congrats and with that we are ready for our next demo so without further ado i'd like to welcome the sean to talk about 2sq [Music] you karthik um so my name is nishant and my project was 2sq you can find it at 2sq.xyz so the problem that i'm trying to solve is that the current nft community space is a little bit fragmented a few communities are on twitter a few of them on discord and if you want to know what's going on you probably have to join their discord um verify yourself and see what the people are saying once you do that you still don't know if the people that are talking in these communities like on twitter and discord actually own the nft and um say you want to join a new nft project um tomorrow you have to join that discord and then you have to join a bunch of communities and makes it a lot harder so i wanted to bring everything to one place uh on one platform where different nft communities can interact with each other so i think all of us saw apes to punk demo a few minutes ago so let's go to their page so now we're at apes to punk's page and you can see all the messenger screen sharing is not enabled yet right so yeah yeah okay so uh we're at abc punk's page right now and you can see that all of the nft metadata like the name the picture um even the address and you can also see that the um like we all automatically detect if this address was a polygon address or an ethereum address so now we see that you can only mint or you can only post on this page if you own an nft from apes to punk so let's connect my wallet okay now i'm logged in so it's going to verify my ownership and you can see that now i have an option to post so i'm going to say hey how is everyone and the support markdown as well so i can make it header for the background and so on i also found this nice name so i'm gonna share this with everyone when i post uh so you can see it's waiting for a few seconds and my post is live it even shows the nfc that i own within the community and other posts as well right um so let's go back to the home page and let's go to the little lemon friends page right i don't own an nft from this collection so um once it verifies my address you can see that it it doesn't allow me to post so that is that sort of form of within communities where if i want to post on the little lemons page uh i have to mint an nft file or i have to buy nft from that collection right and you can also notice that it shows ether scan on that page so let's come back to the home page again and let's go to the personal section so this is where you can see all your nft collections so right now i'm just going to click on this one and there you go i'm on the build space and ft collection and you can also see post that's going on around the space so um if you're part of a community you can invite everyone and have a great time here thank you thank you for that demo this is cool and not only uh did you make a really uh just make a mainnet demo but uh this also uses a project that just demoed 30 minutes ago uh hipster punks and uh we're already in the composability phase of uh using all these things so for anybody who just meant it name2punk from mainnet you can uh go to 22msk.xyz and say hi so thanks again to sean and with that we are ready for our next demo i want to welcome andrew to talk about xerox 40s hello so let me uh we are zero x corgi so let me share my screen so uh pretty much ox corgis we are making web3 docs into cute and informative mini games so the problem is everyone has documentation can we make it a little bit one percent better or a little bit different with little types of puzzle games mini games some of the pain points we see throughout the hackathon is just reading docs and then trying to get started right so our solution is to build learn earn or explore or play and we're trying to convert web redox into fun informative games in itself so we'll see that kind of like our analogy would be it's like a dulingo which is like a learning language app plus clippy which is kind of like a microsoft assistant that will help you guide you through onboarding process as well so here's kind of like a screenshot of our chrome extension uh having uh pretty much your friend cody and you that person that assistant will help you through the documentation and it only will show on different types of docs across the board so the technology is built with metamask polygon ipfs react hard hat and the contract was built in solidity deployed on testnet so i want to do a quick demo so right here when you go to the app you can see that's this is the main page uh so the goal is to defeat imposter syndrome and explore the web3 space so i'm going to head to press start and you can see there are little different types of levels we have a global polygon so why not i just try e global i want to learn more i want to hit about to eat global and i will connect my wallet once it's connected you put in some polygon to play and that will send a transaction so let me go check pending and then you can play some of these mini games in itself so let's say what is eve global so if i say eat global and try to get it wrong uh it will turn the borders red but let's say helps on onboard developers and designers to web3 check and then the process this is that you can earn like nft or mint it uh in itself now let's move on to the chrome extension where you could actually it becomes like more of an onboarding platform so if i do polygon you would see here that you have your assistant and it will pop up you can say like maybe you want to turn it on and off so you have that option as well and what's cool is that you want to learn more about that documentation and it'll guide you through so it gives you some of these paths of polygon so let's say if you want to onboard yourself to web3 so i'm going to say hello metamask it goes through and highlights it with gradients of the steps so if i want to do step one click downloads and some of the sets will pop up so it would be as well so like step two and i'll show you how to get installed and get ready and then others will be like if you want to add to polygon it can get more complex and the game games will be more like scavenger hunts but sometimes reading documentation i can go through this or i can ask for help and with that i can actually see that it will give you hints so if i want to scroll bottom it will show me those gradients or if you want to just play the mini games you can so you can say like what is about polygon i can connect and still put in some polygons funds and then they'll show you some of these mini games or puzzles so let's say this is it uh i got this wrong or i can click and get it right and then i earned these batches so then the next steps for this project would be maybe skins nft badges that will change the character or the chrome or your partner and also we can try to create more different types of mascots it doesn't have to be corgis a lot of times we can make new characters for each of the different web 3 orgs and then try to make it and build it up like more like crypto zombies or ethernets that will teach you solidity rust python and javascript languages for web3 so it can be expansive with different characters and different a lot of explorations or build your identity with that chrome extension so and if you want to learn more um thank you for the event uh we'll pretty much be deploying it to mainnet and the chrome extension will be published in the future you can follow us um pretty much um ox corgis or just chat on nmtv youtuber awesome thank you so much for that demo andrew i think this is just uh we're seeing so much education um focus kind of content coming on uh just in what three and i think the thing that kind of delighted me was that the chrome extension piece that you get to like point people to go here and and follow these next steps and just sort of do all these things just makes it so interesting to kind of fund way more people and uh everyone has docs not everybody has to read the docs but interactivity is kind of the key here especially for people who are either trying to become developers or understand the nuances so this is great i hope you continue interesting and uh i hope that we all get to use it i mean i think we can already use it but we always use it for more more protocols and projects and uh and categories thank you for the event congrats all right so um next up we have sign and now we're just getting a um a confirmation on some technical issues here so we'll give this a 30 second kind of uh wait and um if we don't get those resolved then we'll move on to the next team but i want to just i'm hopeful here we haven't had too many things go wrong so we'll figure this out in a few seconds and in the meantime for uh anybody and i'm already seeing a few questions on the chat so if you have any questions about sort of what's happening whether it's for the wrap-up or any kind of follow-up questions that you had about the event please uh just kind of type them out here and i'll be able to answer those questions for for everybody and just a quick note on how the prices are going to go that's the most common question we have gotten um so don't worry we have six more demos to go and after that we'll be solely focused on covering all the prizes and uh you'll kind of see who won everything and what and everything that you need to know about how do you receive the prizes how do you claim them what the timelines are and if something didn't go according to expectations like what to do there in terms of any dispute resolutions or or the ability to kind of go and get another response from from anybody so that's kind of the context we are on track here and let's see what's going on so i'll wait a few more seconds here and uh and just get a quick uh confirmation from our next team all right so let's just get started with our next project which is allocate so we already have jason alfonso here and uh whenever and we'll also get nathan on uh consume so whenever you're ready okay team feel free to kick off with your demo welcome thank you very much so hello everybody my name is jason and i'm with the allocate team we are a team of four developers and the problem that we're trying to solve is how do you teach your children to use crypto safely and confidently oh more than that and our solution is by teaching them defy and investing allowances in a safe environment managed by parents so i'll give you a quick demo so upon landing on our page you'll notice you have a couple different ways of logging in and onboarding you can utilize web3 auth or you can sign in with sequence so upon landing or signing in as a parent you're going to be welcomed on your own dashboard this dashboard has been pre-populated already with uh some usdcx that is a superfluid super token that we use to stream funds and allowances to the children you have the ability to top up your account and to withdraw funds and you want to add your children as simply as putting in either their username or their actual name whatever you prefer providing their web address or sorry their wallet address and setting whether or not they're allowed to withdraw funds and we'll get to that a little later once you've added your children you can add funds to them or send funds to them individually you can create a stream and send funds to them over time and if you have more than one child you can send funds to them at the same time using the super fluid instant distribution agreement you're able to see at a glance the activity of your child's investments how they're handling their funds and you're in and then that you're yeah and then you're able to send more funds to them so this is a quick rundown of what it looks like from the perspective of a parent if we were to go over to the child dashboard which again a child can log in with their social media google twitter twitch and we can see already that there are funds streaming into the child's account in real time they have the ability to top up their account and right now we have an allocation so the child has already allocated some funds so when you allocate funds what you're doing is you're setting a goal for the future in this case peter set a goal that he wants an xbox and you can add additional allocations to an existing allocation so right here if we added say 15 usdcx you're going to be able to earn rewards on these allocations and on these goals so if your account is a full access account from the parent you can earn additional rewards you can actually earn interest on this usdcx if it's a locked account then you'll only be able to earn the allocate tokens so if we add our funds you can see at a glance that we have 32 available funds left of peters that he's able to manage he's got 27 funds totally invested and at the moment he's got 18 allocate tokens and these tokens will be able to be used in the future throughout our platform and now when it comes to withdrawing funds let's say that peter's all done he's all done managing and he wants to withdraw his funds a key component to our platform is that if the parent set up those permissions that we talked about and gave full access then when you go to transfer your funds that those funds are going to go to your externally owned wallet and you'll be able to use those funds across any crypto market but if your funds are locked right funds but your account sorry the permissions are set and there it's in a locked state it means that you're working inside a sandbox and when trying to do a transfer what's going to happen is that those funds are going to be diverted back to the parent and the parent will be able to pay out the child in fiat so that's a quick rundown of our application we have our sponsor integration where we use polygon to reduce our gas fees we use superfluid as they handle the streaming of allowances to children and we use sequence and web3 off as they both allow the children to create a wallet and online log in with web2 social accounts we do have a roadmap after this hackathon we're hoping to upgrade our staking rewards introduce education portals and be production ready stage 3 would consist of introducing nft marketplace and community incentives and phase 4 where we want to introduce liquidity and sandbox pools we are live on the polygon network so check us out thank you very much amazing thank you so much for that uh that awesome demo and it's so glad to see uh tools and uh things being built for a younger generation and just being ready for 21st century so this is great i hope this goes live for everybody to use it and check it out and uh congrats again for demoing live thank you very much all right so this brings us to our last five teams that are going to come on and uh and demo so we're going to bring on paulie sign ali share hashtag scribe beep so without further ado let's welcome chris to uh demo polysign love chris all right hey everybody uh let me just share my screen and we can get going all right uh well hey everybody my name is chris and i i am a software engineer actually working out of boston and i put together an app called polysign now uh if any of you have e-signed documents or signed documents in the last year maybe a few months you might be familiar with an app called docusign which uh you can use to send e-signature requests to virtually anybody now the problem with this is that it's highly centralized and docusign is technically collecting this uh fee per month regardless of your usage and regardless of like uh uh you know how how often you want to want to use it or how many team members you have so i wanted to use a polygon and in particular some of the other sponsors to enable anybody that has a web3 account to send e-signature requests and acknowledgements to other people based on addresses rather than requiring things like emails or other sort of identity because blockchain can actually serve a lot of way in a lot of ways as an identity provider so this uh this form is actually very simple so the way this works is anybody can come in with a web3 wallet or a polygon account and create a new signature request i have an example here that's just like a condo agreement and uh you know right now i have it hooked up to metamask but i also have a flag that could be used with uh sequence so whatever wallet the end user wants to use doesn't really matter as long as you have the funds and are unable to just pay the gas fees um so what could cost 10 on ethereum just to send any signature requests now can be done for a fraction of that using matic and polygon so i have an example document but this is just like assign this.pdf this could be virtually anything could be a collection of documents and once i'm good with this request i can submit it and there's a couple things that happen uh behind the scenes so the first thing is that a polygon contract gets deployed and most importantly is this address at the bottom so this is actually saying who can actually sign this request so this request actually gets deployed um and so not everybody you want to be able to sign this particular uh contract um so i just entered the same address i used for my existing wallet because i'm going to be the one that signs it for the demo but that could be could have been anybody and we enforce that only the address listed there can be the one that signs the agreement the second step that happens is uh an upload of uh the documents attached to the original request and so sorry zoom is in the way a little bit there um but this is like hosted on more uh facilitated by morales to host the the metadata associated with this request and now it's forever preserved um all the assets information needed to fill that contract are now available here um so that's just the metadata i provided uh the second link is the polygon contract and that's actually deployed on mumbai and so the information about the contract who can sign it is actually saved uh forever in in the blockchain rather than actually having it hosted on docusign and so really i'm just paying gas fees rather than paying a centralized party uh the last url is potentially the most important one and so this is the url that you would actually share with your colleague and so i'm already logged in with the same account so i uh if i weren't logged in with this account it would say hey you're not the authorized party you can't sign these documents so the exact same information is available to your friend that you want to sign this agreement and so you would just send them this url say hey i want to sign this i can actually upload like open that particular document uh let me just move this again uh this is just a landlord recommendation letter this could be anything and i'm just want to acknowledge it um if those look good to me i just say accept type my initials draw my signature sign it and so remember i'm actually the signing party now and what happens behind the scenes is there's there's two big things one we generate an nft to represent hey i signed it at this point in time there's also a contract interaction that happens against that polygon contract to indicate i signed it and it uploads an image of my signature with it as well so now we have the signature as well as the documents stored on ipfs to represent that document exchange lastly you could go back to the site and look up all the activity that happened against a particular address so if i did a particular deploy i can simply go back here and see like okay here all the e-signatures i have out here the ones that i'm collecting i have some other activity on this address but in theory this could just be a list of all the e-signature requests you have going out and be able to see the contracts as they evolve so 34 seconds ago this was actually the confirmation that went through so there's an nft that saved as well as a contract iteration uh interaction that marks the e-signature request as fulfilled um but that's pretty much the polysign project today and uh thanks for your time thank you so much for that demo chris and uh yeah this is such a cool utility that uh is finally ready for a web 2013 hot swap replacement with no uh differences for the end user so this is great um cool thank you so much and with that we are ready for our next demo so i want to welcome highway to talk about ollieshare so whenever you're ready we're going to get started all right thanks hello everyone my name is hunwi i'm currently located in singapore and actually i'm not exactly a web developer but i'm actually a video producer animator and medium writer this is my very first webtree hackathon and i joined this hackathon alone so i don't have a team and the project on my entry is called alisha alicia is a decentralized application that allows nlp creators to distribute revenues to all their nlp owners now the key idea here is to enable long-term energy projects to reward all their energy owners as investors so with this platform nfd creators can distribute revenues that are generated from royalties social media monetization sales for in-app purchase dlc from games merge sales and even brand collaborations so to bring this idea to life i wrote a contract called dynamic payment splitter it's called dynamic because it is very flexible when it comes to the handling of payment splitting even though there is a change of nfd ownership so let me just give you a quick example so for example um person a and person b are the owners of this particular nft project that gives a distributed revenues so let's say one day the entity creator decides to distribute some revenues so both of them will receive revenues because they are the owners of this energy project however let's say some time later on person a decides to sell all his entities to person b then during the next distribution person a will not receive anything because he is no longer the owner of that nfd and on top of that i also built a website and i use moralis to interact with the smart contract as a result of this integration both sending and receiving of the distributed funds can be performed by both naft creators and nfp owners making this platform a one-stop solution for distributed revenues without further ado let me just give you a quick demo on how it works all right so this is a website that i built here's a landing page let me just very quickly log in with a meta mask okay it's not loading and just refresh it again because i have to login again okay okay here i am logged in already so let me go to this page called distribute so for this uh demo i'm just gonna use one of the projects that i just deployed as a demo this is the project that i deployed to polygon main net is in the midnight right now it's called all this rehearsal and this is how the artworks look like so i am just going to copy the smart contract address of this entity project back to audishare select the network.esp deployed to which is polygon mainnet paste the address and retrieve the details to ensure that i'm connecting to the right project so here we have all these rehearsal two owners and let's say for this demo i'm going to adjust 0.05 metric okay click distribute okay confirm the payment all right it says here transaction is successful very nice now on the other hand let me show you what happens let's say if you are one of the recipient of the distributed revenue so to show this let me just log out this account and i will log in with another economics okay let me log in sign it okay now let's go to receive all right over here we have a dashboard to show uh how much this person has received again you can see the project title here it's called all this rehearsal you see the total revenue that has been distributed by the creator so far and over here you can see the exact uh history of the transaction as well and over here the balance so whenever this person withdraws the balance will become zero so let's try to withdraw right now okay let's confirm it and we'll check the transaction over here to see if it successfully increased the amount it's confirmed already but we are still waiting for the amount to increase all right so there we have it this person has successfully received the distributed revenues from the creators now back to my slides so in case you're wondering um ollie is a character that i've created and i'm actually an nfp creator as well what you're looking right now is the teaser trailer for my nft project called all this audition tip now the reason why i built alisha is because i've been looking high and low for a platform that can allow me to distribute revenues to all my analytic owners but i can't find any so i decided to build on my own so what's next where do we go from here well audi share is already online it's live on the polygon main net although it's an advantage but having said that feel free to visit earlyshare.com to give it a try and you can let me know your feedback as well and if you're interested about my entity project feel free to visit all this auditiontips.com and the qr code that looking right now contains all my social media handles if you are interested to reach out to connect i'll be very happy to do so and yep that's all from me thank you so much for having me here amazing thank you so much and uh this is so cool for you to uh share more about the illustrations and the animation you made this is awesome and i'm glad that you're able to do this live so i hope you continue building this thing and i'll be sure to uh check out the audition myself all right with that we are ready for our next demo and i want to welcome team hash scan to come on and get started with showcasing what they built welcome auxiliary hi everyone uh my name is alex and we've built hash scan the free user analytics on this hackathon we worked in a team of three people i worked on data and back end virtual worked on front-end app and alex helped us with with product we've built event-based analytics for user segments uh right now if you have a community or a d app and you want to get an insight on your users on chain activity you will have a hard time doing so most tools are very complicated and we want to build a new type of analytics which is different in two things first it is focused on users rather than protocols and projects and second it's easily accessible by but not for non-technical people so they can compose queries very very fast let me show you let me show you a demo this is hash scan web app first you should select a segment of users a segment of users can consist of multiple filters for instance this is a segment of users who owns at least one lobster dial nft we can see how how the amount of those users changed over time uh we can also take on this segment on the users who owns at least 10 of them what's more interesting you can compose filters uh let's take a segment of those who owns at least one board a club token and 75 friends with benefits tokens which is a full membership in in that community and we can see how this uh user segment how amount of these users in this segment changed over time next when you selected a segment you can choose an event and you can see an event analytics for this user segment in this demo we've we've made analytics for looks rare traits and you can see how many times holders of board ape club traded in each day on on looks on luke's rare we can we can take me beats and compare it and we'll see that and me beats holders traded twice more um all right what's what's what's interesting here is we can take for example uh a user segment based on ethereum activity and see how they um in how they interacted with with other on polygon because both chains are evm compatible which is cool uh in the future it would be interesting to support more type of events for instance for for filters uh for instance if you can get a segment of users who trade it on openc based on their trading events and even further it would be useful to allow you to import your segment of users from your backend and then you can take those who are nft trader and compare or just analyze which nft marketplace they prefer and you can you can make a product a product decision based on that to do that we we scan smart contract events for a lot of data we we have to we have to collect a lot of data we place it in click house database which is which is a database design for analytics it allows us to do very very fast requests and queries from back end and reduce response time on front-end app click house is also highly scalable and it fits very well for for our use case in the future you want to support event-based analytics we also ideally want to allow you to see and analyze events and smart contract calls of any smart contract we we also want to add more type of charts such as looking at unique users who performed an event or looking at every time a user performed an event from from a segment you have selected thank you uh hashkan is live you can test it on hashcon.xyz follow us on twitter and we plan to support and develop this project further if you have a d app or protocol and you're interested in analytics like that i would love to hear your ideas just just let's chat on twitter thank you awesome alex and team thank you so much for that demo and it is super awesome to see that you not only managed to do this cool thing that everybody needs right now but it's also live and ready for others to try out so uh congrats again and i hope everybody who's interested in getting their project supported on ash can uh reaches out to alex and team and uh and get that integration going so we have two more demos to go and then we'll get to all the prizes so without further ado let's welcome scribe how's it going i'm marcus and i described my screen here cool so hi everybody we're scribe and we've created a transpiler that takes evm compatible code and converts that to code that can run on polygon's new zk roll up network polygon mining so most developers know what solidity is but not everybody knows what yule is so yule is this intermediary language between solidity and the ethereum virtual machine so when a developer creates a contract and solidity it first compiles down to yule and then compiles down to the evm opcodes so this allows a developer to have really low level control over smart contracts and this will come in handy as we talk about scribe you know in the upcoming slides here so another thing to be familiar with going to describe is polygon midan so midan is polygon's new zk roll up network which is a stark-based zk roll-up enabling faster and cheaper transactions and there are no delays between l2 l1 and l2 transfers so this opens up a lot of use cases that can be really cool but out of the box midan isn't evm compatible and that's where scribe comes in so what scribe does is it takes evm compatible cold and it translates it then compiles it down to run on the mining vm so the way that the way that actually works is it takes a yule contract and first converts it into a string then passing it into some grammar parsing logic so this logic is looking for statements and expressions in mule and packs those all together to create an abstract syntax free and then passes it to the mind assembly logic that actually creates the minded op codes that can run on the minor vm so there's some really big benefits to this first solidity viper and you'll plus all compile to yule which means that a smart contract developer can write a contract in solidity and then compile it to yule and then use scribe to actually have that code run on the mind and vm second it allows developers to use high-level constructs like variables and not have to deviate from familiar design patterns or frameworks that they already use and lastly it allows for interoperability between the ethereum virtual machine and the mine and virtual machine again allowing developers to focus on writing good clean secure code and less time worrying about environments and tooling and we got a quick demo here about how scribe works in practice so we've got some contracts here that we're going to be demoing you can see we've got like an addition contract to find a couple variables then we've got a fibonacci example and we got this binary called scribe and you just run it and it's an interactive mode now so it'll show you the steps and so simple example if you want to add one to the result of multiplying two and three here then we're gonna parse this we're gonna turn it into this ast you can see the expressions there and then that's gonna turn into mind and assembly and uh the core uh operation in midan is like dealing with the stack and so here it's going to push one onto the stack then two then three and then it's gonna gonna call multiply which will pop two and three off multiply them together and push six back onto the stack then we're gonna call the add operation which will add that one and six that's remaining on the stack together and then when we run that through the mind virtual machine we're going to get seven then uh we can also handle variables um which of course are not like by default supported in mode and vm so we need to like keep track of where they are in memory and stuff so when you run that you can see our ist can parse it and get the declarations and the references and then this is the the code that it will generate and it'll pop it'll push the literals that we've used for the variables into the stack and then it's going to pop that from the stack into memory and then later on when we need it again it's going to push it from the stack and push it from the memory into the stack again so that will give us 43 results of adding 42 and one uh and then here this is just a generator that will find the 12th fibonacci number written newell and ast is pretty big i won't go through all of it but you can see we've now got four loops conditionals blocks assignment all that good stuff and uh there's a lot of mind assembly that it generates but the result of it is uh 89 which is the 12th fibonacci number so yeah been really fun to work on this back to back to you then so yeah this has been an awesome hackathon um the team is myself ox kitsune control c plus control v who couldn't be here for the presentation but has been a huge huge part of this project and then marcus buffett who's been integral to this as well in the future we're looking to complete yield grammar add end to end compatibility from solidity all the way down to the minor vm and more and we're super excited to carry this forward so this has been an awesome experience we've learned a tremendous amount and a huge huge thank you to youth global polygon all the sponsors and a big congratulations to all the other hackers this has been absolutely awesome thanks again everybody thank you so much and i am still blown away what but you managed to do this thing over the basic of three days and this is such a cool way to kind of get everybody to uh go into zk roll ups and uh make that easy for everybody to uh to try out what's possible with evm compatibility so congrats and i hope you continue building this and we want to definitely get to full compatibility here right so with that we are ready for our last demo of the day and without further ado like to welcome beep.xyz so whenever you're ready um yeah hey guys so that was that was awesome subscribe awesome project but i'm here to present the xyz um just let me share my screen real quick all right so here we go beep.xyz is the cold messaging of web3 so before we get into the demo which i'm super excited about let's just see why kind of let's just talk through why cold messaging really sucks in web 2. so i just took a casual screenshot of my discord of someone maybe having thousands of bot account to promote their own project which lead to the problem of really bad spam for casual platforms like discord so this lead to not a good user experience but on the other end of the spectrum we have more professional networks like linkedin which basically is pay us to message our users like did you know a recruiter plan costs 9 000 per year and um people are paying for those plans in order to cold message people that they are not connected to but as users we are not getting any of that money so really not cool and this is why i have beep.xyz it is completely addressed to address so um the other person does not need a beep account for you to be able to message them you only need their address and in a second i'm going to demonstrate all three of those points and why is it so much better than the alternatives in web 2. all right here we go so i am playing as phoenix and my good friend and partner boba fett is looking to add more muscles to our team right and i know this really good hunter this mandalorian he's um he's phenomenal but he's not super savvy so he doesn't yet have a beep.xlizzy account however i have his address so i am still able to message him i'm just going to give him my usual recruiting template looking for some side cash so as you can see since he's not following me back and he doesn't have any uh he's not yet using beep.xyz i have to stake some token in order to message request them um so think of this maybe as the linkedin email of webs3 right instead but instead of a centralized entity like linkedin obviously taking all the profit when i signed that transaction i am authorizing mendel to withdraw the tokens that i have saved for him whenever he accept my message request so um the money directly goes into mendo's wallet it's no longer linkedin we don't need any middlemen alright so it's all done and now i will be role playing as mando i heard of this really cool website deep.xie where i can get some side hustle and i am always down for some side cash so i'm logging in for the first time i do not have uh i do not have an existing account right so i don't have any message but i got a message request from phoenix looking for some side cash so yes i am looking for some side cash so i will accept her request and whenever i accept a message request i am basically accepting a friend request in web 2. so i am able to message phoenix freely from their point on so she does not need to stake any more token in order to message me um i guess we can think of this as a linkedin connection once we have accepted each other we can message each other freely so the transaction is done and phoenix's message is in my main inbox all right now that that worked out so um i'm going to just wrap up the presentation i don't want to take any more time before the prizes so um i think um just maybe some fun just maybe some final thoughts think of how many websites you actually have your credit card enter in order to pay someone right you like a lot right i can think of maybe tens maybe 100 a lot of websites but think about the other side how many websites do you actually have your bank information there in order to get paid right like i don't know i don't have that many so i think this is really the key driver here and this is really what enable us to pay someone directly to message request them instead of having a middleman like linkedin obviously capturing all the value um so thank you i am i'm at beep.xyz on twitter i'm also looking for inviting the first users to try out the app um the website is beep.xyz you guessed it so thank you thanks for having me there and thanks kartik awesome well thank you so much for demoing and building this cool app i hope lots of other people get to try it out too all right well that concludes all 15 of our demos and i want to thank all these amazing teams for kind of coming on here and doing these things live uh it's always a nervous moment for everybody where you don't know if the live demo is going to work or not work and i was so glad to not only see that everything worked out really well but i just want to quickly point out that majority of these products that you saw were already live and ready for maintenance and that is just incredible that is another data point and just saying things are actually ready for mass adoption and i can't wait for uh more people to try out what everybody built today so congratulations to all 15 of our
