you good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of eat global and i want to welcome all of you to the market make finale we have an amazing next couple of hours playing for all of you today and uh i want to kick off this and then get to the the great parts of starting off our amazing demos so we've been doing a lot of online events over the past 12 months and uh to uh to make the experience a lot more interactive and and have it adapt to what we're doing we we've designed our live page to reflect uh what's happening in the stream so all of you are joining us here on live.ethelglobal.com and i want to make sure that you kind of get the chance to check out uh this page you can see the the video on on the left here uh we have a chat for all of our attendees on the right side there's a video you can enjoy and take breaks and i'll also encourage all of you to kind of sign in to the chat and play with your avatars and use that to ask us any questions or make any comments and we'll be able to relay them right into the live stream so market make is an event organized by eat global and for those of you who don't know eth global is an organization whose mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the what three ecosystem uh this event is our first event of 2021 and before we jump into how this was uh designed and how this came to be i wanted to just take a quick couple of minutes and summarize 2020 for us 2020 was one of our largest years in terms of events and impact we kicked off the year last year with our first and only in-person event in east london where we hosted a few hundred developers in the city of london then we moved on to hack money which was our first online and d5 focused event and over the summer we ran hackfest which was a collaboration between protocol labs and eve global where we worked on and helped the looks like we have some av issues what l2 is sorry about that uh we had we ran hacker fest in partnership with falcon and protocol labs we worked on web3 and decentralized storage related hacks and then we moved on to our biggest event so far eat online which was a near thousand percent event uh with five different summits uh on different topics anywhere from scaling to privacy to the future of ethereum and needs to overall throughout 2020 we hosted 1900 hackers and close to 4 000 summit attendees from all different domains and experiences and backgrounds and these participants came from 87 different countries spanning 21 different time zones we never thought we'd be able to make an impact at this scale and reach this global audience and we're excited to do this and even beat our own expectations for this year and that brings us to market make sure market make was our first event uh focused on lending specifically and also how we wanted to kick off 2021. for this event we hosted 490 hackers from 58 different countries and they spent across 17 different time zones they've all been working on really amazing hacks for the last three weeks and with the hub of 30 plus mentors and 10 companies who came in as sponsors and our supporters we kind of had an amazing event here so i want to quickly just thank some of our companies who made this event possible uh first off it is ave then i want to thank ethereum foundation one inch chain link matic uma and ens who were there to support at the event in our hackers and building uh projects using their their protocols and then i also want to thank the graph avagachi alumnus capcoin gecko and queen market cap for supporting market bank and three weeks of intense hacking and uh and learning and talks and workshops we finally got to the end uh where last sunday we had all of our teams and attendees submit their projects the the outcome and the impact of this has been absolutely phenomenal we had 134 projects that came out of this event and we spent the last three days uh judging and going through all of our projects thanks to the amazing set of uh over 20 judges that helped out with this process and from there we were able to get to a list of our 12 finalists who we want to highlight today uh these are some of our 12 favorite projects and uh today is dedicated to showcasing what they've done and having them do a demo of what their hack was so i want to quickly just introduce what these 12 teams are who these 12 teams are and in in no specific order i want to congratulate orca protocol flash sweet gearbox protocol len 2 protocols revert arbitrage coinfu mobile apparate and claimable these 12 teams will be coming on here and and showcasing everybody what they've done and uh we are ready to kick this off so one thing when we came up we got kind of the final list of these projects was uh they all sort of fell into these nice interesting categories they were a really good uh set of lending and novice specific hacks and we saw a lot of interesting primitives and protocols specifically focused on defy and composability of d5 protocols and then we had a an obvious category that focused on infrastructure and analytics and how to actually best take advantage of all the public information that's out there and before we move on to our first demo i also want to take a second and kind of mention that just because a project was not listed on this this top 12 it does not mean you were not good enough or there was something that was not worth talking about or highlighting i want to specifically thank all 122 projects here that still put in the same amount of time and work and energy to make this event a success and and not only just that they continue to push uh themselves into trying new things playing with new protocols giving new uh tools a try we had an amazing set of over 100 people who had never done any what three development and uh we got a lot of them to showcase and talk about their progress throughout the judging process and i want to congratulate all of you for uh still uh pushing forward and demoing what you've done all these hacks are are available on hack.deepglobal.com and you should be able to go to this website and check out everything that was submitted for this event so we hope that all of you keep working and in publishing these projects and getting more feedback and improving them and with that i want to kick us off with our very first set of demos we have four amazing people who are joining us today we have stanley kulachav from ave ashley from unit swap linda shea from scalar capital and spencer noon from varian fund they'll be here with us today uh giving their feedback and comments and questions to all of our 12 teams and without further ado i want to kick us off with our very first demos we'll have the infrastructure category come up first uh we'll have flash suite revert coin flynn claiming we'll present uh back to back and then we'll do a group q a for all four of these projects and uh we'll have this opportunity to ask and share any feedback so uh with that um please welcome flash suite with our very first demo for our finale okay all right thank you karthik for that introduction so we're flash suite um we're just we're gonna kick off the demo right about now okay so just wanna make sure can everybody hear me and uh see my presence okay awesome all right uh what's up everyone our product is flash suite my name is lee i'm from new york city and my background is in wall street and finance my team consists of three other members they are mikael our ux ui designer elaine our architect from france and ralph and raf are a full stack engineer from london so what is flashlight it's a set of tools that empowers non-technical users to better take advantage of flashlights and in this toolkit we currently have two tools one our flash arb and two are flash flows so let me take you through each of them so the first set of tool the first tool in our tool kit is flashard flashdarb is a price discrepancy monitor and its goal is to empower non-technical users to be able to be able to identify and execute arbitrage trade opportunities using flashlights let me demonstrate so now it's loading um as you see in this matrix of price discrepancies we have five d5 dexes which are ver uh which are visually displayed with the price differences of coin pairs just listed on each of these exchanges so yeah the pairs are given from a drop down menu on the left and here i can select the pair i actually want and this data is live the stream directly from one inch and zero x so okay here we see a healthy pair of deprived price discrepancies and the uh the arbitrage opportunities are in absolute value so what we really want is to find the biggest price spread that it could be negative or positive so once we have the spread what we're looking for we then need to enter how much each we want to borrow in the flash loan and once we do that then we go to the cost profit analysis to see what our estimated net profit is so in let's give this a try so with this pair um we will the biggest is balancer and dodo so i'm going to go ahead and collect that i want to do an arbitrage opportunity and i want to lend or sorry i want to borrow 1000 eth in my flash loan uh okay with thousand eighth this should this is actually not a good opportunity because this calculator is showing me a negative um so with a negative value let's see okay so let's go to the next one let's go to banker and a balancer banker actually has no fees right so this this would give us um a positive value because we have trading fees of zero and if we were to borrow one thousand uh eth in a flash loan our gross profit would be 7 000 and minus our flash loan fees and trading fees and gas costs we would net about 989 dollars so uh again this is just an estimate but this gives you a sense what of what arbitrage trading opportunities are in the market and this is this is specifically for trade identification now um in the future what we'd like to do is create a button here a launch button that once we identify the opportunity we can with a single click execute the flashlight arbitrage tray so this is the first tool the second tool in our arsenal is called flash pose uh what is flash flows flash pose is a position migrator it's a solution that allows you to select the loans and deposits you have on ave from one ethereum account and migrate them to another account in just a few clicks let me demonstrate so okay so before i demonstrate i actually want to go to the ave test net as a user in this test net i have an account with two collateral deposits and two loans and i want to migrate some of my my loans and my my borrow of my loans and my collaterals to a different account of mine now you might ask why would i want to migrate to another account that's already owned by me well for various reasons but one of the most popular reasons that sometimes users want to migrate their positions from a hot wallet to a cold wallet okay so and if i want to do the migration manually right it would take a series of different steps and it could be quite cumbersome so but with our flash pose tool uh we can actually migrate in just three clicks let me show you so and just to caveat here uh we're just only going to show metamask transactions we don't we're not going to have any code wallet transactions so okay this is flash pose as you can see there's two accounts the first account is the account of origin and the second account is the account of destination this will be my metamask account one and this will be my metamask account two this is the recipient account this is the origin account where we want to migrate our loans our loans are collaterals so uh the so what we want to do first is select the deposit collaterals and and the loans we want to migrate and then we hit migration we hit the migration button okay so here um as step one we now want to approve the transfer of my deposits from account one so it's gonna it's gonna load it's gonna take a while but notice we also included health factors here in the origin account and also in the destination account so while this is loading okay so step two once this is uh uh it's uh once this is done step one is done um it's asking me to choose the destination account so i go to account two okay okay once i i choose the account what really happens is retrieves the existing positions in uh in account two so here i have a deposit of uh chain link and one thousand uh in one thousand tokens now okay now as a step two i approve this transaction and uh and this is to approve the transactions from the destination account to take out the loans i'm migrating okay and once this is approved what happens underneath the hood is that we make use of ave's credit delegation functionality to allow our smart contract to borrow on behalf of the destination account which is our account two so okay and then finally the third click we're gonna hit confirm and this is to complete the migration using a flashlight okay so here we have a little bit of flash loan magic and boom you can see that the collateral loan at the collateral deposit and the loan has successfully migrated to the destination okay we're gonna do a quick check just to make sure on the test net okay this is account two the destination count we can see our die which is our loan and our wi-fi which is our our collateral has been successfully migrated and to double check i'm going to go to my count one which is their origin count and you can see that okay the the the loan and the collateral of diamond wi-fi has been migrated so this has this is successful all right so in closing in the spirit of decentralization uh our flash tool of our flash suite tool is fully deployed on ipfs and furthermore as the d5 market continues to grow we feel our flash suite toolkit is an appropriate supplement to support existing users and attract new users to try out flashlights thank you and thank you for listening [Music] amazing thanks so much liam and the flash sweet team i'll ask all of you to just stay on and not just keep your videos off we'll move on to the next demo and then we'll have a q a for all projects so uh without further ado let's have uh revert present and mario whenever you're ready kick off uh with your demo yeah hi um let me just share my screen um okay uh is this coming true yes okay uh so hi i'm mario i am based in mexico city and uh my hack is called rebirth and it's an analytics tool for liquidity providers on on deep fight so liquidity providers can have their assets divided across different pools and across different decks and to properly calculate the p l for any one position you have to take into account um the value of the underlying assets the value of the assets are usually invested also any possible gas cost incurred and maybe even reward incentives that the position might be occurring and you also want to manage risks and this involves being on top of different trends like the volume for the pool the research for the pool the prices for the underlying assets and maybe even the prices for the reward assets as well so i built this app and you can access it right now at robert.finance from here you can connect either your metamask or portus wallet but uh for this demo we're going to use the very famous newbie.ether account and what we're doing right now is uh getting all the data from the blockchain so this is the symbol sort on all the transactions relevant to the lp um positions so like uh mints burns nlp transfers out any possible um stakings and uh claiming of rewards and we got all this data and from this uh we uh built this dashboard and you can see here in the dashboard your open position and any historical exit position exited position and you also get an aggregated values for for all your um for europe positions and you can toggle this thing here to um include also the exited positions or only the open positions right and the piano from pools refers to the p l that is derived um only from the assets originally invested and the current underlying assets where the asset withdrawn and the total pnl will also include staking rewards and gas costs and so for any um for each position you get two sets of metrics really on the left side you get metrics which are relevant to your own um lp position so the current assets the invested assets withdrawn and the difference between this you get claimed and unclaimed rewards and the lower value of this uh gas cost for any transaction involving this uh this pool and your current lp tokens which will also include any lp tokens that could be staked in any arbitrate contract and on the right side you get a metrics which are relevant to the pool itself so you get a three-day volume the 3-day reserves and the volume to reserve ratio this is one this is a trend you want to be on top of because it will give you an idea of in which direction the fish you are capturing from the pool might go you you want to see it ideally go on open to the right and you also get the prices for the underlying assets and the price diverged which is uh price divergence which is some another thing you want to be mindful of because it will give you an idea of which direction your your the version of those might go this one you want to see um well as flat as possible or um to revert back then and uh the position lock gives you um just links to all the relevant transactions so the mints any possibility transfer out claimed rewards any contract your lp tokens might be currently or previously staked that uh the pull history will just show you um a nicer visualization of all the of the pull metrics um explained uh before and as i said you can get the same for um any um historical exited position in which case the asset value will be zero because all the assets have been withdrawn but you still get your your p l's and you get your um your staking rewards and like a historic position lock for for for that pool uh if you go to um to our about page you can get a a more in-depth explanation of how we got all this data how we um compute the different matrix metrics and um so what's next is obviously integrating into different exchanges uh building an index of pull by different metrics like pnl or or um or price divergence uh to manage entry and exiting positions directly from our ui there's also an idea of um offering a way to hatch for the virgins loss with on chain options and alerts based on on your positions pnl and that's all please check us out we're live and on the mainnet at robert.finance and uh thank you this this has been uh great fun amazing thank you so much and uh that's great we'll have you uh do a uh we'll just kind of have you wait for the q a and we'll get on to uh asking a lot of questions some that i personally have here next up we have coinfu and i'll have rj come and kick us off with his demo hi everyone um yeah i'm rj um and i'm here to present coinfu.io yeah so um yeah let's okay so first of all uh let me start with the motivation so um just imagine if banks have all their data publicly available i mean for traditional finance that might sound like a security risk right but that's what make makes ethereum so valuable protocols build with transparency in mind data is stressless verifiable and open for everyone to see and more importantly to use the problem though is unfortunately there is a huge amount of data to sift through if you want to understand what's happening searching for data is no easy task and users are often overwhelmed this leaves most actionable opportunities for developers and their bots what about retail investors what about people just entering the ecosystem will they forever be at a disadvantage so the solution is um automation um it already exists uh in the outside world through zapier and if um yeah coinfo.io helps you gain control by letting you build and attach automated tasks to cryptocurrency events so how does it work um it consumes and transforms blockchain data to a universal format which can be sent to third-party applications it enables users to build tasks on their own through an intuitive user interface and it run tasks automatically when conditions are met or certain events occur so let me go through a quick demo of what i've um what i've built so over here on the website i'm just going to click on the dashboard so over here um there are three sections so the create task all the tasks you've created um and sort of like task monitoring to see what your tasks have been doing in the background so um for the purpose of this demo let's quickly explore some integrations i've added so over here we have like uni swap and then we based on like uh like these events like token purchase or token pair creation you'll be able to get all of these data um but to complete um for the spirit of market make um let's also check out ave so ave over here once you've selected the app you can select an action so over here a new liquidation opportunity i'm going to click on that and over here underneath that input field are some information related to that event so if i click on next um you can choose to send the data to various third party apps for example on google sheets you can send that to and create like a cell or an entry but let's send that to twitter so over here on twitter i'm going to select send tweet that's going to that has pre-populated my twitter account and it has also pre-populated the message that you can add so for example here you can add more data um other stuff like that um to go through um like a like an example of a task that has actually run let me go quickly to this currently running task so this one is just a sort of like a like a task that monitors uh smart contract function calls so over here i'm actually watching the fdi vault from harvest finance every time it uh over here yeah so every time a a smart contract function call uh a method is called then it's gonna send a tweet so for an instance when this actually occurred i'm going to go over here over here is all the data that has been sort of like parsed and processed here on um the smart contract function call side you can see the i've parsed the function name the function caller all of that and on twitter um the tweet that i sent out and the final output of the entire task automated task is this one so yes that strategy was called in the heart's finance fbi smart contract and these are the inputs which points to the new um vault strategy um yeah so so the next steps for coinfruit.io um if you want to be a part of it so just sign up on the website to get notified once the media is available and also send me a tweet and tell me what integration or feature you want next um yeah that's pretty much it thank you for having me yeah bye amazing thanks rj we have a lot of questions for this one so um we'll uh we'll move on to our last demo for the infrastructure category and that is towson who's going to talk about claimable and after that we'll kind of do a group q a and uh and have our judges ask any questions or give feedback so toss them whenever you're ready feel free to kick us off hey everyone as an early adopter of defy you get rewarded with free air drops if you use uniswap before september 2020 you have thousands of dollars waiting for you to claim but how would you know where you go video uh the screenshot stopped in case that was that's expected you can see me right yeah where do you go when is when are these tokens available for you you'd spend a lot of time on d5 twitter reddit listening to crypto podcasts and just hoping you don't miss these airdrop announcements but no not anymore my name is d5 dawson i live in breckenridge colorado and i'm missing a really good day of powder skiing to tell you about this so let's jump into the demo so here we are on claimable this is a live website that you can visit claimable.versailles on here what we're going to do is paste in an ethereum address and see what do we have for free waiting to go claim on this address looks like we have eight thousand dollars of uni three thousand of one inch and this pull up token which i will get into later so far i've only jumped into the air drops what you can do here pop them open and then claim them right away if your internet's faster than mine but it's loading these three links um there you go so here's the po-op claiming this is for being a genesis depositor on eth2 being a validator this is uniswap again that was eight thousand dollars just simply linked to you like this and every demo so far the judges have found more than five grand during my demo so if you haven't used the site yet i really recommend it for every single default user so that was the first address pretty simple right how about this when you have this much use of d5 it's hard to keep track of all that you do but with this tool you can easily go and see what you have available to claim so in this one now we have the addition we have curve token and we've got three po-ops now we've got three i'll explain you what a pull-up is sorry i didn't mention initially i know more free stuff coming at you i'm sorry so on here a po-op is a proof of active participation which means you took part in something that was historical in the world of ethereum and on the pop-up site you can go and claim these by placing in your address now what's really cool about this tool is that even on the plop site when you want to claim a pop you need to go into each and every one of these to check so for pull-ups alone this tool is way better than what's out there and that's ignoring the hundreds of thousands of dollars this has already helped people go claim now one of the founders of po-op i was messaging them on twitter and they said within 24 hours of launching this 20 of all their props had been claimed for wi-fi so this is making a massive splash within the community of folks don't know what's available none of us do it's hard to keep on top of all this and so we need tools like this to simplify it let's do a few quick addresses and then we'll move on to the rest here we go this person is a massive kingpin and d5 seven over seven hundred thousand dollars to claim and imagine if this person didn't know about their airdrops also not just addresses we also support uh ens domain names that's xyz dot eth uh there's many other other.lux and then last but not least we have to pay homage to the founder of it all vitalik with one mysterious airdrop of tornado cash tornado cash is an anonymous protocol so i find this pretty funny that vitalik.eth has only this as his airdrop as mentioned since launching folks have found at least 100 grand to do this i have doubled my twitter followers and i'm getting messages from several different protocols helping them launch their tokens this is an estimate though because i'm not a man in the middle i don't actually know what folks are claiming because of what the security practices are here so you can trust that when you're using this platform your data is not logged each claim is directly to those protocols and you may not have noticed but there's a subscribe button when you use the site right now you're a one-time user it's been useful for a hundred thousand dollars worth but the real power comes in the future i'll email you when future airdrops match your address cutting out all the hubbub and all of the spammy postings people do with these airdrops it's hard to filter through some of these ones that are sign up here retweet it share it with your friends and you might get 17 with the 8 000 uni airdrop that you might have waiting for you to go claim i will stay focused and only alert people of the important ones and folks trust that they can see that in the ui and the design and the care i put into this because there's over 4 200 people on the email list in just under four days i launched this during the super bowl and i imagine this is probably one of the largest private data sets of ethereum addresses to email addresses so it's critical that i respect everyone's privacy here who wants to take part in this the web app again does not log any of this the 4200 is if you sign up with your email address and here's where it gets really exciting people want notifications for the right things the anonymous nature of crypto means there's otherwise no easy way to communicate with your users but claimable fills that need as of friday i'm full time unclaimable the future of this is going to be a new way to communicate with d5 users and launch directly to them i'm adding more and more airdrops every day so if you'd like distribution or communication that will deliver value to d5 users let me know and again if you haven't used it yet try it out at claimable.purcell.app you never know you might have thousands of dollars waiting and for all partnership requests or investing find my information at dosbot.com thank you for your time amazing thank you so much and uh congrats to all four teams in the infrastructure category who just presented we'll ask what i'll do is i'll ask all of the teams here to turn uh their cameras on and i will just do a really good big gal review of everybody here and uh and jump into our q a so i'll kind of i'll start off with uh with the comment by just saying that a lot of the things we just saw were live and not only that it's been uh it's been the intent of every team here to let others use it and and most of them also want to continue building this thing especially it doesn't when you talked about being full-time on this so uh to me that's just an amazing trend to see uh this just kind of makes it a lot more possible for us to kind of keep pushing new and interesting tools for others to use as well and uh with that i'll see if any of our judges have questions or comments or any feedback i'll hop in there first of all all of these projects were super super fantastic i'm like blown away i feel like every time i come to one of these hexagons the projects just keep getting better and better but um revert i have a question for revert so i'm curious what's the what's the methodology are you using to check for liquidity pull tokens i saw that you're kind of like running a script in the beginning um are you checking every pair is that process happening on chain i'm just kind of curious like how you decided to implement that yeah yeah that's a great question because it's a difficult problem so when we first do it yeah what we first do is um check the unigraph in this case of graph from from the graph and and that gives you any uh like uh snapshot of the any position that that account has had and from there we just go and check for all the transactions relevant to those pools and that account and you get all the mints all the burns and this way you avoid the issue of um of these if the lp tokens are held in some uh staking contract that then they won't be in the balance but they're still owned by the account so yeah that's that's our solution okay cool and are the is it if it's taking from the subtract sub graph does that mean it's checking for the unch i mean there's a lot of untracked stuff um that maybe would not show up in the sub draft i'm just curious can people basically add so let's say they created their own pool right and it's not tracked by the subgraph yet can they manually add their liquidity pool tokens or how do you manage that situation where the search basically misses something well if no i i hadn't actually run into that into that specific issue um but yeah if it's not included in this i mean we know that the subgraph won't have like i mentioned the one star state right but else to show you the snapshot but yeah if there's like a new pool that hasn't been tracked yet by the sub graph and that and that time between it gets some index it won't it won't appear yeah okay cool great job this tool looks amazing i'm i'm gonna be using it for sure thank you um i'll just i'll just echo and say these projects were really amazing and a bunch of them i'm going to be using myself um so for flash suite i just wanted to understand uh how often are the price differences updated for the arbitrage tool so like trying to understand um just like whether or not i know if an arbitrage opportunity is is like outdated or not um just curiosity on that yeah so at the moment it's quite uh manual but the idea was to add something um to refresh it uh maybe every five seconds also but also manually if you want to to check yeah okay cool thanks i would pick you back and ask a question about flash suite um and everyone did a great job by the way of course um so so have you tested this out with the results like i mean obviously you're seeing what it should be and there's an arbitrage opportunity to make a profit but i'm curious if um you know when the rubber hits the road if you're actually able to get one yeah no so for a bit of context we're all very excited about using flash loans for arbitrage and other use cases and i think we have a bit enough a bit more that we could chew in three weeks so um for arbitrage we actually realized that the first step would be to identify the opportunities so that's why we built this uh dual ui tool but unfortunately we didn't have the time to um to build smart contracts to actually execute the arbitrage trades but it's coming it's coming yeah that makes sense i i'm just gonna be honest with you a little bit skeptical that this would be defensible long term right because as soon as you open source a tool like this everyone's going to start using it and it's going to obviously get quite competitive but i love what else you're doing of that flash post you know using credit delegation and being able to migrate i've found myself doing this manually and um yeah i'd love for you guys to continue building it if you want of course yeah yeah that would be that would be great yeah for sure i could say that uh yeah first of all congratulations for everyone i mean it's it's always like a pretty fun event participating hackathon and learning things and i mean we're definitely in a unique environment and there's there's so much thanks to being built and i think the quality of the hacks is it has been very uh very good uh i have a question for um uh claimable like i i think like this is a very interesting kind of like a uh you know tool because even like especially like how d5 was last year people were participating every kind of things and uh you know there's a lot of interesting rewards uh and probably in the future will be even more as the nfd economy starts to evolve a bit and and different protocols projects are going to reward more their users and i think like poop has been doing pretty well that and i think this this uh claiming claiming something with your addresses is pretty neat and maybe it could actually even evolve into your place and so some sort of a uh kind of like a venue where you know you you actually you know invite some community you know it could be let's say everyone who holds let's say abhigachi or you know a certain rarity of avigachi or or or hash masks and and in fact he you could reward and that could be the venue that people could come to and and they find something interesting there and getting some something like that uh can be pretty cool it really takes time to uh that that people get get uh find it there and you get partners to launch but i think i think it's a very neat thing because like normally you would have to find those opportunities but here you could actually see see what's going on and and you know claim things and look at new opportunities it's a nice way to invite invite communities and get projects to create all kinds of uh rewards so definitely that's that's pretty cool thank you was there a question in there yeah there's a question there as well uh practically uh something i noticed actually i was claiming i was claiming i think it was uni token but but then i was actually surprised that i have a lot lot to claim went to claim but it was already claimed because i don't know the uh the app doesn't show yet if you have already claimed something right correct everything happened to me yeah you know the most requested feature at this point luckily it makes for better screenshots but it does not make for uh you know some folks do get frustrated as well or scared or something that maybe their money got stolen so yes for all the users this is also stated in the footer that what you currently see is all airdrops you have ever been able to claim regardless of if you have already claimed them and then yeah i wanted to add one last thing stunning on what you were mentioning that this email list mashed together with open source intelligence means that if you want to email all of the early uni users i've got a subset of them if you want to email um all of the early tornado cache users i've got a subset of that as well because if you mash together the email addresses with open source intelligence you can infer these types of things so uh as i was mentioning with really responsible practices here and only treating these email addresses with full respect and not ever spamming i think this who knows what it could become anytime i'm delivering real value is when you know i think an email sending an email is worth it at that point yeah i guess the kind of challenge always is for protocol builders and so forth that you know that you want to collect as least data as possible but uh you know uh i i think what's important to give people options and if you want to subscribe and you know what data you collect and how it's important and one interesting thing is that you could actually list future events you know that could be an interesting way to to promote certain projects as well i just wanted to piggyback um claimable is great i i just found five grand of one inch that i didn't know that i had um so that's cool um yeah don't don't tell hayden that i ever traded in one inch but uh but yeah this is the that i had was um how do you make sure you're covering a search for all air drops are you manually adding searches for different air drops for example one of my the dress that i just claimed with i know that there was also a mirror air drop to it recently um and that's not showing up unclaimable so i'm just curious like what's your problem yeah great question that's the second most requested feature so far which is there are a few large air drops that were they didn't have open source data on and so the amount of effort to add mirror for instance is hours to days and what that is next on my list and what is cool about that is that the the entire process is different it's not like a it's not an open sourceable csv file that says who got what in mirror and so now i can run the the email signups through that and email you when this launches so yeah that is next up awesome thanks and then um for coinfu i was just really curious to understand what do you think are going to be some of the most interesting or popular use cases for this yeah so um there's there's a lot right like for example uh for uma protocol it actually relies on um like people doing the liquidations and also the disputes um pretty much any protocol that requires um community participation um yeah i think this would be useful for them also as an example uh whenever for example vaults like um for urine or for harvest whenever they change to a different strategy i believe that all users should be notified of that new strategy um if they're part of that fault i mean that's just yeah that's just pretty obvious i think for me well thanks i've got a question for revert uh which is do you plan to continue working on this um and if so what different ways would you take it um yeah i'm i'm also full time on this um and uh yeah hopefully um the the team will will grow and uh the directions to take this uh to make it more useful like right now uh it's just really at the demo stage being handling only on one exchange um but um so the next uh obvious steps are um entering our exchanges and also um just iterating uh rapidly getting feedback from users and uh like uh well i feel like this is a tool that that hadn't existed yet because well amm some hadn't existed exactly so on it's a sort of like a type of discovery uh product um iteration i think uh what we have in front of us gotcha yeah that's really cool yeah as you think about this more and more um i i run an analytics newsletter and like lp uh ops i think is a theme that i'd love to cover so if you're ever interested in that please reach out i'm a huge fan of our network yeah thank you yeah amazing so i i think uh inspired by spencer's original comment uh earlier for uh flash harp we have a question from uh from our live chat from alessandro and uh the question is for flash harbin and the question is in case you thought about this thing would it be would the dap will be able to connect with dex running on layer twos and or is there any limitations on how you think this would work when layer two integrations are possible are they limitations have you thought about that people are curious to get your take on this yeah i think that's an excellent question but we haven't thought that far yet we were more focused on getting price data identifying the arb opportunities and then being able to execute them as a non-technical users and then also maybe automate some of those arbitrage like like bots too and being able to set that up with a few parameters awesome well hopefully that was helpful for alessandro um i'll give another minute or so in case there any last questions or comments i am particularly excited to see that all these things are soon to be ready for everybody else to use some of them already are and uh this should be a pretty fun uh next few months for everybody to try out all these tools i think that somebody kind of mentioned this at the beginning of this session uh the the fact that everything is public is is a great benefit because that means everybody can have their own version of what they would like to see and prioritize and that is just an amazing opportunity that doesn't exist in any other domain so whether it's claiming air drops or seeing a really detailed summary of how a particular position is on a particular platform or finding out every arbitrage opportunity that could exist i don't think you get to see that anywhere else and this just makes the whole ecosystem even more powerful so uh congrats everybody and what we'll do is uh we'll get all of you to uh to turn your cameras off and uh and we'll uh go on to our second uh group for for the demos so i want to thank all of you uh for presenting and doing everything live it's definitely not easy to make this work uh live and getting it right the first and the only time and uh and uh this is this is awesome so with that said we are ready for our second group and that is uh lending and d5 specific hacks so a common theme here is that a lot of it is uh adding and uh extending features of the ave protocol and for the landing category we have four projects and mobile apparate is our first demo then we have lavave hush hush and avid raj and all four of these teams will be coming on and showcasing what they've done so without further ado i'd like to welcome mobile for ave to demo their hack hi everyone i'm avette and i'm here to present mobile app on away am i audible uh yes you are so hi everyone this is avi on mobile and this is our hack for market make 2021 so let's get started teams i'm average in the ios and android engineer for this project and with me i have eric who's a back-end engineer so let's talk about the opportunity coinbase mobile app has 15 million downloads look at look at binance over 10 million downloads this shows that there is a significant demand for mobile apps but when we look at away solution it's strictly website based but it has a staggering tvl of 5 billion dollars assuming a 2x penetration a native mobile app for away actually represents another opportunity for five billion dollars and that is why we have created a native ios android and android app for away and it works on mainnet it's not a webview or a dab browser it's the native app that works on me and it supports all on-chain transactions i'm talking about deposit withdraw borrow repay switching of interest type collateral settings we have also partnered up with one inch um to provide swap services in case the user does not have the tokens which are supported by away our app also supports transferring of tokens creating and importing of ethereum wallets the app itself is built with an infinitely scalable architecture and we have created the away rest apis from scratch each api endpoint talked to a microservice which is also serverless and that microservice talks to the rba smart contract and since everything is serverless scalability is not an issue here and this could be scaled up to the global level and it's demo time so assuming that the user has already imported the wallet let's go to um let's go to the wallet details and look at there are way positions so as we can see he has two deposits one of wbtc and one of we and he has one loan of knc and his health factor is currently 1.8 so now let's go to the rb market info screen here we can see all of the tokens which are supported by away let's dig into one of them let's go to each the rv protocol currently has 365 million of each earning at 0.24 interest the available liquidity is 175 000 total borrowed amount is 28 000. the deposit yield is 0.24 the variable borrow rate is 1.79 percent the stable borrow rate is 5.23 percent now all of these statistics they are coming from the rv smart contract via our api and it's nearly real time um let's look at the swap section here we have used one inch in the back end to provide the best exchange rate with all the dexes and let's go to the transaction part and every transaction on this application is a two-step process first is review second is confirm so now let's try to deposit 0.5 each in away i enter 0.5 i hit review and in the review screen you can see the amount to deposit at 0.5 each and the usd equivalent is 8.95 and the gas fees and as soon as i hit confirm the transaction will be immediately broadcasted on mainnet so let me go ahead and do that so i hit confirm and you can see it says successfully deposited 0.582 away let's go to etherscan to check the transaction it's still mining so let me complete this demo first we'll look into it later i click done so let's go to withdraw section and here we can see since the user has deposited only wbtc and we they can only withdraw those and here also we let the user withdraw a max so that his health factor stays above 1.06 i click max again it's the same process review and confirm then i go to the borrow section here we can see all of the tokens which are supported by away let me choose let's say knc um if i click max here also i let the user borrow a max so that is health factor stay above 1.06 in this case 1.07 the user can choose between the stable or variable interest rate then also it's the same thing review and confirm so you can see the review screen amount to borrow 17243 tnc then i go to the repay section here i can see the user has one loan of knc 25000 knc and he has 28 000 pnc in his wallet so we can repay all of that loan instantly so if i click max i click review and i hit confirm it's going to be broadcast in the main net immediately now we have two more transactions um first one is switching of interest type from stable to variable or variable to stable for any loan and at the end we have collateral settings in case the user does not want to use any other deposit as collateral so that's it for the demo side let me head back to the presentation real quick and we actually look forward to work with our team to grab this amazing opportunity and improve the penetration of our protocol by releasing the official mobile app on both play store and ios app store and both of the apps for android and ios are production ready we would actually be very happy if we could release our apis to public so that other developers could build on our apis as well so uh let's go back to that transaction real quick there is a transaction it says two minutes ago it's a success and i can see deposit to eat on our way so that's it from our side that's it for the presentation thank you amazing there's a live mainnet demo that went through on time so that's just uh to me the the best thing about this and on top of the amazing things you've done so i'm sure there's a name for questions here but uh we'll move on to our next demo and i will do a few of them back to back so next up is lavave and i'll have uh marco go and present the demo hey hi everyone this is team levave we are a group of passionate engineers healing from uk and india marco here is from the uk while me and muncie are from let's have a quick look at the current market scenario current leveraging protocols are centered around power users and have a quite and complex mostly complex confusing ux for a user the users need to establish trust on these protocols and it's not easy to trust they support only handful of tokens and with limited liquidity enter level levy features a very simple ux developed to empower its users with simplicity at its core value it comes with a very high trust factor backed by away's leading security and trust it supports multiple tokens which can be matched and paired to leverage any assets supported by away with deep liquidity on levy users can open manage and close multiple long and short positions with just a few clicks users can monitor their current health factor they can also keep an eye out for the estimated health factor before opening a position and while power users can enable advanced settings for the swap powered by the one-inch api now let's go ahead and quickly look at the protocol uh in this protocol let's say the user wants to go three x long on link he deposits one w8 to us we take a quick flash loan of two w et we exchange the three w eight four link using one inch we deposit the equivalent amount of let's say in this case 200 link on our way and borrow 2we plus the flash loan premium and we repay the flash at the end of this transaction the user is left with 200 a-link tokens and a date of two weeks against it virtually opening his position on avi now marco will go ahead and give us a quick demo of the app everyone this is our application running on fork admin net at the moment on the left side you can see the interface to open the positions while on the right side you can see and manage your open position here we can impute the amount of collateral that we want to use for the trade and we can choose which asset we will use here we can choose which asset we are open the position we are taking the leverage position on for this example we use link and here we have the spot swap price based on the collateral that we choose and here the number of addons that we will receive which is based on the amount of leverage we can customize the slippage tolerance and we can also see the estimated factor that we will have after we open our position just a few seconds okay here is metamask we confirm our trade and here we can see our open position with few information here we have our overall health factor on our and with just one simple click we can close our position in our platform we can also take short position and for this demo we'll open a short position with a leverage of one again using w it as collateral on shorting link so let's refresh this and again with just one transaction we open the trade and we have it here and again we can close it easily with just one click now we'll tell you about our future plans yeah so in future uh we want to show detailed data about the open positions and enable history management for them we want to enable ease of mind for our users by automating the stop loss and take profit features we want to optimize the gas costs and we want to implement the gas tokens to further save cost we want to implement the complete advanced settings feature for swaps and this is mainly for the power users then we also want to provide data and statistics of all these tokens to enable better decision making by our users optionally maybe later on we'll also be creating some synthetic tokens for the open positions where the user can keep a track of these positions easily so that's it guys thank you amazing thank you so much that was a really cool demo uh we'll uh move on to our next demo and i'll ask all of you to just stick around and uh and hang out in in this chat so uh without further ado let's welcome hush hush to kick off with the project so hi everybody i'm leslie and i will be presenting a scheme for improving uh anonymity on on-chain savings account so today if i want to open an onset change savings account i can use eight homes directly in my wallet but this will leak a lot of information every time i do a spending or something like that i could also use tornado cash but this is quite inconvenient as tornado cash has the same amount for withdrawal and deposits and they must be equal so we propose hush hush which you can think of as a tornado cache with a twist we use same size deposits but with variable straws this gives us a convenience at the cost of some privacy so to make this possible we are using is your knowledge proofs so for those who don't know a show knowledge proof is a proof that proves that something is true without showing you why it is true an easy example is that i could convince you that i know some private key without revealing the key itself by creating a signature with it so currently her charge supports two transaction type so we can do a deposit into the pool the deposit is done by first the user having the user generate a node off chain this node is a secret for the deposit and then he transfer a hash node and some a tokens to the contract on chain this will update the internal state industry so you can think of the leaves of this of this tree as being utxos and the node being a private key if you know have knowledge of the node you can spend the deposit the other type of interaction is a withdrawal and before it is a bit more complex than the deposit so to withdraw from the contract you have to have knowledge of the node um user will then run a local snark group where he provides the node a receiver address the amount to withdraw from the pool a fee and a new node which is used for representing the change amount here he provides this to the approver behind the scenes the proof that is generated here will ensure that there's no cheating is occurring the proof will also create a nullifier which ensures that we cannot double spend that node uh when the proof is created we will send this to a relayer who will then run the transaction on chain this is done to ensure that the spender's identity is not leaked when he is publishing the proof if the proof is valid the nullifier will will invalidate the old node meaning that he cannot spend it again and the change node is inserted into the tree the user will then the receiver will then receive the atoms that will drawn and a fee will be given to the relayer for his services so for the demo we have a command line interface and we will be doing a withdrawal so earlier today we made a couple of deposits so we have these two deposits and if i just pick this one i will initially here have a withdrawal of a small amount a fee and a receiver we set all of these values prior to the test just to ensure that we don't have to fit with that now then we can see here the spender of the um the fonts and here the that is the proof um for of this node and then we can see who we are relaying through so the transaction should be live now so we should be able to go to ether scan and then we can see the deposit here so if we look here we can see the address of the layer is the from and the only um it is only the contract who is actually transferring funds is transferring to the receiver and then the fee to yeah to the relay so for future work we would like to have a proper browser interface to make it more accessible and then we have to do an mpc for the trusted setup for the snag and possibly look into using planck for universal setup then we have to have a set up a relay network and we would like to look into in pool transactions meaning that you can transfer to someone else in the pool without funds ever leaving the pool thank you thanks so much lassie that's uh that's great i think there's a handful of interesting things that will be possible in this thing so we'll uh we'll ask some of those questions in the q a section but before that we'll move on to our third demo for this category and that is project avatarage so whenever you're ready enter for the demo awesome yeah can you guys see my screen yes awesome all right so uh my name is andrew schmitz i am from st louis missouri and i'm william fan from ottawa canada and today we're excited to present our project arbitrage so simply put arbitrage is a dashboard focused on interest rate arbitrage so within ave you have a variety of different stable coins in a variety of different markets each of which allows you to deposit and borrow these assets for different rates having all these options available opens the door for arbitrage where you can borrow an asset cheaply from one place swap it and deposit it for a higher rate elsewhere and the key feature we wanted to build around this is allowing users to enter a leveraged arbitrage position by using flash loans for a single transaction and sort of our big picture goal here is just to create an application that helps people effectively utilize their borrowing power to generate additional yield within ave so how do we do this well we start with our home page which is completely dedicated to showing people uh where these opportunities exist uh so we start by showing people the best overall arbitrage across all different markets and then we separate this out for version two so in ave version two uh you can use flash loans to interact with your positions and this opens the door for leverage uh and then we also give a table view of all of the different stable coin rates and market combinations and then in our portfolio is where people can actually utilize these things uh so we start off by showing people their currently available balances and borrowing power and then we give them a breakdown of the deposits and borrows that they have available for each market and then we have this action panel currently a lot of these are under construction but what we did build for this hackathon is the average interface which allows you to first select an asset that you want to borrow i'll select the cheapest and then select where you want to deposit it i will pick usdc in version two and if you select an asset that is available as collateral in version two uh this leverage happens automatically in the interface um so what's happening here is that the user would be taking out a flash loan of susd uh swapping it into usdc depositing it as collateral and ave version 2 and then incurring this as debt so the reason this is useful for the user on is sort of what this diagram depicts which is that you could do this same process in ave version 1. it's just that you'd have to borrow and deposit multiple times which is very cost prohibitive and with flash loans you can do this in a single transaction so all that will explain this a little bit more thanks andrew so without arbitrage the user has to manually deposit collateral in ave take out a borrow swap the borrow asset for a collateral asset through a market like uniswap and then finally deposit the swapped asset again as collateral the user will then have to repeat this loop until either their borrowing power is maxed out or their desired leverage is achieved we found that for the highest loan to value markets the point of diminishing returns is about five loops so this ends up costing about three and a half million gas and with arbitrage average charge allows us to bypass the need for running the loop on the previous slide by securing the entire borrowing in the entire borough amount through an obvious flash loan this means avatar can utilize the user's entire borrowing power with only one transaction and at one sixth the gas cost compared to the previous method also thanks to v2's debt incurring flash loans and credit delegation features users don't need to deploy any personal smart contracts and only need to make the necessary token approvals in order to start using arbitrage so here's an example avatar's transaction the user starts with collateral deposited in ave and here they have 120 000 die and next the user calls the avatars contract specifying their desired borrow amount and finally when the transaction is complete the user incurs the flash loan as debt as well as additional collateral which is now collecting yield so even though the final net api is lower than when we started the capital base is much larger if you compare the earned and paid against the original collateral of 127 000 die the apy is actually closer to 15 and also notice that by carrying out this arbitrage we effectively have to the spread between the deposit and borrow rates this is also limit this is ultimately good for the lending markets as it leads to less fragmented rates across the board and i'll hand it back to andrew to talk about the future yeah so on the future note so the first thing is obviously refining and testing these smart contracts uh so currently the arbitrage is not live on mainnet but we're currently working on getting all these things finished up so we can launch that interface on mainnet uh then finally adding full portfolio functionality so being able to do the same things you can do natively in ave today uh the second thing is you know the interest rate spread the volatility is really a limiting factor for this uh and so we think it'd be an awesome idea to integrate stable yield opportunities uh like barn bridge or 88 mph you can get predictable returns uh and then finally arbitrage doesn't have to be exclusive to stable coins it could work with any asset that's available as collateral in abe wrap the tc are probably the two biggest ones with that encourage everybody to check out the interface that we built already and special shout out to all the people that made this possible thanks well thank you so much and uh this was our last demo for this category so we'll do as i'll ask all of our teams to turn their cameras on and we'll go into our q a and uh i'll kind of start off by uh sort of making a comment for for hush hush i think uh the the previous section talked about all the amazing things you can do when everything is public um and then accessible for everybody to interpret in different ways and then uh hush is making it possible for people to retain some of their privacy which we will all agree that uh that is uh needed so i'm particularly interested in seeing how we can actually merge this thing whether it's being able to hide some of our our asset balances or governance decisions or votings but uh to me that's a really interesting world that uh that we're going to see this year so that's a super interesting theme and uh and also thanks for doing a really amazing job at uh explaining how uh you're doing the privacy and nazi knowledge zkp stuff on live demo so that's my comment i'll see if any of our judges have any questions or feedback yeah adding to the financial privacy part i'm a huge fan of that and i think what you're building with hush hush is awesome i just want to understand like how long would it normally take to do a withdrawal without the like previous inputs or proof generated since i know that that can take quite a while so the proof or not generated previously okay so we just made a deposit earlier um and the main reason to not do it live were that we have to do a transaction for it okay so so the the withdrawal process that's actually like how long it would have taken yeah this was a real ritual but this tree is rather small currently so it would be a bit longer okay um but there have been a lot of progress on on that part and so we can actually use watson to to compile the or to make the proof which is a lot faster than than it was just last year well that's amazing thanks i have a question for mobile app for ave um first of all the the app looks really good um what you guys have put together looks really clean and like yeah i'm i will definitely be checking it out i'm curious though like mobile app development with smart contracts i've heard is is is quite tough what challenges did you guys run into as you were putting this together um so i'll take that question so again so it was very difficult for us is to basically sync up and the mobile with the with the smart contract and that's why we have to introduce a layer in between uh but then introducing a layer mint is we are potentially adding some some of the the points where the app can fail so we figure out like how do we make it serve or less and that's why we're focusing so much on serverless right now we deployed everything on google cloud so and then we have checked it um before that i worked into another centralized exchange and the technology is is highly scalable uh so so our challenge was first of all this one and the second one is that because there is no metamask available um we have to provide some additional functionality like creating creating a wallet and if you allow users to create a wallet then we have to also allow user to export the wallet and then also guiding him that private key has to be saved so there's a lot of education has to go in the app um probably we didn't get the time to show us but we have built already everything in it and then also fetching the fetching the the rate of every token luckily our support only like 20. um right now we are we just hook up to one inch api for code but we are planning to move it to chiba from uni swap i think that's that's pretty reliable in terms of pricing and also i was going to ask you about that yeah we we do plan to move to achieve unison that's this particular level and also the other thing is that for for rs specifically let's say if you as we can see that the user has multiple position and he has a borrowed position as well if he wants to borrow more how much we should allow to to make sure that his health factor is still is is not getting liquidated and when he's trying to deposit more how his health factor will change so all those sort of calculation where are we going to do this calculation on the mobile app or in the middle layer or at the smart contract level so these were some of the challenges that we faced and of course the last challenge is to getting release on ios app store because apple is not allowing yeah yeah good luck with that one that's uh always fun always fun i'm more and more convinced that we need to like create our own crypto phones you know so we can get rid of the tyranny of of these app stores but anyway great work looks good yeah i've got a question for arbitrage um cool name i think it's uh it's a really useful app i'm i'm curious what's the most underappreciated aspect of this project or build that you that you guys said well uh i guess i would say sort of the most underappreciated aspect is that you know it lets people get yield um you know and only expose themselves to ave you know a lot of people trust the ave smart contracts they built up that reputation over time but i think that a lot of people just don't really know how to utilize their borrowing power to actually generate yield and so with our project we really wanted to just keep the risk scope um limited to ave and provide people with just an easy opportunity to earn yield with their borrowing power so i think that's sort of the underrated aspect is sort of uh you know how simple the risk scope is for the project cool yeah i like it you should try to find a way to get in touch with the uh the founder he might be on the call i don't know who he is i've never met him at all yeah i mean that was pretty interesting like there was like 30 i was i saw usdc at 33 or something so kind of like it seems that d5 has grown to the extent of kind of like now the dejan legend liquidity is pretty much sitting everywhere and it's i think the whole space needs to somehow to scale but those rates are pretty high and i i think what's interesting about this arbitrage is that especially like in the other our idea is to create multiple markets so you could actually arbitrage between markets and it's interesting there because some of the markets has less risk might be just you know there might be only e as a collateral in in one market in another market you might have unisoft liquidity provider shares as a collateral and and it's interesting to see like what will be the differences in in rates uh so that's something i'm looking forward yeah that was sort of a big goal of our project is like will said you know it's sort of advantageous for the protocol you know having an option like this will allow people to easily sort of bridge those arbitrage opportunities but like you said you know different markets different collateral types you know they all have different risk profiles and different use cases and so those interest rates will naturally vary a little bit and so you know having a platform where people can easily take advantage of those opportunities you know i think could a generate yield for people and b sort of stabilize those rates on ave yeah definitely and also the uh i have a one interesting question for lev uh is that uh are those like positions tokenized you know you have the short position and long position or not now are not organized they're just the position that the user has basically on the other pulse but yes we showed in the presentation we are thinking that as a future uh feature uh we could add we could tokenize uh those um position as you were saying what's interesting there if you go if you pick an asset pick a collateral you you have a let's say eat collateral then you go one x short on each you practically have a completely flat position so it's kind of like a way to have a stable position without a stable coin i think yeah also this uh enables our users to trust us a lot more since these position positions are directly opened on rv there's no middlemen there's no option for drug pulling and kind of stuff that's actually a lot prevalent in the community during the last year yeah they're hunting and also for the uh mobile apparate i think you you guys raising did a pretty good job i mean mobile app definitely i mean mobile experience is very important and uh you know if you want to continue something like that you definitely should ask the other community for a uh grant and and get a proposal on chains so that's that's something could be pretty pretty cool so you know that's uh amazing we'll do that thank you i don't wanna i wanna give a special shout out to uh to austin griffiths here um i saw the uh avatar team used scaffold ethan and uh it was just one of many other projects we saw at the 130 that uh use capital did you just get started so i think it's just a lot of work that got put into making that repo possible so you can just get started on the actual hack and and not the the initial work of getting everything set up so that's the four link there we go so austin i hope you're listening and i hope this makes you proud and it makes you want to add more things to the repo i mean there's some amazing themes here uh some of you are ready to uh push this domain net uh there's a there's actions about having some of your privacy and governance decisions being uh being made private and giving those rights back to you there are attempts to make the distribution a lot wider with uh having mobile reach on android and ios there are ways for you to uh go long and short and uh and use leverage uh with flash tones and just in general with the cloud that you have on on the ave platform and beyond all that just arbitrage which is what most of the d5 ecosystem is right now in in both positive ways and positive some ways uh just being made more accessible to everybody out there so to me this is a great sign that we're going to see a lot more applications possible and uh i want to congratulate and thank all of you for presenting and also again also from being on making this work on all the different time zones that everybody's in and all different parts of the world you're coming in from so congrats again i hope you keep working and whenever uh the projects are ready for others to be used we'll be happy to uh let them uh we'll share them on on our networks and our social media and have others try this out so congrats thank you so with that what we're going to do is we're going to take a quick break for our judges and in the next five to seven minutes i'll be going through uh all of our sponsor prizes for all the teams that have won different things from using some of the apis from each of our sponsors or protocols and uh so we'll just kind of have everybody turn their videos off here we'll come back in about five or so minutes and uh in the meantime we'll kick off with some of the prizes that we have and now what we've done is we've asked some of our sponsors to make pre-recorded videos where they'll just be able to talk about their prizes and uh and now we'll then be able to reach out to all these teams post announcement so the first stop our sponsor is ave and i'll let the other video kick off hey everyone it's david here congrats on completing the rv market make hackathon you're all winners in our eyes i'll just quickly present the official ave prize winners uh in this video so the price for best integration of flash loans that's two prices of one and a half thousand ausdc each that goes to flash suite which is tools for position migration and arbitrage opportunities as well as rv triage a dashboard focus on interest rate arbitrage the next price of best integration of credit navigation that's 1500 ausdc each that goes to stable yield which simplifies lending and borrowing on ave as well as a lender protocols which provides uncollateralized loans to dapps and protocols next we have best integration of v2 governance now that's one price of one and a half thousand ausdc and that goes to paladin which is a governance and lending protocol next we have the avenger nearest award and that's a prize of 3000 ausdc that goes to quadratic treasury which uses quadratic funding to fund and fundraise for projects in the area of public goods next we have the most impactful award now these are two prices of 4 000 ausdc each so that price goes to hush hush which is a private extension privacy extension to arve interest bearing tokens that supports anonymous savings accounts and they use cool things like zk snarks and also of a telemachine a physical cash liquidity provider and there are so many fantastic projects that we just had to give a bonus award as well so the bonus award of 1 500 ausdc that goes to interest simulator an interest earned simulator for the rv deposits and borrows so congrats once again for making it this far congrats to all our prize winners and also whether you won a prize or didn't win a prize and you plan to continue building a project we would love to see you apply for the grants program also hit us up on discord with any questions or comments awesome amazing so i'm sure you saw the video talking about all the prizes but in case that was too quick i want to just use this and then just repeat some of the teams so we have hush hush ave teller machine flash suite aviator stable yield lenti protocols paladin quadratic treasury and interest simulator as uh the ave project winners on top of all that uh every project they used they also got a 108 usdc and now we have over 80 projects that qualify for this price so congratulations to all of those teams and of course if you want to build more on the ecosystem you can apply for more and continued funding through the ave grants program so congrats again we'll be reaching out to all the teams uh over discord and email soon and with that we are ready to move on to our next sponsor and that is one inch hey hey hackers here sergey the one inch ceo and co-founder and i'm going to announce our bounties from this hackathon first bounty and three thousand dollars in manish tokens goes to maddie's uh thank you guys you are done really amazing job second bounty and three thousand dollars in manage tokens goes to our liquidation protection team uh you guys are awesome 100 percentage deserve this price unfortunately we couldn't find any relevant projects uh for short bounty but we decided to give our open track price one thousand dollars uh to the youngest team the contract want to support you guys we all need fresh plot in the in our industry good luck to you and all participants congratulations to everyone keep building guys via one inch team is the best example how you can achieve just by hard work and keep building and you can just grow from a small hackathon idea to just in one maybe two years to a really a leader in this uh really young uh in the industry young space the d5 space keep building us amazing thanks sergey and uh just to repeat some of these teams uh we have mantis i have a liquidation protection and contract who are the winners for the one inch prize and uh as sergey mentioned uh one inch itself is one of the hackathon projects that started off 88th global and it is now a very successful protocol in this space so i want to just encourage all the teams to get here to continue building and continue working on and improving iterating on on your projects and paying us for any help that we can give to get you to where you want to be and uh and uh congrats again to all these teams so uh next up we have chain link and now we're gonna have their prizes uh being talked about from patrick hello youth global hackathoners we had an awesome awesome event and we got so many products and we are so blown away by the creativity technicality and prowess of all the projects that were submitted at this hackathon so it was a really really difficult decision but we have our top five winners for the five chain link prizes of one thousand dollars in link each and those projects are gearbox digi.lab audits are dead whiskey coin and q2t so congratulations to the top products for the eath global hackathon market make it was like i said it was a fantastic event it was really really difficult to choose just a couple of winners and we're really excited to see everyone continue to learn and grow in this space and we'll talk to you soon thanks guys patrick um and just to repeat some of these themes uh we have gearbox protocol dgu.lab audits are dead whiskey coin and quadratic treasury who are the winners of the chain link prize so we'll be getting in touch with all these teams over email and discord and with that i want to move on to our next sponsor and that is matic hey guys i'm arjun and i had growth at polygon i don't know if you had a chance to sort of look at the news lately but matic network has now rebranded itself to polygon and what we've done is we've taken on a broader mandate uh you know a bigger mission to build the internet of blockchains for the ethereum ecosystem so what we want to do is keep ethereum at the middle and build a scalability layer around the ethereum chain whether and this would allow you to build so the polygon sdk would allow you to build any sort of chain you'd like whether it's a zk roll-up chain or optimistic roll-up chain you want to use a current the uos plasma chain you want to spawn your own chain so whatever whatever you want to do as a developer you will be allowed to do on this or you will be able to do on the scalability solution so i encourage you to read about it but of course this this this short video is not about that what i really wanted to do today was to just congratulate some of the winners of the um of the market make hackathon and i just wanted to sort of just walk you through some of the winners who you've chosen for this so i think the first prize goes to um which goes to the matic cross chain arbitrage solution so this is a really interesting solution which which i think a lot of users in the d5 space would really love to use because it allows you to figure out where exactly the arbitrage opportunity is and then you can sort of maximize your profit there um so amazing solution the second one uh is is sublimate and what the solution allows you to do is to sort of it takes content creators and it allows allows users to stream uh payments to those content creators when they're sharing their content where they're doing videos and things like that and i think with the whole nfd economy booming i think this is something which which a lot of people would find very interesting and very useful the third prize of course goes to polaris and which is a very interesting lottery kind of a d app which is which allows you to use interest pairing tokens and many other different modalities to design a great lottery system so again congratulations once again to the winners and i wish you guys all the best and you know we want to help you scale these solutions as well and so please be in touch and and yes to the rest of the apps as well great job guys and of course we found many notably apps we want to work with and we will be reaching out to you so yeah once again congratulations and take care amazing thank you so much arjun and uh just to repeat some of these uh projects uh there's three winners uh mata crosston arbitrage supplement finance and polaris and i will be getting in touch with all of you over email and discord next up we have uma and i'll let them share their video and talk about their winners hello from the uma team today i have the pleasure of announcing the eth global market make hackathon uma sponsorship prize winner we decided to have our community vote for which they thought was the best project an honorable mention to the div x team which was the internal favorite project within the uma team but our community voted for the coinfu io team to win the three thousand dollar uma sponsorship prize thanks to all the teams for participating and we look forward to seeing you in the next hackathon amazing so just to repeat the winners for the uma prize that is project coinfu.io and we also have some a handful of other sponsors who have not uh we're not going to be doing a video and i'll be doing uh i'll be just announcing those teams so for the graph the winners are supplement finance and poolside and i will be getting in touch with you over email and discord the ens prize winners are project staker name claimable ens analytics orca protocol and sublime finance the avigachi winners are refungible haciendas and poolside so those were some of our all of our sponsor prize winners and uh like i mentioned we'll be getting in touch with all of these teams uh shortly after this ends and through email and over discord and with that i want to go back to our last category which are primitives and protocols for uh from our final list so what i'd like to do is ask all of our judges to turn their cameras back on and we'll be going into the the remaining four demos for today so we'll have oracle protocol gearbox protocol paladin atlantic protocols come in and present and uh while uh we're getting set up for the first demo from orca we'll uh we'll just give it a few more seconds and have the presentation kick off so i see that julia is here so whenever you are ready please feel free to demo great thank you okay hi everyone we are absolutely thrilled to have been selected as finalists we are team orca from brooklyn new york and today we will be demoing the orca protocol a flexible and adaptable dow implementation our team members are john cerlacchi stephen valeri will kim daniel thompson and myself julie rosenberg i think it's no secret that existing daos have a usability problem most are either overly complicated or not robust enough current governance frameworks lack ways to meaningfully manage hierarchy and permissions which create motor apathy and misaligned voter incentives a protocol which allows daos to easily create flexible rules and manage permissions is critical in order for on-chain governance to really reach its full potential this is why we created the orca protocol a gas efficient simple resistant dow implementation using erc 1155 equipped with a simple ui dashboard to manage dial proposals and allow on-chain voting for on-chain assets to give a little background on our infrastructure orca is made up of pods organizations which consist of a fixed number of member tokens each representing a single vote each pod is linked to a multi-sig vault to securely hold shared on chain assets pods are flexible and built modularly to accommodate infinite use cases including project governance pooled investing and community management and so much more the orca protocol mints and distributes the pods erc 1155 member tokens in order to claim a membership one must meet the pod member requirements and rules pod members can create proposals and vote on whether to execute a proposal could be internal defining requirements to hold membership or external performing on-chain actions such as deploying pod funds all proposals are executed on chain by a network of third-party users called shepard's in exchange for orca tokens see shepard's ensure proposals are executed fairly and member requirements are being met now that you understand the infrastructure let's see how jane would use the orca protocol interface jane opens the orca protocol and logs in using her preferred wallet on her dashboard she can see her pods and any urgent pod proposals market make club has an active internal proposal requiring members hold one unisock she votes yay to implement the proposal directly from her dashboard jane is going to try to join a new pod sofi direct club the pod has two internal rules one pod members must hold 120 120 ave and palmer pod members must delegate their ave vote to the pod jane currently only meets one of those requirements she now goes to alve to delegate her vote and comes back once she performs that action jane now complies with the pod's internal requirements and claims her membership let's say jane wants to create a new proposal she selects the ave rule library the submit vote option and proposes that the pod use its delegating vote voting power to vote yes on ave governance prop 7. the proposal is now available to other members to vote on if the proposal passes it will automatically get executed by the orca network and that is the orca protocol we are incredibly excited for what's ahead we plan to finish the web app shortly bring orca to the mainnet build out a comprehensive integration library implement pod hierarchy systems and so much more this year we hope orca protocol will empower all types of organizations to lean into decentralized governance here is where you can find out more and thank you so much for your time thanks so much julia it's a really cool demo and uh we'll have you stay here for a few more demos before we go into the q a but next up we have a gearbox protocol and i'll have mikhail kick us off with his demo thanks cathy so this is mikhail lazarev and today i'm so proud to present gearbox underculturalized protocol for margin trading on unislab so the problem which gav jarbox solves is that landing protocols are over culturized and furthermore traders should use both landing and dex protocols for margin trading so using multiple protocols increase gas costs gerbox solves these problems and using gr box you could trade with leverage on unislab on other first class taxes providing 25 percent collateral only and of course you can earn by providing liquidity to the pool so let's start from earning liquidity providers could choose between pools to deposit their money and each pool has underlying asset and the level of risk the level of risk depends on tokens admitting for trading and interest rate depends on asset utilization rate so let's consider this situation with a persona trader jack jack is a crypto trader and to open leverage position he provides 25 a zero and got 100 ethereum on virtual account so using his virtual account jack could swap tokens from pool allowed list on first class dexes like uni swap one inch curve sushi swap and others and when jack wants to close his position it would be converted automatically to underlying asset and pool interest would be deducted so as a result he'll get initial amount plus profit earned all funds are held on jrbox contracts and cannot be withdrawn by traders so jrbox a risk model to continuously assess the quality of trader's portfolio and if the value of the portfolio converted to underlying asset is below the liquidation threshold it becomes available for liquidators and they could eliminate it and got premium as a decentralized protocol jr box delegates decision concerning allowing allowed token policy and liquidation threshold to the centralized organization which is consists of liquidity providers of each pool and now let's check the demo so i go to local thing and let's start from earnings so you can see different pools here of different assets and different rates when i press on the pool i can see the a lot of tokens different pool parameters and of course it's easy to start so for example i want to put 100 yep done and for example on less so let's buy 50. nice so you can see there are two deposits on my side and let's go to the leverage price here i can start my position and let's start a zero because we today on as global so i provide 100 to 0 press confirm here and it automatically appears here and for example let's choose link just got price from them thanks guys yep so there are two different leverage positions here so let's go to trade section now as a trader i can choose between these two different ones and i'd like to trade for less so i press trade and i can see allowed tokens here so i can buy and sell for all tokens from this list and for example let's let's let's buy a hour okay so i want to 50 hour so uh when i sign this transaction it would exchange these tokens on unislav so okay press connects to uni swap voila so it's decline some amount of s and put into hour so earn as a liquidity provider leverage your position using uh different uh offers and trade on unit swap and first class basis and another great feature that it has a easter egg when you press on footer you can see a special thanks easter egg so thanks for all market make s global team sponsors and katakta personally you are the best thanks guy it was a gerbox protocol thanks a lot mikhail i appreciate those comments um i think uh the whole global team should be thanked for everything that uh that uh you're alluding to but also i don't think we did anything compared to you who actually made this possible over the weekend so uh i think credit is deserved to just eat here so uh well this is a really interesting concept uh and a lot of interesting kind of thoughts and primitives built into this so i'll let some of our questions come in later but before that i'll uh we'll move on to our third demo here that's uh project paladin so let them kick off with their live demo looks like we are just making the necessary permissions work all right so romaine is being promoted to kick off with the demo and remain whenever you are here feel free to kick us off with the screen share [Music] so so it should work so basically uh paladin is a governance lending protocol the idea behind it is that today the whole point of defy is decentralizing and disintermediating people and the protocols and everything behind it them and uh by decent decentralizing them what you need is that you need to have users that actually have the decision-making power when you look at protocols today they have the cap ability to do it but when you look what happens in the voting system right now there's a very low people a percentage of people who are voting for example if you look at uh the past eve uh proposals you have around 500 tokens that were used out of 16 million so there are a lot of reasons why these tokens aren't used but instead of asking if we should or should not let people low in their governance token right we should ask why not let them why because it's a question of capital efficiency the idea is that if you actually allow people to loan their voting power other people are going to use them and because of this you're going to have much more activity on your governance that's the idea we went with the idea is that because of paladin we can actually polarize users who are yield farmers who are speculators for example and we can with all the governance activists the one who will actually help drive the growth of your decentralized platform so the idea is that what we the way we do it is that we allow governance farmers to actually deposit their tokens and earn yield in exchange of loaning them and the activists they can borrow the voting power and via delegation and pay it with either stable coins or governance token so i'm going to have to show you how the protocol works uh we have been working working demo on kovan and the idea behind it is that you can either borrow deposit or withdraw first of all we're going to look on ave we have right now 9.5 voting power so if i want to borrow more voting power i just have to ask for for example 1.5 more rooting power i can choose up until what time i actually want it so for example i need it for the next three days i'm gonna have my fees that are gonna automatically update and i can just borrow so we're gonna wait while it loads but you can actually check in the balances and see all of your active loans and the ones that were passed so for example i borrowed uh one for one polluting power and i borrowed another one which is currently active so do whether it's active or close for three uh three eighth token the idea is that it actually allows people who don't especially have the means to put up a proposal to put it and it allows people to have actually built defensive position in governance action so now that my transaction has passed i can actually check it on my if page so sorry sometimes internet can be kind of slow and right now you can see i i have 11 voting power so it can we actually have a working demo and where it gets really interesting is not that you can actually actually lend the tokens because that's something you could actually just do with ever compound which is just borrowing the you can actually land any of the sub tokens that grant you the governing power so for example stakehave that's where it gets really interesting because right now stakeh has no use outside of actually redeeming your aids in the safety module so it means that because it has a vote it has voting power we can actually lend it to anyone that's very strong power because it actually enhances the compassibility of the protocols and the usage of every single token so if i want for example to deposit any if i can for example deposit two ads and the actual api can be quite quite important because it depends on utilization ratio and the idea is that the people who are actually going to borrow any governance token they're not going to borrow 100 or a thousand tokens right they're going to borrow 100 000 or a million because you need a lot of tokens to put up a proposal to actually move a vote so that's the idea basically uh behind the protocol and uh if i go back to my presentation uh i'd like to go a bit more into the technical details the idea is that uh inherently the way a pro the protocol works is that we need to uh delegate the whole part of the whole token pool in the smart contract so in order to do this we actually need to create a sub model pool which is what we have to do each time there's a request for a borrower so that's what we do and then we just delegate it so this actually this type of architecture allows us to have two really cool things the first one is actually to use any sub tokens and the second one is because we're actually delegating and not directly landing the token we can actually do uh a loan of the voting power without any risk of credit yeah because there's no risk of credit because you actually can't lose a token you can just redirect the delegation anytime this is pretty cool and this allows us to build a lot of things so uh just to end what we can do with paladin uh first of all uh not only intraday integrating more and more governance protocols but we can actually integrate it directly into any uh staking loops taking pool that doesn't actually allocate efficiently it's um it's governance tokens for example if you have a a uni or an av pool uh the idea is that all unborn tokens could be directly borrowed and redirect their borrowing power their voting power inside of paladin so we can actually use the paladin contract inside any any loaning or any staking contract which makes makes the allocation of voting power much more efficient thank you very much for listening amazing thanks remain and uh our last demo for today is lend to protocols so we'll have ltp finance come off and kick off with their demo hi today i want to showcase you ltp.finance a platform to scale the cutting edge feature of credit delegation developed by avi this platform is brought to you by flightful stack engineer who are amelie loic remy stefan and myself alexey l2p stands for lens2 protocols what we are allowing with l2p is for users to access an additional revenue stream while reducing their risk along with creating a new liquidity pipeline for depths and protocols and how do we do that by giving the opportunity to the user users to delegate the credit line to only authorized depths and protocols on diversifying their exposure thanks to our algorithm and that's what stefan is going to show you during this live demo the floor is your stefan thank you alex hello i'm stefan from the l2p team and i'm going to show you the platform so first i'm going to connect my wallet before the before the demo i boarded already onboarded one participant one delegator which will delegate three thousand dice to the pool so basically the pool the dyes are delegated in the pool and for people to borrow now i will show you how to onboard one user so i'm going to go on another delegator and this delegator will send 2 000 to the pool so the first step is going to allow the contracts to actually handle my die the second step will be to delegate my credit line to the pool so it can land loan phones and the last step will be to actually deposit my tokens into area that's the second step when the deposit step will be done you will see that we have actually some tokens deposited here so i'm depositing dice to the pool and i will receive back a dice so i will be starting to receive returns directly from the protocol and that should be it yes so we have the deposit the next step of the demo is uh to act as a borrower so a borrower is actually in our context a trusted dap a that that the l2p pool allowed to borrow some funds so i'm going to do just that the dap will borrow 2000 dies and we'll actually get these funds back without any collateralization whatsoever so when the transaction i actually go through you will see that the loan will be balanced rebalanced between uh between the several participants of the pool so the delegator one will see we loan 1500 dice to uh the borrower and delegator two which is the one we are seeing right now we'll learn 500 likes so that's it you'll see that when we actually loan funds from the pool we earn two kinds of profits the first kind is directly from ave protocol and the second can is for is from the use of the l2p pool so depositing assets into the platform is a way to boost your returns the next step is to repay the loan so i'm repaying the whole loan that i took as a borrower as i trusted that and that's what i'm doing and so we are doing actually the reverse step so you saw in the in the ui that i uh repaid 2000 dies but what i'm actually doing is we paid 2 000 plus the interest rates that were accrued uh in the bar so the loan was repaid that's great and it should be the case for delegator one as well yeah so the last step of the demo is to actually show you that a user can withdraw at any time so i'm going to do just that the first step is to approve to approve the die interactions for my contracts the second step will be to withdraw my deposits and also the interest that i got back and that's the last step so here i'm showing you a withdrawal without any loaned amount so that works but if i had any amount the remaining the remainder would be actually rebalanced between all the participants of the school so we can exit anytime that's it for the demo thanks back to you alex thank you very much stefan and now to our audience uh we are waiting for you uh on ltp.finance we hope that you will enjoy using it as much as we enjoy building it and if you think we should support more assets or that we should have a voice in selecting the whitelisted death well we agree and it's part of a roadmap this was lcp to that finance thank you for your attention and keep delegating amazing well thanks so much and now that was our last demo for today so what i'd like to do is just ask all the teams to turn their cameras on and we'll jump into a quick feedback uh review and q a section um a lot of interesting things here being able to manage daos being able to do under collateralized loans being able to lend to other dows and protocols and uh some super interesting concepts and uh for for all of our our vips and judges i'd love to kind of see what you thought of some of these teams and these projects and the applications that could be possible hey there um orca i i thought the presentation was super super well done looks the app looks very organized which i guess is what you want when you're creating a dowel organization app but i'm curious i mean obviously there have been several platforms that have created tools around dao zaragon colony etc so i guess i'm just kind of curious like what what did they get wrong what are you trying to solve for what is orca you know where does orca really improve so our our sort of mindset is to build dowels around uh sort of like smaller actionable groups um i think other dows their sort of test case is like how does this work with like a thousand to ten thousand people whereas ours are like ten people uh action groups and so we sort of clawed back a lot of the opinionated designs they had and just made a super lightweight frame that you know anyone can extend off of and integrate with so we tried to not make too many decisions for people okay so whereas like whereas like aragon is trying to be a dow solution for a project um or an entire project you guys are maybe trying to be an organization's solution for say you know a certain political party within a governance system for them to organize their themselves so we had discussed um we've discussed with some other projects about creating like a community board through orca and so they can deposit funds inside the multisig and you can have a community board of like i don't know five to ten people just sort of organize events or whatever they want to do with their community delegating that funds those funds however they want i think also something we have um coming up is that we want to implement pod hierarchies so that there's the option to invite more people into the organization but um tiering it out as to not dilute the uh governance voting power gotcha cool great great job guys this this looks awesome um my question is for paladin um i i know that like the governance lending piece is really controversial but i think it's definitely inevitable um so making this easy for people makes sense to me um what does the experience look like for lenders like do you manually pick which pools to select or will it automatically carry out based on the attributes you're selecting like how does it look for the lender so for the lender it looks exactly like the borrower in the sense that you just pick the the the governance token you want except you don't check actually to choose for ever stake if you just choose a then just gonna pick in both of the pools because it's the same voting power so that's about it and just uh as you could see i didn't have time to show you i didn't think but in orange you could see what was left of supply so what you could still uh pick because one really cool thing is that these are actually non-collateralized loans right you don't need any collateral to loan you just base the fee the fee of prompts and if you don't need as much time as you actually paid you can just reduce the the time frame and get the fees you didn't use back got it thanks i i had one one more quick thing here on on governance funding i mean just just as with bank you know banks decide who they lend to and who they don't lend to right um i wonder if you guys could build in that functionality um into this product because you know i can imagine lending out some of my governance token to some people but not to others and i think you could use um you could even use like unit swap sybil uh tool that we've recently released um to basically require that people attach their twitter name or something to to the account that they're trying to borrow with but it might be nice to offer some visibility into who you're actually lending to um so that the the lender can choose um you know whether or not to lend to that person or not so we i actually pondered about this because as you say there's a very big responsibility in actually loaning government's tokens uh the choice we're actually doing for a roadmap is that we're actually going to to use module modularity in the sense that there's going to be a main pool where everyone can borrow and learn and learn from each other because that's the principle of g5 if we actually start doing anything else then we might as well not be in d5 right and then we're going to actually open it some smaller pools that are going to be uh maybe not sible resistant but at least some type of white listing that's going to be governed in a way or another allowing people to actually restrain a part of the people not to use uh their governance tokens i actually think uh if protocols are not able to actually uh manage uh the the loaning of their tokens maybe on our platforms or on other platforms they're going to have a problem because the reality is that anyone can buy a token otc or anything and take control of a protocol so you need a lot of money right but it's possible and we have to address the question there is a real problem about this i'm just going to jump in and because i have questions for paladin too i i think this is um like one of these faux pas categories but i kind of agree with linda that we should embrace this right um like we're building protocols in byzantine environments so it's ridiculous to think that this won't happen if there is an economic incentive for it to happen and i think a lot of our governance systems today we don't do a great job like reasoning about um exactly this type of attack so this is going to help us in the long run um make more kind of robust governance systems so i have two questions for you the first is um how do you think about like like safety with respect to custody because it's my understanding right that now you're kind of depositing your your tokens into a hot wallet so that's can be challenging from a ux perspective and the second part is integrations does um do you need to integrate or sorry do the protocols that you're trying to work with need to do any added integration in order to work with paladin so i don't know if one of the engineers in my team wants to answer about the safety question because i would feel very unqualified to actually answer i can go on yes so the basically the user just like any landing protocol deposit is funds to our contracts and we just give him the assurance that the until you read the robot the tokens won't leave the paladin protocols because we don't lend them to the to the borrower we just spawn a new contract and send them to this contract and this contract delegates the voting power to the to the user that borrowed uh i don't know 200 av token and so right now we just can have this insurance that the tokens will stay in the in the protocol either in the pool or in a little contract that we created to delegate power but we don't have any other form of security right now as for integrations uh basically there's two way right the current way you don't need any integration and that's uh what we were just saying before about uh the problem with governance tokens is that anyone can actually use them in way in a way another if they found a way to take possession to loan or any way to actually access a governance token so we don't need anything to actually do it from the protocols which is scary and at the same time good because we're actually putting the conversation on the table right and the second part is if we actually want to use uh this taking uh the the governance token that are locked in others taking poll of course we need some integration from each protocol and that's going to actually ask us to come and talk with each protocol and to see what we can do and if it's interesting for them because the cool thing about integrating paladin directly into your protocol is that you're actually giving more yield to your users so you're incentivizing to actually bring more uh value locked in your protocol and basically it's an upper leg money lego sorry all right cool one question to lend to protocol so are you basically using the the kind of uh obvious uh native credit delegation or are you looking kind of like uh does the user need to lock the eight tokens kind of like to give it to the custody of the smartphone checks and when they are in a contract then you basically pull the pull the liquidity from average so we use the native credit delegation from uh ave for now but uh we saw that you uh all of the tokens were were on your repo and that we could use them and and decide our own rates uh to make them grow or to so for now it was easier for us if we wanted the protocol to work uh to build exactly on what was done on ave but we could definitely deploy our own tokens so that they would um represent more how how much you're earning from the protocol or we we went for their their shortest route to the happy flow that's true what was it so basically is it like now peer-to-peer or let's say could someone just create a vault and let's say uh someone just posted tweet about hey here's a uh here's an interesting like a walt you could delegate and others can delegate to that particular let's say walter like a contract and you know you can like pull up uh this delegation liquidity or is it just like now like peer-to-peer that there has to be like a trusted tab that you're delegating to uh or could you actually pull the liquidity like get get like multiple people delegate credit do the same same uh case anyone can delegate not everyone can borrow but anyone can delegate oh so if you wanted to create a bot to delegate uh profusely on the on the the test contract for now you could you should be whitelisted you should be authorized though on the other side because we want the people to borrow to have at least a reputation so that it protects the people who are delegating and and basically trusting because it's in a totally uncollateralized loan so it's not even under collateralized it's not collateralized at all so yeah but that's pretty cool i had a quick question for gearbox um yeah cool cool projects always you know i i think uh anything that allows for better better capital efficiency is always interesting in my book but my question is actually around gas efficiency so can you just discuss the issues that you face um in creating the kind of a gas efficient product and any kind of innovations that you came up with there how you solve that problem at first for gas efficiency this virtual uh accounts stored on smart contracts so we do not um we do not pay for gas for for example like tokens as you know the last balancer moved also to store these balances inside contracts the next point it's really optimized to use uh as less as possible transactions to open your leverage it's just a few checks and another point that for risk assessment liquidators could check if this uh portfolio is across the liquidation threshold and if it crossed they of course could pay for gas to liquidate it otherwise it really use so less logic inside so if you compare this to use uh landing protocol plus unit swap or other taxes it could be drastically less so cool nice work thanks for paladin also like i was thinking you could i even have kind of like a i don't know if it goes to the same offering but practically that you could uh uh pay pay also for giving out loans i mean not loans but like giving out the votes uh because like the thing is like what i was talking about talking with uh rick burton uh in and he was trying to uh kind of be a protocol politician and active member uh in in in d5 and kind of like a um he campaigned for getting votes and so so so forth but there isn't kind of a model now to get you know be incentivized to to be a protocol politician besides the fact that for the sake of decentralization so i don't know if it in your case it will be negative interest rate that actually you have to pay to delegate but to someone but what's interesting here is that uh this kind of model is still missing out there you know that just someone inches fees and you know and then they have they don't have to worry like they can do full-time actually governing protocols so so i think uh and i'm not specifically talking for my uh sorry uh for my team but the the thing with with protocol politicians i think they're not that uh fits for defy in the sense that we're trying to decentralize everything and then we're actually recentralizing at one point so of course we're giving the trust to someone but the whole point of d5 was actually not having to challenge the trust question so the idea i think is that with protocols like paladin you can actually very easily create because we're aggregating voting power we can create what we call automated delegates and train the users to actu coordinate to actually uh make their automation uh of their sorry their coordination of voting sub-diaos basically like political parties but you don't have you can have a representative but you don't have someone who actually owns the the voting power i think protocol politician is uh is a good idea but i don't think it's the end game for defy we can have representatives but i think giving them the power who is not is just going to move the current problems we have to the same thing but in d5 yeah it makes sense it's a very interesting approach i got a quick question for orca what is uh the timeline for us to uh see this in action and uh how are you thinking about getting this in front of people uh it's a great question so um we're working on sort of uh solidifying the smart contracts a little bit um and we really want to push hard to get this uh on mainnet soon um as well as like you know button up the web app um and you know we're just trying to get it in the hands of communities that uh want to have a little bit more agency on chain so we're hoping within the next few months amazing well um i think the kind of thing i'm sensing here is that uh realistically activism investing is about to get a lot interesting in uh in crypto so uh i don't even know how to fully think about that world but uh i think there's gonna be a lot more opportunity for arbitrages around basically governance and uh and that's uh that's an interesting world that i don't think we've ever seen before so can't wait to see what that enables and and also kind of just commenting on a few other protocols obviously the the advent of how dows are sort of thriving right now and how they're becoming super commonplace i think we're going to see a lot more opportunity in getting those in the hands of everyday users and them being able to speak or participate more actively in their relative community and of course capital efficiency is always going to remain important for this entire ecosystem so gearbox and ltp just being able to take advantage of the capital that's within the system in interesting and efficient ways i will just make a lot more applications possible so i want to thank all of you again for uh for demoing being able to do this thing in all different times once you're in and taking precious time out of your day to tell us about the amazing things you worked on with the past few weeks and i want to congratulate all of you and all 12 teams for uh being here today so uh with that said i just have a few closing thoughts for uh for this event and i want to share those with you and mostly their thank yous so i want to thank all of the teams here uh presenting from the protocol on the primitive side and uh we'll be moving on to the last closing thoughts so essentially uh the event was three weeks long and there are a lot of people that i want to thank who actually made this possible for us to run and execute this event we have all of our judges our speakers our sponsors our special guests our mentors volunteers and of course all the hackers so first i want to thank stani ashley spencer and linda for being here with us today and being able to not only just share the excitement giving their feedback asking questions and engaging and also offering a lot of suggestions on what features or enhancements that they can do and getting this in the hands of uh in getting this in the hands of people that they really want to try this out so thank you so much for uh for giving us your time today and we really appreciate it um so specifically not just that the four people we have on our call here we had so many more judges developed go through all of our projects all 130 or so of them over the past few days and uh it's a long list that i i would rather not individually point out to but i want to make sure that they all get the recognition and thank you that they deserve and on top of all that all of our speakers who helped with doing talks and workshops and being able to conduct a handful of sessions over the past few weeks thank you so much for doing that and making it possible for others especially all the newcomers in this space to learn and get up to date on how they can get started in the web3 ecosystem and of course we have our amazing sponsors who came in as mentors and hung out and helped out all of our teams with projects on the technical side telling them about how they can use certain protocols or make it easy for them to not start from the beginning and use some of the existing work to make their own lives easier there's a lot of people here to thank and uh without their support not only would this event not be have been possible but also uh we would have seen a lot of projects that would have been blocked on some technical and design issues so thank you so much to all of our mentors here it's a very long list and of course the other thing i want to do is give a quick shout out to some of the six volunteers who helped us out during all of our judging we ran so many things in parallel to make sure that this was efficient as a process and also respectful for all of uh the attendees times and uh they were the ones behind the scenes making sure that everything ran extremely smoothly and of course i also want to give a quick shout out to the global team who has constantly worked behind the scenes um that to make this event a success but not just this event throughout everything else that that we do so i want to quickly give a shout out to trent who uh has been amazing at making sure that everybody knows what's going on from the attendees and the public side of this event uh he's even into community and marketing and uh has been a crucial to making sure that everybody is attended to in terms of not being blocked being able to understand what's happening when and also conducting some of our amazing workshops and talks next up is emily who has been amazing at running the event on on our discord whether that's helping our teams getting unblocked on having our attendees getting unblocked on on getting support from mentors to managing all the check-ins for this cohort and being able to run and ensure that no hacker has any outstanding issues and managing the entire support without her help would not be we would not be here and we would not be able to attend to 500 people in parallel next up is andrew so everything you're seeing here on the stream is uh being organized and run behind the scenes uh from andrew he's been crucial in making our massive transition to switching over from in person to online and he's an absolute star in making sure that you have a really consistent smooth and amazing experience as an attendee whether it's it's this talk or this session or anything else that we do throughout an event next up is jacob jacob has been our partnership and sponsorship lead he's been helping ensure that every sponsor has been able to get their word out in whether it's helping attendees uh understand how they can best use some of the the tools that are in abstractions that have been already done by by are some of these protocols in this space to making sure that we are able to connect and actually help increase uh the developer activity in the respective ecosystems so thank you jacob next up is liam horn uh everything you see that's being done on our our back-end to manage this event whether that's the dashboard to how you are interacting with us on this chat uh all that is thanks to liam and uh it's a it's a really big effort and are giving an effort for making all this work on the technical side to support everybody and do this all real time so without his help and and also understanding how we move the the rest of the event and global forward this would not be possible and last but not least i want to thank heather uh who is uh the person in charge of making the entire experience possible and running it global without her heather managing the entire process the project and what we do as as a team uh you would not have market make and everything else we're gonna talk about later today so thank you so much heather and the rest of the global team um i wanna make sure that i spend more time on this because we spent the least amount of time thanking the team that makes all this possible so thanks again and with that we are coming to a a close um we've been using the word finalists for uh all of our events and especially this one where we talked about we had 134 projects we had 12 teams that are that are finalists and they came in today and demoed their projects not only did they demo what they did but they also did it live without any without any technical issues um and the thing is uh if you've been part of any global event before um we kind of really spend the time highlighting that this is about experimentation and learning and being able to try things out without having to necessarily come into doing something long-term or we're essentially signing up for solving a particular thing we want to give everybody that creative freedom and also ensure that this is not designed as a competition we use the word finalist because that is the best word we have for this where it becomes a way for us to showcase some of our interesting and favorite projects throughout this process so when i say finalists all 12 teams here are technically our first place winners they are the top 12 and the 12 uh teams that are the winners for market make and as part of uh being a finalist every member on their team will be getting 0.58 and and this is kind of how we want to thank each and everybody here who helped us out with doing their demos and putting in all the amazing work and working on some really really cool projects that they'll continue to work on from what we've heard and seen so i'm excited about that and congratulations to all of you for not only just being our finalist and winning the the eighth year but also some of you also have won a lot of interesting prizes from our sponsors so we'll be getting all those details to you over discord and email but i want to give a big congratulations to you today and hopefully for all of you that are in different time zones you uh you get some time to uh to get some rest and and sleep now that we're at we're close last but not least i want to make sure that uh uh this is consistent to all the other events that we've done in the past which is this would not be a neat global event without us telling you what's coming next and i am super proud to announce that not only just uh we're going to talk about the next event we also have a couple things in the works that will all hint right now so this is an announcement for announcement but we are going to be looking at a small small event that is going to be a two-day hackathon over the next few weeks and we'll be discussing and publicizing that that events theme uh shortly but our our big event uh that we're going to plan on next is going to be called scaling ethereum it's going to start on april 18 may 14th and is an entire event dedicated to bringing projects in this ecosystem towards there too this is at this point live and you can head over to skilling.eglobal.com to uh to sign up and learn more about it we'll be doing a lot of summits we'll be talking about how we can get projects uh and protocols to all participate and move themselves and try things out in the entire literature ecosystem and now we are extremely excited about this uh this next hackathon so that said i want to thank all of you here for being with us today hopefully you all got to see some amazing projects i want to thank all the teams who presented today but also all the 134 projects that spent all this time uh working on and trying their curiosities and playing with what's possible in the web3 ecosystem we hope you keep building and we hope you tell us about what you're building so we can help promote it and make sure that you get the help you need should you need it and uh thanks again everybody and i hope you have a great rest of your weekend bye
