all righty hi everybody uh welcome to the building with uma's new products workshop uh we have chandler and john here from our sponsor uma they're gonna be running this workshop for you guys um so yeah i'll leave it to you guys to get started and um introduce yourselves hello yeah cool thanks for uh for that um just before i jump in just want to say like we're really excited to be here um we were part of the last um hack money event uh and uh this this kind of round is really going to be um summarized by us wanting to talk about the new products that we're working on at uma um and want to get into the hands of some developers so if anything piques your interest here um that's kind of the intention of what today is about and we just kind of want to like discuss and show off what we've been working on over the past six months a quick agenda just so that you know what's coming up uh we'll just quickly introduce you to some of the uma team members that you'll be seeing throughout the event some of the prizes that are up for grabs at this hackathon a quick introduction of what uma does but i want to be very quick on that one and you'll see when we get to that an introduction to the themed products that we want to be building um over the next couple of weeks specifically the long short pay kpi options and the optimistic oracles john will go through a demo on how to deploy and get started and some creative ideas that kind of you can do to get started with that and a quick little punt on some of the hiring agenda items that we want to talk about and so if you're interested in joining the team um there are a few open rules at the moment so uh just a quick introduction i'm chandler i'm the growth strategist at uma uh joining me today is john from our engineering team hey everybody um happy to be here cool and you'll also be seeing a bunch of other people lurking around in the discord um melissa vari shawn and clayton um they're a friendly bunch so say hi when when you see them and then an extra little bit of added support um the east global team are really kind enough to give us a dedicated hackathon support channel uh this channel is a combination of boomers community team members and the um team in itself and so if you see anyone with the uma support tag uh that is someone who is uh will be able to kind of hear some of the questions that you have and ping the right person whether you need some technical help you just need some ideas creation you need to help find some talent to kind of add to your team um and this is kind of that support tag quick little disclaimer the super humans is a tagline for a community member at super at uma in itself so they're they're part of the official uh uma community all right why do you want to hack what are some of the prizes that are up for grabs um that that we want to kind of just talk about today so the first one uh we will be giving away two thousand dollars for the most creative use of our optimistic oracle by the way each of these prizes that i'll list out will go through the products in themselves later on this will be judged by the umid team and the community team so a combination of uma and our community will will judge this one the next one will be the team that comes up with the best community based kpi option this is one that will be judged solely by the uma community team uh sorry just the uma community itself and this is the one that wins the hearts and minds of our community and then the last one is the best use case of uma's new long short pay contract this will be judged by the uma community by the uma team in itself so that's a quick little discussion around the prizes and i'm also really excited to announce that we recently published an article yesterday saying that uma is now supporting polygon we've got a long uh list of other layer 2 scaling solutions that we're going to be launching on over the course of the next few months but the first one will be with polygon and in the spirit of collaboration they've given an extra thousand dollars to any of the winning teams so for the kpi options and the optimistic article if their um solution was built using our polygon and enabled contracts so that's really uh nice of the polygon team and really excited and humbled by that all right very simply for anyone that's never heard of uma what do we do um and i try and try to make this as quick and easy to understand for anyone it's a lot more complicated than this but the the one liner that i've like summarized um in is we build financial contracts financial contract templates like the kpi options the lsp which we'll go into later that is secured by a dispute resolution layer so these two elements are are the two really like powerful elements that work together that encompass what um does um and if there's anything that you want to take away from what uma does today those are the two very important points that i want to want to highlight and we'll go through like some of the examples of how we how we kind of um marry these two aspects together so introducing the specific products that the prizes will be um will be about today the the first one what is a key performance indicator or kpi option um these are basically synthetic tokens that will pay out rewards based on a verifial verifiable bit of data in the in the outside world i'll go through an example later um but this is a really powerful tool that aligns your incentives with an objective that you want to reach whether it be with your community the outside world there is a lot of creative aspects that you can use kpi options for the next one is our long short pair it's a little bit more complicated than what i've put on the slide and we'll run and you'll see that through the example but basically what it is it's a synthetic asset that mints both sides of the trade bounds the gains and does not rely on any re-margining what this actually just means in in like practical terms for developers is that this is a synthetic token that cannot be liquidated which is a little bit more different to how other synthetic tokens are created out in the world and then the last one is our optimistic article i kind of call our optimistic oracle the most flexible oracle out there but really what it is is a it acts as an escalation game between uh contracts when they want to reque request a price and or dispute a price and and so this escalation game is how our optimistic oracle handles uh information flowing through it it can quickly resolve price request information and the the kind of key feature of what the optimistic oracle does is it only brings prices unchained when it needs to and this isn't an event of a dispute so this is a quick high level overview of those products we're going to run through a couple examples of what you can do with some of these um and kind of just to kind of get a mindset of how how we've used them at uma before or what what you know hackathon members can or hackathon um hackers can use them for so a quick example of of how you can use the kpi option it's a very simple example it's not a perfect example but at least i will attempt to kind of give a powerful illustration of what it what you can do with it let's say for example you want to reduce rainforest degradation and let's say arbitrary numbers rainforest is grading by 10 per year what we can do is have environmental funds and public donors in this case we would be we will be creating these options donate some funds the mint a bunch of kpi options and give those option tokens to the members of society that would be the most used the most suited to be able to actually have an impact on that actual outcome in this case can be conservationists um and and kind of the the managers of wealth um of kind of uh like rainforest management and so let's say there are 10 million dollars allocated to buy environmental funds and we mint 10 million dollars of these uh option tokens and we give it to the actual conservationists themselves and we'll say as a as an arbitrary payout to payout um and kind of the function is that if you we want to get degradation to zero it's currently at ten percent and we'll just draw a linear scale between ten percent and zero percent and at the end of this we will measure how close we got to that goal and so let's let's kind of run through how a payout would work for for one of these types of kpi options um and and say at the end of one year the conservationists actually managed to get rainforest degradation down from ten percent to two percent meaning that they actually achieved uh 80 of that kpi so the kpi was the reduction of rainforest degradation so each of these options would then be worth 80 of the payout because they achieved 80 of that result and so the 10 million dollars allocated to this would pay out roughly eight million dollars um or actually exactly eight million dollars in this example and and this kind of illustrates how how kind of you know if you had increased it to let's say um one person you've got rainforest degradation to one percent meaning you've got 90 of the result you can really um increase the value of the power based on this another example that we did at uma this is our very own kopr option payout is that we paid um each of our options are worth um the same linear scale but based on the total value locked on uma and so um between a current floor of a hundred million dollars and if we reach two billion dollars there's a max payout on that um so these these options are extremely powerful on where you want um to measure a kpi and to find who'd be able to sponsor something like this and who'd be the most um valuable person or entity or individual that can best move that kpi option so one of the prizes will be based on on the kpi option that wins the hearts and minds of the communi umo community so the longshore pair the other product that we're talking about today it's a little bit more of a complex financial and financially engineered product but hopefully with just a little bit of um kind of discussion we can kind of make it a little bit more simple basically what a long short pet does is you you mint both sides of a trade in other words if i put in let's say a hundred dollars of of collateral normally you meant a synthetic and you would then have the long position if you held the synthetic or if you had to sell the synthetic you take the short position on that what the long short pair does is at the point of minting mint both sides of the trade so we'll have this idea of a short token and a long token and you can choose depending on which side of the trade you want to be on sell either side so sell the short token to be long or sell the long token to be short now this is slightly um kind of vague if we just kind of decide to kind of describe it in this way so let's kind of run through two specific examples on on different payout types but that illustrate what we mean by this long short pair or the for the lsp so let's assume that we have a binary outcome so either something happened or it doesn't and the binary outcome is um either worthless or completely in the money and so what we mean by in the money is that the the token that you hold is worth something and let's say a strike price is how we're going to determine the settlement so either it's worth something if the expiry of the synthetic token expires below the strike price or it's worth something if it expires above the strike price and so running through kind of a numerical example let's consider that we have i take a bet with john that i think in three months time eath will be higher than three thousand dollars and so i would then we would determine the strike price of three thousand dollars um for eth and we're going to put a thousand dollars as a bet on this now at settlement in three months time i would hold the long token because i think ether is going to be more and john will hold short token and be um and think that youth will be below that if the price of eth goes above three thousand dollars the contract expires with the all the long tokens being of value one which means that all that thousand dollars gets accrued to the to the long token versus the zero that gets expired to john because it expired above three thousand dollars and the vice versa is true so if it expired below three thousand dollars the long token would have been worth nothing and the short token would have been worth all thousand dollars and this is a either or outcome and and so this is kind of quite interesting for for binary outcomes like this but what happens if we wanted to have something that is maybe a bit more on a linear scale so the lsb operates um on a on a range of payouts so how would this kind of typically work so john and i refine our bet after the first year of running these binary bets and we think actually we can be a little bit more uh determined because we think that eath will trade within a range so there's somewhat of an upper bound there's also somewhat of a lower bound and we can then say all right if if eth trades outside of the upper bound or below the lower bound we can handle that very similar to a binary case but actually between these bounds is where something actually quite interesting can happen where um the value of the bed can have different pairs depending on which how close you are to either bound and so if i describe this it basically amounts to that the price um between the upper and lower bound will either pay out the long or the short token in in various ways and so this again might not seem uh very intuitive in in that level of description but let's run through a little bit more of an example where we can kind of put some numbers behind this so the linear lsb on the price of eth let's say is going to be set at a lower amount of two thousand dollars and on an upper bound of four thousand dollars so we think okay it's not really going to go outside of those two bounds um and we still put the same amount of money in of of a thousand dollars um and what we then can say is what happens when ether is between two thousand dollars and four thousand dollars so if the price is if i'm still the same long person and uh eth is um above four thousand dollars then the long is worth the zero is worth zero sorry the long is worth the collateral and um the the shorts worth zero but if it's below two thousand dollars then the long's worth zero and the shorts worth of collateral and so if it goes outside of the bounds it looks very similar to the binary outcome but in between the bounds is where um some of the the payoffs change and differ slightly so let's assume that the price is between two thousand dollars and and four thousand dollars and for arbitrary sake we can say it's worth three thousand five hundred dollars then the expert price is some ratio between the upper and lower bound and three thousand five hundred is closer to the long upper bound um and so if so if i hold the long token my thousand dollars or the thousand dollar bet would be worth 750 dollars whereas the short token would be worth 250 and if you if you move the settlement price or the actual end expiry price closer let's say if it was in the middle then um if if eath at that point was three thousand dollars then each long and each short was worth the same amount and so because you have both sides of the trade it makes the it makes the combination of of payouts um a lot more interesting and because they're bounded there is no need for for liquidations or re-margining um because you have both sides of the market at any given point in time so these are just two quick examples of how the lsp would work and there are some other more um interesting use cases when you use options and and and yield dollars to kind of combine them into range bonds we've recently just published an article around that if you want to get more into the weeds um of of how you can use this lsb to to really kind of create new and interesting synthetics so i'm going to hand over to john now uh he's going to run through um and how to use the dispute layer a little bit more of um of a kind of in a description plus run through some of the demo aspects over to you john all right uh yes i'm going to talk a little bit about the optimistic oracle basically if you think about an oracle in a lot of cases we've gotten used to just asking for prices or something that has a continuous data feed but what you get out of the optimistic oracle is something that's really powerful and flexible to answer any kind of verifiable question the demo that i'm going to show is going to be kind of traditional it's going to rely on an eth usd exchange rate that you get from the oracle but it could also be extended to be much more complicated so you know if you wanted to get the eth usd exchange rate but only if eth was above a certain dollar value you could ask that if you wanted to get it only if um you know it's over 100 degrees fahrenheit in las vegas and mercury's and retrograde you could ask weird questions like that it wouldn't make any sense if it was a continuous data feed but if you're just asking questions this actually works just as well for that as anything else which is kind of neat i'm going to share my screen real quick and walk through the tutorial here are you able to see my screen ah no just give it one go all right let me see ah there we go okay so i'm going to walk through an example contract it's a really simple one it's basically a smart contract that's hooked into the optimistic oracle where you can deposit your eth in the form of wrapped ethereum and withdraw it based on a usd dollar value so you put some eth in and then you say i want to withdraw this many dollars of eth so you needed the oracle for that um i'll pull up the demo i did a little bit of this prep earlier we're going to be doing a ganache local instance and i already migrated all of the uma contracts so you can use it so that's what's going on over here just saw the results of the migration and i'll actually run the demo script and explain a little bit of what's going on under the hood here so this is going to step through this is all just a like web 3 script calling the local ganache instance now it's deploying the optimistic deposit box contract it's making sure that the price feed that we want is um registered with uma's system so if you want a particular price identifier it's not that hard you can just add a new price to identifier through human governance and we could walk you through that if you have an idea for a new one make sure the collateral type is also whitelisted and then just deploys everything you put eth in the box and then when you want to withdraw you put in the withdrawal request and the optimistic deposit box makes a call internally to the optimistic oracle where it requests the price then somebody it could actually be the person making the initial withdrawal request is going to propose a price in this case they're saying that eth is worth two thousand dollars uh that is not disputed we kind of fast forward after the dispute period and that price is settled and they're able to withdraw five eth because they wanted ten thousand uh dollars worth of eth uh what would happen if that price is incorrect is anybody could come in and say you know ethan's not worth two thousand dollars that's inaccurate they can dispute it and that goes up to the uh uh longer and kind of more settlement layer that we call the dvm where all of the uma token holders come in and vote and so any price request that you put in is going to have the full security of uma's entire market cap even if it's something really weird so etheusd is a common one you would think like okay you need good security for that if you wanted to make that weird request about las vegas temperature and whether mercury's in retrograde and the eth price that would have the same level of security because ultimately it can go to this final dispute resolution mechanism so that's really powerful you can sort of think about applications where you're verifying complex off-chain computation uh compound questions um a lot of stuff that you would have to bake into the contract itself traditionally you can now do off-chain with full security and one idea that i came up with recently which i'm kind of excited about is a kind of complicated investment strategies if you're running a dow you can bake these strategies into a document that lives off-chain but you can verify it on-chain with the optimistic oracle which is kind of neat i want to show a couple of other things too just thinking about interfaces so this is an interface for minting and uh you know creating covered calls these are a couple of live contracts that we have i'm going to go to the uni covered call cause i have a little bit of uni in this wallet i can go over here and just really easily uh mint uh some new calls that i could then sell on uniswap and you know make some extra money um another cool one sorry the zoom interface is getting in the way uh okay another cool thing here i could use the same uni tokens to mint some uni yield dollars if i wanted to go through that use like the uni usd price identifier you can see how many price identifiers we have this is another sign of how flexible the system is pretty much any outside verifiable information you want you can put into a price identifier to relatively arbitrary levels of complexity so it's not just price feeds in here there's also like kind of more complicated uh calculations for some of these i'll just kind of click through set an expiration time stamp for the future this expires december 31st uh give it a name i'll just call this uyd set a collateralization requirement unlike the lsp this actually is liquidatable this is using another contract type called the emp so for that you need to have like a certain threshold below which somebody could be liquidated put in some sponsor tokens move the zoom interface out of the way again and then create it but not actually because uh it's really expensive right now so that's all that um one last thing before i kick it back to chandler we have these launch repos to make it easy to launch contracts too so what i just showed through a user interface you could also do by a script and you could plug in your different parameters in here you could go into the script itself to change some defaults and we're going to have one out for the lsp really soon so if you were a little bit overwhelmed by the lsp look for the launch lsp repo probably next week and that should make it a lot simpler for you to deploy these all right back to you chandler cool thanks john so yeah as you can tell uh really simple to kind of just um deploy the the optimize the optimistic oracle um there's a couple uis for for creating some options out there and also a synthetic boulder and a bunch of launch repos all of this a link um for any developers that want to use these tools and i'll share them with them on our discord um just a quick caveat the lsp and the polygon launch instructions will come soon so if you are particularly interested in that please let us know and we'll share the how to get started with that as soon as possible um and then one last thing uh we're hiring at uma uh we've got a bunch of open roles at the moment um just a quick one around some software engineers uh smart contract engineers and a launch engineer um you can read about this afterwards and it's also on our angel list site um there is a talent referral bonus so if you not necessarily one of these members but know someone that that might fit this particular role uh we pay up to a thousand uma tokens not a thousand dollars in tokens but like a thousand uma tokens um for a referral and there's kind of a vesting schedule on that which is quite cool and for anyone that wants to know what it is like um working at uma we published something that kind of mentions a little bit more about what it is like to work in in uma at the moment so i encourage reading that if you're interested i know there were a couple questions that came through so uh hopefully you have enough time for some q a um but that's it from my outside thanks very much for the opportunity to chat to you guys and really looking forward to some of the really cool projects that get built right um should we go through i think we have about three minutes left um we could try firing through these questions from the chat absolutely um first one's for you any details about the range token uh so the range token we're calling them range bonds so they're a combination of a yield dollar a put option and a call option um you you package those together um and you can use the lsb for that so it's just a combination of using uh some financial primitives to build together so build together these range um these range tokens so yeah we we have an article that's published on that it's on our medium um if if you're interested we can share that with you at the moment cool um is the lsp contract uh prize not eligible for a polygon bonus prize if you do an lspn polygon yeah so at the time of chatting to the polygon team we didn't have the lsb on polygon at the time this might change so if anyone is interested in that specifically we can kind of maybe put together that bonus but at the time of discussing it we wouldn't have the lsp on polygon at that very point in time um i think for how are the options priced uh depends on the option call options for instance i think we look at black scholes and then use that to kind of set an initial price on unit swap um links to the other articles on the lsps i will share those what happened to the mark cuban bet i don't think that that was ever like finalized the details of it but if we were going to implement that now we have a price identifier that's coming out soon that the working title is binary query where you could just ask like a regular question so you would write the details of the bet and ask like yes or no and we could give an answer to that so that's probably how we would implement that and that would work for any kind of like random proposition bet like that too bitcoin outperforming s p 500 yep that's an easy one that could also be a binary query one you know you could do like a combination of like an s p 500 price feed and a bitcoin price feed but binary query seems fine for that and anyone can propose a dispute um yeah human or bot and who watches it is really kind of up to whoever's putting the product out there you want to make sure that your product's secure so make sure somebody's watching it if nobody's watching it then bad prices can come through and your product can go sideways so you know make sure that somebody's watching it and if you need like humans to look at it you can set a long liveness period if you like don't want to run bot infrastructure you could say like i can dispute this for like a day and then just like check you know at least once a day or something uh so you know really depends depends on the product nice one through those questions rapid fire thank you guys uh john and chandler uh for running this workshop i hope you guys enjoyed it thank you guys for coming and yeah if you guys have any other questions you guys can find them in the uma discord channel um so yeah have a great day oh there's one last question if we have um what's the incentive to vote um you get voting rewards so if something goes to a vote which it only does if it's disputed if everybody like agrees on the price or at least doesn't dispute it um you know that's fine if it does go to a vote new uma tokens are minted and you get some of those if you voted correctly so if you voted incorrectly or you didn't vote then you don't get any of those uma tokens okay great thank you guys um yeah again hope everyone had a great day um great workshop and yeah reach out to them on the disc
