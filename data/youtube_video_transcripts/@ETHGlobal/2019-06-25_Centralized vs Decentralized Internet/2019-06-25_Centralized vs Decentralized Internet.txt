shall we start or shall we alright so hi there I wanted to have a I guess more chat rather than than a presentation type of thing I have these few slides I think they'll run me about five minutes and then we can just chat chat around as we see fit you know questions everything discussion so yeah the topic that I've chosen and what what word does it get us what kind of lifestyle does it get us into so I'm gonna be speaking about three things about the Internet what's broken with it today how to fix it and how is this industry is fixing it the guy the guy just just was talking about it for a half an hour I think it's one of the fixes and mysterium contribution and what's the next step that we could take and how is this all connected so the problem so who owns the internet this guy gave us a heads up into the question who might own the Internet it turns out that the Internet in the beginning it was completely peer-to-peer completely open machines talking to each other no middleman but as web 2.0 type of things happened big companies created huge silos they created a system for themselves to own the information which of course gave the powers-that-be low-hanging fruit to work with those companies well Edward our brave hero he gave us a heads up about the prison project anybody who doesn't know the prison okay the prison project it was unveiled unveiled in 2013 by Washington Post I think by the information given by the Edward Snowden he was working in NSA at that time basically it revealed that big companies Google Facebook Microsoft Apple we're giving real-time data which every data NSA needed about its users so basically and say with the prism can hear your ideas as you type them literally watch the video stream hear what you talk hear your your phone calls and not just phone calls Skype calls anything so it's a it's it's business as usual for the NSA and it's not NSA that the bad one it's it's it's a natural thing for the big organizations such as United States or such as China or such as Russia or such as any big power to have this power so this is a natural step of evolution once you have internet which is based on owning data owning the internet by the big corporations so that's that that's a natural evolution yeah so that's that's what what what the world we're living in and I guess there's no no surprise here this conference is about solving this and making a bit more empowered well for ourselves so the solution is basically giving the superpower back into your own hands so there are all of those different mechanisms and protocols and and and the apps in the in the soon to come future which we will be using hopefully on a minute-to-minute basis but they need they need an underlying layer which helps the store data to transmit data to to do the calculations to do all sorts of things so I'm just I was just naming few few organizations that are trying to solve some of these problems but the end goal is we're still using the same level of depth of Internet that we're using today a speed facebook or Skype or whatever else just the difference is all the data is being owned by us it's being encrypted and if I want to talk to you it's me and you talking no third parties interfering enter into our conversation so that's where mysterium comes in were what we're building is we're build we try to contribute this whole movement by building ad central I well we're starting to build on the BPM technology what we're building is we're building a protocol for the decentralized VPN and of course we're building the initial node network because the protocol without the nodes makes no sense and vice versa so yeah we're building both things at the same time eventually what what its gonna do is it's gonna unblock the content and block the communication open doors where walls are present at the mall like you know you can't watch lots of Netflix shows from Russia at the moment you can't watch a soccer competition that's happening in Germany from United States you can't do certain things while in other places because it's being blocked by IP right because it's being blocked by countries because it's being blocked by the Great Wall of China it'sit's and so on and so on so what we're building is we're building a network which is robust enough and the protocol which can penetrate those walls and open up the communication for people as if they're equal citizens of this planet not of that particular country so yeah that's that and well the third thing is we've built we build the initial protocols we've been busy about this it's been proven to work in certain cases and we found certain cases where it's not working for example there are certain routers which are different from from the ones that we're using in our lab and nab hole punching is a technology that were using to punch the hole through the router is sometimes working in these cases sometimes not so we need to debug those use cases we need to find solutions how to work with different routers so that's the first wall we need to figure out how to how to how to go through then we'll go for the bigger walls I guess so we don't have we do have built a node into the Raspberry Pi we do have build a node into Mac Mac iOS into Windows and into Linux yeah and we're searching 450 nodes at the moment I don't know how far we are around 80 something yeah that should give us enough enough enough spread to push the limits of existing technology to debug to improve upon you know what we've learned for another month or so so yeah that's what we're searching come-come chat us up raspberry's is is paying itself in what in one month raspberry cost around 40 we pay around 10 dollars worth of each every week so a month and that's that's that's been paid and yeah we have a so yeah that's that what's broken is the confusion who owns the internet I think you should own the internet bye how is by putting you know that ownership back into our hands and it takes a lot of effort from many many many different organizations and people and yeah and for us it's it's it's simple we're searching for the first initial notes so the whole traffic is encrypted between you and note most most of the services for for this very moment we have a few companies lined up it's to be honest it's it's VPN companies who are who are in great need of residential IPs and we have agreements with them that they will only send us streaming service so basically Netflix or something we can verify if that is the case or not the case so as a node you have an option to to be completely open to all of the network or just to the whitelisted traffic that's that's that's like quite narrow use of the technology and it's it's in the hands of the node runner to choose you know whether you want to open up our position because we understand that we need to build out this robust node network and and that's the infrastructure on which all the other beautiful services that we can reach can come from but right now we're in grind mode getting nodes into hold on the raspberry PI's on your laptop so if we're thinking about referral program any ideas that's our goal to get as many nerds running as possible within like a strategy for this particular use case cuz unlocking doesn't work without you know sufficient and robust network of notes that's when it starts to become efficient for the users that makes sense yeah yeah it could be it's it's a service you could make I don't know you have those services like when you you have somebody show you around the city all the nice spots which you would not find by yourself once you're traveling so yeah this could be the same just on the Internet all right most likely most likely so so I I'm hoping that somebody will you know who has the showmanship and and and knack for it would take the challenge and show people around like what they're missing in their small or big bubble whatever the size of the bubble yeah but for us as the foundation of mysterium I think we do have a challenge which is a very technical challenge to make sure that those walls are being penetrated solving that one yeah cuz cuz cuz eventually what we're building is it's it's not at this stage yet but eventually what we're building is an open open network so it's it's open source it's it's it's open for anybody to utilize as they see fit Wow that's I wouldn't say primary but that's definitely a first and it's the most obvious because because we we hear it like so many times if they know what the traffic is exactly so if they if if they don't then you know how can you if you can't tell like the guy before here I was saying if you can't tell whether somebody just smashed on the keyboard or it's it's a valid valid file you know then you can't really stop it and that could use as a medium to transport data so any medium is is good [Music] and anything and if you look deeper underlying technology is still the same so basically can be used for the deep things but of course the first use case and the most sort for is the entertainment so come chat us up yeah or just download it on your Mac or whatever it's working yeah yeah did they are by far better [Laughter] all right thank you [Applause]
