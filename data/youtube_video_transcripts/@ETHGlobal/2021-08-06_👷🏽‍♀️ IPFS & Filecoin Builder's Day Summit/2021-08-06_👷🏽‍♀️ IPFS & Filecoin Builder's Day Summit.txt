b good morning good evening good afternoon everybody my name is kartik i'm luke and we will be your mc's today for the ipfs and file coin builders day summit so for those of you who don't know this event in the summit is part of accfs and all of you are watching this on youth global.tv so for those of you who are going to be engaging with our speakers if you have any questions for any of our speakers from our talks uh be sure to sign in and ask those questions and we'll be able to relate those questions uh to our speakers um and hack fest is a month-long event where we have a hackathon going on and we have a couple of summits uh for just what's happening on the hackathon side we have over 650 developers from 61 different countries working on building amazing things and what three that use anywhere from storage decentral storage to smart contracts um and we can't wait to show you what what everybody's building in the next couple of weeks and also part of the hackathon we're doing two summits to highlight what is happening in the ipfs altcoin ecosystem so today is our first summit uh of uh this month well this is our builders day summit and then next friday we'll be doing our storage provider summit so let's just jump right into today's agenda we're gonna kick the day off by uh doing a keynote from molly from protocol labs and then we have all these amazing talks lined up so just to give a quick overview we'll have alan talk about what 3.store is in nft.storage then we'll have jimmy talk about estuary.tech and we'll have dan who's going to be introducing the palm side chain and ilia from new york talk about how did you enable open web and consumer apps with entities fasttack we'll talk about how to actually make really large and updatable and extensible nfts uh using ibfs uh stefano then we'll be talking about the longhash web3 accelerator program that they've been working on and then we'll let michelle cover uh how you can get more involved and get more grants uh from the ipa investment cloudpoint ecosystem foundations and just uh the projects that you're building to get support and then we'll close the day off by uh blake talking about the face camp program that they've been um working super hard on so a lot of amazing talks for the next few hours and uh without kind of further do we want to just kick us off with our very first talk of the day uh we have molly uh talk about who's going to talk about just what's now possible with allcoin um and just to kind of give a really brief intro uh molly leads the ipf our sorry pgp ipfs at protocol labs and uh i'll uh stop cutting in her time for our talk and just let her kick it off with that today so welcome molly to the stage and uh it's all yours awesome thank you so much for having me um this is super exciting i cannot wait to see what everyone is going to build as part of heck of us um and so excited super excited to get to chat with you today and feel free to continue the conversation um as as we go forward as well as you guys are building things i have office hours i'm going to be in falcon slack so feel free to ping me um and and ask me questions or show me cool demos of what you're doing i'm excited uh maybe i'll share my screen and hopefully everyone can see that um everything's great perfect cool um so what i plan to chat with you about today is really quick overview of the stack which i think you guys are all familiar with um dive a little bit into where we were a year ago um it's crazy to think back into where we were in 2020 the here that is falling off of everyone's brains because it didn't exist because of pandemics but where we were your year ago how far we've come where we are now what's possible to build now um some areas that are really exciting and some tools that are available to you to build on top of um and then a quick sneak peek into some of the stuff that's coming next um so i work at protocol labs our mission is to drive breakthroughs in computing technology to push humanity forward um we have built a number uh nucleated a number of new protocols and uh ecosystems trying to make the internet more robust um one of those is lapeda p the networking library of web3 which is used by ipfs falcoin polkadot ethereum 2 and many more folks there's ipfs which is the data and content platform of web3 which addresses content by what it is instead of where it's located and now has this really phenomenal amazing ecosystem uh that's grown around it an amazing community and it's even now enabled on a number of major browsers which is super cool um and then of course falcoin which i'm sure you've all heard about a lot today which is the storage network of web3 its mission to build a decentralized storage network to store humanity's most important information um the network is made up of thousands of storage providers around the world and it builds this marketplace between applications like all of those amazing groups building on top of ipfs who want storage in a decentralized network and a globally distributed network of storage providers who offer that storage to them and so to rewind a little bit the network you know today is still super new and so where we were last year was a different place a year ago i spent most of my time staring at this super fun snazzy gantt chart uh i don't know if anyone was familiar or part of the the falcon ecosystem back then but august 2020 was you're in the midst of this like space race calibration period we had not started space race which is the falcon incentivized test net competition um that ran for kind of a month before the the main net started um hack fs had just completed um and you know there were just a million things to land in order to actually make make file coin as a network live um so here here are some old snapshots i pulled out of old old all hands decks that i had from back then like the the test net in august 2020 was like barely limping along calibration that had just gotten to 10 pebbites of data we were like psyched it was like oh my gosh 10 peppabytes that's super cool um you know fast forward to today and we blow 10 pegbots out of the water but but that was cool at the time um and space race was uh you know in active preparation we had this um kind of calibration space for a spellpoint where we were um looking at the deal storage and success rates for storage and retrieval across all of the folks who are participating in the space race competition super excited after you know tons of time working with groups like we've gotten to 72 percent of storage providers were dialable which is like really exciting and you know crazy to think that far back into where the network was back then um a couple other exciting things that had we're landing in the the month of august um balcoin had just implemented uh eip 1559 so that we had the the gas model which i believe has just rolled out for ethereum so uh we've been playing around with it for the past year and it's been awesome it's been was a big differentiator for us in terms of making sure that uh um like networks and messages and transactions flowed really smoothly within foulcoin uh message selection was a big part of that as well um slate had just shipped building on top of textiles powergate which was pretty much the builder's tool that was available to people at the time i think uh at that point textile powergate was maybe like a month old and available really just for hackfest developers and so amazing to see how hard the textile team has come since then uh in kind of the the additional kind of solidity and and um tooling that they've built on top of this which is amazing um and then yeah hack of us had just wrapped up and a ton of amazing projects coming out of hackerfest uh went on to other accelerators to launch into the ecosystem and kind of evolve and continue offering um kind of new new solutions to people in the web through space which is super cool um then you know fast forward to two months uh into the future october 15th the falcon network went live with main net liftoff which was a really big milestone for a lot of groups and super excited to kind of like start that new phase of the falcon journey um and now kind of looking where we are you know about 10 months later the network has already amassed eight exabytes of storage over 8x bytes which is just crazy to think about i think i would have this blows my expectations for like where we would have been by end of year 2021 like completely out of the water um and that was even blowing the remember 10 petabytes was really exciting uh back during uh you know early days of the network so to reach this point is really cool um to amass all of this storage capacity that's available for web3 developers um you know anyone in the the wider internet ecosystem who make wants to have uh kind of decentralized storage for um their tools and protocols and there's also now you know a huge and growing ecosystem a ton of open source contributors and a good storage provider community as well um and so to kind of look at that you can see here that you know the amount of available data in the network has been growing a ton and this is actually already doubled um the storage onboarding rate has doubled just in the past month since the hyperdrive network upgrade that went out in um end of end of june and so we're right now you know we're seeing this growth rate continue to ramp up i think it's likely that we're going to hit 15 exabytes or more by end of year so it's just a really crazy kind of war chest of data capacity to to bring to bear on all of these applications um and as part of that that's creating a lot of demand amongst the storage provider community for amazing data to store so um lots of lots of groups are um really reaching out to folks who can act as really valuable clients who can bring kind of public data sets into um the falcon network and demonstrate how you know amazing this solution is for them and so um definitely if if you are someone who is you know tooling in those uh open data think there's a lot of opportunity here um as you can see storage deals as well utilization of that capacity has been growing super fast um you know since like uh january of this year it's just like you know whatever forexed 5x um it's going really uh growing a lot which is super exciting but also we have so much more to do here and an area that you know a ton of folks in this space are investing in super hard the ecosystem has grown massively in just the you know less than a year that um the falkland network's been live a ton of amazing partners have joined this uh awesome ecosystem to help build the network here um and there's now a ton of applications tools um you know developer sdks that are available for you as builders to build on top of and harness as part of your ipfs and falcoin web3 builders journey and so that's actually the thing that i want to spend most of my time today chatting about which is what's now possible what can you be building um and i know a ton of folks who are participating here in acamas actually already had a long chat with juan about all of the exciting things that could be built here um i know there was a big brainstorm session earlier this week if you missed it go check out the video um it's on the global youtube page i watched it i thought it was amazing i'm super excited about all the stuff you guys are gonna be building um but i just wanted to highlight maybe three areas which i'm really excited about and i think there's new tools that have just become available for you to build on top of um and want to make sure that you're all aware of them so that you can you know blaze forward in your developer journey um and can kind of build on top of the shoulders of everyone who has come before and focus on really reaching um users in the web3 space or building the thing that you know really sings for you and you don't have to go and kind of uh reinvent some of the underlying building blocks um and so those three areas are one web three native dapps on file coin building on top of all of the amazing dev tools from powergate to web3 dot storage which just launched last week um building things around nfps nft marketplaces mentors galleries on top of file point using nft.storage um which has been around for a couple of months now is being used by folks like openc and others and then building applications around photo video large data archives um pulling on some of the amazing kind of uh pioneering work that starling and internet archive have been doing around using falcoin as a verifiable storage layer so those are my three areas i'm going to chat with you about so first web 3 apps notably things like satellite or audience are doing an awesome job here in this space um because it's a super exciting area and there's a ton of tools that groups who are excited about building new web3 apps can use uh i mentioned slate already um they're an awesome uh they have like a whole developer aspect as well they've created both an application and a ton of building blocks that developers can utilize um to kind of leap frog forward and so definitely go check out slate and see if the they're a great place to build on top of i know that folks have probably already seen the the talk that carson gave earlier this week about the work that textile is doing to bridge fabcoin into um various other ecosystems and so the they already have the near bridge set up i believe they're bringing it to ethereum and um i think it's polygon in kind of the next short short time period and so this is a really cool kind of leap frog forward if you're building things kind of in the smart contract space and you want to take advantage of decentralized off-chain storage because punching storage doesn't scale nicely um then definitely definitely go check out what the textile team has been building um their implementation of kind of uh auctions for this data is pioneering and awesome and we're all like you know cheerleading and learning from it and figuring out how we can bring it to more things and so um they're an awesome toolkit they also of course have powergate 2.0 um which you know uh is the iteration from the 1.0 that launched uh just over a year ago uh and so they've got a ton of tools here especially if you're building kind of like a dynamic application um on top of filecoin fleek is also an awesome to look at they have a files app demonstrating use of the space daemon um which packages together ipfs text file and aims to make a really easy developer sdk if you are doing something that has maybe a static front-end component to a smart contract back-end fleek is also going to be your best friend when it comes to deploying say like a d5 front end um you know really smoothly from github they are kind of your netflix netlify easy replacement um i can deploy a website on fleek within like three button clicks or something at this point which is just kudos to that team for doing an amazing amazing job on the developer experience side um highly recommend go checking it out um you should probably also check out ceramic especially if you're doing dynamic document updates um i think they they just recently launched their mainnet it's super super cool and if you're doing anything around private encrypted data definitely look at the the kind of pioneering work they've been doing around um dag jose doug jose um and they've been like really pushing things forward there um also bring in a lot of the decentralized identity part that many application builders want to utilize and so go go check that out and again there's i mean so many so many of these that i could just go on and on um definitely check out truffle if you're doing anything and you want to be kind of testing within their amazing developer tools like ganache and of course metamask i feel like their phil snap is like almost going from developer beta to like actual open access uh usage but um if you're if you're aiming for the the lightweight ease of use of a metamask integration there's a falcon snap for you um and of course i'd be remiss if i didn't also mention web three dot storage which you're gonna actually get a whole talk about um right after this from alan but uh awesome easy new storage layer for all of your favorite web3 assets to store them really really easily this is a it's a data it's an aggregator and a broker in falcon network terms which means that it helps take many many many small files or like app uh data objects and aggregate them into filecoin deals and it does deal management deal brokering for on behalf of all of these clients and then it gives you back um all of the information that you need about uh what deal all your data is stored in um and how long it's going to be persistent network and all of that sort of stuff and it's super easy um i think the the record is i'm sorry if i'm stealing alan's thunder 56 seconds from sign up to having submitted their first stored their first file on filecoin so that's amazing uh talk about uh developer kind of throughput in terms of being able to have just like a drop in place solution to to then move on to all of the exciting hard stuff when it comes to building applications on web3 so um i'll i'll not steal any more valence thunder but definitely go check this out okay next space nfts nfcs are like my favorite thing especially when they're cats um but there's so much cool stuff happening here i'm sure there's a massive community here in the hackafest um uh hackathon who are building cool new things in the nft space or cool new things in the nft gallery museum space super cool the metaverse is is meeting web3 and i'm so excited about it um but nft storage should be your best friend um it's really easy to use you can store nfps up to 32 gigabytes per nft which i haven't met anyone yet who needs to blow past that limit but maybe it'll happen uh in which case split it into multiple use web3dot storage perfect um but definitely come come check out nft.storage it's a super um useful tool it helps you be protected from things like rug pulls lost nfts insecure links um size limits from other tools all of that sort of stuff and um i think i think we yeah we just crossed actually sorry my slides saturday we just crossed two million nfts stored on nft storage um many of them are coming from ethereum but they're also coming from places like polygon and other places um and definitely go give it a try it is almost as easy as web 3.storage maybe it's easier i'm not sure but it's amazing so uh go give it a try um this has been used by folks like openc to do their freezing metadata feature that they launched a month and a half ago or so and there's a lot of great content here about how you can use ipfs and falcoin to uh kind of support the the really critical parts of addressing and persistence for nft so we can make sure that this you know collective cultural work that we are building in this nft collection across all of these amazing creators um you know we'll be here two five ten years from now and all of those nfts kind of stick around and stay super accessible um and yeah just just a reminder to folks that drug polls are a real thing and definitely use ipfs um use follow coin to make sure that your uh your data stays around long term uh my last and third area is around photo video and data archives and the amazing applications you can build around this actually audience is another great example of this where it's all of this amazing audio content that's being um kind of minted in a way on the ethereum blockchain and stored um on ipfs and i believe filecoin at this point um another great example of someone who's building around this is internet archive they're bringing a number of their um kind of like archives of of amazing you know talk about humanity's most important content uh most important data that we've amassed bringing this to falcon is part of the the falcon archives project um and i think that's really exciting here i feel like there's actually a lot of opportunity for builders there's fewer developer tools here so that means there's an opportunity for building tools both for developers and for these large storage clients um to make sure that all of this data can can move smoothly around in the web3 ecosystem because we're talking big data here pebblebyte data sets um and so it gets exciting um but that's also a huge opportunity um really cutest to jim for for building this um visualization but there's a huge opportunity to apply uh the the marketplace example from nfts to large data sets as well as i mentioned there's eight exabytes of capacity there's a ton of storage providers who are really looking for how they can bring their storage content storage capacity to bear on humanity's most important content and making doing the matchmaking between large clients who have peppa byte data sets and large storage providers who really want to put their capacity to use it is a new opportunity just like the marketplace between a nft creator and an nfc collector and so um would be excited to chat with any group who's um looking at this intersection and wants to build uh kind of a an auction house for data sets or tools for enabling the kind of interaction between these two groups um i think there's a really exciting space i know a number of large storage clients who are like wow the the 10x multiplier for storing large data i would pay a hefty penny for that um and so if if you are um excited about this there may be a lot of opportunities for you as kind of a broker um or clients to to build um an idea for people who are building on top of such data sets is the work that um that the starling foundation um or starling has been doing with the usc showa foundation for example with their photographic archive of trust which documents the uh 2020 primary election i believe it's beautiful it's like this this great overview of kind of how they used um kind of on on-device capture of metadata um storing like chunking this data storing it to file coin um and then visualizing it from a user perspective so that anyone who's browsing kind of content and i believe it was reuters in kind of like the reuters ui can see where images were taken and verify that kind of the the the cust custody supply chain of that data so that they can increase their trust in in media i think this is a really cool example and it really builds on top of this kind of checkpointed use of a distributed storage network and the verif verification of the proofs of storage um really using falcoin there to to show you know yes this is the exact content content addressed um that's been stored here over time uh and can be persisted long term um in a way that everyone can can verify um and so i think this concept of verifiable storage is a really interesting idea that a lot of kind of large archives or um kind of large data set communities may find really exciting um so that you can kind of look at these continuing continuous audits that data has been publicly um stored verified and stays available um and i think there's a lot of a lot of opportunity around that i'm almost out of time so i'll just give you a quick preview into a couple of things that are really exciting that are coming next i already mentioned nft.storage and web3.storage but um it's still new that you can store up to 32 gigabytes per nft so go and take advantage of that would love to see some video nfts or metaverse nfts or other really cool things that are are being kind of built and stored here and definitely take uh make use of web3.storage which is brand brand new off the presses um new another new area that's coming up is this kind of cheap fast verifiable storage through things like the the bridge work that textile has been doing and also some of the work that's um kind of uh in the works uh around content indexing so you might have heard about car v2 if you pay really close attention to the falcon ecosystem but there's a lot of work happening to make sure that all storage deals that that get stored on fellcoin are also indexable and accessible um through ipfs gateways and so a lot of work is happening there get excited about it should have some more information in the next couple of months um third there's a new fip that you should check out i know people here probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about fips i spend a lot of my time thinking about falcon improvement proposals um and it's super exciting it can make um storing data and deal making like hundreds of x faster um cheaper easier and it really unlocks all of the storage capacity that that um storage providers have amassed so far so that you can make deals for you know hundreds of pebbabyte archives really really quickly um and that's super exciting and it just brings the accessibility of this technology so if you're going to be building something for the next month think about how you can kind of um parallel that work um with some of the the new fits that are landing here as well and how you can take advantage of them and finally this is an area i'm super super excited about is really opening up falcoin actors in many ways to uh more developers as well bringing things like edm smart contracts into foulcoin um this is still in super early days from a design perspective go check out the fifth issue if you want to kind of contribute your two cents or if you have a lot of expertise uh with the ins and outs of solidity and have a a lesson or two to share but i'm really excited to make all of the storage in file coin programmable and accessible through kind of a um you know a smart contract layer there as well so that we can script things like um the concept of repair miners that just automatically on the falcon blockchain make additional storage deals to globally um end up with many redundant copies of your data and and much more um so much is going to be interesting here from a d fill perspective as well which is like a d5 but with fallpoint um anyways there's a lot of really cool stuff and i'm so excited to see what you all build because there's um you know an amazing amazing community here and um i know that folks are gonna just blow everyone away um so with no further ado get building and i'll hand it off to allen to talk to you more about weather.storage and how you can build on top of that um feel free to reach out to me at on twitter or on southpoint slack um momek28 on twitter i'm going back to on on fell point slack and happy to chat more well thank you for that that was an incredible presentation it's been an incredible year for the whole file coin ecosystem obviously i think we're running a little bit low on time for questions but i do encourage people to continue the conversation in the discord as as was stated our next presentation comes from alan uh he needs no introduction but i'll give him one anyway he's a software engineer working with protocol labs currently working to make the distributed web more accessible to developers alan if you want to get started i will hand it over to you sure thank you okay let me just share this with y'all all right um okay if you don't see the screen then let me know it's gonna be boring um all right um welcome to uh this presentation i'm alan um and this is a mashup of two talks uh about storing data on ipfs and filecoin uh using web3.storage and nft.storage so let's do it first of all i'm gonna talk about nfts um quite a lot the kind of off-chain side of them uh how they can be stored decentralized on ipfs and filecoin for the long haul so um i'm kind of new to nfts most people are they haven't been around for that long um but when i found out about them i was uh i was super excited to see that um the the ipfs was already being used uh to to store them um so for example if i go to like any kind of uh website like this one for instance this is a this is a game it uses nfts they have like a kind of marketplace uh and they have so like nfts that you can buy and trade and stuff uh so let's have a look at i don't know this one for instance um i happen to know that this um this particular game uses the marketplace of marketplaces um called open c open c there we go um and i can just paste in hopefully the um the uh token id of that this particular nft hopefully i can click on it did that come up there we go is it working oh hello there we are there it is oh come on internet no open c is not having a good time at the moment all right let's try one more time okay right anyway this is a cool car uh but yeah i can click through and i can see that it's metadata is here i should just be able to click on this this talk is like fraught with uh with danger so um we shall see how it goes it doesn't look like things are going to work out so well today for me um anyway this is going to ipfs.io um uh the these this uh you can see in the bottom left there that it's a cid on ipfs.io and the metadata for this particular nft here it is it's just come up uh is stored on ipfs so hooray for that that's great um and uh hang on here we go back to the notes there we go um and but why why is data for nft stored on ipfs anyway well it's because it's kind of prohibitively expensive to store data on chain on the ethereum blockchain at least and ipfs actually has some really nice properties for off-chain data that um we'll go into in a little bit um and so um as i learned a little bit more about nfts i came to realize that um the the uh developers that are enabling nft creators so like the the openc for example like foundation like zoro they all really cared about users being able to access their data should they ever just like disappear off this off the face of this earth like if they if they fade away like that they still want people to access these nfts that they've bought and created and traded um so they don't want the nfts to just disappear also and so um ipfs uh this this comes into play now and this this thing called ipfs can solve this problem it actually fits the bill really well um and um from my point of view at least it's not really surprising that it's being used but uh so let me just rewind a little bit and explain um some basics of ipfs in hopefully not too much technical detail um but i've chosen a uh a little um nft here that he's a uh little one-eyed squid thing that's on actually on sandbox that sandbox game um and uh anyway so if i put him on ipfs firstly what do you get you get acid it's called a content identifier and cods are a kind of cryptographic hash and they address the content not its location they address that squid with the one eye not where it is um and um and that means that any given cid will always refer to the same piece of content so if that um if that squid were to grow another i for instance then the cid for that squid would actually change um and what typically happens is those cids are stored uh on chain and they're linked to from chain and if that wasn't the case if if we used like a regular url to like google drive or like dropbox url or whatever that could be problematic why could that be problematic well um the content at the end of that url could be deleted by the owner the domain could could uh could expire or the hosting like it could be not be paid and then uh and then just go away the the image could or video or whatever it is could be altered in some way so i could have my squid turned into a cute cat or something which which would be disappointing um or for instance the url just might not be accessible from within your country or maybe you're in like some sort of corporate firewall or something where you actually need to get hold of that data from um appear that's maybe closer to you than the internet location where it where it actually is so ipfs how does it work anyway well um so if someone who's using ipfs um requests that data by its cid then um the person who has it will send it back to you and they'll receive it you'll receive it so um and now two nodes have that same content and they can serve it to anyone else who comes along so uh like this if someone else comes on goes do you have this cid the content for the cid and uh and uh either one of those nodes can help to transfer the bytes to that uh to that node we call it uh bit swapping uh because why not uh and and so that that happens and now three of them have it and the cool thing about this is that the original node who had the content can actually go away like gone gone gone um and the data will still be retrievable from other nodes uh in the network and this is the awesome power of peer-to-peer hooray um caveats there's two caveats the first one um the first one is that if all of the nodes uh that have the content um go away then you're not gonna be able to retrieve it it's kind of kind of obvious worth stating if there's no one on the internet who has the content you're not gonna be able to get the content that's caveat number one caveat number two is uh slightly less obvious it is garbage collection so depending on your um configured kind of gc uh configuration um it might run at a particular time uh it might run when you're configured repo storage limit is hit so you might be fetching things from ipfs it all goes into your repo and eventually you'll use uh enough data that ipfs will go okay we're kind of full now uh let's have a let's do a gce ram and uh and the third other um time that it might be run is it could be run manually so you can actually invoke gc from the command line um or you can uh if you've got the http api exposed you can call it from like that so what you need to do is tell our confessors this content is not garbage um because um when you obtain content from the network that you didn't actually add yourself that content is eligible for garbage collection so if i got this picture of the squid from someone else then it could be garbage collective in the future so what you need to do is kind of tell your ipfs that this uh this piece of content is a rare nft and it's not trash don't throw it in the bin please um and in ipfs that's referred to as pinning and if you don't pin your data then it will eventually be garbage collected so even if the content is super popular you can still eventually um exit the network and so these two caveats are why uh developers generally use a third-party service like pinata or textile fleeq to store their content um because they have nodes that are publicly available and they stay online like 24 7 and obviously they pin the content so it doesn't disappear cool so nft storage uh molly just mentioned this earlier so you kind of already know a little bit about it it's something that we've been working on for a while now it's a place where you can store your nft data decentralized on ipfs and filecoin safe in the knowledge it'll be there tomorrow um and it hopefully goes some way to addressing that permanence problem um and uh it's free it's free as long as possibly as long as we can possibly make it free and the one of the founding kind of principal rules is that it should be easy to store data using this service so how does it work well um you upload your nft data to nfc.storage um and nft storage stores that data on ipfs nodes in the network that's right we actually have a cluster and we store it in on three um free nodes at least um so okay so far so good but how's that different from any other like pinning service well um behind the scenes what nft storage is doing is it's negotiating deals to store your data with storage providers on the file coin network um and so the file coin network you might already know incentivizes the storage providers to store data quite heavily they get paid to store data they also get typically get paid when um data is retrieved and they also get block rewards when uh for providing capacity to the network uh so why why is that good well if anything that stories were just to happen to just go away like poof it's gone then um and and also every miner on the net sorry every um ipfs node on the network went away as well then um then the file coin storage providers who have the content will still have them we'll still have it and they will store it for the duration of of the deal that's been made for them and so you can think of these storage providers as just another set of ipfs peers with really strong incentives to continue storing that data and this is this is hopefully a really good level of redundancy basically and should uh like i said go some way to solving that permanence problem so um here it is again nft storage free decentralized storage for nfts on ipfs and falcon um and uh the url is nft storage i've said it about a thousand times you should go take a look um we have a simple api it's expressed as an open api schema if you don't know what that means it means we can generate docs like this we can also generate like actually generate clients from this schema uh which is which is kind of rad in different languages um that's really cool um the api is re real small um you're probably going to need even smaller subset of it like these two like if you want to upload a file just post to slash upload but what what i really wanted to draw your attention to here is this um this check api and so with this api you can actually check uh the status of any uh the cid of any nft that has been uploaded to nft storage and the output for that kind of looks like this and so you can see here like the uh the like pinning status of this particular cid but also the deals with uh file coin storage providers that have been made or are being made currently and so you can see their status um like time date stamps for when things have happened changed the on-chain deal ids so you can go and look it up you can see the the address of the storage provider who's who's actually storing it or going to be storing it um and what's interesting what's really interesting here is that there's two things there's um there's the batch root cid here and and also the data model selector and that they're they're kind of important ones because what happens is that as data comes into nfc dot storage it gets uh kind of aggregated together into this big pile of data and that gets that gets sent to miners and and then um if you ever want to get your piece of data out of that big uh aggregate then you're gonna need the data model selector and that allows you to pinpoint your particular bit within uh within the aggregate uh so anyway this is this is a cool api that you can you can use to check stuff um yeah we also have the same thing in web3.storage which i'm going to talk about in a sec um js client we have an official javascript client this one isn't generated from open api we've lovingly hand crafted this one for you uh it's got typescript types it's got nice api docs um we've got a metadata api as well and this metadata api is designed to make minting nfts really easy for you by guiding you through creating like erc 721 and 1155 compatible metadata um and uh we will take a look at that um let's take a look at that now all right here's a here's an actual demo so let's see how it goes there my gods are um hopefully gonna help me out here here we go here's the whole whole desktop okay um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna use this metadata api i've already installed the client from nfc.storage using npm i'm importing it like this and i've just created a um a version here i've created my token already on the website just go to nfc.storage and create it i've exported it in my uh terminal so that should just work um and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try and store this this image called pinpai because it's appropriate about pinning and stuff so uh pinpai let's try and store this using the metadata api so what i need to do is uh call client.store and then give it an object that looks really similar to something that you'd get in when you click through from uh your um token uri uh which is minted on trent on chain uh to and what is stored on ipfs essentially the metadata for the nft where the actual uh image file or video whatever it is can be stored et cetera et cetera but it looks uh it's really simple it looks something like like this i'm going to call it buy it has a description and we call we're gonna call it because it's a comic thing um and then what's kind of cool here is that um we put the the the property is called image and this has to be essentially the url to an image where your nft which is your nft essentially um but what we put in here is actually just a file and what happens behind the scenes is that um the nft storage client will automatically upload that image for you and replace that image with a ur url to the um the the ipfs uh asset which is stored on ipfs so let's just quickly do that create a file i'm going to use fs.refile think i'm going to get the pin by jpeg um here we go you have to give it a file name which could be different from the actual file we're reading from i'm just gonna give it a mind type of image slash uh cool uh so we this returns a promise so i need to wait on it and i get back this object uh i get this object this metadata object and i'm just gonna log out the metadata dot url and this is the this is the url that you'd actually use in your minting process and that would be stored on chain essentially uh log metadata i'm just going to print out the data here just to show that this file gets transformed into a url to this um this particular asset i think that's all i need to do so we'll see if this works i'm in the wrong directory okay sorry about that right here we go so let's just take a look here uh so yeah so we printed out this this logged out the url this is the url that we're gonna put in uh on chain uh and also um here is the data and you can see this image got transformed into a url as well so that's super cool um here we go and what i should just be able to do is head on back over to uh to here and if i put this into my browser uh yes there we go and i should just be able to fetch it from any ipfs http gateway um and this is the data that i uploaded to ipfs so super cool all right um that's that demo successfully done uh stop that sharing okay right let's get back to the slides because slides sides are here here we go um cool all right so what what do we do there well um we actually uploaded data and then we got back a cid from nft.storage um and nft.storage is doing the work of um generating that cid from the data that we sent it and there's a couple of problems with that um firstly we have to trust nft that storage is doing the right thing it's not giving us the cid of some malicious virus in some way it wouldn't do that but you know you don't know in this trust us peer-to-peer world we're trying to inhabit um so it's better to have generated that cid ourselves why can't we do that why don't we do that um well um the other thing before we get on to that the other thing is that um that that we have to um wait for that cid to come back to us we have to upload that data and um uh and wait for that crtd to come back when actually it would be really useful to have that cid before we uploaded because then we could mint our nft on chain uh whilst it's uploading and if it's something big then it might take a while to upload so actually having that cid um generated on on the client side before it gets uploaded is really useful because then i can use it somewhere else i could maybe even store it in a database in my in my app or whatever um so so it means that i can i don't have to trust nfl storage and um i also get to get to solve this ux issue basically um so yeah why can't i just generate that cid before uploading the data well turns out you can uh new is storing cars and cars are not automobiles in this world cars are content addressable archives and it's kind of like tar for dags and dags are directed acyclic graphs and they are the things that the ipfs generates when you import data to it so yeah tarpon tags if that's a if that's a thing anyway um so it allows you to know that cid before you upload um and in the client um or so on the client side we can do the work to generate that cid um and it means assembling that data into the graph but then we have that cid we have that root file but once we have the graph we pack it into a car and send the car instead don't send the data send the car it's got the tag and then that can just be stored by nft storage you know you know what's being stored is is the the thing that you added because you generated the cid on the client side so there we go um and it also means that we can split it up into multiple cards like you can send you can send partial partial dags like bits of it and that's cool because if you've got like loads of data you can split up into smaller bits and it also allows us to send data that's more more than 100 megabytes in size one of the um kind of quirks of this service is that we decided to put it on like cloudflare workers and they are cool because they put uh put you know your your worker close to whoever's requesting that api or using that api um but they do have a limit on like how much data you can send them in one in one chunk but uh but it's okay because we can chunk up things uh so we don't have to we don't have to abide by this hundred megabyte rule anymore so you typically end up this is completely contrived uh diagram but you might end up with like something like this a yellow line it uh kind of rings around the nodes in the graph that you'd maybe be sending in one car so you might send this set of nodes in one car you might send this set in another car and you might send this set in the third car and we know that all of these cars are related because they have the same route cid that's pretty cool um and that that allows like failure and retry without sending everything again we can just send any any car in any order uh because it doesn't matter um and um and that allows us to also report on um progress after we finish sending a chunk so we can say you know we've done enough and you get that your ui feedback so that's cool all right let's try a real quick story in the car demo i know i feel like this is going way over time i'm sorry uh all right so here we go uh stop the share let's share my whole screen okay cool um great so this is very similar to what we had before i've had to i've imported this extra ipfs car module this is going to help us pack a car from our content um the path i'm going to use is i'm going to use pinpai again uh the content is the content is actually so that's just the the file name essentially read file read the file i don't actually i'm not going to use pinpoi at all because what i want to demonstrate is actual uh splitting and chunking i've got my skate movie here it's 24 megabytes let's just uh let's just make sure that uh here we go here's my skating movies 24 megabytes that's great um i'm gonna i'm gonna use that um what happens is that the cars get split into 10 meg chunks so we should see um two uh three chunks uh two ten megs size and one formic uh so escape movie here it is oh typing here we go uh and and so the cool thing is at this point here we've packed this uh this video into a a car file and we've also got the cid before we've even sent it um to our client so we can we've got the cid here and we and when we get the cid returned from the client we can verify that the cid we created is a cid that has been returned to us so i'm calling this method called store car pass it the car and um and the cool thing is that we've got this um nice call back which gives us like the size of the chunk that was the car chunk that was stored so we can log out we can log out the how many bytes we've stored for each chunk that gets sent hopefully that's good to go so um [Music] there we are uh npm no node node index let's try again here we go we've got so you can see here we've got that cid like straight away um and so now what's happening is uh well there we go we've got one chunk got sent that's about that's like four meg and so these other two here's a 10 meg chunk just come through another 10 meg so we've got three chunks got sent they all got sent in parallel we send up to free in parallel um to not starve browser browsers but um that's that's the kind of cool thing about it and the four megabyte uh chunk even though it was maybe at the end of the data it it won because it's smaller so there you go and the cid we've got back is the same as the cid that we um that we we calculated that's pretty cool back to the slides all right uh we are getting on for finishing off but at this point i've talked a whole lot about nfc dot storage um but we're free dot storage is the brand new thing it's just just launched almost almost literally uh and um and with three dot storage is built for any data so it's not just nfts if you remember this slide from earlier then um web free dot storage does exactly the same thing uh so uh but it's just not not uh it's not just for nfts uh it's for any data so you can put a images videos uh you can put uh documents uh whatever you like even ipld data as well so um you can pick what works for you the best so if you're gonna be minting nfts then you're probably gonna want to go with nft storage it gives you the tools as you saw to create and store and ft metadata and that that and that metadata will comply to ethereum standards um it also follows best practices for linking to data stored on ipfs um and um and for everything else then web3.storage has you covered so you should uh check that out the other the other difference right now um is that um cars are baked into the web3.storage client that we've we've made this is a nice nice js client we've done for web3.storage as well um we'll catch up the nft.storage client at some point but at the moment you can see for storing files at least um you just call like client.put and then it does it there's no mention of cars here like it's just it just does that for you it um it will create the dag it will split the car up it will upload it will do um uh retrying if it should fail for example so um so hopefully uh even easier uh than lft dot storage all right so let's really quickly dive into the architecture um this is essentially a fork of nfc dot storage um in the future nfc dot storage might the back end to nft storage might be where free dot store isn't um we'll see how that goes but um they are very similar at the moment very similar um and and so what happens is that users interact with the http api they send car files uh and we put stuff into our ipfs cluster uh that's cool we have like a six node cluster we have we put stuff on at least three of those nodes in the in the cluster so that's kind of cool and we back up everything to pinata pinata uh provide a pinning service as you probably have come across um if you've done any kind of ibfessy stuff um and uh yeah that's their um the storage broker service this is where all the interesting stuff happens basically and what what it does is it grabs all of the cds from our database our database is called fauna um no idea why uh and anyway so it batches them up into uh presence so they're not really batches there are aggregates of data essentially now presents for miners and they are the presents are actually cars as well everything is cars um and um and what happens is the storage providers they come and eat them up uh not really literally eat them but they will take them because it's the self-serve kind of thing they're like give me give me the deals and i'll store that data cool okay um last last bit uh free when we when we say free we often get questions like why like how how does it how's this even possible well um let me let me tell you a little bit about how it works this is this is essentially um that that bit in the bottom right hand corner of our um our diagram here just uh expand it out a bit this is one particular storage provider who has some hard disks uh anyway so what happens is that storage providers commit their hard disk space to the farcoid network they they basically say i've got they've got this capacity uh and they get like significant block rewards for doing so and that's this this kind of circular thing because that happens uh essentially every as as the block progresses they get they get rewards and this translates into real world profits profits are down here these money stacks at the bottom left um and uh and yeah so so that's that that happens and that that means that they're really like incentivized to keep uh committing additional hard disk capacity to the network so they keep doing that like more and more um just so they can they can make more profit and of course why wouldn't you do that um however when uh the storage providers are storing data from users on the network their likelihood of winning block rewards goes up by a big factor 10x so um wow look at those profits they just ruff raced up um so you can see the potential profits to be made here by storing real user data and this this is such a powerful incentive for file coin storage um to store data such as the data that is coming from a free storage um or nft dot storage that they're they're willing to offer um free storage in order to get this block reward multiple in some cases storage providers um want to store data so badly that they'll actually pay debt users to store their data so anyway so as long as these block rewards continue to be really powerful incentive um which will be true for a long long time and for example like bitcoin block rewards are still an incentive for bitcoin miners today um storage should be free for all verified users on the far coin network right now um and so if it's free for us to store data on farquin and it's it's free for you to store um to store data with us so uh yeah if you want to learn more about the the mechanics behind that and how to be a verified user then if you go to the file coin docs um and then uh click on this there'll be a link there for filecoin plus it's dock.filecoin.io um and um and you can you can find out how to do it and that is uh mostly all i have to say uh but thank you so much for listening and um hopefully i haven't gone too far over no no no no excellent excellent job excellent presentation as always i am i want to encourage people to continue the chat in the discord i know um alan covered a lot of topics today and i'm i'm sure everyone's got a lot of questions on how to build with uh with nft storage and web storage weather storage in their hacks over the next three weeks alan thank you again i want to introduce our next speaker jim jim works with the application research group helps lead them at protocol labs needs no further introduction i'll let him take it away from here hello how's it going um just share my screen so wow yeah thank you for letting me present about estuary at hackafest um i'm gonna give a little walk through about this project we've been working on since uh around like april march uh what's the arg though um we're we're building applications on top of amazing technologies in the follicle and ecosystem and so it's uh it's me it's why uh chris elijah a lot of ecosystem collaborations to name a few textile fission arzora a lot of people from protocol labs a lot of technology that's made there is absolutely amazing and we're hiring so maybe if you want to roll with us and make cool software let me know what is estuary so i was thinking about how to describe bestiary and i think it's a story for the most reliable way to upload public data to the follow coin network and our methodology is we work in the open so we're hoping that others take from our open source code and just learn and improve on it uh i think we break up into three parts it's a hosted example of an estuary node um an industry note stack that anyone can run and a documentation platform to discuss and iterate with the community and we it's a familiar place i think for ipfs devs who work with http uh we support the ipf spinning standard um and i think we we really try to improve on the follow coin storage deal experience and i'll get into more of this later i'm gonna give a walkthrough of the features but uh we reliably make deals against the falcon network at six replication so we make a ton of deals for better for worse and it's been a lot of fun um so we're running an estuary node http you can use any language you want to interface over hosted api we configure it to be invite only uh we could change this in the future but if you don't want to get an invite uh web3 storage and empty stores don't require this kind of gatekeeping so you can use those today we're testing optimal performance instructions uh and integration so uh as we make mistakes and as we get feedback we will continue to iterate and improve on what we're doing and someday you'll be able to run your own node and so here's some of the the i guess like the proof is in the pudding or you know like people want to see data in our performance so we've put over three million files um onto the file coin network over through three thousand deals over nine terabytes um over 29 terabytes of sealed storage on falcon network and we're working with 96 miners the goal is to work with like a lot more if we want to uh so we're we're curating miners and trying to figure out which miners you want to work with and we have a couple power users one power user put over two million files another power user for over eight terabytes of data and we're just testing the ceiling seeing how far we can go and so i'm going to give a feature tour of what you can experience when you look through the website and kind of like talk through some of the parts and then also go through a feature tour of what it's like to be a node operator and what you can see and manage so uh we put commands everywhere uh there are commands for everything all of our documentation marketing pages so we won't really want to show that this is like a developer tool that you can just like kind of use about going to the gui the gui is kind of like the least important part of the product i think it's it's kind of um you know you can just run these commands wherever you are you can use lotus to retrieve you don't use anything that we made and uh you know we have clickable links everywhere so you can see the files that you've uploaded and so here's one from the marketing page um we think it's really important that you can verify your cid so what i mean by verify or cd is that you want to know it's on filecoin and you want to know uh which miners that it's on specifically and you want to be able to see details around that and you also want to see um you know like a receipt for that storage deal so you know how long it's going to be on chain and so we we created an experience around this where you can basically you know make a deal see the deal successful see the start end date uh see the collateral see everything and i think that transparency makes easy to understand and we'll keep fine-tuning this experience so people i think are better get a better grasp of what's happening with their data we obviously want to add more like you know what location the miner's at you know compliance a lot of things for us to explore uh we added upload via cid so you know there's a uh a default way that you saw in the beginning of this presentation where you can just drag and drop files but you can upload a cid as well upload via api so our documentation is editable you can um upload files from the docs itself so you can just copy and paste the curl command even and do it from the command line we want to we want to just be really open with all our process and make the whole thing a playground that people can play with we do public performance analytics so you can see basically how well this node is doing in the in the public so uh nothing's kept secret even our failures uh we keep uh a graph so everyone can see like the performance um and we also keep a list of every single miner or sorry provider that we work with and you can see the stats deals and errors and if you go here you can see uh well skip ahead you can see some of the logs that we help show so this makes it really easy to work with the providers on bugs and figure out what's going on we can skip a meeting uh makes things really quick so we have a cool thing around batching batching is kind of an example of what happens when you know if people are uploading like four kilobyte files or something really small like small text files um we we have a way to automatically bash that into a bigger deal and the reason why we do that is because every miner or provider has in their maximum piece size minimum piece size kind of like a maximum little tag and a minimum will take so we're still experiencing the best way to do this but we don't want to overload miners providers of a whole bunch of really small padded files so this is a great way for us to kind of batch things together and make a more valuable deal and we provide the provider details on estuary so there are public pages and in the future you know we basically can show error logs we can show price we can even share like compliance and a whole bunch of other really cool things and so see how much time i have left cool so now to get into tools for network operators uh as we build out those things for kind of like the client experience for network operators we want to uh you know we we're focused on stress testing the capability of our note today so whatever we achieve we will provide the steps for you to do the same and so uh horizontal scaling with shuttles it's a cool new invention uh i'll get into that more later or you can talk to me about it offline lock store storage capacity essentially inventing new techniques to store more data on a single node um faster rights and reads and uh built-in file coin address support so you can run your own verified address and make deals on your own you can even just use a normal following address if you're willing to spend file coin about making verified deals and i think allen covered that really well in his last talk and if you want to talk more about verified addresses we can talk about offline as well and so the one of the coolest things as a network operator when you're running your own estuary in the future is that you can curate your preferred providers and you can see all the logs and you know have a relationship with them where you know why deals are failing or succeeding and if there are problems you know and you don't you don't have to make deals against all of these providers you can basically just you know suspend them for a little bit uh it'll show up on their profile page and you can basically talk about the issues and then work through them together and then re-enable them so i think this is kind of like a a step in the right direction with when it comes to like a relationship between a client and a provider where we can debug things together and figure out what's the issues the data transfers network issues et cetera uh you have a file coin address if you run your own estera node so uh you don't have to verify it uh we have an address right here has a balance of file coin and um this address is for holding we can move that amount to escrow and whatever moves into escrow gets used for making a ton of deals and so um you know you can you are in total control here and we'll add a lot of uh um different features that make it so it's much more manageable you can set limits you can maybe like even limit by user and so we're still exploring this and we have great ecosystem partners that we're working with to help figure all this stuff out um shuttles are like a really really cool invention um i i know that like there are a lot of clients out there that have a ton of data like it's just not easy to move sometimes petabytes over to wire and you probably shouldn't because if you're using uh the cloud you know you probably pay for network ingress on that and it's gonna be very expensive and so uh we are like the the shelves like an option before offline deals where if you really don't want to do an offline deal what you could do is you could uh have us create a shuttle really close to you and then you could upload your data directly there and maybe save on some of the ingress costs and so we're experimenting with this right now and it's been great like it's actually helped people who are in europe upload a ton of data instead of like going through you know us east one or whatever um there's a lot of user debugging tools uh that we're gonna be releasing as well so uh network operators can debug problems for clients by impersonating them i was kind of hesitant to show this feature because i think it it's kind of like it puts a lot of responsibility on a network operator to be a good actor but at the same time you know we've had users have really stress tested estuary and it was really nice to be able to go into their account with their permission if they gave us their api key and kind of like find the bugs at like you know a million files and see why things aren't paginating correctly and um when you run your own story node you can actually uh make your asteroid node open to everyone so or you can make your restaurant node uh like as a service like invite only and so we chose to be invite only for now and so you can see this page where we can generate invite keys and we can invite other admins so right now estuary that should be managed by a few other people to um you know create invites and allow people to come use the product the last thing i think is uh one thing that's really cool about running this asteroid node is that you can also see um the hardware system analytics and so this is a really bad screenshot it doesn't show all of the details but i really want to know how things fail i think that's like a great step forward to figuring out you know how to improve your product and so we keep track of the failures we check the deals attempted and we also have a hardware stats so you know how much uh hard drive space is being provided by the box that you're using and i think as we fine-tune this uh we'll give users a lot of control over how they want to run their estimate notes so you hypothetically you could run one on a cheaper machine somewhere and you know you as long as you curate your providers and users in a certain way and set expectations you can even support filecoin deals that way without having to have a super robust system that we have and so uh yeah that's um that's pretty much a quick overview of all of s tray hopefully i didn't go through it too fast but if you have any questions about it uh you can ask me and i'm gonna play actually a little teaser of um what's to come in the future so we are we are making um videos to describe some technology that we're creating to make estuary work and so in the future you'll see videos from the application research team that uh will look like this and they'll have a lot of different examples of you know what to uh like how to use the product how to get an invitation um in i think like what we actually really need are more technical deep dives so we'll probably do some more deep dives on the stack and how to run your own uh and all the different modules that we've built such as like phil client and etc so um stay tuned for more videos that kind of walk through uh how the product is used and um how the stack works and uh kind of like even some discussions around like how what direction we should we should go in the future so yeah i placed through that pretty fast um stay tuned and uh yeah i'm happy to field any questions now thank you for that an excellent presentation um if we have some questions give me one sec i guess we're all sort of interested to know um you know next steps and big plans for for the team um let me see if we have some questions from the audience yeah so one thing that we do want to get to is by sometime in the future we want to make it easy to send petabytes of data to the follow coin network and so i think that's going to be a really hard challenge uh and very rewarding i think there isn't a lot of tools right now that make it easy and so we have workarounds today in the ecosystem that are really brilliant um but it would be nice to have like a fire and forget solution where you can send that much data to the filecoin network and we'll keep experimenting playing until we get there for sure for sure i know this is pretty specific to the event itself but we've got a lot of hackers here some of them you know completely new to this space looking for things to build and you know looking for ways to to build with estuary um suggestions for them i guess would be important do you have anything off the top of your mind that you would give to a new hacker here yeah so i would say that if you're a new hacker uh don't feel too intimidated by what you see i wrote a tutorial i'm not the best writer in the world but i wrote a tutorial here that where you can actually play with the whole api right here in the code so you can change this to and change the code and play with it um and you need an api key i'm not going to go and get one because i don't want to expose that on the screen right now but you can basically go through this three-step api and see how easy is upload files to estuary and you don't have to use javascript so if you are a python dev a ruby dev um you know a godev whatever just you can just use your api of http and you can integrate into your application without installing a module so i think that that makes it a little bit easier if you if you were worried that you had to learn a front-end language or learn javascript to participate in the hackathon or you had to build a beautiful gui you can actually use the whole api from the command line and uh it should and i would love to know if it doesn't work out well so there's a little bit of a feedback form right here and this feedback goes straight to me so if you write anything you write here uh be nice or be kind i guess but you can you can write feedback here and it will go straight to me and we can have a conversation about it and i'm more than willing to help you and solve this problem so if you're a new hacker um i have a lot of time uh to help so let me know your questions and and i'll be more willing to help you get started awesome awesome well thank you i think we're uh a bit ahead of schedule right now i want to thank you know thank jimmy for for your time obviously but we're going to take it to a break for just a second so if you want to stay stick around and enjoy some low-fi beats we'll be back shortly right where we left off cool see you guys all right and we're back i want to thank everybody for their patience um bringing in another guest for our next presentation daniel heyman dan is the co-founder and ceo of palm nft studio prior to that he led protocols group at consensus they built a variety of ethereum related protocol efforts um dan if you're if you're with us it'd be great to have you step up on stage and hear a little bit more about what you do and get a better intro than i can give you yeah thanks so much luke hi everyone um super excited to be here and chatting with you all so let me share screen get some pretty visuals for you so very quick just intro as to as to who i am as luke said i'm the co-founder of nft studio i'm energy studio develops uh nft projects on the palm side chain and today i'm mostly going to talk about the palm side chain why i think it's interesting who some of our partners are in that effort including protocol labs how you might perceive building on it then i'll talk a little bit about the studio because i'm a co-founder it can help a little bit of shameless self-promotion by way of background so as luke said i spent the last four years at consensus i sort of grew the protocol engineering group there from about two people to 60 65 where it is today we have an ethereum one implementation called hyperledger basu hybridge base is actually the foundations foundation of uh palm as well we have an ethereum two implementation called taku which i also encourage you to check out and then we have an enterprise ethereum implementation called consensus quorum that has something like 30 of the overall enterprise voucher market and when i was at consensus building these sort of production grade enterprise grade solutions for jpmorgan or mastercard or some of the other clients it occurred to me that that same technology exposed publicly could solve some of the challenges that nfts had in the ethereum ecosystem i'm a big believer in the ethereum ecosystem we want to keep projects in the into your ecosystem and so as that background and consensus sort of led to the creation of pom and combinatory studio before before getting more technical um i think it's always interesting to stop and think where nfps are today where they might be going a lot of people have different views on the future of nft that will be valuable we've seen some incredibly successful projects from crypto native art to sort of nba top shops top of the list in terms of capturing existing ip and leveraging this new technology expanded we've seen some really exciting projects like maxi infinity and zones do native games with blockchain i think there's a ton of innovation and a ton of uncharted territory still ahead for us my personal belief is that in three to five years the vast majority of nfts will be given away for free they will be fan activation and engagement and rewards and we're going to use nfts still as collectibles a little bit and sort of crypto art will still be important and always be important but the thrust of it will be really the connection point between creator fan and the activation point between creator and fan and that that looks a bit different than the way nfts are largely thought about today or at least implemented today and it also premises on the fact that it's uh just as important for existing brands as crypto native bridges and so a lot of what we do at palm nft studio is trying to work with leading artists creators brands and how they can use this technology and evolve so you know pum is so that's sort of the background in our thesis um we launched palm the side change it was soft launch eight weeks ago now it's gotten increasing usage over the last couple weeks in particular last week we saw the first major projects on it um sort of got to see some major throughput on the system which is exciting there were a few fundamental design principles that we wanted to solve with bomb but first of course the scalability everyone needs a scalable solution particularly if we think you know high volume nft is going to be the future gas fees are of course a challenge with ethereum but the the one that surprised me most in terms of customer feedback or what brands and ip owners and creators are looking for is the environmentally friendly angle and i've sort of been ted's deep in the crypto space for a while and in the crypto space we talk about sustainability we talk about the importance of it but it's sort of uh it generally seems like it's more of a secondary concern but for creators for artists for brands for consumers it's very much rightfully selling primary concern and so we wanted to design a chain that could sort of meet the needs of sustainable brands and sustainable customers that said we wanted all this to live within the ethiopian ecosystem so i believe deeply in ethereum i think that is my bias i think ethereum brings the most innovation the most developers the most tooling the most existing projects so we also wanted to make sure everything was as compatible as possible with ethereum so that's that's sort of what we set out to do in in practice what this means is we set up a network based on hyperledger bassoon hyperledger basu is a ethereum client you can use it to run the theory of mainnet nodes if you want and a number of people do but it also has a consensus mechanism that you could swap out for alternative purposes one of the consensus mechanisms you can put in place for proof of work is a variant of the pbft families this one is called ibft or qbft and to skip the jargon it's rotating proof of authority so it requires a trusted validator pool that's sort of the downside in terms of in terms of decentralization and for that downside you get a number of benefits you get a chain that's fully evm compatible you get a chain that has long particular gas fees high throughput at around 100 to 300 transactions per second per day today but we we know how to scale that much more we've scaled the solution all the way up to 10 000 transactions per second [Music] and then fast deposit withdrawal from ethereum so our bridge which is live has sort of hit some production like speed bumps in in the last few days but the fastest transactions are going over the bridge in under 15 minutes even under five minutes uh and we're targeting all transactions going to the bridge and you're 15 minutes moving forward and so these are these are all nice properties the other nice property and the thing that's sort of implicit in all this is that the technology is not brand new this isn't sort of technology we're testing so to speak this is the core protocol is something that we've deployed a number of times for production which is which is pretty awesome and the other point here is this this is a collaborative effort with a number of folks so common nifty studio is obviously invested in the success of on the network we're far from the only one here's just a few uh a few projects i wanted to call out because another dev tools are super important protocol labs has been a supporter of bomb from day one all the nfts are currently out on palm are stored via ipfs and filepoint and we're continuing to our collaboration for decentralized storage solutions infuria hosts palm and hosts ipfs and instance and so you can use uh inferior's pinning service and other things like nft.storage on today consensus is one of the leading validators on the network through fira which exposes the apis truffle integrates very nicely into palm as well i don't want to go too deep here but there's about a dozen sort of key projects that are already launching upon and so as we roll out our our network it's really exciting and validating our hypothesis that staying as close to the ethereum ecosystem is really important and we're starting to see that take up uh at the beginning and so you know what do i mean by uh theory and compatibility um so there's a there's a bunch of layers of the stack probably one if we're being is missing from this diagram in terms of data apis maybe but the the nice thing about pom since it runs hyperledger basu it's like literally the same evm uh it could process mainnet so all the app codes are supported it's the same api interfaces it's also hosted by inferior so we have the same infrastructure we've had projects tell us it's a matter of an hour and a half to fully transition their project their product from ethereum to pum [Music] and that's that's pretty remarkable so you can redeploy your smart contracts the solidity code will work you can connect to the same inferior api endpoints from chain id and then just as importantly the nfts that you make on one chain can move across the other and vice versa currently our bridge only supports uh 721s and but we're planning to add additional support on the bridge and so that's an ongoing effort until it's really important to us so i've said this a few times with that sort of high level compatibility with ethereum is like absolutely core design principle for us and something we think is super important you know so just to reiterate this if you want more info there's docs.pom.io that's getting started you can also join our discord which is available via our website upon io the the concept behind palm and the tech stack is is really really simple you know it's an evm compatible side chain it's uses rotating proof of authority to get scalability it's hosted by infira it's got a bridge back to mainnet and we're having an increasing number of third-party projects deployed there's one thing i mentioned uh or should have mentioned that i didn't yet um it's also really important to us uh palm the side chain requires you know a native token palm to pay gas but we we're not selling it we're not trying to make money off it we're giving it away for free to developers and projects who need the token to do things on cheap and we're also asking those partners to give it away for free to load their users so they can do things on chain the real the real goal of this token is to be a utility token to pay gas in the future govern the network it is not something that we're trying to monetize and so if you want access to that faucet or or want any information about any access to that you can find some information on docs.com.io i'll also give out my email at the end of this so you can get started yeah so that's that's sort of the whirlwind pretty brief technical overview stepping away from the technical bit i wanted to talk also a little bit about palm nifty studio which is sort of the company i lead you know palm the side chain is it's an open network it's hosted by infira consensus funds a bunch of nodes io builders nifties we've got a bunch more people bringing nodes on board mnft studio is a company committed to deploying projects on and you know you can think of ourselves as sort of part creative studio and part technical layer api so the the most recent project we did was in collaboration with uh henny you can go to henny.com to see more here i don't know how many in this audience are familiar with damien hurst damien is by many measures he are one of the most successful contemporary fine artists and he made 10 000 physical pieces of art back in 2016 around the concept of art being currency sort of all we usually think of art is this thing we stick on our wall and it stays there and it can't move and he was wondering well can art actually be exchanged more often and traded more often he did this before nfts were really a thing and so when we were talking to him he had this brilliant idea of of using nfts is the way to run this experiment and test whether these nft whether whether our work could be exchanged like this how people use it how people interact with it we love the project because it uses the technology to extend and expand what is capable with the artwork and right now we're posing to all users a really interesting question oh and there's a really interesting question so if you own a damien hurst nft you have one year to burn the nft at any.com the burning option will go live every two months but once that option is live you'll have one year to burn the nft and claim the physical if you don't earn the nft and claim the physical after one year the physical will be burned and you're stuck with the addition i was kind of asking a question do people care more for the digital and the physical i'm very interested to see the data that comes back i personally plan to keep mine in the digital um i've heard a lot of people want to buy two so they can have one of each uh it would be an interesting experiment we were able to sell obviously 10 000 of them we had 35 30 35 000 people apply for over 70 000 nfts the second year market in the last week has been really robust both on henny.com on the palm side and on openc on the main net side and and for this one you know palm and empty studio obviously did none of the creative damien hurst did all the creative but we worked with them to design the project and help implement the drop um which which we're really proud of the other project we did recently was sort of the opposite in terms of problem energy studios role it was a collaboration with warner brothers and nifties.com nifties.com sort of was the site of the experience this happened through it uh they they did the technical implementation design of the game and palm energy studio was responsible for the creative assets like the visual nfts and what you see and we're really proud of this one as well so there were two rounds of drops the first round 90 000 fts were claimed and sold within a number of hours uh the second round i think the number was into the six figures so it was one of the largest nft projects in terms of number of nfts number of users engaging with those nfts i think these two projects are good examples of our capabilities so we've got deep technical ability to implement new projects but we want to marry that with deep creative capabilities it can do justice to and really showcase existing brands for us for us this technology will go mainstream when major brands are using it to extend what they can do the major brands will only do that when they think the technology will do justice to their work and so having that world-class creative team is absolutely crucial to our vision as well um and so you know i was told to speak for about 20 minutes and that was that was 19 so not so bad uh you can find us on pawn.io doctordocs.com.io there's the discord so everyone has it my email is dandan.com.io feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions i feel compelled to make the plug that we are hiring in all departments everywhere so creative product technical content if you're backing engineer full stack engineer front end devops tech writer we have a ton of open roles if you don't see an open role that meets your profile but you're still interested in working with us email it would love to receive that email and with that let me let me take a sip of water and see if there's any questions thank you thank you excellent presentation i'm always excited to see i know we're all excited to see new nft projects it's such a vibrant space right now especially you know bringing in the traditional art world into the distributed art world seeing the alignments and synergies um take a few questions here i'll see if we have any in the chat first but if not i know um you know we have a we have a diverse set of hackers here today a lot of which are new to the space a few of which have you know come to our events before looking for ideas on on how to leverage nfts for their projects right now what are some interesting developments do you think in the nft space right now that you think that they could potentially work off of for their project in pack fest uh i think there's a bunch of cool things going on that can give ideas i mean the the party that happened yesterday to sort of buy the alien punk um or sort of forget how many people but like a few hundred people each shipped it a little bit more to make the giant bid i think that was really interesting experiment on how communities can engage in the nft space for collectibles but for me the most interesting thing is happening with nfts are outside the collectible space so some of that is being pioneered by axi and you know zed run and others in terms of the player in space i think the space jam project was really interesting sort of a marketing activation space and so i'm sure there are hackers in your audience who have tons of different backgrounds understand what their companies would want to achieve within your media right and if we think of nft as a new media new way to extend content and reach you can start to get pretty creative about how to do things and also how to connect traditional media and new media so i would love to see projects that um that sort of real world crossovers much more that have sort of multimedia storytelling much more i think that'll be the some of the some of the more interesting innovations that we'll have moving forward definitely interested to see how the sort of art as currency idea sort of takes hold um i want to thank you again for for your presentation and encourage people to connect you on discord and in the ways you've listed um i'm going to bring up our second our speaker we have following this uh ilya uh elia if you're if you're ready to go you can get this going um one second ilya is the co-founder of near protocol which is celebrating three years by the way prior to that he was with deep learning research and led a team at google working on deep learning research uh ilia whenever you're ready we can get this started yeah uh thanks luke uh hello everyone it's great to be here and yeah i'm excited to see all your hacks uh when the hackathon ends um yeah wanted to talk today about open web what it is and kind of how to hack for it i guess let me share my screen and we can start yeah just while we're here yeah we actually started uh in august pretty much six six to eight i guess um year so it is actually three years since we started i'm really excited about this journey so let me kind of first introduce a little bit about open web generally like if when we're thinking about web right and i mean all of us are using it all of us are using the word but what is this actually right and actually vab was a one of the protocols of the kind of internet in general so when uh just internet was kind of starting there was like arpanet all these networks and there was a set of open protocols that uh people are using to communicate using these networks and the email is actually one of the few protocols that survived kind of through this time then the app came and that was really this idea of how do we kind of exchange information how do we uh like link to it and share content and do this thing and so this was kind of in 89 it started out and then for a while we had this idea of you know yellow pages and internet and all this kind of like basic stuff let's put information on internet and everybody will be able to have access to it and then about in 1978 when amazon google and kind of few other big companies were starting the this idea of interactive app came in right this idea that you can actually interact with these applications you can actually able to put in information and see relevant links or you can put information to stay there and this is where we have social we have all those things but with that we kind of lost some of this open protocol ideas we kind of lost a lot of the spirit behind the original internet and instead we started to kind of give a lot of power to these big companies that are providing us the services right so we kind of became almost like uh those customers but in many cases products of the services and with that you know you have user data acquisition you have data leaks that's been happening all this time because kind of you have the central honeypot place where you know all of your data is and it's been sold it's been you know stolen and it's been used in all kinds of ways and so what we have kind of nowadays is this resurgence of this of the protocol idea of the ideas of how do we build something that doesn't require this kind of centralized provider that will be exploiting this data and exploiting this usage but really kind of bringing it back to the original ideas now in parallel this has been a growth of of you know blockchain right and it started with just money it started this idea the simple idea how do we make a peer-to-peer money where nobody is in the middle or nobody's in control except the people who actually hold their money and this is where bitcoin was born but as we saw in the past few years kind of this idea of well actually you can build more than just you know pure transactional money you can actually have a full financial system you can have all of kind of programmable types of applications that leverage money as one of the components and use the same technology use the blockchain uses trustless layer to really start building something that you know now we know as dfi or openfi that really transforms almost how people uh kind of operate with money and so open web kind of from one side right we have this pattern of like people trying to go away from those big serve kind of uh big centralized companies that are operating and from the other side it has this technology kind of pattern right of well actually we have now a trustless you know no intermediary uh protocols and systems to build on top of which we can actually build this open web and so this is like in my for me this is where you know these two things meet right because a lot of people have been trying to build for example like mastodon and other protocols open protocols and uh even uh the instant messaging protocols but now none of them succeeded because they were not they were building them in vacuum they were just trying to build a protocol they didn't have this kind of trustless layer and financial incentive layer uh on the bottom so that's where we are and so what is actually open that right what is this concept i mean and people call it like three as well but open web is really this idea of there's a set of philosophies that people follow when they build applications right and decentralization is one of its philosophies right so it's really this idea that you don't want to have a single center single server single party that is able to control the whole system you don't want to just to be able to bring it down or you know big data or whatever you also want kind of this idea of composibility right because uh when we think of you know googles and facebooks they always provided some kind of api you can always use their service but they control it and they are really only give you a fraction of things that you can build uh kind of that you can use from their service if you're working inside actually inside everything is very composable so i worked at google and inside google actually feels like a huge open source environment where you can just like take you know a little bit of here level there compose it and launch new application and that this idea that like actually in the permission is open you know to everyone way is is the spirit here uh you definitely want it to be open like you don't want you know you need to pass an interview to google to be able to do this stuff or uh there's some kind of you know guards that like oh if you're from this country if you whatever whatever is the property that people like to discriminate on like you don't want any of that and and like this is very hard to achieve right uh you want it to be user first and this is where you know if if you think of companies companies never use it first right it's it's its values are always driven toward kind of company internally and so if you're building companies it's really hard to be user first uh however you know they say because you always like user for you is just a source of income right and so uh you're just trying to kind of um figure out how to how to how to extract that income from them and then in in kind of the sphere of blockchain right this is where you own your keys you own your money you own your you know whatever that is and so we want more of that more ability of users actually owning their data owning their governance and being able to decide for themselves what they want and obviously underneath you need markets and you need economy because this is a driver like this is the ability to actually you know invest in innovation achieve it and kind of sustain it over time if we have ability to create the economy so i have this very messy graph uh i can zoom in a little bit for a second and so uh this is just to show you like i like to say this is the idea that you know there's always a plan somewhere so kind of the idea is that when we when we started out with blockchain uh there's a lot of components that go into building a blockchain you know storage networking sharding executions and all those things but blockchain is just a small component right and when we look at it right there's a lot of kind of infrastructure that goes into it but then there's a lot of applications and protocols that you build on top and i'll i'll kind of go over basic stuff but uh okay if you have a whole slew of financial applications you have a whole host of infrastructure olympics and stuff and so this is just an idea that like as we're developing this there's a lot of things that are in progress and there's a lot of things to be built and this is actually a call for hackers to actually uh you know go and hack sounds and stuff um so let me let me kind of explain what we already have right this this is i mean as we i mean the whole space right uh we have there actually a set of primitives that are very powerful that are actually enable a number of things if you you know combine them in the right ways so we have a programmable ownership we have a way to program ownership of you know some digital information some digital data that can be money can be data it can be you know hashes of some data on uh file coin this can be uh you know nfts this can be you know actually some something that maps to a real world right to a real world item and you can program it in in kind of unlimited ways right you can say like well if it's thursday and you try to transfer it it actually will transfer to somebody else right you can do whatever you want and this is kind of this is something that's not possible to do in you know normal kind of programming right this is not something that like you are able to program banks to do stuff or program you know ownership databases to do stuff in such kind of powerful way we have this pseudonymous identity right identity is important because it allows people to um obviously to build reputation to to accrue kind of information to have the ownership but it's pseudonymous means also people can have multiple of them that are kind of exposing different angles of this thing and obviously privacy and ability to uh really kind of perform things that otherwise maybe will be harder to do we have encryption and proximity encryption and if you're not familiar with proxy encryption re-encryption is this idea that if i encrypt some data i could actually allow you to have access to it through a set of kind of cryptographic primitives and set of nodes without anybody else kind of having access to it and me needing to re-download this data and so this this allows now to share data in in kind of different ways with different parties via pretty much trustless protocols obviously we have decentralized storage i mean uh we have file claim here and a few other solutions we have oracles oracles are actually a very powerful concept because they bring them information from off chain on chain and you know we need this economic kind of we need this information to do both economic and non-economic decisions a really cool concept is your knowledge proofs right his ability to prove something that this is an outcome of some computation without actually redoing the whole computation and you know it's pure magic but it actually works and now we are able to do this in new interesting ways and the thing i'm really excited about is kind of decentralized autonomous idealizations is this idea of organizing people around the world in novel ways right there's completely no ways and still being able to have access to all the programmable ownership to economy to finances to all those things uh kind of through this new new new level right think of it as you know if come companies kind of the legacy style gauss is a way to you know kind of program a company that is global and you know have all the same can have all the same features or whatever else you want different and it's and it allows us to kind of create this organization that are impossible to do before so all those are primitives that are already here like you can use them today and you can build novel applications so like how do we have this well actually because we have all this infrastructure built right so we have scalable blockchains that allow you to kind of have this ownership have those identities and kind of things around that you have indexing and querying this is kind of one of the blobs there on the chart where you're able to actually connect uh you know your front end to the nodes kind of in the easy way get the data that they need and all those things right we have scalable storage chains like falcon we have economically secured oracles which allow you to you know trust like as a smart contract you can trust the data that comes in with some economic guarantees and we have new ways of kind of getting getting people in right the gateways and exchanges are allowed for a person who never seen crypto to actually start using it and being able to kind of on board into this so all this is already here its components are kind of built and it's now about how do we combine them so the other side of this slide is is really reimagining how we're doing things because when you build things in the kind of web 2. um if you build a sas or if you build a consumer app there's a set of ways how you usually would build an application how you build a company right you would have a marketing budget you would you know go out to you know facebook buy facebook ads and youtube ads you would you know figure out how to get your app installed on all kinds of phones through you know ads in other games or in other applications but it's not really how you would do it in kind of open web because you now have this one of the pieces one of the components you have is ownership itself you can actually uh kind of program ownership of your company of your project of you know application you're building and you can use it to uh to do all kinds of stuff right so the simplest thing right is able is is really about building a community or an application who will become your most loyal fans who will be also owners of this application through you know various ways and through that they actually will become your you know your marketers and your uh you know influencers and your community members who will go out and bring more users and so this is i call it the usage mining this idea that like what you want to do you want to really align the way people use your network the way your application or network is is growing right in a value and you really just allow people to get ownership by doing that right and like in d5 a lot of it is it's called liquidity mining because liquidity is the way to kind of grow the network but this can be anything this can be a social graph where you know the social graph is its value is um kind of the number of connections and so you can actually align around growing the number of connections as a network and receive kind of value around that and at the same time you have kind of this ownership now becomes you know it transforms how people think about the applications and and and kind of how they associate themselves with it right a good example have been in toronto a taxi company actually used this idea and they aligned their usage mining around drivers driving the taxi right and so drivers became so kind of embedded into into this application they became you know the biggest fans they kept you know selling this app to their customers to their friends to kind of everyone who likes to listen because it aligned both some receiving income and ownership in this application which is you know in in a way captures future income of the system and so like that app before pandemic have outperformed uber in toronto because of kind of really aligning those networks and so you have this novel ways to really build applications that are a almost impossible to build before because you can be global you can be kind of using uh these primitives and you can create new ways of actually aligning people to really push this application grows this application without kind of building a marketing machine without building uh all of the things that we kind of usually do in your sales machine in in web 2. so what's next right i kind of talked about you know primitives we have infrastructure we have this new base like what's missing right why is not everyone you know why is my phone doesn't have all the apps are uh using open web and so the thing that's missing right now right and this is again exerted from that graph is a set of common protocols that would connect kind of this basic primitives and what the applications will be at the end right so a few of the protocols that i believe that needs to be built kind of in in coming in coming a year or years are social graph right like if you think of it when we right now using on facebook it's on story on facebook then you go on linkedin it's like its own social graph and so you have like every single app has its own social graph and so having a common social graph protocol right where kind of for your identity your identities even you have your friends you have your followers you have your kind of uh you know work colleagues and it doesn't matter which app you go but it's actually ha like you know it's connected to your identity and it's you know encrypted to you and it's kind of yours and you're just allowing apps to use it when you when you are interacting with them pretty much would allow kind of open up a huge set of use cases and a huge set of applications communication is another one is really kind of creating communication channels between you know multi-party right now we again relying even with all you know the signals and telegrams which are supposed to be you know encrypted and everything we're still relying on a centralized party to deliver our messages even though underneath we have internet that is decentralized and so and again like the decentralized communication protocols have existed they just never actually uh beat the centralized one because they're always kind of lost in the in the kind of this investment slash uh like protocol game and now we have an opportunity to build these protocols that are incentivized to be kind of growing music nvidia and kind of across all the content there's a lot of kind of opportunity to really reimagine and have a common protocol that musicians and video like videographers and all these people they right now receiving a smallest portion of the income that they can be receiving from their fans right and nfts is one way to connect them but really there's a lot to do on kind of on on the basic stuff as well certification and reputation right this is just an ability to track around the identity of the person like the pseudonymous identity or even a kind of some identifier of an object right certifying that something is true or not like that creates a huge you know set of things where if you can rely on this and the next set of applications become way easier to use and so figuring out the protocols that are reliable that like others can build on is huge the really cool one is conflict resolution if we have conflict resolution that is kind of can work between two pseudonymous identities right we pretty much have a court kind of what we have in in you know in in the government that is able to kind of make decisions around you know facts like it doesn't matter who is behind that identity it doesn't matter uh kind of what is the history there it just matters what's uh you know what's this conflict and what's facts that were predating this specific thing and maybe reputation obviously maybe some other things but it's now you know we're removing all those biases that we right now have in the court system we're removing a lot of um kind of like places where people can make mistakes and now we're really kind of simplifying it to a core uh core primitive and another one that i really like is work scheduling is really ability for people to uh to kind of grab a like post some job grab some job and so this actually requires a conflict resolution because what if they didn't do it and so that's kind of i mean here on the graph you see some of the linkage of this protocols because they'll kind of uh connect at the end so this is like set of protocols that i like i believe we should be building and this is again this is a call for hackers to go out and build them and if if you are building this reach out to me i would love to kind of work with you and support you and figure out how we can launch this so i was talking kind of from perspective of like technology i was talking from perspective of you know building stuff but what does this mean for users right because as a user we mentioned before like you wanna you want some sovereignty you want the control right you and so here this idea is that user now is in the center right you have all these protocols kind of around you and you're able to really interact with them and it doesn't matter which kind of front end you're using right you always have access to your data you always have access to your information to your social graph to all those things to your communities and you're able to really drive um kind of usage and drives the the like through this owning of a little bit pieces of this protocol drive where they evolve as well and so this is really powerful for those users because like between you know facebook that constantly changes rules or like instagram removing like like button for for south america right here you have this ability to really like if somebody built a better interface for you know file like image sharing using the same social protocol awesome you know tomorrow everybody flog there and people who didn't vlog they still see because they're using the same protocol they can still see the same stuff they just you know maybe don't see all of the information that new app is using so you now have this ability for users to choose and to really kind of drive because of this usage to the applications that are the best instead of kind of this centralized platform it's also very powerful for creators right a lot of creators right now and i mentioned instagram because that's one of the complaints they are kind of stuck in the platform they are in right and usually like uh these platforms also use all kinds of ways to kind of restrict them from doing things and so we already see in blockchain that creators love it right part of it is because there's this concept of royalties meaning that as things get resold or get reused they're receiving kind of a percentage of the future value that's been transacted back to them and this is something that obviously none of the platforms do and none of the like physical items are have ability to do that uh we can see this kind of going beyond because now creators have a direct audience that they can connect to there's a way to interact with them in more direct ways and and get feedback and get engagement right and so this is also like the topic here is like passion economy there's a lot of kind of exciting stuff happening there even outside of blockchain but this concept of really connecting them together of a user of like end user and the creator through nfgs through the content through the platforms that kind of engage them uh is definitely something that like both sides want and we see already is happening across discords across you know these platforms and like for developers right you have this um ability to kind of mix and match pretty much already on top of existing stuff right like where before you would need to you know you launched an app it's like zero users zero data you know and now you need to start building stuff here you launch an app you know every single user of the platform already is your user right they maybe didn't do anything yet you already have connections to a lot of data from other applications and now you just you know combine it into new experiences you know create incentives create community and you know it kind of propels it and like defy in general showcase this kind of edit for you know specific slice of use cases like financial ones but that was the idea right like somebody launches the default app there's like 100 million dollars worth of kind of money coming in because people are exploring what are the other apps they can use but like they're the same the same platform they know the guarantees they don't need to you know be like double checking who built this app because they know so a lot of the guarantees already the example i use is there's no chance anybody would build a like 50 billion dollar kind of financial system on something that's like built and maintained by you know a dozen people by a dozen engineers but this is what ethereum right now is and so like that kind of um conceptually like that kind of ability to build on something on top right something super valuable billion dollar letters of value with few people as well like unit swap is built by a few people on top of something that's on its own is also like a startup and built by a few people is in kind of almost unimaginable uh before before blockchain before open web so like i mentioned this but like this idea of compatibility it's almost like that's why i didn't give you like examples of apps because there's just so many of them that you can do and like i have some in my in my chart but there's like just infinite amount of things like you know from like just example i was trying to find some examples that are kind of funny like you can do like you know a social network where only people who have enough reputation can talk to each other right or you can have uber for co-workers right because you have social network you can have you know gig protocol for calling cars so you can only you know called over forced coworkers when you work or whatever um you can have a more interesting like more uh real example is like you can have this personal medical data encrypted and then you share it to specific entities and you can have a log of everyone who has access to it right and all of this potentially is doable in the real world but like here you have already also like if we have all those protocols this becomes an extremely easy thing to do right or you can have you know what x infinity is doing right now but there's like a lot more opportunity to do with games that i actually have like economy around ownership around uh kind of creation and destruction and really kind of uh moving beyond just uh you know just the easy like pay to play so i just gonna give you like one example of uh how this works already so we have one app on here called near cloud which is uh pretty much an amazon mechanical torque which is a crowdsourcing app and so this is done fully unchained we have about one like 1 500 daily actives on it with like over 2 000 like uniques uh using it and it's already collected over a million data samples uh since launching in april right so this is an example of of an app that kind of is literally what you know like i i use this kind of stuff at google every single company doing machine learning is using this uh to collect data and so this is like an example of this app working in and the benefit is that it pays people around the world and we have people actually from philippines who literally surviving right now because they have this job and uh like during college there's no other opportunity for them to work at uh in philippines we also have people in russia who live in their like shitty job like on the factory or something that because they are able to earn a good a good wage with this business application so this is really example of like this open lab is not just you know conceptual we have already stopped working and like these people are non-crypto people this is not people who you know doing defy trading or any of this stuff this is truly people who are like just you know earning very little and are wants to find an opportunity in their life and creating these opportunities for them right creating this economy and then them being able to participate in it in really easy way like sign up you know not need to figure out private keys all the stuff and start using it so i don't know how many of you know about your protocol just like i didn't want to talk too much about it if you're interested reach me or you know near.org there's a lot of information but just high level right what we've been building right and kind of our driver is really to build something that's ready for mass adoption right and so we we kind of built this in a way that normal people can use it normal people can onboard start using it and as you mentioned in case of new crowd and being able to you know not you know it's not going to cost unfortunately right it's scalable via sharding which means like we actually maintain low like kind of low cost because we actually are able to add capacity to the network we've been really focused on making an experience as close to kind of what normal web experience is right we think of it as like almost like firebase right and so pretty much allowing people to write in typescript in rust allowing people to kind of use existing smart contracts as rest api so they can easily add it to their whatever app stuff like this is really what drives us like making it so easy that millions of developers actually able to participate and at the end it is about community right i mentioned community multiple times like at the end this this whole thing is still people who are actually building and who are using and so we have this huge community of kind of creators and you know people who are helping and of course developers who are kind of working together to really expand this ecosystem to make things uh kind of easier for everyone in the world so given you're here you're hacking you might be into you might be interested we actually have a it's a non like it's protocol agnostic called open web collective accelerator and kind of founder community to help people to develop their applications into real products into real things help them with fundraise help them with mentors help them with you know talking around makes all those things and it's the application process is open right now so if you're interested open up collective.com apply there just to mention we have a lot of content that we've been we believe in education we believe in the space needs a lot more kind of information and teaching and so we've been doing a lot this is just a few examples of redone we have also academy we have certification program all kinds of stuff but check out our youtube there's a lot of videos on how contracts build how protocols work how like use cases can be uh if you're interested in more about kind of randomness or bridges or economics in general our blog as well as full of that and uh thank you and yeah i'm i'm excited to respond to your questions thank you for such an excellent presentation really glad to have you in today um i wanted to to ask you just a few questions about the direction of near and and the developments in the future i know you're just hitting your three-year mark now um what the big part of the next half of the year will look like for you in terms of development for sure yeah so i mean near as ecosystem has like lots of levels and i mean as this this probably is a great example where it's like well in in this level we have a set of things that's happening in this level so i mean overall if we're talking about specifically the protocol right the blockchain part uh we continue working on so the sharding design uh there's a lot of interesting things coming out it's kind of resharding changing number of shards and things like that we're also working on uh really kind of optimizing things like initially we did a lot of stuff just to kind of launch it but there's a lot of ways we can optimize and make the kind of protocol even cheaper and faster to run right and that's obviously going to be a goal going forward on on kind of next level we have a lot of interesting stuff coming out one of the cool things that just came out uh kind of a month a few months ago have been aurora and aurora is a separate company's separate project that is providing people who want to write in solidity for kind of evm ability to do it on near so it's actually infrastructurally it's actually we took evm and they compiled it to webassembly and run it as a smart contract and it just shows you how powerful kind of our native environment is but this allows kind of all the developers who want to target evm able to build that and kind of enjoy all the same benefits that they're getting from from near we have bridge that connects to helium there's kind of a few other bridges that are in progress that coming out um there's a lot of kind of nft things that are growing like this like i'm not sure even i know all the projects that are building on here anymore in that space and there's also like a huge set of d5 as well that coming out and like i'm pretty excited as like it actually starts to kind of boost the economy of the of near through through a lot of these defy tools um so i think that that's kind of the basics things that probably half a year but and kind of this covers a lot of this a lot of this chart already and then over time i'm i'll be excited about these protocols that i mentioned i mean i don't think like the few i know that i've been worked on but i would love to see kind of all of the ones i mentioned to actually be in progress in a year or so that makes sense that makes sense for our newcomers to the hack i know you you put a list up of some projects that you'd like to be seen worked on um for the specific new to ethereum or maybe new to near hackers do you think those are accomplishable i mean were there actionable ones that you could announce today that might be more efficient for the newcomers so i think you can get to an mvp in a hackathon uh it's not going to be like the whole thing you're not going to be probably launching it right away but you can get something interesting that you know if you willing to continue and stick with it you can build a company and fundraise and do all the kind of actual like growing it into a real protocol over time i can i mean each one of these is like a full you know full project pretty much off the level of you know some some of the projects that i hear right so i think that's what's incredible is you could really drill down on any one of these and spend a lifetime doing it i don't think some of our hackers understand the the sort of magnitude of the ecosystem that we're involved in it's it's interesting to see everyone from across the world focusing on the same ideas at the same time i think progress is inherent with that um well that's that's why i was drawing this graph because if you look at it like this is d5 and sure it's cool like these things but like there's a lot of other stuff going on here and and it's all interrelated too like d5 is powering a lot of the other components so uh you kind of need to have both to kind of really really uh come together what do you think is not getting enough tension attention right now i know we've sort of talked about the parts that are and what's most interesting but what do you think are the stones that are unturned i mean i think the more the like the least thing is where you really need to hit kind of the people side of things like concept resolution is where i know i think cara's been working on that but like uh clara clarus but like an argon a little bit but in general that's kind of a like it's a very messy problem right it's like two entities are not the green and stuff and so people are kind of naturally avoiding it especially like when you can write you know thousand lines and build something that's like really valuable so i think that's where like the space of things that are not really being looked at is space of where you really need to kind of start interacting with people and communities and really figure out how to like solve some of these harder problems right on well i want to thank you again for taking the time to walk us through all that today this has been uh incredibly insightful um next up we were we have fast tackle here in the chat um a presentation on nfts using ipfs um i'll let him let them give the introduction that i i cannot um more than welcome to start your presentation when you're ready great great meeting you luke thanks uh thanks a lot do you mind if i um share screen go for it go for it um it's telling me here you cannot start screen share while the other participant is sharing oh here we go there we go [Music] great um yeah so thanks uh thanks luke uh great meeting you um so uh uh yeah today so we launched a protocol on wednesday uh called uh k-spec so this presentations come together pretty quickly uh uh sort of hacked it together overnight um but uh uh before before we jump in i'll just give a very quick background uh on myself and the uh collective that i'm contributing to um so uh for the pe since uh march uh well from the very beginning i've been contributing to this collective called canon which is a group of senior uh museum curators and conservators who are operating pseudonymously so they'll sort of work at uh at the top art institutions in the world uh and then a few of us are also um uh you know technologists and and with background in um uh crypto teachings uh basically and sort of react engineers and solidity engineers myself personally i'm not an engineer but i've spent a lot of time uh sort of developing uh software products um uh and sort of you know semi-proficient in you know a node uh but uh also a very avid nft collector since about december so very briefly i uh topped the charts in uh super rare um until you know the real whale started the actual real whales started moving in around january when it really started taking off but you know the the protocol that we've developed really came out of the sort of the issues that i was seeing in my own collecting so when you when i started collecting i found myself developing a very close uh and fun relationships with a whole bunch of uh nft artists um and we were running up into a lot of uh constraints and uh you know in satisfaction with the way that these uh nfts are are structured so um casepac is uh first of all it's open source it's permissionless it's completely uh on chain and what it does is it gives artists unconstrained uh freedom to create so we'll go into some of the constraints the most common constraints that they then they end up encountering uh and then for collectors so for people like myself um uh also you know these things i made the mistake very early on of peaking under the hood and uh there's some real serious issues there in terms of um how long these things will actually last and also uh provenance is very brittle as it will which will which we'll get into and then for nfts uh i mean uh the protocol gives them adaptability and update abilities so normally nfts as many of you might be aware they're immutable both at the token level and also at the contract level uh and so the protocol gives you know the artwork that these artists are creating um updatability and adaptability so that the protocol actually works with any nft so it's super important to me because you know i you know spent either an irresponsible amount of eth on on nfts uh so this protocol works with any nft even if they've already been minted and there's no need to stake or burn or otherwise encumber your nft it's it's non-invasive um so you know as i said we launched on wednesday and i thought you know when we were putting this together i had an inkling that this might be big and i'm getting more and more conviction that um that actually this is a game changer um uh for for nfts um so you know diving into like you know what what the actual problem was that we were that we were looking to solve um you know a lot of you might be familiar with this but i'll just you know go through it just to make sure that everybody's awareness and how these things work uh you know at the low level uh so typically a an nft uh you know is a smart contract and you know there's thousands of these that have been deployed and each one of them uh so say that the structure of an erc721 which is uh the most common standard it's effectively you can think of it as like a a table with rows and each row is a token and tokens have a your token uri property that then returns a single link or you can also pass like bytes or the token uri can respond with a with a package of bytes but effectively it's just like a static response a text string response that is returned by the contract and then it also tracks uh you know an address right that that controls the ownership of each of each token um so that's at the contract level and practically the way that platforms implement uh the uh the contracts is uh you know when if you're an artist and you want to create um nnft you um uh you know to put it put a file best practice obviously save it on on ipfs uh sometimes you know or uh you know or you can return bytes directly so you know because obvious obviously that's unchained um but you know for practical purposes uh the platforms restrict uh what you can upload uh this is wearable so it's 100 megabytes super rare uh you know we're restricted to 50 megabytes and crucially it's you know generally just one file that you can um uh then you can upload so basically an nft at the moment if you're trying to create an nft and you're trying to create art you have to squeeze everything into a single 50 to 100 megabyte file so when you're trying to do that you know that that really chokes creativity and one thing that for me because i'm not from an art background uh right at the very first nft that i collected it was the very first piece of art that i collected that was in december 2020 and um what took me a bit a while to a bit of time to realize and then obviously then you're working very closely with these museum conservatives um is that you know digital art has been around for you know decades right uh and uh artists have not been facing you know they don't face constraints when they're creating so for them it's really torturous to you know have these wonderful creations and then you know having to try to like jam it into a single megabyte file so that ends up meaning that for instance like this anima uh music video uh normally the artist is working in pro res uh you know uh or or 4k and those files are you know this this file is actually four gigabytes and so you know how are you going to squeeze that into 50 megabytes well you're facing the choice of that either really degrading the the art uh you know the degrading the uh the resolution or clipping the or clipping the uh uh you know the length or both uh which is just uh which is just awful right uh so you know you can serve the file offline but then it's not connected to the nft so that's probably the most common limitation uh that i encountered in my own collect and collecting and also that i hear artists i'm most frustrated by um but then actually you know in the real world art is is actually you know often more complex than just a single file so for instance this is a an arc by an art piece by an artist called rachel rose which is actually a multi-part installation uh so you know how do you how do you represent something that's like got multiple parts uh in an nft uh that's that's very challenging uh and then you know with um an area that's that's particular of interest uh to uh to me uh given um you know i i really love these um uh uh you know like 3d avatars um uh is uh you know these it's basically the the three 3d at the moment is in a very nascent stage so the ecosystem is evolving very rapidly and the formats change and you know as as an artist uh it's very risky right to commit to any particular format because you know right now sort of glbs gltf's uh you know are the formats uh but even those have like all sorts of variations to change over time uh so if you have to commit to a file up front and then you can't update it um you're you're not gonna stick it into the nft so you know some of the solutions that you're seeing are off-chain like amiibos for instance uh you know this is just coming off their own uh their own server um so um you know there are some hacks around it but you can see here this is you know to me at least when i see this is awful this is sir tim berners-lee nft so sometimes you know solutions that people come to is like try to jam everything into the description field uh of an nft but even this you know you can't change uh subsequently so our um the solution that we came that we came to i by the way this is a a problem that's very well understood um and uh the um you know there are some you know solutions that a lot of people that a lot of the solutions that we've seen are you know sort of hacks right like this one where you try to jam everything into description the other the other one is like trying to attack the problem at the smart contract level uh but the problem is that then you know obviously everything that's been created before you know you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to uh uh take advantage of that um so say my nfts you know do not benefit from somebody launching a new smart contract uh but also these smart contracts they're difficult to untangle difficult to understand and if you've got like three four competing alternatives and you're an artist and you know it takes me it took me two hours right to disentangle uh you know how how the smart contract for example temporously uh how that contract worked um and then you know if you're on super rare if you uh uh you know use another contract uh then you're migrating away from that platform so yeah so this it's it can you get pretty messy pretty quickly to start trying to solve this at the at the smart contract level um so for us the you know the solution came from two uh insights uh one of them is philosophical and one of them is um is technical so from a philosophical perspective the insight is that the nft is not actually the artwork so all the nft is a it is is it's a certificate of ownership that gets passed back and forth um and there's no point trying to jam uh your artwork right into a into unless your artwork's like just simple just like a gif or an image or a single you know low resolution video uh you know then it might work um but if it's anything more complex than that and uh you know as i said like the vast majority of the art outside of nsts this is generally much more complex um uh you know then you're just gonna end up massacring your art and trying to squeeze into that so um you know just treat it treat it as a certificate and then develop the art in a fully expressive parallel state and that is where the artist has complete freedom uh to decide what to do to decide and to describe and to and to secure what the art what the art is and have that parallel stage being uh inextricably tied to the nft uh so that's all very well said and very you know that's all very well and but uh you know how do you actually pull that off um so that's where the technical insight came in where uh all nfts so all nft contracts erc 721s uh erc1155s they have a function called self transfer uh a sort of self trans sorry safe transfer from and uh the parameters for that function are a from address a to address and a token id so those are the three ones that normally get used and then there's a fourth parameter in there called the data parameter and sorry i should have screenshot it here but um i did put it in here but uh that fourth parameter is the key to unlocking this parallel state because in that fourth parameter that data parameter you can pass it any arbitrary uh you know uh uh string oh sorry that has been bytes but but you can pass it any arbitrated data um and that's what we use to construct this uh parallel this parallel state so we pass a carefully constructed data package uh where we then describe on chain uh what the artwork is so what you're looking at here is uh you know an actual live example uh of an artwork by an art artist called uh yena sutila so we created the token and then in the parallel stage we i mean we created a data package which i'll show you shortly because it actually relies very heavily on ipfs uh we've had pass a data package where we described the the artwork and it includes a 1.8 gigabyte prores version of the artwork which doesn't fit into the super um nft uh and then we had the we defined a valid case pick transaction as a transaction where jenna where yana sends the nf teacher herself uh and so that records the dotted package on chain uh and uh then you know she sent us the uh uh you know the nft uh then imagine right like in six months time jenna comes up with like a cool idea about uh adding like a 360 version video so like a vr version of the of the video uh what we would do is we would send the uh token back to yena and obviously you know they're non-custodial ways of doing this but at the moment we're just manually doing it right where we send the nft back to yena uh and then she burns you know uh an updated data package so that will again this is all on chain uh and uh that will add the additional assets to the um uh to the nft uh she does self transfer to record that and then she sends it back uh back to us so you know if this were for instance like a 3d avatar and uh you know some new platform had emerged uh or filed uh formats that moved on uh then as an artist you know you're not too stressed about that because you can always um uh you know update the update the parallel state and it's also much more expressive you can express uh whatever you want in that in that state uh so i'll go through a a quick demo uh we've got a quick as i said we launched up wednesday and we've got a quick demo application so um anima uh and marigold they actually created this uh music video so this is the first full resolution full length uh nft of a certain nft of a music video uh that uh we used k spec for uh and what i'll uh link to now is our demo application which is uh we've called iddqd um and um uh you know you can pass it any uh any nft smart so any uh 721 or 1155 smart contract and a token id and it's going to read directly off chain whether it finds any valid case spec data package so in this case it found one and you can see here that uh uh you know we've defined the case back as having three components this just described what kind of case pick it is and this is a a header um uh where and then you know the body is where we actually store the metadata and the and the actual data so there's one one area that i'll just quickly uh take you to which is the uh credits because this this in and of itself is a collector uh you know i personally find this uh super excited so what you're seeing here uh this is adama's uh address and this is marigold's address so immediately here we can see that they're uh uh both uh signing this and actually in the header we'll go into the detail in the header you can actually see a hash confirmation a signature confirmation from marigold who's the co-author so here you already have a system for you know multiple people attesting to the providence of this and if you go to um if you follow that transaction actually here in our application if you type uh the path parameter uh id at the end uh it will actually take you to who made this um uh who made the sanity and again all this is on chain uh and here let me inspect uh the second result which is marigold uh and we'll go all the way to her records i mean there's metadata on her identity which i will go into but you can explore i'll link this um i'll link this in the chat if you want to uh if you guys want to explore that um everything that's in there uh but uh just very quickly i'll show you uh again this is all on chain so um here in the in the storage what we have is uh data replication so we've got fallbacks uh so we've got a centralized url uh which will uh you know facilitate fast sharing uh but also uh you know these uh decentralized uh alternatives uh as i said like um ipf it relies heavily on ipfs are we for use as well but you know anything bigger than a gigabyte uh really it's not practical to use uh to use star wave so just click here just to quickly show uh what that looks like so this is marigold um you know reading her um uh reading her uh uh you know id so you know the beauty of this as a collector is i don't have to rely on you know say sotheby's or or even super like i i i trust them right to verify this but i can now uh verify for this for myself on a you know on chain uh but uh and even more importantly machines right can i can pull this information you know without having to send an email right to sotheby's and going like hey you know how did you verify that this thing uh you know is actually um uh is actually made by the person who made it who says they made it and also it allows people to use platforms like say like zora or openc to create these things and have like an inbuilt uh provenance change so basically there's no reason there for there to be fake nfts now basically which is a one of the big problems and um uh you know these permissionless um environments um uh uh actually so i think i've i've covered the storage component right but yeah as i said like you can go through um uh you know and inspect this i mean um you know there's there's a lot packed in there uh let me see if there's anything quickly interesting oh one thing that's interesting here is that you know we've defined like a distribution um element so you know that pulls things from storage as required so again like if there's some new application that emerges uh that requires a particular format for the nft to be ingested you can just define a new uh element here you know that serves that particular applications with you know could be like decentralized or spatial or something like that um and uh yeah so every um every nft you know that has like you can define like an arbitrary number of records and you can also define an arbitrary number of components to the to the artwork um so yeah i can leave some you know i'll leave it there but you know if there are questions as to you know this actual structure we cannot uh we can cover that um i think i um no here it is uh okay so um uh what as i said we launched on wednesday so what sucks for us is to uh at the moment we're implementing these manually uh in you know in collaboration with uh platforms and um you know selected platforms of selected artists but we want to put this in everybody's hands so first step is developing a docs um we then need to create a you know graphical user interface to sort of broaden the number of people that can actually use this um we need to build applications so for example like you know what this enables is like cross-platform staff aggregators and sort of attribution as well which is a big problem right now where you know if you're a mentor and you have a collaborator the mentor is going to get the the uh the stats for the sale um which has a big impact on on artists earning capabilities so those are the things building applications um and uh yeah we've got a fantastic uh you know team of engineers working with us uh but uh uh yeah we're looking for help as well to help uh build out this uh protocol because uh yeah we're gonna need a lot of hands we're already seeing a ton of demand and we've been warned uh you know by some platforms that uh you know to get ready to scale up because we're gonna uh we're seeing a lot of demand from the uh artists and the collector's side um so uh yeah i'll pause there and uh yeah luke thanks uh thanks a lot for the opportunity of course i um we're happy to have you we're excited for the launch and you know sort of following up on that i know you mentioned there's been a positive reception so far but um how have things been going i mean you just launched um you know i i guess for some of the hackers here who are interested uh what could you use specific help with or potentially what could they could they use this tech for in their projects uh going forward for the next three weeks yeah um so we're we're trying to work that out uh uh work that out ourselves i mean i think where we're going to start um i think any application right that sort of uh helps uh someone create this uh this data package like imagine an artist right that you know doesn't know how to handle json doesn't have like hash deep or whatever installed another command line uh uh an application that would um uh you know construct this validate the schema uh for it uh that would be uh that would be that would be you know something super super interesting would and that artist would find because what we're seeing right now right is uh we've got uh a ton of artists who are dming us with like this the stuff that they haven't been able to create because you know they were facing the limitations that they did in nfts and they're saying can we uh can we how do i create a case pack and uh you know the best i can tell them is like okay we're going to get you docs like soon pretty soon uh so anything that can help them uh uh create this thing for the for themselves i could basically give you like a list of 10 people uh who would be ready tomorrow to start uh to start implementing it that's excellent yeah there's been so so much uh expansion in the nft space specifically over the past year i think everyone like the the question on everyone's tongue is sort of like what will be next um you know where i guess do you expect things to be maybe next year in a perfect world yeah so um uh well in a in a perfect world uh everybody all artists uh we can even handle anonymous identities as well we felt like a attestation uh system that that we can use with this so i think all artists have uh you know verified their identity on chain um and uh and then you know our um you know for for anything more complex than a video or a gif then uh you know creating these um this structure for those nfts on chain um and then you know then that just opens up like um you know a whole ton of possibilities i mean you could use it i mean you could use this for journals for instance i'd love to see this uh being implemented for um uh academic journals uh right um and uh you know vr ar uh yeah just i would you know okay let me put it this way i would love to see um the complexity of the art just explode uh and explode and and to be surprised to like in a year from now going like holy crap like how you know we thought that uh we thought that this you know we thought that 3d avatars were cool and we thought that in a year's time you know everybody would be like you have like their 3d avatars in an nft and which we're working on by the way but you know being there in 12 months ago like yeah we did that but this other thing that we just never saw coming that would be that would be pretty cool yeah i i there's just a myriad of possibilities um a sort of super nuanced question for you here um if you could explain for for us in in the call right now how the parallel state works how the parallel state works uh yeah yeah so um by parallel state we basically mean know it's a state for the for the artwork right so at the moment uh here so at the moment here it um uh so this is a a token right so token26090 on super rare so that's a real that's a real token and that this all exists right now and the state of the art work at that at this point includes a 50 megabyte file which is a low res file used for serving on the internet and it includes a uh prores uh you know almost two gigabyte uh two gigabyte file so that's you can think of it as like you know how ethereum's state machine right so at any particular point in time it's like a snapshot of what of of what what the data is so that's what we mean by parallel states at this point this is the state of the artwork um then if you want to modify that uh because so uh caseback has like a like permission built at the lowest level uh so that for instance like i can't just like modify this myself so the way we uh enforce that is by uh defining a violent a valid case pick is one where the artist has to send the artwork to herself um so you know so say if k21 said this to themselves it just would be ignored by the protocol but because here she sent it to herself we know that both k21 which is our you know collection uh and uh the artist consented to this updating of the of the artwork so here this was the state before and this is the state now in the the new state includes an additional uh file so i don't know if that answers the um no that makes sense i i i appreciate the definition being pretty synonymous with the the syntax chosen um as as far as next steps for you guys i know you've sort of mentioned what your plans post roll out are um maybe delving back into that a little bit first for case back um you've got the the applications you're you're hoping to build and if you could just i think go a little bit further into that for people who are still with us i'd be pretty interested to see what you're what you're working on yeah sure so um i mean i could definitely you can always take you by step where we're where we're going so uh uh i think first we're going to start with an application that allows people to create uh their caseback ids um because those data packages are very standardized uh that's a that's a good place to start and also you know it also helps artists prepare right for when they have a product because you require a caseback id to create a valid case deck so an application so you know we've got a product designer right and so again we launched this on wednesday so we haven't really exactly defined how that uh looks like but you know our product designer is uh is fantastic and you know we'll come up with a great ux right for creating that um that uh ui then um i think the next step would be creating a ui that tackles like 90 you know the 90 use case which is uh you know that artists uh run into this like 50 megabyte hundred megabyte limit and what they actually want to do is like they want people to experience you know a three gigabyte a three gigabyte file on an lcd screen uh you know whether it's at a gallery or or um or in the collector's home uh and uh uh yeah so there we're talking about actually constructing you know a a graphical interface for constructing um a standardized case back so i always i think there's always going to be like a like room for someone like canon but doesn't have to be just us but someone like cannon creating like these more bespoke ones like we did one for instance for a website you know that the artwork is actually like an entire self-contained website right so that takes a bit more thought and it's gonna be those gonna be a bit harder to handle like on in a standardized way but ninety percent of the artwork is at the moment anyway right uh ninety percent of artists will be able to use like this uh graphical interface and get their their artwork done and it also might serve as like a reference implementation for any platform that wants to just build that uh you know sort of build that in into their own uh uh you know applications um and uh you know we also are quite interested in uh and this idea of like matching collectors and uh and uh artists um and then sort of like developing a non-custodial way because at the moment you know as i mentioned the permissioning system requires you to send the token to the artist we're not particularly i'm not particularly concerned about uh you know the security of that because most of the time right the likelihood that like a legit artemis artist is gonna like run away with the own their own token right a little bit disastrous for them um if and uh but still you know obviously for completeness would be it'd be good to have like a non-custodial solution but more than that it's the just it to be able to do it asynchronously i think is important uh uh and that's why i think you know if you've got that capability for the non-custodial work you know someone could deposit the you know the token and then have that performed at some point and then uh you know uh that would be that would be super useful and then as i mentioned like um these applications that uh you know read uh sales so sales sales statistics in particular and this is something we've that artists have actually uh shared with us right that um it's very difficult right now because each platform has their own uh way of tracking sale sales statistics even though everything's on chain or should be unchained um but also things like say in this anima uh video this is a collaboration between anima who's the music artist and the and marigold who she's the visual artist or the 3d animator um and anima minted the work on super rare and he received the credit for whatever was like uh 21 ether or something like that uh and marigold had did not like on the platform she did not there's no way for you know for super rare at the moment right to make that attribution uh you know because the credit uh is provided like in the description this is not machine readable uh but uh with case back it's completely machine readable because it's you know very well structured and uh and defined and so you know you and it's uh across platforms so you'll be able to um so yeah so that's that's one application we're very interested in uh because it directly helps artists to have somewhere where they can show you know the track record of the sales and everything which is super critical to um you know what they can expect to get for subsequent works i love it that's a i can immediately see the value for for the creators going forward and especially in this sort of decentralized economy that's going to be incredibly important i want to thank you for for presenting today and showing us everything that is uh that you've been working on i'm really excited for your team and really you know i guess we can also we're proud of the developments being made on your side so thank you thank you again for all of your time today appreciate it thank you very much luke thanks uh thanks everyone of course our next presentation um let me share my screen real quick our next presentation is going to be recorded um we have stefano of longhash ventures coming in um we'll be sharing a video and audio for him and kicking that off right now [Music] hi everyone this is stefan robery from longhash ventures uh very excited to be with you today at hackfs uh a big thank you to stefan and the whole team at protocol labs for inviting us to share with you all of the participants in hackfest about the longhash x accelerator and of course applying to our program which is taking off in a few months time so uh maybe to start off uh a little bit about uh longhash x so we are asia's leading web3 accelerator uh we're part of longhash ventures which is a uh crypto investment fund and accelerator uh based in singapore and for longhash x so we have graduated six cohorts in the last three and a half years we have over 40 alumni projects and we have helped these projects raise over 100 million dollars in funding and some of our notable alumni from the program include zapper instadap balancer and akala now in addition to eighty thousand dollars in seat funding uh if you join the accelerator program your growth is going to be uh you know boosted by the network so we have over a thousand investors in our network and of course quite a number of um notable and high profile mentors and and also by by education through our modules so we have six web three focus modules that include product strategy and design tokenomics governance technical mentorship community building and marketing and of course uh fundraising now uh some of the investors that connected that connected with our products after uh our most recent demo day which is back in april uh include uh you know some of the names you see here so both uh crypto native investors like fembocher uh you know iosg or gomi cryptos and then some other uh you know non-crypto but of course notable investors such as sequoyah now the program is segmented into two tracks so we have a defy track and a file coin track now i think uh today you know most of the interest would be around uh the file point frontier accelerator track uh this one we run in partnership with protocol labs and what this means for you is that of course you get a lot of technical mentorship uh you know as you're building uh on uh file coin and you get access to uh you know to mentor sessions uh workshops and fireside chats with um some of the members of the protocol labs team uh yeah so i talked a little bit earlier about our module so as you can see it's very crypto native um and so typically through the accelerator program it's uh it's 12 weeks during which we touch on each of one of these modules with you uh this includes going through workshops uh fireside chats and then of course one one-on-one sessions uh with mentors and also with the low hash team now uh you do receive uh you know mentorship both from the team and from a top crypto native uh mentors and investors so you know on a regular basis you'll have interactions with me as a program lead as well as with pranav who's our venture builder uh but then also you get access to uh you know to our network uh of course from our friends at protocol labs like colin like zx and then also members in our investor network like tekken from polychain and bobby from cms holdings now we just wanted to also illustrate a little bit on on how we work with you uh so so to do this we wanted to share an example of the work we did with balancer which was a um a project that you know i'm sure many of you have heard of and went through uh one of our most recent recent cohorts uh so with balancer uh some of the things we did included uh you know shaping the decentralized governance model and we did that by hosting a roundtable uh with founders of ave synthetics and defines capital who share their experience and ideas on decentralization we also wrote a governance proposal on staking of one of their protocol one of their pool tokens sorry as a precursor to uh you know sort of wider adoption of decentralized governance we also help them to develop case studies on why lps should provide liquidity into their pools and lastly we also uh post programming got a grant from them to help develop their community um in asia pacific so this is just an example of uh of the different ways that we actually work uh with us a project through the exterior program okay so uh we're currently uh recruiting for our next uh cohort uh so applications are open and uh we'll have a qr code with a link to the description uh just in a minute but just share a little bit about the timeline so applications are open until uh next monday uh which is in about three days uh from now um and after the application is closed on the ninth of august there'll be two rounds of interviews and selection then by the 10th of september projects will be selected and we'll make the announcement directly to you via email and then the accelerator program begins in months from that so in the 11th of october it runs for 12 weeks uh and then at the end of it we'll have demo day that is scheduled for the 18th of january when you get a chance to pitch your project to uh you know thousands of investors uh and uh after the demo day uh you know we still worked with you and we'd bet with the investors to make uh one-on-one introductions now um you may also be wondering you know how do we how do we evaluate projects that are selected into the accelerator program so uh you know as a base criteria we of course look to make sure that you have a web 3 native or crypto native business model and that you're actually tapping into networks of public permissions blockchains and then we have both a top-down and bottom-up approach to uh you know to do the detailed selection so from a top-down you know we um we look to see you know where do you fit uh on the web free ecosystem and are you plugging in some of the gaps that we currently see in in the web3 landscape uh and or are you tapping into some of these upcoming trends that we're also seeing and then from a bottom up perspective we look at a number of things so one is we look at your business model so how are you planning to capture value um you know if you already have your tokenomics formulated or you have a rough idea you know we also look at this you know is there a fair allocation to the community what's the inflation mechanism etc uh of course we look at the team you know what's the team's background um what is your domain and crypto expertise uh your technical ability and of course your history of executing and and building uh startups um and then last you also look at you know what's your starting position so um what kind of traction do you have have you done any fundraising and and who has been funding you uh do you have a community and how active is it you have partnerships who are your competitors and how are you differentiating from them so you know hopefully this gives you a little bit of the idea on um you know how we evaluate projects that get selected into the program so uh thank you again for your time uh you know very happy to have been uh you know asked to share a little bit about the long hashtags program now very importantly um we would love to encourage everybody to apply uh so if you scan this qr code with your phones this will lead you directly to our application form and uh as we as i said earlier uh applications close in a few days on the 9th of august and we'll start to evaluate immediately after that and so for those of you that apply we'll be reaching out to you pretty soon thank you so much and have a great day really exciting presentation from longhash uh i want to take this moment to remind people to continue the conversation in discord we have a vibrant community there with both the industry leaders that we've invited for every one of our competitions as well as a lot of hackers if you are new to hacking with east global our discord is a one-stop shop for networking with you know like-minded peers learning about projects that you could become part of you know i.e long ash ventures as well as you know finding people to build your great ideas what we do here is you know build the community one developer at the time one developer at a time and and we we stand by that so our uh our resources like the youtube channel where we record all of the videos and the stuff that you'll see here today can be viewed after the competition ends whether or not you know you want to continue on your project or not you know all of that information will be stored there for future reference um and i i think that you know it's we're no stranger to you know providing opportunities and the discord is a great place to to meet communicate and and grow our next our next talk i'll share my screen with blake from outlier ventures uh is going to be a recorded talk as well and i think we are ready to get that underway shortly hello hacker fest my name is blake lezynski and i'm the program manager of the fallcoin basecamp program at outlier ventures i'm very honored and humbled to be presenting in front of you today and let me tell you why protocol labs teamed up with outlier ventures to bring you a dedicated version of our core webfree startup acceleration program basecamp dedicated to startups and projects that leverage ipfs falcoid lib p2p or any other part of protocol lab stack in their tank and it's quite important because as basecamp we helped 70 companies raised over 140 million dollars in seed capital and we've reached a combined total valuation of our portfolio at the level of 1 billion dollars at the peak of the bull market run i believe it was closer to 3 billion because we're really not afraid of token investments so what do you get if you apply to base camp and why should you consider it as a way to 10x your startup you get 50 000 upfront investment from us as well as a chance for a follow-on investment at 250k you'll get help with all aspects of your business that i'm going to get into later as well as access to our network of leading web-free mentors as well as investors so you can apply directly on our website or you can book an office hours call with our team to discuss why we think falcoid basecamp is the logical next step in the development of your project all hackaths teams submission will be considered a priority so let me tell you more about base cap it's a fully remote three months program that allowed us to condense eight years of organizational learning at outly ventures everything from legal setup jurisdiction token design distribution governance tech hiring community and marketing anything you can imagine to make a web free startup widely successful this particular program the falcon basecamp focuses on three key areas for falcon technology financialization of the open data economy anything regarding data commodification defy apps define privacy layer as well as using storage contracts and compute contracts to create a new class of financial instruments the second theme is very close to our core thesis the metaverse os and it's all about nft experience and metaverse persistence it goes from large energy assets like virtual worlds and 3d printing models to making the metaverse persistent and interoperable for example by helping track nft data across virtual worlds last but not least is the cloud 2.0 the centralized storage compute theme that includes all of the use cases that are typically associated with fall coin retrieval market storage market client and minor matching to cases like distributed ai as a service so we provide this customized entrepreneurship support to web free startups and you might have heard about some of our successful alumni uh such as dia data or boson protocol i believe each of them is around 500 million market cap right now depending on the market prices so how do we do it well it's all about what we call the three piece it's about process essentially goal setting helping you track progress and move through key elements of your flywheel activities that bring the most value to your business uh and helping you reach operational excellence it's about people the people we have in the company that are leading world class experts in all of the areas of business that i mentioned before and give you one-on-one focused attention and finally our mentors we have an amazing network at outlier ventures but you also get access to the network of protocol labs as well as successful funders that took their projects to fruition um and know the challenges of falcoid and protocol labs stack and finally it's about partners it's about exchanges we partner up with startup communities we work with uh other startups and alumni of outlying ventures but most importantly investors i believe at apply adventures fundraising is our key strength we have you pitching to investors early on and we hope to have you fully funded by the end of the program we have some heavy hitters interested in the falcon basecamp specifically from secure capital to union square ventures van bushi capital okx or wabi ventures so do not wait apply today because it's only three days left till the application deadline uh you can do it by going on the link you have on the slide or scanning the qr code the process is on the rolling basis so again you get a bit of an advantage if you apply early the whole process is done fully remotely essentially you're speaking to us and clarify on your market and product and then we'll loop in an ov domain expert to focus on specific aspects of your business during the due diligence process um feel free to book office hours with us or reach out to me on twitter at blakebeyond on on linkedin at blakelaszenski if you have any questions and without further delay i invite you to apply and happy hacking excellent thank you blake thank you to the entire team and outlier i want to welcome our final presentation uh michelle lee michelle is a people-centered software maker currently she leads the developer onboarding group at protocol labs and she's got an extensive history behind that and i will you know give her a chance to introduce herself um she was a code for america fellow with the city of philadelphia and then a co-founder and ceo of texas a platform that helps cities connect with their residents through text and email workflows previously she invented google forms which i know we all use designed online trust and safety tools for ebay and studied human computer interaction at stanford quite an interesting background and she'll be with us in just a second uh michelle i want to thank you again for joining us adding to the intrigue of what we have today for the summit hi luke thank you so much for having me of course [Music] all right well i'm very delighted to come here and tell you about all the ways that i want to give you all money um so in a moment i will be sharing my screen and talking through some of our grants programs um at the file coin and ipfs projects so here we go all right so welcome everyone thanks for hanging in there through such a long long and exciting day and uh thank you very much to our organizers for putting together such uh a jam-packed schedule um so i am calling from philadelphia which is on the east coast of the u.s it's a subtropical climate it's hot and humid it's 90 degrees fahrenheit today um trust me i'm going somewhere with this i spent a lot of time mountain biking and we joke that our local trail system is the jungle and everything's alive in the jungle and and that's what building in web 3 feels like right now there's just so much creative and unstoppable activity um a lot of different intertwined projects and movements really hard to untangle them and you can see things like hey ferns are taking advantage of the shade of the of the bigger trees for their ideal climate and you've got vines growing up these branches and taking over the trail in the background it's getting narrower um and so this is a really exciting and inspiring place to be building um but we also don't want to take these conditions for granted so plants need moisture nutrients shade need a lot of things to grow not just as individual plants but an interconnected and mutually beneficial system and so that's why we call our community and growth group the ecosystem working group at the final point in ipfs projects and our mission is to enable developers and entrepreneurs like yourselves to execute on your dreams through advocacy technical support grants collaborations as you iterate towards success and get ready to hit escape velocity whatever that means for you whether that is um you know hey that was a great learning project now i'm gonna put it on pause and try something else um or hey my open source project is sustainable because i found these ways to um have a really engaged and um and extensive volunteer network um or you reach profitability or you go after accelerator programs and adventure investments so really any model where um we're bringing in people uh just getting started building in web3 you know realizing the software or the technology projects of your dreams um and then uh using um you know using the the collective community support to to help you get to the next level so today i want to specifically talk about some of the grants programs as an overview we have three tracks of grants next step microgrants we have open grants and we have targeted grants so i'll talk about the micro grants first the next step microgrants are really straightforward program um it is offering five thousand dollars to take the next step on your project so um in the application which i'll i'll walk through shortly um all we're asking is did you start something like is is there evidence on github that you started building in this ecosystem and do you have a credible plan to get to the next step an open source network so um that's all uh filecoin ipfs or lib pdp should be used in the project stack but it can also be indirectly through frameworks like textile or pinata pinning services or really anything that builds on top of those it's a very lightweight application with a weekly review i will share these urls again later um but i just want to walk through the process so you can see on the left side we have um some accepted grant applications uh this is all in the github repos uh for you to check out the history um to apply you create a new issue there is a template with six questions some of those questions asks you ask you for links to things uh you know in your github repo or in the community forums but basically it's a page and a half of information um and we review these every single week so trying to get back to you quickly we have um we've had grantees who needed these funds to pay an infrastructure a hosting bill we've had grantees who've used these funds to hire great designers and and uh and ux writers so that their app would be more more user friendly and and um and more popular we've had folks use this to fund their own time so so that they could continue investing in the project so it's really uh there's no restriction on the funds other than it has to go directly towards your project um and that's the micro grants program um let's see after this uh we come to open grants so open grants uh range typically from five thousand to fifty thousand dollars um for novel work to apply ipfs file coin or live pdp to new domains um or to bring significant new usage so really any project that um that has promise of uh you know really extending these networks or these ecosystems um or uh maybe integrate these technologies into your existing project so it's still very open-ended there are a few dedicated tracks that are listed in the repository um we specifically have some collaborative grants with the hedera token service with chain link oracles more are coming in the next two weeks so a lot of collaborations across web 3 that we're interested in seeing people you know use combine multiple projects into into a single application um there are also some rfps for for specific um areas of interest but we're also i believe more than three quarters of open of grants are awarded to open open you know new id completely new ideas so um we want to hear everything that you have uh to share um i would call it a middleweight application process uh it's a little more than an issue but it's a lot a lot simpler than really most application processes and we review these every month so just to walk through um some of the process uh you you know create your own project idea that meaningfully advances the stack um you can also check out the rfps for lists of ideas or areas of interest then you submit a pr using the proposal templates i believe it's about two pages of information to fill out really just looking for you know a a strong proposal that includes evidence that you've thought through the problem that uh you know that you have the experience to deliver on it um and that you're breaking it down into realistic milestones so um that's the open grants uh you know shape or structure um we review these every month um and so the longest you'll have to wait for responses is one month um and what you know it used to be quarterly but we wanted to move towards an even faster review cycle to um to give people the chance to you know hear back and make their plans and get on with building your project so um just a few of the past grantees i i wish um i wish i had time to share all of them with you because there are some really cool projects um this was one of my favorite micro grants this year um to a project called ajam and it's a web application that hosts asynchronous jam sessions for musicians so you can record little snippets of you know you playing one track um it publishes to ipfs and then you can also invite other users to contribute their tracks to you know to your hotnew record really really cool use of ipfs there um another one uh much lower in the stack this is for a project called go graph split so if you're storing directly on file coin and you're not using one of the many really awesome and easy to use storage helpers if you're building directly on a core file quite implementation you need to split your data set into pieces smaller than either 32 or 64 gigs and this is just a really simple and clean utility that can split your split your data into the right size data set so you know really nice little building block um uh it's not necessarily trying to solve every problem in the world but it solves one particular problem really neatly so we really like to see tools like this that can be used by a lot of different players um and then here's a very different project this is a whole initiative it's not just software but it's also the program and system and working with a local uh regional governments to make this happen um it's a geo web project and it's a set of protocols and systems for tying digital property rights to physical land um in parts of the world where um there can be a lot of uh you know unclear land records so um there are also grids we also give grants to community builders so sometimes it's not just software that you ship or an application that you publish um but we've had grantees propose hosting meetups or you know someone who's fantastic at building communities requests a bit of funding to to host a you know a smaller large event we've also awarded a grant recently to a team that was building uh an incubator program for storage providers so you know coaching and developing small-scale storage providers so that we could further decentralize the system and and help even uh even more new players get on board so um as you can see wide wide range of grantees um i know that there are two you know two of these are open grants and so that means the teams have probably had more experience working together but we also really really like to award micro grants so don't hesitate to apply um you're all you need is just some evidence that you've started building in this realm so um it does not have to be a fully featured app before you apply in fact the whole point is to help you get there um so really want to encourage anyone who is interested in these ideas to to consider applying for a grant um here are a few ways to reach us uh i think that um having raised venture capital before i think that the um the the climate of those conversations can be a little adversarial and we aim to be the opposite of that we really are here to support and encourage you um with resources to to help build new things on top of this web 3 stack so one way to reach us is to create a draft pr with your submission or file an issue and label it work in progress um you're not penalized at all for these early submissions and we're happy to you know work with you to help shape it into something that's a strong application um you can also email us grants.filecoin.org or join in the fileplan project slack the grantstash questions channel happy to answer any questions that you have there so um that's about it from us i you know uh in addition to the grants team i also lead our developer advocacy group so we have a lot of ways that we want to you know get to know what you're building support you encourage you um and really build the future of web3 together so thanks very much um luke is there a is there a chat with questions that i can answer or um i i think the the best foot forward here would be to continue the conversation in discord i know people are going to be having questions from all the presentations today and i i want to thank you for your willingness to do that um if that's all right with you i think they could also reach out to you given the contact information that you had just posted um we are expecting probably i'm going to say close to 100 100 plus projects coming out of this event i know i can speak for a lot of the hackers and that they will be quite interested in finding grants and other funding options following the event so i want to i want to thank you for for your presentation and thank you for your time explaining that it's a great way to close out an event a lot of enthusiasm uh for the builders fantastic well thanks for having me here it's great to be here uh for the builders which is one of two words non-dilutive um thank you very much all right we're going to be taking things offline from here unless you have any further comments um more than welcome to um i think that's it for me i will hop into the discord and along with my friends at five point in ipfs we'll try to answer any questions that people have all right thank you so much and i want to thank everyone for joining us today for the ipfs and file filecoin builders day summit uh thank you to all the speakers and thank you to the
