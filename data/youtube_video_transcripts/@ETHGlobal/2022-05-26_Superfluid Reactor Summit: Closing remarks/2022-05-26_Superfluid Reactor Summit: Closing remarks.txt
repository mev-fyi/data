[Applause] [Music] i want to bring on fran again to share some closing remarks and then we'll wish all of you happy hacking because submissions are due in two days so uh friend thank you uh thank you kartik so i'm just gonna very quickly share my screen can you see my screen so we'll just uh wait for you to be on the workspace so we can just there you go perfect yeah all right well uh thanks everyone for joining us today i think it's uh it's been actually really interesting at least for me there were a lot of things that i learned from our early guests from our later gas the panels everything was really interesting i just want to bring you back to superfluid right so what we're doing at superfluid is building a protocol we're building uh streaming money with no capital lock-ups and programmability on chain right and as you might have uh understood by some of the panel some of the content what the reason we're building this is really for builders right we saw a technical opportunity to build a very interesting tool for builders to innovate the way money works and effectively what we saw was an opportunity to to change the way money works right to change the way people experience money what happened there sorry for that so as i said we saw an opportunity to change the way money works right and that's uh what we were building we wanted to change the way money works from lump sums to money streaming right and we can make money more more fluid and you know we can bring this new tool to webfree and then we realized that this meant we could network cash flows right by simply changing the balance of function of an erc20 we could enable businesses to receive and send money in real time and see this real-time balance move without any actions on their behalf right this was something that really opened our eyes to the opportunities that uh bringing cash flows on chain meant right because suddenly we could effectively uh create subscriptions salaries all these beautiful things that effectively created web 2 right web 2 was created by ads arguably but also by sas right sas is the most successful monetization strategy in web 2. has created massive companies right so when we understood that superfluid could enable this in webfree we realized that this was really an opportunity to push with fee forward by enabling subscriptions by enabling cash flows to come unchained we could effectively create more sustainable uh web-free economies and this is something that we also acted in the last panel where we talked about how yields really currently depend on speculation and the demand for speculation and leverage but with cash flows on chain we can change that we can make webfree its own economy where people are paying for services right not just for leverage and that's something we're very passionate at super fluid about and it's the reason we organized the summit so that we could get people who are building these tools to talk about them and their importance of them so i just want to share with you an imaginary a future which is actually not too far so i expect we'll start seeing web free businesses that get paid through subscriptions managed by diagonal those same businesses in real time will pay their salaries through coin shift to their teams and their teams will be invoicing them through a request network and those those people working for these companies will then reinvest their money through a ricochet exchange or another streaming investment platform and use part of the that salary to maybe borrow money on huma finance right and all of this is being built this is literally happening in our ecosystem under under our eyes right now and i'm extremely excited to enable these kinds of use cases to happen in web free because these things have never happened before right like forking uni swap for the tenth time is not as exciting as building uncollateralized numbing so come and join us come and create this vision for on-chain networked cash flows with us we're really excited to you know involve more people build more of an ecosystem and increase the amount of money that we can flow through our system and you know our ecosystem is growing we already have a lot of apps but there's never enough right there's so many different use cases so many different verticals to explore and we're really excited to you know enable you to come and change the way the world experiences money with us so for all of the developers in the room join our superfluid reactor as i said if you're building out hack money at the end of it if you really like what you did and you think that you want to turn this into a business apply if you get in we will help you fundraise we'll help you launch and we will not take anything it's completely free right so this is the best uh the best accelerator out there because we're not going to charge it now bringing us back to superfluid of course it's streaming money on chain cash flows but it's also building a web-free native economy with on-chain subscriptions enabling credits and connecting cash flows to effective effectively make the web free economy leapfrog traditional finance and uh hopefully usher in a new um internet native economy that doesn't rely on the intermediaries that have uh you know uh grapple that we've grappled with so far so that's it for me i think uh that is uh an amazing wrap up of what today was all about thank you again for uh being an amazing partner and uh being the support system for a lot of the hackers that are trying to understand and basically change how money works so uh once again thanks to all the speakers thanks to all of you listening and and watching this and you spent the last few hours with us uh asking questions sharing comments and talking about everything um web3 and money and uh to mike and fran really appreciate having the opportunity to work with you here on this summit thanks man thanks for having us you got it
