good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global and welcome to hackmoney 2021. now all of you are watching this from eve global.tv and for those of you who haven't been on this website before this is the interface we use for all of our our summits and our talks and our events and uh i just wanted to quickly give everybody an overview of how everything works you're watching this thing live this is not recorded anything you type in the chat will be able to read and reply to we're going to host a lot of content today whether these are there's talks interviews workshops and as these panels and talks happen if you have any questions for our speakers you can simply log in and ask your questions on the chat and we will release them to our speakers directly uh when we're taking breaks you get to enjoy our radio and for everybody who signs in you'll be getting co-app nfts uh to prove that you actually participated at this event so uh be sure to take a minute uh log into your profile and sign in and say hi to all of us so with that said this event is organized by eth global and for those of you who don't know uh if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we primarily do this by running hackathons and summits so this event is no different we're going to be running a summit uh today and and for a few more weeks we have three summits planned for the entirety of this month uh we're going to have a summit on uh mevs and and we're hosting another summit on the union swap grants program and the progress that they've made since the beginning of the program and today is our kickoff summit where we have a few talks from some amazing speakers and we're covering everything from what is happening with defy on the regulatory side to some interesting macroeconomics uh on on crypto and security best practices for auditing smart contracts and everything in between now let's talk about the hackathon some of you are joining us the second time for hack money what's super interesting about all this is that hack money uh the very first version of it started in 2020 just about 12 months ago we brought together 350 people to work on some interesting projects and we didn't know what would happen this was right at the beginning of us trying things out online and we were absolutely blown away by the amazing projects that came out of it uh these are some of just our are amazing and interesting highlights i'm sure you've heard of a lot of these companies already they've come up from from our hackathons to now successful protocols in this space to some incredible products and that's just the tip of the iceberg these are just nine out of the 120 projects that came out of the event and we can't wait to see what hack money 2021 would look like so this really brings us to our second version of it from 350 people to almost 3x the size this event absolutely blew us away this is by far our biggest event ever we have over 975 state packers they'll be participating over the next three weeks we have over 500 summit attendees for just this week's summit and the hackers that are going to be participating are coming in from 75 different countries and 18 different time zones this is just a map of where everybody's joining us uh from from the rest of the world and it just blows my mind that we have so much diversity in so many different perspectives and so many interesting people that are going to be participating at hackmoney 2021 on top of that we also have over 170 mentors these are some of our our partners these are some of our our on staff mentors who are going to be there to help you with anything technical design or protocol related questions whether it's a solidity bug or you want to get advice on how to use a certain protocol we have so many incredible people waiting to just help you on our discord and we have support from 50 amazing companies in in our space these are protocols projects products foundations incredible names and partners from the d5 ecosystem that are just waiting to to talk to everybody here and to top it all off we now have over three hundred thousand dollars in prices uh that will be given uh as part of uh different sponsors and integrations and um various sort of tasks as we have planned for the rest of the hackathon so the most common question we've been getting from everybody who's joining us for the first time is what can i actually build um is this three weeks enough is it do i need to have really specific skill sets what am i just learning something right now and kind of the answer is that there is so much more that you can do and in that time and kind of from looking at all the the excitement that everybody's put in and talked about in their applications there are so many applications for lending dexes trading options derivatives nfts that you can play play with whether that's building some new primitives or integrating existing primitives or using similar protocols to now piece together and make more composable products you can do so much more in yield hacking and optimizations whether that's making something more stable or more fixed to to optimizing the yields by doing arbitrages there's so much more in just that sector alone and it's not just that you have to do everything in in protocol development or only stick to writing code in solidity you can do so much more on analytics you can design dashboards to retrieve data or better represent information that's that's already on there on chain uh to design products that let others use these protocols without having a too intricate of a knowledge of how something works under the hood and that's just on the most obvious side there's also opportunities to do integrations on xero knowledge side whether that's adding privacy or or uh adding some sort of composability whether that's integrations with rollup or other layer two protocols um and there's a lot more you can also do on building developer tools so others can also do this thing in the future a lot more easily so these are just some of the high level categories there's so much more we have to talk on all this as a topic and we'll be there over the next week just to really showcase some interesting themes and ideas and and brainstorm with you on what else is possible so the way this is set up is that i want to take the next 15 minutes and talk about the logistics for the hackathon and then we have some information about our prizes and then immediately after that we'll be able to jump right into our summit talks and and then we get to go get back to hacking so what i want to cover is how team formation works this is the most common question we've gotten people are looking for teams people looking to join others to either work on an idea or bring on others to build the idea that they already have in mind over the next few weeks what happens if you are still learning how you can get help all the prizes you can win what's the structure and how all the talks and workshops work how the judging is going to work for the hackathon and then also how the summit is structured including today so the most important piece here is that all communication for this event is going to be on our discord what this means is we're minimizing as many opportunities to do something live with the exception of judging this particular video right now and all our closing ceremonies in in july everything will be done asynchronously and uh that means to manage all the time zones to manage all the communications to manage all the help that we need to uh to either provide or or or check in on all that happens via discord for everybody who is staked as a hacker you will see an option to click on discord and join um and connect your discord to our our our channel and that will give you access to all the private channels for hack money and this means that anybody who is under the hack money header on on your discord is part of the event and you get to talk to everybody there whether those are our sponsors or protocols or mentors or see information about the event or judging just everything that you want to know is going to be on discord so please make sure you have access to it please make sure that you can see the hackmoney2021 header and uh and if you can't ping anybody on uh on discord on the global team or email us and we'll be able to help address that on top of all of that there are a lot of talks and workshops that are happening some already have happened and started over the past few days there's more over the next few weeks or sending calendar invite for all of those events to everybody who is hacking and this means that it will show up on your calendar you get to quickly click on a link and join those conversations and ask anywhere from questions to participate um and and if you forget where the calendar invites or you haven't received it yet you can always go on to the event website and just see the full schedule immediately and join anything uh from there we want this to be as asynchronous as possible which means that if something doesn't work because of your time zone that is completely okay because we are going to be recording all of that and making it available for you to consume immediately after and all that is available on d5.ethglobal.com this has all of our event schedule this is all the list of uh the partners that we're working with and all the prizes you can win and how to get in touch with anybody on the global team so now the question is how does the hackathon work we talked about just communication uh we want to highlight some of the rules for this event um before i get to the rules uh in more detail um the the gist of it is that the hackathon begins right now which means as of me saying this sentence you can start working on your projects and you can have up to five members uh on your team and you get the next 2.5 weeks to submit um your your hacks uh that 2.5 weeks ends up being july 5th so you have almost three weeks just to work on anything get feedback get any help or show us what you've been iterating on and really refine from an idea to a important prototype in the course of almost three weeks in the rules and criteria for being a eligible participant to win a prize or or just be considered a hack are fairly straightforward anything that you are going to be submitting must be done over the course of this hackathon which means that all work must start today and spend the next two and a half weeks uh all the submissions that you are going to do uh to work on must be related to defy on specifically ethereum and if you have not rsvp'd on our dashboard uh you will not be eligible to win any prizes so it it's really important that if you are working with a team that all of your team members are listed on your team officially through our dashboard and if that hasn't happened yet or they're not showing up please ping anybody on the global team so we can really help you address that because we really do have to make sure that everybody is a qualified candidate and everybody is following the exact same rules and then the broader question is well what if i'm new to all of this there's a lot of you who already came in with ideas there's a lot of you who only wanted to work some work on defy in this space but did not specifically know what they want to hack on um and i just want to tell everybody that that is completely okay you don't need to have something immediately figured out and you don't have to have an idea already ahead of time there's a few hundred of you in that situation and uh and this is uh this is expected this is normal and uh we have a lot of things that we do to help um address that uh the the first and the the biggest comment i wanna make is you get to head over to find a teen channel on your discord and you can see everybody else who is looking for teammates or looking to join a team with a certain skill set so if you're looking for a designer or a smart contract developer or a front-end developer you get to ask and and talk about what you're working on or what would you like to work on or what you are able to do and find others who um can work with you for that project um on top of that you get to also use the the slides we've made for finding team members there's uh those are constantly being updated by everybody who's in that position so you can see he was still not looking we're still looking for a team who was it was already found a team um and and on top of all that uh aside from just being on the finite team channel you can also introduce yourself in the hack money chat where you have uh a thousand plus people uh just waiting to say hi to you and and give you help on anywhere from refining an idea to understanding if something is possible as you think about all of this and really engage with people from 70 plus countries that are participating at this event and lastly even if you don't have a an idea or you know that you can do certain things uh for a team uh we have a couple more opportunities to join a team formation call um later today and also on monday so uh time zones aside uh if if you were able to make any of these calls work today or on monday uh you get to come on live on a zoom call and talk to others who are also looking for team members um and really kind of find them and talk to them in real time that specific call is not going to be recorded so if you are able to make it uh you would have to be there live but uh if because it's later on in the day if you are not able to make it due to time zones the one on monday will be early so we can accommodate for all the other time zones and and all that aside i also want to highlight that you don't necessarily need to have a team it is it's absolutely beneficial if more than one person is doing all the the work and sharing uh the load but it is completely okay to just pick something for yourself to learn and work on for the next few weeks um but you don't have to necessarily find somebody to to be eligible to participate in this event is completely okay to hack solo lastly on talks and workshops whether it's the summit talks or some of the workshops on how to use specific protocols uh there's a whole spectrum of content for all levels of experience in this space whether you're a beginner or an expert we have so many opportunities over the next few weeks to to share what's happening in this ecosystem not just d5 but also broadly in ethereum and you can attend any of those from our event schedule you should also already have calendar invites for those of you who are watching this thing that are not hackers uh these are still all public talks so you can immediately watch them on youtube because everything is recorded and if you're wondering how to think more about the events or get more questions on whether the talks or or how team formation works or what are some rules and criteria for this event you can head over to the info center that all of you can find on your dashboard to get all those details in all those explanations a lot more details and just one more time all of that is public and available on defined ethglobal.com so you can see each of the talks on the schedule you can click you can sign up for the summits and be notified over email as we as we announce and we're ready or we near the next event and any talk that's already happened can be found on the website with a link to the recorded youtube now one of the most important pieces of all of this experience are the check-ins so there's all about a thousand of you that are participating at the hackathon which means that there's a lot of stuff that's happening asynchronously and we have this checking system to really get stay on top of what's happening for this entire event for just the global team and for our mentors to really help you get unblocked so check-ins happen once a week so you'll have two to three check-ins for the course of this event and the what happens in a checking is fairly straightforward we just ask you what you're working on and what did you do uh last week or since the last check-in and you can write a couple sentences there and press submit that's that's all there is to it you also get to define some of the prices that you're applying for and are going to be planning to to integrate and that also helps us understand that uh if if you need any help with integrating any of these things we can connect you with the right people to make sure that you don't have any issues or technical integration problems uh this really kind of helps us get you the help you need to just stay unblocked you'll be able to follow all of that on the discord channels and you'll be assigned uh you'll be kind of prompted to kind of just post your check in there as well and we'll find we'll kind of share all those details over the next few days and as you respond to check-ins and submit a project the stake you've put forward uh gets returned um and all this happens again asynchronous dba dashboard so you don't have to look up for any email or specific message as soon as you log in onto your dashboard on monday you'll be able to see the next steps and after those check-ins and after a lot of uh talks and workshops and two and a half weeks of hacking um we kind of get to the submission space and what i want to talk about here is just a quick format of how judging works uh we really want this thing to be a synchronous so uh to submit your project all you have to do is record a maximum four minute video of of your demo this covers who you are as a team what you've been uh doing over the past few weeks what inspired you to work on this project and a demo of how it works and everything you were able to do and as you do that you get to submit that on your dashboard again and we get to then set up for judging slots uh that happened the week uh the the days after judging is due so uh the quick reminders here are do not do this thing last minute because uh to get to get looks like we're having some technical difficulties so um do not do this thing last minute to get a there we go uh don't list the last minute because uh to get a four minute working video keeping all transaction confirmations in mind uh does take long so it's important that you kind of get to record everything and plan for how the whole demo works and you're able to anywhere from cutout and efficient or waiting periods from the video or really make sure that you have a way to still snapshot what you did in case something breaks as you're presenting it to the judges for the judging live and all these details again are going to be made available on the info center and also on your dashboard and we have example videos that you can look at we have example submissions that you can see through on what details you need to provide and you can also watch some of the live previous judging sessions from previous events on this and really see how that whole process goes um if you'd like and then as part of all this i want to make sure that this is a still an event even though it's online and we have a code of conduct that we want everybody to abide by and the rules and the code of conduct are are over at each global dot co slash rules uh this talks about some of the best practices for how to behave in in our online community and also what it means to participate at the hackathon uh the gist of it is that uh in terms of rules i've already highlighted them before which are you have to work on something that's as part of how this uh as part of the window the hackathon is is open and officially running and anything that you build over the course of this event the ip of that solely belongs to you so you own the full rights to do whatever you would like for your project um and the gist of the code of conduct is that please be respectful to everybody on on the discord and on the calls and harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any capacity um if if you believe somebody is behaving uh not like they should please reach out to anybody on the youth global team and we'll be there too to help and lastly just as i wrap up the logistical pieces i want to quickly just take a deep breath and tell everybody to really pace themselves uh you have a lot of time to understand what's happening you have a whole week just to learn and catch up and explore what's possible we do not want this thing to be exhausting for you this is not a competition we really want you to have fun there's so many people that are participating for the first time that are just getting started in understanding what's what's out there in the world of web 3 and we really want this thing to be about learning and experimentation so it is totally okay if at the end of this event you don't get to finish what you wanted to do or you only get to 50 instead of 100 we want you to learn and that's our primary goal we want to make sure that you can continue to build in the space and we have the whole set up to ensure that you get the help you need whether that's during the event or even after the event so please don't hesitate to ask any questions as simple or as complex as they may be on our discord because we have so many dedicated people just waiting to help you and help answer all of your questions so don't be afraid to to be in a place where you think you may not have a full project this is very much about experimentation and we just want you to uh learn something more than you did as of today all right so that was a lot of logistical information all crammed into the last 20 minutes so i'll take a quick five second pause and and uh and we'll walk through any questions that come in um from our chat and we'll get to address that in a few minutes as we move over to the rest of the content but until that kind of comes what in want to do is quickly highlight the schedule for today and what the next two to three hours look like so uh immediately up next is uh prizes and some of our our our videos from uh some of the sponsors that we've asked to uh to introduce themselves and then we're going to jump in just exactly an hour and we're going to jump into our very first summit talk and that's going to be an interview with the sec commissioner esther purse and marvin amore from uniswap then we have a an amazing chat with dimitri kofinas and hassu on just the macro economics of crypto then we have our d5 security panel where we'll have mariana conte sam emiliano and martine talk about some of the best practices in writing safe smart contracts especially as you deal with people's money um and then we have some just quick 60-second closing remarks on just wrapping up the day and then uh later today we have uh our first live team for racing's uh formation session after the event kicks off and and that's that's pretty much it so a few more hours from now we'll be on track and with that let's get ready to talk about some of our amazing partners so i want to quickly thank all the amazing people that have kind of signed on to help over the next month for for attendees from our mentor side and everybody in in this space so there's a lot of amazing companies and protocols out there that are going to be present at this event so i want to first thank god all of our presenting sponsors and that's unique venus swap grants program compounds grand program uh circle one inch ave and steak dial so um they've been an immensely helpful partner to work with over this event and we also have badger ethereum foundation superfluid and balancer next up we have our our pillar partners i want to thank protocol labs kyber network vega nexus mutual wearable the graph liquidity uma 88 miles per hour enzyme harmony paraswap element finance pillar polygon and flashbots all these protocols are here to help you integrate what you can do in in the d5 ecosystem and there's so many incredible primitives that you'll get to explore soon on our provider partners we have oasis foundation acropolis economy consensus umbrella network gas station network streamer upshot starkware connects covalent idle finance pods finance instadap bitco chain link teller ens and lastly are our supporting partners matcha kwan stan lemniscap hermes coinspect and saddle this is an incredible lineup of so many amazing companies and if you're thinking about anything in the categories i've named about whether that's lending options insurance protocol indexes aggregators nfts like layer twos you have a full spectrum of things that you can do and you can ask any of these companies on what is and is impossible or how you can remove some work from your plate and just use these protocols just to get started and focus on the core value prop of of your experience for the hackathon project so those were some of our amazing partners we also asked a few of them to record a few words uh talking about who they are what they're excited about some of the culture at their at their team and and why they're excited to to be part of this event for the next month so i wanna kind of have them share a few words here and as we get ready for that we'll be able to jump into talking with the details for our prizes so without further ado let's let's roll uh some of our partner videos hello hack money my name is jesse weiss and i'm a marketing director here at circle we're so excited to be participating in this hackathon with all of you as the company behind the fast fast-growing stablecoin usdc and a suite of apis that help businesses around the world build financial apps across payments treasury and digital commerce use cases we truly believe the future of finance is being built on chain by developers like you our goal in participating in this event is to help you get a better understanding of the role both usdc and our apis can play in the development of dfi and blockchain based finance apps we're here to provide access to the resources and tools you need to implement usdc into your project on thursday our vp of product joao reginato will be hosting a workshop to help you learn exactly how you as a developer can leverage both usdc and our apis to build on and off ramps into d5 he was the product lead on both usdc and our apis and he'll give you a quick overview of the products as well as a couple of customer stories from companies like ftx dapper labs and dharma will be available on discord for the entirety of the hackathon so feel please feel free to reach out and connect with us there you can also connect with us at circle.com we're so excited to be here and we can't wait to see what all of you build hey everyone my name is nick mardich and i work on business development for compound labs for anyone who's not familiar the compound protocol is a set of globally accessible open source interest rate markets allowing anyone to earn an interest rate on their idle assets and use them as collateral to borrow other assets since september of 2018 compound has processed over 140 billion dollars of supply volume 40 billion of borrowing volume and has cemented itself as a core piece of financial infrastructure for the decentralized economy compound is a developer first protocol that opens up a new universe of innovative financial applications we've seen folks use compound for a variety of use cases like savings accounts prize pools leveraged tokens portfolio trackers and fixed income products just to name a few our team is now working on a new project called gateway that will expand compounds interest rate markets beyond just the ethereum ecosystem gateway allows users to upload assets from connected peer blockchains which are used as collateral to borrow any asset supported by the network the ultimate vision for gateway is to prepare for a multi-chain world where assets interact seamlessly across multiple layer 1 blockchains the success of both compound v2 and gateway will depend on talented developers who build new integrations upgrade the protocol's code base and actively participate in governance there's also never been a better time to contribute to the compound ecosystem and get rewarded for doing so hackathons grant programs and the governance system all present great opportunities to get funding for your work we're excited you're here and can't wait to see what you'll build next this is sonic from the other protocols uh genesis team so we are the team that uh built the other protocol and and gave the protocol to the community ownership and uh so excited to be here in in this hackathon participating uh and being able to judge different projects here and uh to give some context what up is so ava is a our protocol is a decentralized interest rate market where you can come and deposit different kinds of uh cryptographic assets and see those assets grow in terms of uh interest rate uh in in form of balance and your deposit also uh acts as a collateral in the protocol meaning that once you deposit into the protocol you can actually borrow other assets from the protocol or you can delegate that borrowing power uh to someone else and uh as a protocol the the market consists of different kinds of assets that you can use and and the protocol is deployed on the main ethereum network and also uh test nets uh such as the common test net and also in the matic uh network so if you're building on automatic or or the mainnet or covan desnet uh this is very interesting uh proposition for you to test the cross chain operability especially if you have some sort of a hack in mind that uh could empower both of these communities and uh anyone who is participating uh should also mind that we as a team are here to support you and the other grounds style as well and there's various prices that you can actually uh win uh during this hackathon and and so once the prices are for example for the best uh pack you will get seven thousand uh usdc and for the second price you get three thousand and third two thousand there's various things you can actually build on top of the protocol itself and we'll go more into detail in that or you can ask any questions uh in in the uh discord happy to be here and thank you everyone hey my name is karil and i am the lead blockchain engineer in one inch network as you can know one inch was built in 2019 on ethereum new york hackathon and the initial protocol of the one inch network was a dex aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources and offering users better rates than any individual exchange this protocol incorporates the pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over 50 plus liquidity sources on ethereum 20 plus liquidity sources on binance smart chain and 7 plus liquidity sources on polygon in less than two years the one inch dex aggregator surprised 50 billion in overall volume another product of one inch ecosystem is one inch liquidity protocol this is a next generation automated market maker that protects users against front railing attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers and our latest release is one inch limit order protocol this protocol offers an unmatched level of flexibility which shows in two major features dynamic prices and conditional execution use our protocols with pleasure thanks hey guys i'm adrienne butler i'm one of the contributors of stake downs take down is this entire exchange uh with a very nice ux in ui and we from buying selling assets uh into some very advanced uh trading uh other uh routing mechanism to investing in some very advanced strategies euro uh u.s dollars bitcoin ethereum all the different ones into some uh different networks like binance ethereum polygon and then staking inside native uh native protocols like solana polygon uh cosmos and all the different ones and then earning extra rewards on the top of it to some governance uh things or you can earn the different proceeds from the dow and also some nft mechanism where we are the the only one providing advanced mechanism on top of nfts for you to boost your api or have access to some vip strategies or vip products that we have been building you can also like build for arbitrage liquidations uh different strategies so if you're looking to participate inside this architecture you can click on the top of the binary instructor and it will bring you to where we are offering those different prices so 405 4500 u.s dollars for the best strategies and also some very exotic ones so example api hunter we've been working on some of them but would like you to join and help us build and ship those different strategies and also like two thousand and five hundred view stores for two links uh so example typescript sdk uh helpers on the top of soyut contracts zaps and some modular strategy framework we also have a partnership with superfluid a thousand newest doors for uh building on top of it and a wheeled car and pool price which is uh four thousand usd so if you're building some very cool stuff that we think is really nice to add inside the state that will be willing to reward you so if you can you can join us on discord uh sponsored sponsors take down uh on the east global channel and be answering questions you can also like tag or hashtag us into the twitter and if you have questions uh for me directly about the hack you can contact me and reach out to me on twit on twitter at being eligible i think that's it uh happy hacking guys see ya [Music] hey everybody chris battlefor here from badger dao just wanted to say we're super excited to be participating with hack money this year and looking forward to seeing what but everyone builds to give you an overview of badger we're a community-owned project that has really a singular focus which is build the products and infrastructure necessary to bring bitcoin to d5 you know today we have a handful of products that enable users to bring their bitcoin to ethereum and other chains and then when it's there put it to work our foundational product is uh sep vaults which is a yield aggregation product for tokenized bitcoin so we run non-custodial uh smart contract based strategies on tokenized bitcoin across other protocols in d5 like sushi swap and curve and uniswap and so forth we also have a badger bridge that enables you to bring bitcoin to ethereum and put it to work with one click and then we also have a few synthetic products like intersperon bitcoin and dig intersperon bitcoin is a basket of yield bearing bitcoin tokens and dig is a synthetic rebasing bitcoin so as it relates to the prizes which we're super excited to announce we have 12 000 total and prizes and 10 000 of that 12 000 dedicated to bitcoin yield strategies that means is for this hackathon the top three yield strategies that are tokenized bitcoin focus on either mainnet or polygon will be rewarded that ten thousand dollars you can get started super quick by using our badger strategy mix and follow the step-by-step tutorial and workshop video to start building on badger right away and then we also have a 2 000 open prize really for anybody that wants to build anything bitcoin dao related governance oriented so couldn't be more excited to see what everyone builds and looking forward to the had fun [Music] hello everyone my name is francesco i'm one of the founders of superfluid and i'm extremely excited to welcome you to hack money this year we really wanted to sponsor this hackathon because hacking money is exactly what we do at superfluid we have rebuilt tokens to what we call the super token standard now super tokens are like tokens on steroids we have amazing functionalities like money stream rewards distribution and batch calls built directly into money and what this means is that you can have native experiences like for example recurring automated payments so let me tell you a bit about money streaming so money streams are these perpetual uh instances of transfers right so basically you open a stream and once you've opened it money will start flowing from your account to the counterparty's account without the need for any intermediate transactions so as a user you simply have one transaction to sign on chain and then hands off you can walk away money will keep flowing forever until you close the stream or until you run out of money now what this means is that we can enable a very good ux for recurring payments and recurring payments are an incredibly important piece of payment infrastructure because if you look at web 2 what we've seen is it's basically made the fortune of a lot of companies now for us it's very important to monetize webfree in a sustainable way and we believe that money streaming will be the way we do this so using money streaming you can do subscription payments you can do salary payments but you can also build real-time finance finance where you use streams this is something we're very excited about and you can find out more on our website now i'll tell you a bit about our bounties so the first and most exciting thing for us is enabling anyone on the internet even if they don't know that much about crypto to accept streaming money for subscriptions so our top prize for this thousand hackathon hundred dollars for the best checkout experience you don't need to know solidity just dazzle them with a great ux now we also have free bounties which are um basically building a savings account where you can stream in and out the savings account can be staked out or ave and as a user you should be able to stream your money into it the second bounty is a streaming exchange in this case imagine you have die you want to stream and buy ether every second third one is for the best use of erc777 callbacks which enable you to stop using token allowances so improving the ux of defy throughout now we also have a price pool of three thousand dollars which will be split with everyone using superfluid so if your idea doesn't fit in please have a look at that now there's two ways you can use superfluid either on the front end where you basically use our javascript sdk to interface directly with the contracts in this case you don't need to know solidity and you can get away with literally one line of javascript to open a flow so this is very very very easy for you and i think it's going to be a great a great first step into web3 if you're more advanced you want to take on the second third or fourth bounty then you will use the super app framework which allows you to create applications which react to streams now what this means is if i open a stream towards your contract you'll be able to execute logic and when i close my stream you'll be able to execute logic again enabling these really complex uh financial applications which have never been built before now if you want to play around with it go to our dashboard it's very easy to use you don't need any specialized knowledge just go to app.superfluid.finance and send your first money stream now i'm extremely excited to uh welcome you all to hackmoney if you do have any questions or if you want to get in contact with us go to discord.superfluid.finance you will find the team you'll be able to ask questions we'll point you towards your resources we'll help you find team if you don't have one we'll help you find team members if you need them and in general it would be great to just have you join the community and create new money with us good luck guys hey guys this is fernando from balancer welcome to hack money it's great to have you here i'm sure many of you know that from hackathons like this come great protocols and projects i'm sure i'm going to see some big things out of this hopefully using balancer so why are we so excited about balancer battle survey1 was all about creating liquidity pools that were like index funds so you could create a pool that has twenty percent wealth thirty percent dying fifty percent mkr and balance of v1 made sure that that distribution of value kept this way now we talked to other teams like ocean power pool and idle finance and so many others we realized that this was a bit too strict to limit it so we create a balancer v2 with some very interesting features that allow for it to be a lot more extensible and for other projects to build on top of it much more smoothly now two main features the first one is that you can have customizable amm logic so it doesn't have to be the index fund style pools can be like curved spools where you have stable points that have better trades for price one and this is already live on coven going to mainnet soon but you have other teams creating um like element finance amms that change over time because it's better for their zero coupon tokens or stablecoin projects that have taxes for people who are selling the stablecoin below the pack and those taxes go to the project's vault for example so that that's a very interesting the second nice feature is the asset managers why would we use the idle tokens in balancer pools and create a lending platform ourselves if there is amazing platforms like ave and others around so the idea was that asset managers allow you to do whatever you want with your token with your pools tokens and it could be lenion ave or urine or doing other stuff but you could also be used for voting which is what powerful is doing so there's so many nice things that you can build in battle city too make sure you ask questions and and come to our discord or to our discord channel and we'll be very happy to assist you on whatever we can really excited to see you guys building onbouncer thanks hello everyone uh this is sandeep from uh polygon network uh i'm really excited uh that that polygon is uh yet again a part of uh global hackathon uh hack money and you know we have been uh always developer focused and uh being a part of uh e global hackathons has been uh one of the best things uh you know in most you know kind of rewarding experiences uh in terms of learning in terms of getting to know the community so really excited for this um about polygon so polygon as uh you know many of you guys would know that polygon is a basically a ethereum scaling aggregator uh it supports uh it is expected to support more multiple uh you know scaling mechanism eventually and we also recently launched polygon sdk which helps you spawn up your own chains um and then you know we have uh we are going to launch uh you know very soon uh more uh into the roll-up domains more more solution the roll-up domains um and especially for hack money like recently you guys must have seen uh exponential growth of d5 on polygon we have i think more than ten uh more than eight billion dollars worth of tvl logged in various applications all the big you know applications in the defy space like ave curve and then you know many many more sushi sushi they are all available on polygon we are offering 8k in bounties and you can uh you know find more details on our notion page all the best to you all and hope hope you guys are able to come up with really fascinating applications which has been the legacy of uh all the eighth global hackathons thank you so much and feel free to reach out to to any of us over discord or anywhere else and we would love to help you out all the best amazing so hope you got to enjoy some of those videos um from from our sponsors they talked about everything that their protocols can do and their platforms are designed for so i'm sure um as i'm seeing some on the chat there's a lot of ideas flowing and there's so many new things that you can experiment with that we haven't really even seen kind of the possibilities for so those were just some of our our messages from the sponsors early on and what we're going to do now is just talk about some of our prizes so you've been waiting for this for quite some time we have a list of every every company that's giving out a prize and what they're doing and we made a a quick compilation of uh them talking about their prizes as well so we will see ave compound one inch unit swap circle staked out badger superfluid balancer vertical lapse mega wearable kyber nexus mutual enzyme harmony 88 miles per hour liquidy uma pillar element and polygon just kind of come on now and and talk about all the prices that they're giving out and how you can qualify hey everybody this is ken on behalf of phoenix off grants program and we're so honored to be sponsoring another fantastic eighth global event this time for act money we've come prepared with six jam-packed bounties with up to twelve thousand dollars in uni four of which are unison specific so two for the most innovative and two for the most impactful hacks built on top of unit swap and we have a social surprise for you in collaboration with flashbots we're offering four thousand dollars for two bounties the first of which is for the best hack building one of the challenges put forward in our hacker guide and the second is for the most creative usage of both flashbots and unit swap so let your imagination run wild check out our hacker guide if you have any questions find us on discord or hit us up on twitter best of luck everybody all right on to the fun stuff let's talk about prizes circle will be donating twelve thousand dollars in usdc to the prize pool and we'll be splitting it between three of the projects that we're judging the first prize is the best overall solution and this is something that we think is going to fundamentally change the world that prize will be seven thousand dollars in usdc the second prize is the best out of the box solution this is a project that honestly blew our mind how the hell did you think of that that prize will be three thousand dollars in usdc and finally last but not least um the most practical solution will be the third prize this was simply a great idea that was well executed and the prize there will be two thousand dollars in usdc good luck to everyone participating and we can't wait to see all the projects hi i'm larry and i'm the lead for the compound grants program if you haven't heard of us the compound grants program is an independent community-led grants program established earlier this year so far we funded dozens of grants and plan to fund dozens more over the coming months we're really excited about hack money and as part of that we have four prizes that we're featuring for this hackathon the first prize is for two and a half thousand dollars and it's for someone who builds the most original use case for supplying assets to compound the second price also two and a half thousand dollars is for the most original borrowing use case on compound the third prize is for someone to build an open source interface on top of compound and there again the prize is two and a half thousand dollars and then for everyone else who's building really cool things on compound we have a prize pool of two and a half thousand dollars if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask we'll be in the hack money discord channel all day long happy hacking so three three top three projects on the uh other protocol side are able to win from the other grand style uh three different kinds of prices so the first main price of the winner of the uh protocol usage will get seven thousand dollars worth of uh usdc and the second one will get three thousand worth of usdc and third two thousand for the usdc and those are there's different examples with uh imran is going from the overground style going to elaborate more and and yeah thank you sonny uh so there are three areas of focus for ave in order for avi to grow to next billion users uh the first is looking for integrations startups are looking to integrate with uh ave as a protocol and building on top of ave the second is really understanding growth and understanding what are some of the tools that users need so things like uh credit delegation dashboard or thinking about bringing real world assets into ave or ave pro and then finally it's bringing more analytics and tooling to to ave and its users so things like being able to uh build out ave transaction explorer is something that we're looking deeply into um and these are the the three areas of focus for us please ping any of the ave team members and we can give you more details on the types of startups we'd like to support thank you so much thank you everyone hey one inch network prepared five tasks for hack money hackathon with the words of 12 000 usd in one inch token the first challenge it's a margin trading on the one inch limit order protocol the second challenge it's a limit order adapter for the one inch liquidity protocol you need to build an adapter for creation limit orders over the one inch liquidity protocol or over any decentralized exchange based on their available liquidity the third task it's a automated market market making strategy for stable coins using their one inch limit order protocol and the fourth task it's a mesh network for one inch limit order protocol you need to build a peer-to-peer network that will validate receive limit orders and distribute them among the network spears and the last track it's open track you can suggest your own solution keep in mind that one inch limit order protocol has conditional execution and arbitrary price discovery we wish you success with your tasks [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everybody chris here from badger dao just wanted to share our prizes for hack money we have 12 000 in prizes total 10 000 of those are dedicated to what we call bitcoin yield strategies and that's building different types of yield farming strategies specifically for tokenized bitcoin on main memorial polygon and we've given a quick start guide on how to start building yield strategies using the badger dow infrastructure and protocol and then we also have an open price for 2000 which is essentially built anything on top of badger you know that could be tied to a btc that could be tied to multi-chain governance that could be tied to some of our products that can interest you in bitcoin or dig but nonetheless gonna be more excited to see what you build hello everyone welcome to hack money come join us and build a future of online payments using superfluid so we are extremely excited about providing everyone online even if they don't know much about crypto with the opportunity to accept streaming money as a way for subscriptions for this reason our top prize for this hackathon is two thousand five hundred dollars for anyone who can build a dazzling checkout now here you don't need to know solidity all you need to do is create extremely good ux so that even merchants who don't know crypto can use it our second prize is to put that money to work so as the merchants receive it they should be able to invest that money into a savings account that gives them a yield like ave or stakedown the third the further bounty is for streaming exchange so imagine you want to stream die and buy ether every second the fourth bounty is for the best use of erc 777 callbacks which are another capability of super tokens which allows you to avoid token approvals but if your idea doesn't fit into these don't worry we also have a prize pool of three thousand dollars which will be equally distributed to everybody who uses superfluid in their hack so come join us at hacc.superfluit.finance you will find all the resources you need great people to help you out new team members and potentially an idea if you don't have one good luck and have fun hey guys this is fernando from battlestar i'm pleased to announce our prizes for this hackathon the first place the winner will get eight thousand dollars in the second place we'll get four thousand dollars so a total of twelve thousand dollars of prices there are some very interesting ideas we are suggesting for people to build on top of course you can come up with your own creative idea and that's something where like we want to be surprised by you guys uh some ideas are for example to use an asset manager to reinvest liquidity from layer one ethereum onto side chains like polygon another one is to create an arbitrage spot that uses price descriptions within battle survey two using internal balances and makes money out of it like arbitraging this so yeah go ahead and hope to see you hacking and creating surprising things for us thank you hey everyone this is mustang i lead developer relations at polygon so we'll be giving out a total of eight thousand worth of prizes uh to hackers who will build on top of polygon uh first is like best

and from various integrations that you can qualify for and uh if you didn't get all of them or you missed out some details uh don't worry all these are available on d5.edclopa.com prices you can see all the details along with the documentation and some workshop videos on how to use them and some sample code for all of all of our our partners so uh if you have any questions on the prizes or how everything works uh you can check all that out on this url a quick note about how pooling works is that instead of having a a particular first second third qualifier for or a winner for any of these integrations anybody who uses the sdk integration in their project and qualifies with an acceptable use of that integration we'll get an equal split for the total prize money so for example if 10 projects use a protocol and are qualifying for the pool price of 4000 then each project will get a tenth of that and we'll split that into individuals so if there are 10 individuals in total then each of them will get 400. so hopefully that clarifies some of this verbally all those are written down in a lot more detail onto this price page so be sure to check that out over the course of the next few weeks and let us know if you have any questions so all that said we are at the end of the logistics of everything that you need to know for the hackathon i want to wish everybody happy hacking as you embark on two and a half weeks of super awesome and hard work on just seeing what's possible with with defy and especially on the protocols in the integration side so with that um i want to thank everybody who stayed for all of our logistics piece as a hacker and for those of you who are joining us for the summit pieces we are ready to start that now so first thing i want to do is just for everybody who's just joining us now um i want to take a quick break and uh oh sorry here we go i want to just take a quick break let's just get everybody a couple minutes to relax um so we'll we'll just uh put on a two minute break and i hope you enjoy the radio in the meantime and we'll resume everything in about two minutes and we'll kick us off with our very first talk of the day all right so i hope you had a quick two minute break but we're just getting ready to start with our summits so for those of you who are joining us right now i want to quickly introduce everybody to hack money we have nearly a thousand attendees attending the hackathon with developers designers artists um and uh and economists uh from all over the world participating over the next three weeks to build interesting things and experiment with what's possible with defy we also have over 500 summit attendees for justice summits and we're doing uh two summits uh two more summits over the course of the next three weeks uh on various topics in the world of defy and ethereum and the participants here for the hackathon are coming in from 75 71 different countries and spanning 18 different time zones so we have a lot of creative creativity in this room and i can't wait to see how and what everybody builds over the next few weeks so i want to give a quick overview of what the next few hours are going to look like we have a few amazing talks up and coming so uh immediately after i finish we have our talk we have an interview with the sec commissioner hester person and uh chief legal counsel of unesco marvin and murray they'll be talking about just all the interesting things that are happening in the landscape of regulations and how that will collapse and intersects with defy then we have a fireside chat with dimitri kavinos and minhasu who will be covering just the macro side of the implications of what's happening in crypto and how that affects uh things like global scale we'll be taking a quick break immediately after that and then we have a d5 security panel we'll be talking about some best practices on just how to write safe contracts and really all the things to keep in mind as you think about either launching your protocols or having others play with anything on ethereum then we have a quick uh closing remarks uh just to sum up the day and for those of you who are planning on entertaining the hackathon if you're still looking for a team we'll be doing a workshop at 6 pm eastern that'll help you find potential teammates if you're looking for some so with that i want to quickly introduce our first and my most exciting talk for the day i want to welcome the sec commissioner hester purse and marvin and murray they'll be talking about all things defy and regulation and um if you have any questions from the audience please type them in the chat and we'll be able to relate those questions back to to marvin who will be moderating and interviewing um and uh i i won't spoil all the content here there's so many things you want to talk about so i'll just let them dig in directly so marvin and commissioner purse welcome thank you thank you cardtech commissioner purse uh you might want to unmute so we're going to be asking you a lot of questions all right i'm ready great well welcome uh we're so excited to have crypto mom herself here uh and so very excited to to have you here no you know as you might have heard it's about a thousand developers at this conference and i'm wondering uh how is this audience different from the audience that an sec commissioner usually speaks in front of well thanks marvin for having me here and it's a delight to get to get a chance to talk to you and to all the developers out there you know typically at the sec we talk to we we talk to a wide range of people but they're typically lawyers not developers uh just just candidly but i my door is always open so i love talking to all kinds of people um so this is a wonderful chance for me to get a chance uh to uh speak with you i have to give you my disclaimer which is that the views that i represent are my own views not necessarily those of the sec or my fellow commissioners got it well hopefully you'll persuade them to come over to your reviews soon enough commissioner purse trying so um tell us you know how have you been think have you been thinking about d5 you know what's the awareness of d5 at the sec um you know what what are your what are your thoughts about its potential benefits uh you know just sort of generally how are you guys thinking about it well again i think this is an area where we are learning a lot you know the growth in defy has been pretty remarkable um in a in a short amount of time regulators tend to take a long time working on things and thinking about things so it's it's a bit difficult to keep abreast of everything that's going on in the defy world that said we are trying to do that we have a a dedicated office at the commission not dedicated just to d5 but dedicated to financial technology and there are people in that office who are quite knowledgeable and who are talking to people in the defy world frequently and uh and we're working with our our fellow regulators across the world to try to get our arms around around e5 personally you know i've i've found it really fun to try to learn about it i'm i am a lawyer by training so it's a bit of a stretch for me but but i i do enjoy hearing people talking about the projects that they're working on and and trying to learn a little bit about it i think it's a wonderful opportunity for um people to try to build a financial system and and i think it's not just related to finance i mean i think finance is probably step one but i think there'll be other things happening in this space that allow people to engage with one another without intermediaries that they've traditionally had to rely on and to build things with people who are you know spread far far and wide across the world and so it's it's a way to bring capital and people together i think that is is pretty um unprecedented in our history and so i'm excited to see what comes from it that said it does it certainly does bring its own regulatory challenges um so often when uh when developers are working on um projects they're looking for real world problems to solve right so i'm wondering you know from where you sit at the sec you know are there any problems you see in the financial ecosystem the traditional what we call tradify that you think may be d5 could solve because it could remove intermediaries do you see any things that you know you might not have the solution but maybe the developers should be thinking about solving some problems that you see well i think from from my perspective when i look at the traditional financial system there are a number of problems that i think consistently pop up one of them that we've we've seen is systemic kind of risks when something goes wrong at one financial institution or or several large financial institutions it can have pretty widespread uh consequences and so that's something that i think is inherently something defy could be addressing because of the decentralized nature another issue that we see is people taking advantage of other people telling them they're going to do one thing and doing another thing again something that i think defy can address because it is something where where it should be transparent where you can see everything that's happening you understand exactly how a transaction will occur and what the terms of the transaction are so that's something that i think is promising so those are a couple areas where i think we see problems all the time but i i also think that something that defy can do because it it does try to bring together people many people into a a system together you you can take advantage of decentralized knowledge in a way that it's much more difficult for the traditional finance financial system to do that so if you think of something like credit ratings um where you're you're trying to understand the risk around around something it's helpful to have a lot of different points of view coming into play there and so i think that's an area where um where certainly d5 can play a role now from a regulatory standpoint i also think having those eyes and ears um of lots of people being applied to a situation can be helpful um we're trying you know we we're limited in our resources and so trying to monitor what's going on everywhere is is difficult but um i think defy can probably be part of that solution now that maybe will look more like self-regulation than regulation but to the extent we can offload some of the work that we that we um do and offload it to people who can can watch over the system themselves that could end up being a good thing another area where defy is often thought about i think as as part of the answer we worry about the ability of the financial system to serve people all across society and i think that's something that defy can do well um but it's not only individuals i think we we need to think about how defy can be valuable for getting capital um to entrepreneurs that's something that i think about a lot in my role as a commissioner um so that's that's another area where you might apply your your development expertise yeah um [Music] oh okay okay great um so uh the some of the things i heard there commissioner were uh dfi can expand financial inclusion could also help uh with uh getting uh financing to entrepreneurs could help with uh monitoring the markets with many eyes on uh the transparent blockchains uh such as you know the ethereum blockchain obviously right there's so many people monitoring transactions on that uh it could also um help reduce systemic risk and one of the main causes of systemic risk in the system are these intermediate intermediaries uh one thing i find interesting is uh your point about self-regulation right do you have any any thoughts you know within the traditional financial world there's lots of different self-regulatory bodies uh and i'm wondering have you given any thought to how self-regulation could happen in the defy ecosystem uh at all yeah i mean most of the self-regulatory bodies in the traditional financial system are actually quasi-governmental regulatory organizations because we actually do play a pretty big role in regulating them and thus and you know regulating the ultimate end that they're trying to regulate so i i think in d5 if we were trying to take advantage of self-regulation i would want to see it be more a pure form of self-regulation where you really are um working as a community to try to monitor what's going on with different projects you know again a lot of this is it's code-based right so so you can um look at the code and know and and understand what's going on and i think that's a very valuable form of of regulation so that's where i see um the strongest case for it i mean i think that one of the worries i have about about what's going on in d5 i think there's a lot of positive but one of the concerns i have is that you know we we portray everything as being very decentralized but there are often is a very centralized element of a lot of what's going on um you know there there are ways for an administrator whether that's one person or a group of people together to make changes and those things need to be very transparent um and so i think it's really important for the community to really take that seriously to to insist that projects are very upfront about how changes can be made and who can make them and what the safeguards are around that um i think there are a lot of you know because there's so much money now tied up in so many of these projects there is going to be a lot of interest from a lot of people whether it's someone associated with the project or someone from outside who's a bad actor or maybe a regulator is going to be looking at that pool and so i think people really need to be building systems that are are able to handle large amounts of money in a way that's safe and in a way that they can prove to be safe to their users so a little honesty i think can be really key in this area and i think that's where self-regulation comes in got it while you were speaking that that reminded me and i wanted to clarify for developers who don't know the sec tends to not be a merit regulator tends not to regulate the merits underlying an investment opportunity and tends to focus more on disclosure making sure the market has a lot of disclosure but that just made me made me realize so some people who are listening might not know very much about the sec we just kind of dove right in talking about defy maybe you can just sort of uh explain where the sec kind of fits within the broader federal government when it comes to uh you know investments in general and securities versus commodities etc that might be useful for a paragraph summary or two paragraphs sure i should have i should have done that at the beginning i don't expect developers to really be familiar with the sec it's it's one of many federal financial regulators and we we regulate broker dealers investment advisors the stock markets options markets and we also regulate public company disclosures and mutual funds exchange traded funds and you you're correct to say that we're we're not uh a merit regulator though sometimes we give way to our worst selves and we start to edge into merit regulation but really what what our main goal is is to get disclosures out there so that investors can make decisions about what they do want to invest in and to make sure that when financial professionals and financial intermediaries are dealing with investors that they're doing so in an honest manner so that's kind of our our mission facilitate capital formation protect investors and you know protect market integrity that's kind of the core of what we do great uh and uh and also the jurisdiction is limited largely to things that are securities right so the question of whether or not cryptocurrency is a security or not cut uh is a big threshold question that determines whether or not a token will be regulated a certain way and i know that you had proposed a safe harbor uh to try to get some clarity uh because it's a new area of technology it's new market structures and a lot of the existing laws are totally crystal clear until you propose something that would be crystal clear do you want to sort of explain the safe harbor in a few sentences and kind of where it is in the process so i can't promise that the safe harbor would be crystal clear either but it's designed to give a little bit more um a little bit more definition around when something needs to be treated as a securities offering and how you could do a token distribution event consistent with the securities laws right now we have a very broad definition of security which is intentional because you want to make sure that if someone is raising capital to build a company that that is encompassed within within our our jurisdiction so we have this kind of open-ended uh definition that captures those kinds of things but that has been quite difficult for a lot of a lot of projects that are trying to do a token release that are trying to get the tokens out there so that people can use them in the network and that the network can take hold with network effects and so what i what i proposed is you have a three-year period where you make disclosures to the people who are buying your tokens you update those disclosures periodically you're telling people what the token economics is you're telling them what your plan for development is and your when you tell them that you better be telling them the truth because you're subject to the anti-fraud rules under the securities laws but at the end of three years if you can show that your token is a utility token essentially or if you can show that your network is decentralized then you can move out of the securities framework and you can go about your merry way without worrying about the securities laws this is something that from talking to people in this space they think it would be useful because we've we've tended to provide most of our guidance in this area through enforcement actions which can be a very unpleasant way to learn the law and i think it would behoove everyone if we set out clear guidelines up front so that people who are really trying to do the right thing had an avenue to do that got it and so your reference to enforcement action reminded me uh i believe it was last week or the week before the sec put out a list of priorities for the year i think they were rule-making priorities and i if i'm not wrong nothing about cryptocurrency was on that list uh how did you interpret that or how should people think about that potentially well yeah i was not too happy about the emission of crypto on the list i think not only would i like to see my safe harbor on that list that's i should clarify i'm one of five commissioners and so i'm not the chairman so i don't set the agenda but i i put the safe harbor out there in the hopes that the chairman would put it on the agenda so that disappoints me and i think there are other areas um related to crypto around custody where we could be providing more clarity for people um now our chair is new and so and does know this space quite well so i expect that we'll see something regarding crypto happening he's been speaking out already um and i think what he'd like to see is he'd like to see the cash markets the crypto cash markets so exchanges he'd like to see those regulated whether that's by the sec or some other regulator but that would require congress to come in and and give that jurisdiction to someone right now the cftc has some limited jurisdiction over over those markets but um but it's it's something that he's spoken out a number of times now already on got it um we have a question from the audience i think is a great question uh the question is is there a department or liaison at the sec to help new companies navigate this burgeoning field are there lots of potential legal land mines and is there anything that an entrepreneur can do to to sort of have a channel with the sec well so i mentioned our office that deals with financial technology and that's the place where i would recommend you start so it's called the fin hub and you can find that on our website and you can contact them and they will meet with you probably now it would be virtually and they do a lot of meetings with developers so that's what i would recommend you do you're always welcome to come talk to me i enjoy talking to people um but the the difficulty and i just i have to warn people about this i think i i always recommend people go and talk to finn hub but you can end up in very protect protracted discussions that can be frustratingly slow and ultimately you really do need to get your own lawyer they'll flag for you some of the things that you need to think about but this is not this is not an easy area of the law and certainly the inter intersection between crypto and securities laws is a difficult one and there are a lot of potential land mines on the way so you really do have to be careful um you know i try to push us to move faster on things but um i've been at the commission for three years now and uh it's it's been you know sort of a slow going um to get stuff to move faster yeah so this is not legal advice i'm a lawyer but not anyone's lawyer uh you know step one try not to do anything shady try to do something that's you know good for the world right already you're in a better place right if you're actually trying to do the right thing even if you don't know what the law is two if you get any traction get your own lawyer right and then think about uh interfacing with with finn hub because those lawyers all know fin hub there are lots of great law firms that work in the space and uh you know i'm i'm at amore on twitter uh and i can you know i'll recommend one right right now right i think the folks at goodwin do a good job the folks that uh there's a set of law firms uh latham that do quite a good job but um feel free to dm me and and uh and i'll send you to one of my one of my friends one of the lawyers i think is good after talking to many many lawyers in the space but i think i think what commissioner said makes perfect sense you need your own lawyer um so the other uh question we have here is um you know this is actually a great question you know when someone launches one of these d5 protocols commissioner it is not just in the u.s it is global right uh and uh you know i i i was an internet lawyer for many years i you know i remember when people said code is law the first time in 1998 you know when larry lester's what came out about it right and uh there's a whole set of thoughts about how the internet would route around domestic laws and and and there would be no domestic law anywhere and they were wrong obviously you know laws is uh resilient and and countries were able to impose their own laws in different ways when it came to the internet now when these protocols are launched um you know globally on day one how should people think about um the law in general right should they should they prioritize the us should they should they um you know should they what what do you should they prioritize their local law how would you think about that if you have any thoughts well i think you have to think about where you're you know where you're based obviously you need to think about the law there and you know the the reach of u.s law is it's we have a long arm and so i do think it's worth people thinking about u.s law unless they make very explicit attempts to exclude u.s persons from being involved in the project it pains me to say that because i know there there are instances where people do that in order to avoid our law but you know i think really if you're being realistic your project is probably going to have some kind of breach into the united states and so um because we do interpret our jurisdiction broadly we may have something to say about it so you know work with your local regulator but you've got to think about eu law u.s law and and law laws otherwise other in other places too that's why you know this is really a fraud area it's a very difficult area to do things um do you have any thoughts on how early people should start thinking about that you know i feel as though you can probably wait until you have some traction before you have to think about it but i don't know if uh if you have any thoughts well i mean i always think it's good to start thinking about these things as as early as you can but you know realistically you're right you know getting legal advice is expensive and so you know you're going to have to figure out when in the process you want to do that but you know i think starting out with what marvin said you know do don't do shady things that's a good that's a good start you can get a lot of free types of guidance um you have to be careful with it of course but i mean there are a lot of things that you can you can look at and read to try to figure out what you need to do but the problem is if you're building something you really do sort of have to understand the framework in which you're building and the regulatory framework is a big piece of that so i'm always you know yeah i can see your point about you you wait till you get some traction but if you get traction you might end up having to adjust what you're doing also so i say earlier the better yeah yeah i think you articulated what i meant to say much better than i did there uh so um you know is there a concern about uh some of the top crypto projects leaving and going abroad or um or are industry falling behind you know other countries i mean one one narrative you sometimes hear in crypto right is that you know finance is the biggest exchange in the world kind of by far right and they didn't quite have to play by the same rules as coinbase coinbase is a great company but smaller is there a concern that if we don't provide clarity or kind of permit folks to to compete on a level playing field that you know the largest companies in the space might be abroad is that kind of is that an important consideration that regulators have in terms of you know american industry versus versus you know talent moving elsewhere i mean it's certainly a concern i have i want the united states to be the place that everyone wants to come to build to build things and to innovate and to raise capital and to to uh to draw from our capital market so i want i want this to be a place that people want to be and want to do things and build things but um you know i have heard from projects that they that they've decided not to do it because there's not enough clarity here i think one of the disadvantages of of being in the united states as a regulator is that we we do move slowly and and that's in a way good because that's why we have you know we have very well established capital markets they're very effective and good capital markets and safe capital markets um and so that's a good thing and and and part of that is because we have a a regulatory system that is stable and doesn't change rapidly so those are all good things but at the same time you need to have be nimble enough so that you can adjust so that you can be a place where someone can come in and say an innovator can come in and say hey i have a new idea i want to try something new how can i do this in a way that's consistent with the law and we and we come back with with with a willingness to work with people to that end and this has been something that we're not great at whether it's crypto or or innovation in traditional finance um we've been you know quite slow and i think that's part of the reason why you see um less competition in the financial services industry than you would otherwise see if you really did have a more nimble regulatory structure so i certainly do worry about that got it well looks like we have two minutes left um uh you know i guess i guess the last question i'll ask um uh without being redundant is is there any way that these developers can help you uh in the commission kind of get more educated about d5 keep up with all this information um you know what what's sort of the most useful and helpful on your end well i think one thing is just come talk to me and tell me about what you're building and what what you're seeing in the space that's always helpful if there are things that you're seeing coming out of the commission that are particularly problematic for you in terms of what you're trying to achieve let me know that as well and if you see bad actors point those out to the sec as well we we have a whistleblower um you can come in as a whistleblower that's on our website because i think if we if we do go after the bad actors the good actors are more likely to dominate the space and then maybe regulators maybe it'll be easier for me to convince my colleagues that there's something really wonderful being built here and then just keep up your good development efforts i don't want you to spend all your time thinking about regulation i want you to build things that are going to change the world for the better well crypto mom you know i asked you if this was like your usual audience you speak to i mean these are your people so uh so so thanks for for speaking to this audience and joining us today uh kartik is is all we have thank you so much it's my pleasure mr purse marvin thank you so much for for that amazing talk and i think it was a really positive and optimistic note especially as a thousand developers get into trying new and crazy things so hopefully uh we get a more safer sandbox way for them to experiment this to the broader world but uh in the meantime we'll play with what's possible on test nets for the course of this event so thanks again and uh really appreciate you taking the time amazing so hope everybody enjoyed that chat now there's a lot of interesting perspectives that were shared and uh we are ready to move on to our next talk so i want to quickly um introduce our our next speakers uh we have dmitry kavinis who is the host of the hidden forces podcast um and he'll be speaking with asu who's a prominent ethereum researcher as they discuss uh and they'll be discussing just ethics restorative versus progressive ideologies in crypto and honestly just a frank conversation about uh what it'll take um to truly make money great again so uh without further ado please welcome dimitri and i'll let them uh take it from here hey guys hey hello guys see the difference between me and hashu as you can tell when i turn my camera on that's fine yeah i would there's no change in the avatar i would keep it at this um so can we start i think so right uh yeah i see just as a yeah we're all set okay great um yeah for those who don't know me i'm a research collaborator at paradigm i'm also the editor of therapeutic research and i host the uncommon core podcast and demetri i'm extremely excited to talk to you today i'm i'm a big fan of your podcast um likewise arso thank you in your episodes you are not afraid to tackle some of the most complex and important topics in the world and i feel like you approach them from a first principles point of view and with a very open mind and that i think is very rare today so um why don't we start by um you telling us a bit about you know what you do at hidden forces and what your mission is um so i'm always bad at these questions but essentially the podcast is a as you know it's a long form conversation type podcast i try and find experts or really brilliant interesting people uh who are doing work in a particular area who can speak to some timely subject and or non-timely depending on whether it's interesting or not and then i do a lot of research before speaking with them and what comes out of these really well researched uh super interesting detailed conversations that really run the gamut um whether it's tim grover who was michael jordan's strength coach from 1989 until the end of his career or central bank people like the chief economist the bis or folks like this and the program is called hidden forces because the idea is that there are in order to understand the world in order to understand the epiphenomena that we encounter in our daily lives you're best suited to get as deep as possible down the vector of whatever it is that's driving that system or that behavior and that's what hidden forces is it's a deeply epistemic approach and it takes an empirical and epistemic approach and a critical thinking approach to understanding the world which i think is desperately needed today yeah spot on um and we today we want to talk a bit about sort of also some of the hidden forces of the crypto space um timely enough um sort of the ethics and values and also some of the excesses that we see in markets today um and i want to start by talking about a phenomenon that i think everyone is aware of at some level but maybe not under the same name some call it postmodernism others you know the casino vacation of markets and in a recent podcast with grant williams you called it financial nihilism so dimitri what is financial analysis and you know why should we care about it so i define financial nihilism or market nihilism as an investment philosophy that treats the objects of speculation as though they were intrinsically worthless and it not only conflates price with value but it synonymizes the two and i think this explains partly why narrative so-called narrative investing to the extent that this is even like a term that anyone uses has become so popular because i think that people i mean people have always made money by investing in things that ahead of before everyone else thinks to invest in them right but we've in my experience we've never really had a philosophy that's so nihilistic and cynical which says that it's all value is effectively what you are able to uh bootstrap bootstrapping a narrative getting people to believe in something even if they believe in many instances things like scam like a scam coin or something or uh or some of these other things the the idea is that everyone's saying well let's all just close our eyes tap our heels three times and the thing will go up that to me is very new and it's very nihilistic and i think that derives from that same type of thing that same type of phenomenon right and i think it's important sort of to delineate between when we sort of when we look at bitcoin for example ethereum those are also things that are bootstrapped from nothing but you know and they are big um and they have a lot of network effect then they will be valuable because of that right right well i think that's a great point right because bitcoin in a sense sort of pioneered this but it pioneered it and it's at a point now where it has millions and millions of millions of adopters people that are invested in its success and i think that's a and that's a phenomenon that we see across the board everywhere in life people try to imitate they try to fast follow and so everyone wants to be the next bitcoin because everyone wants to be rich so that drives so much of of whether it is in crypto or meme stocks or anywhere there's this desire to be the next bitcoin the next uber the next google you know but now it's just everything's been tokenized so the capacity to generate the returns that a google can generate or a new can generate are actually possible because the dividend has gone away the cash flow's gone all you need is asset price appreciation so there's actually an a way to get there if you can get enough people to believe in the ponzi and to buy in early enough so that you can exit at a sufficient multiple that's the game right and it seems sort of where for me the nihilism comes in in contrast to something like bitcoin would be that a lot of people were like straight up tell you that they don't believe in it for the long term they just want to get out you know they want to get in and get out before you know others do and that's how they plan on making money with that right yeah and that raises the question of whether whether a whether utility is important first and foremost and then also whether or not having a sort of a long-term vision is important or is it simply important is price really all that matters you know right yeah i mean you raised a very interesting point when you compared this sort of to the raise rise of growth companies in growth investing um like when we look back 40 years or 50 years like the way that someone like warren buffett you know made their uh made their start was you know with a sort of cigar but strategy right sort of look at you know companies and only look at that tangible value and completely discard sort of the any potential of future growth and now we seem to have the opposite almost yet all only looking at future growth it's a very momentum driven investing environment and that's not entirely surprising when you consider that the ultimate driver of that momentum has been and that sort of equilibrium of steady increases in price over time has been have been monetary policy makers they've created an environment sort of sauce for the goose if everyone sort of invests in in the in the giant tidal wave that the fed has created through the massive amounts of liquidity that it's generated and in that way particularly bitcoin but crypto as a category isn't a is an ex is it really a deep pure expression of the chaos that that has created so you would say financial nihilism is primarily a result of you know bad policy and i think it's a bank failure i think it's partly a result of of of central bank policy specifically what i've talked about is the moment of clarity that normally comes every so often through through the the contraction of a business cycle the the the absence of that moment of clarity um and the sort of promise of perpetual mean reversion that has developed both through forward guidance of monetary officials but subsequently every market participant simply believing that things will just go up that is very nihilistic because it'll it it it it provides no room for the discretionary investor whose job it is to actually tie price back to value right to tie perception to reality if we are operating with an idea that there is some ontological base reality um and incidentally i think this is also why theories of simulation simulation theories have gotten so popular in the culture because there is this feeling that uh reality is less and less relevant or even absent entirely or empirically non non uh obtainable i think that also speaks to something else which is that we just can't appreciate how much our experiential universe has changed over the last in particular i'd say 10 years i think that's what the big change happened because that's when ten or a few more years when ubiquitous connectivity through mobile and social media and networked applications became a huge thing and so i think there is a real sense that the world is less tangible we spend more time and and as a result of that we spend more time in the digital world and because we spend more time in the digital world we end up running into a problem that has always existed but that we never really were aware of because when we live in the world when i meet you hasu i know i if some if i say that there's hasu and someone else will say that's not him but it's so obviously you because you're in the world i can see that that's you the onus of proof is on the person who's making the statement that it's not you but in the digital world it's very difficult to distinguish truth from fiction fact from falsehood yeah and so we run up into another problem that crypto that one of the central problems that crypto is meant to address which has to do with trust um and how do we trust the world that we can't sort of verify through our bare sensorium as we know it to be true putting aside legitimate arguments of whether the world as it is based reality as we perceive it is actually best reality and to what degree it has any relationship to reality those are fair arguments but regardless we were evolved to live in the world and i think this transition to a digital world the challenges of making that transition work are deeply underappreciated because of how quickly we've sort of been sucked into it made a very interesting point there regarding our inability you know to verify things and you know tell true from fiction um would you say that this motivates maybe to a degree the entire you know strive for having a decentralized financial system and you know the web 3 narrative you know let's let's build new social media platforms new internet giants but this time decentralized and where everybody can you know verify the state and and so on you cut out for a second did you say does it validate the need for quote decentralized applications yeah yeah yeah pretty much and the decentralized financial system because this is yeah this is such a high value right both in bitcoin and ethereum the ability for anyone to be an actual node in the system and you know validate that the rules of the system are being followed so would you say this is a an attempt to reclaim that power that i do yeah i do i think the general answer to that is yes i do that's sort of the short and succinct answer i do think so i think it's i again you and i know we've talked about this often times there's you know there is the philosophy there is the virtue signaling within the community um with there's a lot of virtue signaling along certain values of sort of enlightenment or american enlightenment and um and things like this but and truth et cetera and we are you know the community falls very far in certain sectors falls far short of that but i actually i absolutely do think that this is the correct goal to strive for yes in an age where people only seem to care about the price of things um it feels more important than ever to take a moment and reflect on the values that you know the crypto community wants to have um what what values and ethical codes do you think crypto should represent and maybe where does it currently fall short of that well i think that it i think those the again the virtues that the or the values that the community um sort of developed early on or had uh sort of again enlightenment type values um a culture of openness these are important values i think the community feels i think in the bitcoin community the bitcoin community a lot of the spokespeople for the community fall vastly short of that um that standard there's a lot of self-policing that happens there's a lot of um sort of ideological cultish worship worshiping um and that i think is does not serve the community well i think when and i'm not impartial to either bitcoin or ethereum to be clear um but what i like about the ethereum community is that there is more of a focus on building and by the way i think these are again culture is something that changes over time you you know this isn't something that has to be permanent i just think it's a it's a phenomenon at present i i think you know to that point the bitcoin culture as an example is more restorative uh and the the if the ethereum culture is more so to speak progressive and what i find more appealing in in the present time because of all the problems that the world faces and because of the incredible opportunities that this technology can support i find that progressive ethos far more attractive and i also think incidentally that it is far more aligned with the current zeitgeist and i think we've seen this in the conversations around the energy problem or to the you could disagree with there's an energy problem or not but let's just put mining um and the incred the enormous policy focus and focus through esg and other other areas of the economy on green energy green you deal stuff like this so that's sort of how i see that if that answers your question yeah sure um regarding sort of the progressive versus restorative so um you said one fits the current zeitgeist better than the other where do you stand on the question if you know the same person can sometimes favor restorative ideas and at other times progressive or versus um is it like always two different camps and you know sometimes one is more powerful versus the other yeah no i i don't i don't i i think that you can favor both um because again to bring it to bitcoin because the tangible example bitcoin's value isn't its restorative quality so you invest in bitcoin you want to hold bitcoin because you don't want too much change so the same people that can you know be working in ethereum many of those people or people that own eth or and or btc they own both interchangeably um and people can support both and these are actually the the entire i mean one of the things that people outside the crypto community may not understand as much is that it benefits everyone um when bitcoin goes up in price uh or at least it certainly benefits ethereum these the the the industry moves in tandem and that's not necessarily a good thing but it is what it is for now um so i i think that you can support both uh if you can be an in fact to my point one of the these strong progressive values today in the zeitgeist is environmental conservationism well what is that other than not restorative um and uh can you can you restore a restorative audience real quick can i what can you define what restoration i restored if i mean kind of make america great again uh make money great again so to speak putting out all the pejoratives associated with it um and you know there are a lot of things about uh society that were great uh that maybe that the that the the current culture is very quick to uh throw throw out you know the baby with the bathwater there are a lot of really really great things that we shouldn't we shouldn't forget so maybe it's a bit of a jumbled answer but that's why i would describe it restorative i probably should have thought of a better answer than that but it's it's kind of like a way of talking about being conservative yeah you know yeah i think we're like conservative is about you know not like favoring keeping things the way they are unless we are really sure that they must be changed right and restorative to me means returning to a better time let's say like you said with make america great again right we store something that has once been and i think the idea that the bitcoin community is striving for in a lot of ways is returning to like i mean some sometimes they talk about sort of the gold standard um but also just about you know maybe uh a glorified or romanticized version you know of america that may not have ever existed right um the wealth gap is often you know mentioned when you know their grandparents were able to work for a few years out of college and buy their first house right and then get two or three kids you know and and and have two cars and whatnot right and they look at themselves and they are burdened with student loan debt um ever being able to afford their own home seems completely out of reach for them what do you tell them like is it realistic that this time can even be restored or do we need to find completely new solutions to these problems so these are totally fair observations and you know the wealth gap and part of in the wealth gap is partly driven by the type of financial repression that we've described yeah um the same phenomenon that favors asset prices over dividends and income flows and fixed fixed income flows i i think this is a really tough you know tough question it's a fair question it's a tough question no one really has the answer to this i find it difficult to see how um this trend can continue indefinitely because in practical terms what it simply means is that america moves from a a more market-oriented commercial capitalist so to speak um free market economy towards one that is increasingly feudalistic where a smaller and smaller percentage of people in society control the vast majority of all the wealth and whether that's whether that's uh represented in treasury securities or stocks or anything else that doesn't work it creates political volatility in place of these interest rate volatility or financial market volatility that you would normally see right so the central banks create this sort of steady upward movement in prices and in return you get increasingly uh political instability that can't go on forever which is why i think the the central banks whether they acknowledge it whether they even understand it entirely consciously or subconsciously are trying to devalue fiat currencies because it is that is a way of achieving a soft default and the soft default is i think people view it as the only way that we can redistribute well somehow i don't even know if that works it's actually very concerning we all have trouble sleeping at night as a result of this whoever all of us who deal with this issue no one really knows how it's going to work out i mean you can say it's going to work out really badly and you'll have some kind of political revolution or you will have a a form of international because that's we live in a world of nation states international conflict because rather than implode countries will seek to explode onto the international stage that's what we've seen in the past it stands to reason that that will is what will happen again uh things can always change maybe also we are reluctant to believe this because it seems so out of scope but i think it every year it becomes easier to believe with some of the things that we've been seeing and how much the global order has changed in the last 10 years it's sort of unrecognizable especially in the last 20 since the first year of the the first administration of the bush administration yeah indeed um i'd say you drew a very beautiful picture there of you know volatility can't be contained right it can only be moved around and just when you thought you had it content and it breaks out somewhere else right and um yeah 100 so that the thing is that and this is something i talked about uh on the grant williams podcast which is that in a market in a free market economy people have economic value and they have political value if the market becomes increasingly socialized and corrupt people still have political value they may not have economic value uh especially to a further point with the move towards automation people increasingly maybe feel like their lives are meaningless they don't have opportunities to engage in the power process and actually exert their will onto the world and feel like their lives matter but they their lives do matter at the ballot box so that's a dangerous cocktail when you've and this is why the founders are very one of the reasons why one of the reasons why the founders are very concerned about and some pushed for people like jefferson pushed for suffrage to be directly attached to property ownership which was they were very concerned about people having being landless they saw what happened in france yeah they were concerned about landless revolts and inner city riots of people who didn't care and we see that in cities when we see rioting and stores being broken and looted why is that happening because people don't feel invested in their local communities so you know i i think yeah i kind of i don't know if i strove off there no no no that's speaking to me i really like this tension i mean this is this is a i think uh an underappreciated insight right like who is the man who becomes you know a criminal it's it's not the guy who has property and has you know a wife and a family and whatnot right it's it's those that feel sort of left behind by society in a sense right um yeah completely exactly left i think it's a powerful framing though right feeling left behind the even if you're not even if you're not even if you have plenty of money in other words enough money to be able to live comfortably and exert and not have other people determine your life lots of people i know lots of people who are in that position who are a lot older who are angry because they feel like the world is leaving them behind and that i think is just a normal intergenerational transition it just so happens to be that the world is way more different uh today than it was 10 years ago versus 1980 from 1970 and so people who who you know came of age in an earlier time find the world even less relatable 10 years 20 years 30 years later and that's and that's another problem how do we integrate these different conscious experiences into one coherent workable society some people take the view that it's not relevant our current uh nation state uh political structure isn't relevant in this new world i don't i don't buy that argument i haven't been convinced of it because i think that ultimately we do live in the physical world that's not changing anytime soon i know there are a lot of people that want to upload their consciousness of the cloud which is holy scientific a wholly unscientific endeavor but um that's not that's neither here nor there and so security matters and if there is a an outgrowth of political terrorism in the united states as a result of some of the forces that we're describing here that's going to impact all of us regardless of whether we work remotely or not yeah you know they say history doesn't repeat but it often rhymes and what i appreciate about your show so much is that you often bring you know this you have to you have this grand view you know about not just our current times but also knowing a lot of parallels right zooming out um and seeing that you know nothing ever happens for the first time do you think there are any parallels in history to be found um you know to what we are seeing right now yes i i do i mean um i think one parallel is the the first industrial revolution in the 19th century we saw america move from a primarily agrarian and somewhat merchant economy to a a a largely industrial one and i think that coincided uh not coincidentally with the civil war because while the civil war was fought over the question of slavery the means by which the war could be fought and most certainly won by the north resulted from the industrialization of the north relative to the south and the power that accumulated politically to the north and that was a sort of uh a changing of the guard for the elite and society so that that part i think is relevant as is the the the industrialization right because you've got a new class of elites that exist today who um who've formed their wealth as a result of primarily a completely new a revolution in technology i think similarly the second industrial revolution really kind of the light late 19th early 20th century is another example what was interesting about that was one just the enormous growth in wealth and much of which accumulated in the hands of a small group of of people of elites and then subsequently the transfer of that wealth to their children and that resulted in a very different type of culture in america because while the carnegies and the rockefellers john d andrew these folks or cornelius vanderbilt who actually came into the fold even earlier than those guys these folks still work their way up from the ground once the wealth transfer to their children to their children you had this new institutionalized class of elites who increasingly didn't see themselves as americans in the case of the united states they saw them as internationalists and so their loyalty was more to this sort of to their identity as international elites i think we're seeing that today as well and i think the danger at that time was expressed in the form of you know these cults like eugenics the popularity of eugenics i think there's some similarities there in the uh in in the sort of transhumanist movement and other such um such ideas that really kind of i don't wanna i don't i don't mean to i don't mean to conflate transhumanists with eugenicists and i also think it's important to point out that not every new genesis was a nazi right so there was this was a larger philosophy but it had to do with a sense of superiority and and similarly there was a huge interest in fascism at the time um because fascism was such a or seemed to be such a um such a a a perfect ideology for business and so i think there's something similar that we see today with people that are attracted to the chinese authoritarian model people that saw what let's say how quickly the chinese built factories built uh hospitals during the the covid and and therefore there's so sort of there's a a strain of the culture that seeks expediency over what i think is stability long-term and this brings us back also to the point about automation which is that automation makes people obsolete and while it is a political liability in the fact that obsolete voters are very dangerous you do kind of get uh to what people like ted kaczynski the unabomber and people like bill joy uh co-founder of sun microsystems wrote about in the 90s and that's where we talked we bring us back to eugenicism and things like this do we get a power grab at some point by people who have enormous power who are in positions to manipulate our minds and our conceptions of reality not just through intermediation digital interfaces etc but the the algorithms that tell us what we want not just give us what we want but inform increasingly what we desire in the world um i think that's a real danger the sort of dystopian future that is a lot closer than i think most of us realize i think we have painted a pretty dire picture it is of the world as it is today um i would like to explore a bit how you know as a young person today um as i assume most of our audience is going to be uh how you can navigate this world and how you can make your own path um and not become nihilist yourself you know but be strong principled and um you know and and learn to stick to those maybe yeah uh that's a tough question um i guess i don't know why it strikes me as tough immediately maybe the transition from doom and gloom to and i'm not i'm not a doom and gloom guy uh yeah you're not yeah i'm not actually and you know when when i spoke about the point about social media and uh these companies really having a pipeline into our brain and being able to manipulate our wants and desires i'm also inspired by the work of people like shoshan azuboff and others that i've had on my show who have really done a lot of work to inform people about this and i think there's been a an awakening of the zeitgeist around regulation of of these companies can you rephrase that question again sorry yeah um is there anything that you would tell like a young person who right you know wants to live in this world um well i actually looked i looked at people uh it's funny that i you know you're old when you no longer refer you no longer think of yourself as a young person but um i i think that i actually look at people who are in their early 20s or late teens for inspiration on this i feel like it's hard for me to imagine how uh how to make it in this world i i think i think it's important to to make allies and to make allies with people who have lived for some period of time before you and maybe are in positions of power um i you know yeah i i guess i'm sorry i don't have a better answer no it's it's uh fine i mean maybe we can take it from here like to me some our answers would come to mind based on what you said earlier for example if we try to if we realize that maybe you know the the the family model pro like where you have a have a property you have a family at 25 you have kids like you it's almost like you work the same job like your entire life how we can try to recreate some of the same benefits in a completely digitized and international world yeah and you know what it struck me what you said about you know you need allies um i think it's it's very important in this day and age to um have like invest in relationships right because it can feel like due to the constant connectivity um it can feel like you're connected to many people all the time but the relationships can be very superficial and ultimately not fulfilling when sometimes it might be better to you know disconnect and invest strongly into fewer but deeper relationships i totally agree and actually that does raise something which is i think there is that we've talked about the nihilism and the cynicism i don't think these are um i don't think people should be engaging in this type of thinking um i think and i also think that one of the one of the problems that we have today is that there's not these social media platforms which are effectively the public squares of the age are not are adversarial environments um they are not open town halls for discussion and that's a big problem and that wasn't always true it wasn't always true on social media and it just wasn't always true period and we need that and i think ultimately that comes a lot of that not all of it but a lot of that stems from a lack of self-policing of oneself not of others because i think we do a lot of that there's a lot of throwing bricks through glass houses and i think we what we need to do is to and there are people that do that do work in this area in fact my guest who i just interviewed um and whose episode comes out on monday andy norman wrote a book called mental immunity where much of it is about how do we find a way to reason together to be able to establish and hold ground rules for conversation so that every environment every conversation doesn't devolve into a zero-sum game conversation should be a positive sum game so that we all get something out of it just the same way that training ahead of a ahead of a competition ahead of a fight you train you don't train to kill your your sparring partner you train in order to make both of you better so that you can then meet a challenge in the real world and be and be that much better for it so i think maybe developing a less cynical attitude towards towards conversation um and moving away from argument and more towards constructive conversation and not assuming the worst in other people so i if i were have any advice i would say we kind of need to change the there's a again this this speaks something we haven't talked about which is narcissism people are so narcissistic they're so self-involved and they don't even realize how self-involved they are because they're so self-involved but people who aren't that self-involved can see that in their twitter feeds can see that in their interviews and we should and there are and i a great example of someone like this is grant williams i mentioned him before i was on his podcast and i thanked him at the end and i told him that for me grant is really a sort of idol that i look at and i look towards for inspiration and guidance on how to behave in the world because it's very easy in the world that we live in to focus very much on oneself and what i can get uh whether it's money or whether it's a claim and not understanding that we are part of a whole and our actions especially for the public in the public world have an impact and they they impact other people and people look towards that younger people will look towards that for inspiration so i think that's very important for sure yeah we keep circling back to the social media companies right but they they are designed intricately in a way to bring out these negative traits in you right yeah um i saw a really good meme almost like a few months ago where someone mapped um the seven large tech companies to the you know the seven deadly sins and i think you know instagram was vain and facebook was narcissism and hey you know that it was something around these lines right and i feel like it's really true how how they bring that out in you um yeah well you know they're they're meant to um amplify engagement and there are aspects of of the human animal that favor sensationalism favor controversy favor conflict over peace um and you know getting along so i think a lot of those things get exploited and that's where i think we do need regulation um i there was a strong push for it interestingly enough in under the trump administration i've i hear less of it now um regulation of what regulation of social media companies social media companies are not normal companies they are utilities they should be treated as such and i say they are utilities they're not treated as utilities they are they are performing a public service they're very much like the news division of a corporation but even more important because they are where we communicate they're where we share ideas they're where we come to consensus about ideas as a culture and the idea that those should be controlled by a commercial entity whose business model is based on advertising is so obviously a bad idea it's one of the worst ideas ever the only reason it hasn't been reformed is because the commercial interests in control of it have employed massive amounts of money in the form of lobbyists in washington to ensure that nothing will get in their way so i i think this is one of the big battles of the next few years the next however many years i don't know we have i can't say the next 10 years because waiting 10 years even waiting five years feels like crazy to me um so you know this is this is a huge a huge issue it's a we can't have a functioning dem functioning um liberal democracy without a public square that is that at the very least leans towards objectivity and we are far from that right now what are the kinds of regulations that you would like to see for social media companies um there are people i'm blanking on the name now um uh jessica something i think is her name but there there are and you know someone who writes about this and is in touch with a lot of these folks is uh uh i'm blanking on i had him on my show matt i'm forgetting his name now he writes the blog big and so i can't tell you exactly what regulations i think for example uh the spirit of um of uh net neutrality that needs to carry over to the fact that the censoring is not just happening on at the at the information layer it's actually now happening on the software layer it's not it's not on the hardware it's not just the hardware it's not just uh cable companies censoring content and packets of information this is now happening on the platform level with companies like google facebook twitter tick tock whatever yeah so that that type of um that attempt to kind of l uh level the playing field has to happen there as well and i think i i think and this is without having studied it very carefully and i would love to hear what other people have to say about it is it seems to me that this entire business model of allowing of traff of trafficking uh people's attention and clicks for ad dollars is toxic it should shouldn't exist and it would i would favor in the in light of not there be if they're not being anything better i would be fair i would be in favor of banning it entirely because i think it's it's one of those things that's clearly horrible for everyone except for very few people who can profit from it and even they even they will protect their kids i was just in kauai this is a great example i was in hawaii and there's an island hawaii called kauai where they filmed jurassic park tropic thunder in fact i passed by ben stiller's house but more importantly who was the director of tropic thunder i wish i wish i was be i didn't pass in his house because i don't know ben stiller but if ben stiller's an eth head and if he's listening right now he's listening love you love you but i also passed by from a great distance mark zuckerberg's house mark zuckerberg has purchased through uh um you know all sorts of covert processes a huge area of land in kauai and he employs a huge security detail to ensure that no one can get close to it and why do i bring this up mark zuckerberg has told us that privacy is a sort of bygone thing it's not important we're over it move past that but he wants privacy he wants privacy for himself he and she buys all the houses around his house in on the west coast why because he wants privacy so um i think you said something that made me bring that up i wasn't just ripping ripping on on mark zuckerberg i think it was it had to do with the right that was my point in the seventh sentence and yeah my point is the only reason that it's not important to mark zuckerberg is because he has the money to be able to create that privacy and to be able to protect his own children yeah you know uh so it's the same steve jobs didn't let his kids use certain products some of his own products i doubt mark zuckerberg lets his kids open up a facebook account you know unless it's like a private intranet account or something yeah i am i read a book um last year now i'm blanking on the name but the gist of the book was it laid out how the super rich can buy all kinds of benefits like privacy like immunity from law um and you know that you know they are like not that difficult ways you can buy everything with money and everything has a price and this is the hallmark of a corrupt society in a banana republic maybe yeah but it's it it it wasn't local in nature this phenomenon but it was deeply global it had to do with regulatory arbitrage because there was always a place where you can get exactly what you want if you're willing to you know expand your reach and this actually deeply reaffirmed my belief in the value proposition of crypto because if you can buy everything with money then maybe the right way like maybe those holes can't be closed maybe that's the wrong approach maybe the approach is to make it you know just as cheap as possible and that's easy to get you know just democratize access to these things like financial privacy right so the question is how would you do that would you do that um through government regulation i don't know um because then you have the problem of the sort of who will guard the guardians which is that you have to you have to overcome these enormous blocks to regulatory change the sort of progressive regulatory change which are the companies and the individuals who have captured the government and this is why it's difficult you kind of run into the problem of like how do we get from here to there you know um and is it going to be violent and is it going to be difficult and it's certainly going to be difficult you know i mean i see crypto as a bottom-up experiment almost you know in competing with things that can only be done via top-down policy otherwise because for the for the private market it's not possible to bring up you know a solution that grants financial privacy from the state it's not never going to be tolerated but if it's a cryptocurrency maybe right if it's a cryptocurrency what then maybe it has a chance to what has a chance it has a chance to grow you know into existence where it can be used by a lot of people and be accessible is that a cryptocurrency or a platform you're talking about sorry i must have missed that you're talking about a decentralized social media platform oh no just you know financial privacy oh some kind of financial decentralized applications um like store of value that kind of stuff i mean it's it's it's not great privacy but it's some privacy right it's not it's not the kind of privacy that mark zuckerberg can afford for himself but i think there are certain areas where you can create yeah i mean but i don't know i think there are certain areas where you can create privacy um in in the in the commercial realm by using a different uh you know incentive and wealth redistribution model essentially having an open source you know disco decentralized platform with with token issuance i think there are places that you can do that i maybe i need to graduate from the realm of skepticism in general in crypto because of so many of the things that do make people skeptical again long-term believer uh short term there's a lot of noise to sift through but sure i think in principle yes let's talk about that actually like your skeptical position on crypto you say you are a long-term believer what does it take for you to become a short-term medium-term believer as well uh good question um for example for defy one of the things that's been uh disappointing a little bit a little disappointing but more simply uninspiring i would say is that d5 as i said is primarily used as a tool for regular financial regulatory arbitrage and gambling and so it's it's no different in my view than if anything it's just it's just more uh it offers more opportunities to gamble than traditional financial markets um at least in terms of you know for the size of the market the the kind of opportunities to gamble um i would like to see whether it's indeed fire anywhere else i would like to see a major um a launch of a really widely used application so if it were a d5 you know a lending protocol that was that that let's say in in the developed world really made huge changes in economic opportunity for people but also again because this is financial services i think there are huge risks in defy uh as this as the as the network grows because not just because it's unregulated but because these systems aren't don't just have you know complexity and code they also have the complexity of the financial layer and you basically have these two forces working together and they can create a lot of volatility and a lot of instability and you know the traditional financial system prior to central banking was obviously much more volatile and you had instances of bank runs and firms going under because of the nature of how banking works and leverage works but you didn't have those forces combined with with the complexity of actually writing software and all all the sort of unintended consequence that come with that so i think there's still a lot to work through i think it's interesting but you and i have talked about this before i actually think i was early on i was optimistic about how the tokenization of software would drive capital into a space and allow the market to effectively crowdsource interesting projects and that this was i thought i found this to be a superior model to government grants and things like this which i found to be you know full of corruption but when i've actually studied if you actually look at how some of the foundational open source protocols were developed in the united states they were developed through close collaboration between the government academia the government academia and ultimately passing that off to the commercial sector and commercialization and well and the military exactly right so the government i throw the military in together um that model worked very well and i think one of the reasons why i worked so well is because you know when you're a creative and you're an innovator you need a space to be free to think without constraints and to create without any particular objective um vanivar bush created an outfit like this during world war ii and a lot of things like microwave radar that was put onto bombers in the atlantic that actually took out all the submarines the nazi submarines that allowed american vessels to cross the atlantic and to refuel this is before the united states entered the war and to refu and to uh rearm uh and provide supplies to the british and to the allies that was possible because of the ability to separate the military which needed stringent very much like a commercial operation and the academ the academic sector uh academia think tanks etc so i think there's a real benefit there that's lost in the current model because there's so much focus on the token and the price how do we get the price up um and i think that is that's a that's a real cost you know some people might quibble or argue well it's okay it's a cost but it's not the benefits are greater i don't know if the benefits are greater to be honest i think a lot of money has been wasted in this space um and scammed et cetera because of this i think i have a practical question for you um some defy coins choose to launch a token immediately have a trade on secondary markets because they see this as part of the feedback loop right it keeps it it creates an aligned community of early investors sometimes like some of them even become contributors um they use it to incentivize you know liquidity provision and adoption but others um sort of keep the talking on the back burner they don't even launch a day they you know eventually they will right because this for for um the way that i like to think about it is this is sort of the equivalent of going public like the going public moment of a new company and um and some like to take years to launch a talk right dydx is a sort of a derivatives exchange that that does is has been live for like three or four years now and still doesn't have a token um but sort of where do you stand on this and maybe also in the light of private like if you look at regular companies they take longer and longer to go public where for the like then you know public markets investors can buy them for the first time and this at least it seems to contribute to the rising wealth gap right because a lot of wealth is now created and captured exclusively in the private markets um compared to like for example when microsoft went public and all of that wealth was subsequently created in the public markets yeah where do you stand on this uh with regards to defy that's a really great question um i think one there's an incentive for people to launch a a token earlier and earlier because not just to raise capital but this you mention it build a community and i think this it's so it's uh it's one of those things where i understand why people do it even if they aren't necessarily interested in raising more capital and in le but i i would have to say that those again the benefits of community are enormous i mean it's something that i i have to acknowledge it's something that i under-appreciated i mean i appreciated it but i really i didn't appreciate it as much as i have now because i think people want a need community and it speaks to the to the sense of loneliness and being left behind in nihilism that we talked about earlier but i don't i don't i think it's i think on par it's always better to wait i think it's it's it's a lot of times projects you know this will launch tokens that aren't necessary at all so um and there's so much noise in the channel when it comes to this so on average i i i would prefer not to see another token launched you know i would prefer companies and teams work in a more traditional way and i don't know that it's necessary to launch a token you can find ways to incentivize people the way uh early startups have done that before with you know early equity okay so let me actually challenge you on that if the token is the equity then i feel like every project has a token it just may not be well that's different it's not publicly right yes i think that's my point i think that's well that's that that's where i i think it's problematic launching something so early going public as a startup i think that's problematic that's right i see yes i think that is exactly the right framing um and surprisingly nobody uses that right um indeed if i sort of thinking about launching the token as the going public moment and you know really evaluating the pros and cons of that so yeah it only yeah i only thought about that in this discussion yeah are we getting signal to to go off stage um we can wrap it up sometime in the next three i'm happy not to wrap it up i just i just want to make sure yeah this is very complicated for me these sort of digital stages i i have it under control yeah okay we have um we have one or two more audience questions we could we could um [Music] take one more so someone asked them why why do you think current money is not great what defines great money for you it's a bit of a topic yeah so this is a uh i i uh this is a really tough question i used to be um fundamentally a sound money guy i also recognize i mean the gold center is a great example over time i mean alan greenspan made this argument and he made the argument again alan greenspan went through a long transition some might say opportunistic self-serving transition from being a gold bug randian to a to the center to the head of the central bank and really in some ways a transformative uh central bank chief but he made the argument that really the the gold standard is irrelevant because in order to have a functioning gold standard you need to have an honest government and if you don't have an honest government well i guess he was talking about the bretton woods standard i don't know i'm sort of torn on this um i i've seen i think the way our understanding of the gold standard and sound money is is is uh we idealize it but it came with a lot of problems so in place of an institutional elite we had a commercial elite who was what the people called the banking trust there's a reason why bankers are so impossibly unpopular in the 19th and early 20th centuries and why progressive populist movements grew up against the trust um so the issue for me tends to be power and the accumulation of power i think i think it's a it's a if i had if i had to um to pick one i would pick sound money but that also is very self-serving because i would benefit from such a model and i don't know ultimately in the long term if it is sustainable you know and i wonder to that point you know what i should say i think one of the challenges we have with these types of conversations is everyone's always looking for the perfect model you know but i tend to find that what happens in history is people are very clever and they always find ways to upend any existing framework or model and that always leads to revolution and renewal so you know the fiat model is clearly broken the sound money the the the sound money model whether it's in bitcoin or gold creates lots of inequities this is where politics comes into the picture and why you can never really get rid of of people unless you have a world of machines but if people have power you need politics because politics is what causes that renewal process where people can work things out and war is politics by other means so sometimes politics breaks down and you have open conflict and that's just human so i think i don't think there's an ideal model i prefer i prefer a sound money model where i can save my money but that model also comes with other costs so okay um man i'm so sad that we're out of time because i was good so i also have a take on fiat money but this is the end for us dimitri thank you so much for the discussion my pleasure my pleasure please everyone check out

i also want to make sure that all of you also check out house's podcasts on common core um there's a lot of great insights in there and uh i i wish we we had more time because there's so many things we can dig into but that just means uh we're gonna definitely invite you back and continue the conversation so all right guys thanks again and uh thank you on to the next talk so uh our last talk today is a panel on d5 security and best practices uh we're gonna just be covering some things to keep in mind the state of what's happening in this ecosystem from a developer and security standpoint and there's so many details that i'd rather let our panelists go into including the introductions so without further ado i'd like to invite mariano sam morellian emiliano and martine on stage and uh marianna will be moderating this chat and uh i'll let him kick us off with the introductions to all of our panelists and himself welcome ariana hey kartik thank you so much for having us here today oh uh we're excited to have you i'll ask everybody to turn their videos on and we can kick off with the chat [Music] great okay do we have everybody seems like we do cool well um thank you everybody uh for being here this is extremely exciting for me uh i'm calling this version two of the the panel we had i believe it was january 15th or somewhere about then and i remember saying that not a lot was happening at the beginning of the year and uh certainly a lot has happened since so i'm really excited to talk to every uh all of you about it um let's do introductions first um sam do you want to go do you want to go first yeah sure uh hey everyone so i'm sam i'm now a research partner at paradigm where i basically still do the same thing that i've always done which is review code uh you know keep the ecosystem safe as always that's about it right uh more alien hey um good to be here i uh previously worked as an auditor at consensus diligence and uh was one of the original members of that team and now i'm at optimism helping to secure that protocol and loving it cool can't wait for that to go live i think everybody yeah uh emiliano hey thanks to be here with i would say beautiful minds in defy obviously we have many many others so um i'm the co-founder of defy italy a community uh around d5 in italy and uh let's say i'm a part-time builder in dfi and uh let's say i help projects uh during security incidents and i'm also a strategist in the wire group excellent and finally we have tincho hi everyone super excited to be here and ninja i'm a security researcher open sibling i've been a security researcher for the last couple of years already and yeah excited to be here great and um just in case my name is mariano conte i was at maker for a few years and now just uh part of the ethereum and d5 ecosystem uh cool so let's uh kick this off so this past few months at least personally i've seen a lot of activity um you know rock pools and and just exploits mainly on you know binance smart chain and i think i've seen a mix of uh you know exploits that we all that we almost do not see anymore on ethereum for example uh you know a mix of things that we've already learned and and you know don't do anymore on ethereum as well as you know straight up copies of other protocols uh sometimes with one or two lines uh you know change just to become 100 an intentional work right i want to start with that uh what has been your experience um do you think it's fair to say that everything most of the rockfalls are not happening on other chains other than ethereum or do you disagree with that i would i would start saying that there are different scenarios i would say in that you have like rock pools in which perhaps the owners of the or the admins of the project have thought about rock pooling the project since day one and that's just plain scam and people should definitely try to avoid that and then we have like this common or simple bugs that you mentioned and that can be the case of new developers jumping into the ecosystem to these new site chains that appear and they are like just coding their approaches and they fall for the same mistakes that we have have in many times already in ethereum but a different scenario i think that could be interesting to think about is um there have been bags in which they are so obvious to be true right so in some sense i i don't know i i don't want to believe this but it could be the case that we are like seeing uh drug pulls but must as hacks so you launch a project you introduce uh saddlebag or not so saddle and yeah then you get hacked at the end of the day you're just track pulling your users but just you're saying that you got right i don't know there was this case of a unisop fork that they just directly removed the invariant right the x times y equals k they just removed it and that cannot just be you know a simple bug right that has to be intentional yeah i i would say mariano that as tincho mentioned there are let's say uh it's not so easy to to describe all the scenarios i i'm more let's say oriented to say that there is so excitement in d5 and especially in this let's say scaling solution like bsc polygon and any other let's say scaling solution that people uh new developers new builders rush on let's say build their own new protocol maybe you know leaking some information about other protocols that are successful and maybe because they lacks of experience or skillness let's say they remove some feature without doing the let's say tests that are required and definitely we have scenarios where you know maybe some developer remove an underscore so you see you see that the code let's say seems to be identical so that's probably is for sure but uh i think that most of the bugs that we saw on the let's say incident are related to this excitement and another interesting uh um let's say pattern that we saw is that since there are so many variants so many forks now it's it's it's difficult also for those new protocols to stay updated with the changes of the original ones so for instance if you fork a wire if you fork any other protocol and maybe a wire discover an issue it's easy to say that probably it will be exploited in the next minutes uh on the on the side chain so uh this is let's say it's a common problem for open source and because of this excitement is not easy to let's say to to solve it so i i i i always think about it's it's okay to let's say uh contain this excitement and be more safe or it's let's say healthy to have those protocols to be you know to have some impact obviously from a user perspective it's better to be safe but at the same time let's say you're moving innovation in this way so it's not easy to answer anybody else want to chime in on this i feel like with that like good points have been made and it's hard to say a lot about what's happening exactly when run pulls happen um the one point i jotted down was to not necessarily assume maliciousness when stupidity is sufficient as an explanation um i think that's probably very often the case what's going on and then you also have evil at times uh what about something that happened very recently uh like iron finance i don't know if anybody's aware of what happened would you consider that a rockpool would you consider that an economic exploit would you consider it uh that's just the way algorithmic stable coins go so they work until they don't what do you think it seems to me like that without having done a formal analysis but it just it feels like if you publish the rules well one thing if you publish the rules somebody will find a way to break the rules but you don't even need somebody intentionally trying to find a way to break the rules um it's it's just not i think humans are more complex than we can describe with an algorithm and it's asking for trouble and and history seems to be bearing that out i mean someone feel free to jump in and correct me but i'm not sure the iron incident wasn't required like i the founders didn't make money off it right it just sort of collapsed on its own from all the selling pressure at least as far as i understand i also haven't done an analysis myself but uh yeah that's that's as well what i understood uh but i don't know if there was any any new information i just scrolled past a few tweets and there were mentions of both but yeah in the case of uh an algo stablecoin most likely just fell to its uh yeah regular uh bankrupt um there's many ways to make this is not even an allegation but like you know what could like you can just short the token right and so i mean a very roundabout rug pull would be to just create an algorithmic stable coin assume it will eventually die and and find some way to benefit off of its eventual death very indirectly not necessarily through a hack or anything so i think my the upshot there is just it's it's all it's really really hard to um identify to understand motivations and um how who's acting in what way in this world in terms of you know actual security let's focus you know on on evm style blockchains have you seen anything new any any new developments you know that can help us prevent you know certain bugs that can uh you know guide the security community forward anything that you've seen that caught your eye or are we more or less the same as we were when the year started um i think that from a review perspective uh i mean tooling improved a lot and let's say it's more we have more complete tools not at all comprehensive yet uh we we still need the let's say developer adoption of those tools but we we saw the rise of let's say uh companies groups new startups daos or whatever that try to help on take a look on the code that you build so maybe not so professionals but let's say like an audit where you have very vertical people that let's say do many many uh processes to understand if your code is performing as you expect and giving you a different perspective i'm talking about um the initiative uh where also you mariano participated in russell sam where you have a contest that the uh a protocol or a new builder let's say uh put on a location and say hey please try to uh break it or other initiative like the one that i started and let's say it's not going as i expected to be honest so reviews now where people try to collaborate on reviewing the code each other but alongside to that i see that many protocols now collaborate more than before so because they need to integrate to have success uh we see that many protocols look to the other each other code so uh i would say that from a touring perspective we are still in an early phase also if let's say tenderly with simulation with all the tooling that help to you know troubleshoot the issue he accelerate the diagnosis of and and a security incident or maybe before uh but i'm very happy uh to see those let's say initiatives to try to fix the supply of security experts and also the the lack of uh let's say security practice for for new builders yeah go ahead on top of what emiliano was saying that i super agree with that um i think yeah that we have had the developments i would i wouldn't say specifically technical developments but i still think that this security landscape keeps improving and maturing um perhaps we cannot catch up with so many new developments that happen in the ecosystem as a whole like forks side chains layer two and everything but i think that the white hacker space is like maturing and we have managed part one this now i think that the unified people are actually doing a pretty good job um i think on the operation and monitoring tools are also improving like emiliano mentioned generally we have open civilian defender as well doing some great advances um security tooling also i think that regular reads and consensus and sartori who are doing a cool job there and i think they are contributing a lot i also want to stress what elena said like i think that projects are starting talking to each other sharing experiences many of them have been hacked and they have learned lots from those hacks and they can share and get together and do like help groups after hacks and what they have learned and also i like there are projects onboarding new security specialists into their team i think that moderately and not music might be an instance of that but probably other projects as well are starting to take security more seriously knowing that oh it's not enough that there's a whole comprehensive thing that you have to do and like onboarding a security specialist might be a good step forward just a data point to what what tincho said the market for security grow a lot not maybe as we need but for instance a company like emunify now is offering 24 millions of bounties collecting most of the protocols so for me this this centralization is is a good let's say indicator that not only the most famous or the biggest protocols uh see that this is an important let's say investment that you have to do for many perspective user uh continue to to to to to have your protocol live et cetera et cetera but uh i think that there are opportunities for newcomers to not only this i stress this point many times to working defy to express your talent in defy you don't have for uh you don't you don't have to fork a protocol to do a new protocol you can you can collaborate in many ways also gradually okay and security is something so needed and is a very good let's say place to learn a lot of things that help you maybe in the future to design a more robust and solid protocol so i stress out that we need more and more people here and many companies are trying to build on top of this and i'm aware also of new startups new protocols that try to build something that let's say it's a security protocols in terms of let's say in in a decentralized way um about that i think oh no go ahead sorry yeah i mean i think um it's like to join emilia mentioned immunify especially is i think gonna do wonders for security in ethereum in the coming months uh or years if the time scale is uh mostly because you know we're we're slowly pulling over the all of the talent in the current you know website security space over into ethereum where uh you know we're currently experiencing such a shortage of security experts uh i think one other thing i wanted to call out really quickly um on the topic of tooling or at least tooling a json is um you know other languages for the evm that are being worked on right now you know uh the ethereum foundation i believe is working on like a rust inspired language i don't know if it's fe or if you pronounce it iron or however but uh that's that seems really promising and just a couple of weeks ago uh georges was pointed out to me a compiler by a hyperledger called solang which compiles solidity but using an alternative uh back end it's built on lmvm i believe um so i i think this isn't this isn't talked about as much but um you know i i i write about celebrities sometimes for uh some of the more interesting language features they decided to introduce but um i think just in general having the flexibility uh of language that you know is um is designed with you know all the lessons we learned in mind over the past couple years could be a really big point as well in the coming months i think reachlang is also worth calling out there they're doing some interesting work uh i do i can't say i know it very well but um they're they're really working on tackling the problem of secured blockchain development and i think it's worth watching rich is actually really fascinating because they they like they take the concept of like they they like compile an entire basically like state machine down into the program so like in instead of defining you know individual functions for like a rock paper scissors game you would define the state machine of the rock paper scissors game itself and then the compiler would generate all the state transitions for you it's really interesting um you should definitely take a look a deeper like if you haven't yet do you know how it compares gas wise for example i know that you know usually with these kinds of languages you try to be as specific as you can unfortunately i i don't think gas is on the top of their roadmap right now um it you know it the the way the reach compiler works is it takes the reach code and compiles it into solidity or i guess transfer files maybe it would be and then it likes to consolidate compiler handle the rest um so i would imagine gas might i would say at best is equal uh you know you might get some optimizations from the fact that the risk compiler can perform certain transformations that you know as a as a human developer you can't but i wouldn't hedge my bets on that i have a specific question about tooling and security has anybody seen out in the wild you know we always talk about a protocol maybe uh looking at the mempool directly for any transaction that would alter the state of their smart contracts in a way that's on scene and you know having uh a transaction ready to maybe stop the protocol or pause it in some way has anybody actually seen that in the wild uh happen or is that still mostly just theoretical i i haven't seen it but definitely sounds like uh nice right like useful but no i haven't seen it yeah honestly honestly um we talked i think also at the very first uh panel that we have i remember a tweet that that that i did about that but i think that uh few players like for instance block native did a great job on the manpool analysis but from let's say reporting perspective but also from a tooling and i think that the missing part here is how to understand if those transactions are harmful so as soon as we have uh the first line of defense also if let's say the incident will happen anyway is let's say uh a proactive monitoring okay so you know that is gonna to happen and so you can put in place all the mechanisms also from a communication perspective being able for let's say take an action before that one is settled on chain i see that it's still futuristic but it can be realized i would say that i would like to see some let's say a pattern that protocol can use to have let's say big red buttons if we are able to define some sort of standard way to let's say put a protocol in uh let's say sandbox uh modalities sandbox way that is blocked for somehow so the user cannot deposit anymore cannon with talk and whatever it would be easier to attach you know some sort of automation when we are able to understand if a transaction is handful it's actually a really key point um about you know how how exactly do you define um or how do you design the pausing mechanism for your protocol right because the worst thing i think for all of us is when there's a plug in a protocol and there's no way to pause it you have to do the white hat hack on chain uh but of course the if you go to the other extreme you know um users might not really like it if there's this master switch that pauses the entire protocol that you know you can't get out at all you're sort of at the whims of the development team um so that's something that i try to really uh drive the point home when i'm working with new groups is like you know have you really considered how how exactly do you want deposit protocol have you considered adding you know some sort of uh bare minimum fail safe where you don't let users in um and you don't let business operations happen but they can still exit if they want to uh but on the point of you know is there any tooling that lets you react to you know transactions in the mempool doesn't that isn't that what opens up when defender does i was i was smiling because i was like man surely nintendo's isn't was going to talk about this because i think you can you have to do it manually but i think you can set uh like specific conditions to watch for like if this transaction touches my contract and the the new state looks like this compared to the old state then do this thing which may or may not be like fire off this new transaction something like that kind of but it doesn't work with the member yet but definitely it would be a nice extension and what you can do now is yeah you can with defender you can monitor transactions you can see how they impact on your contracts and once you have those you can have automatic actions which we call autotasks and how like automatic triggers right from an alert and react on something on your protocol so i don't know if you see that the balance of your contract has decreased for some amount of money then you launch automatically a transaction that posses the whole system or something like that it's pretty customizable but it doesn't work as long as i look as long as i know it doesn't work with transactions in the manual oh sorry i know coco no i would say that would be a great addition i mean that many players already have speculative execution for for those for the transaction um what they want to add to to to what sam said is that i saw some protocol that basically let the user decide if they want to continue to operate when the let's say protocol is in danger so basically uh you can opt out from the okay uh uh the system is halted but uh if i want i can override just for myself and do the the action the other side is that the having the red button that is pressable maybe from from you know let's say uh this automation could be also a race for let's say denial of service because if i want to stop a protocol to to let's say because i'm a competitor i'm evil or whatever if the attacker knows how you react to those dangers it can let's say continuously halt you so it's not easy i think to to to to design a system that automatically uh pose your protocol because there are many many other scenarios that could arise at let's say maybe you are not in danger but there is someone that continues to you know to press the red button i will i will keep asking uh if we continue doing these panels maybe maybe one day you will say yes this is this is it we build it and use it but on that note even if you were able to you know access the it wouldn't really matter right uh in a world of uh flashbots and and dark pools and everything it's if an attacker wants to not broadcast a transaction they can just use a private service right so kind of defeats the purpose and on that note what do you think about projects like uh like flashbots everything that's going around um you know minor extractable value is there anything special that uh you know d5 developers uh security-minded individuals in the space need to you know think about do differently is the future is flashbacks you know the future the standard of interacting with the ethereum if i'm not wrong i mean the things that you can do with dashboards i might be mistaken and perhaps some you you have some more ideas if you have been working with the team but uh the things that you can do with flashbots are things that d miners could have already done in the past it's just like we are kind of facilitating them the job and perhaps getting extracting some profit from it in the meantime but many of the dynamics that you can do with in mev is just like facilitating the miners that job and so any kind of attack coming from that if i'm not mistaken i'm thinking right it could have been executed by a by a smart miner in the past i think that should be just like paving the way for it to happen in an easier way and more sustainable for the ecosystem that's that's true the intro but it opens the opportunity for others to leverage the minus position so minus maybe doesn't have the time the knowledge the money to invest on let's say strategies on d5 that can benefit for let's say front running others or let's say executing before so minor i mean uh researchers for instance also why earn when is executing harvest for those strategies want to be hidden because of because otherwise could could be a target of sandwiches attacks back running or whatever so having uh let's say a party like a miner that offer you to be eaten during the execution is something that works a lot so i would say that mev is uh i mean uh obviously can be used how you describe so basically attack or whatever but at the same times help to protocols to avoid issue to be let's say to see before the settlement a specific transaction but for protecting your protocol uh this is not the only uh let's say solution that you can use i see because i'm just more close to that that for instance why young implemented in their system uh let's say three shirts and right now with the zero uh for a two volt system you can have health checks on let's say the hours that are the most delicate operation so if if you exit from some boundaries the transaction will reverse at all so it's important also just to complete what we said before that you has a protocol also think about let's say some thresholds of let's say uh safeness of your protocol so maybe bigger deposit are not possible so you have to execute in two steps along with throwers so there is not only one solution but there are many that you can put to cover many of the let's say attacks or traps that you may have uh but anyway just coming back to mev i think that it's a great thing uh however uh uh if you go on on the uh explore.flashbot.net from let's say the last year we grow from the extraction value from zero to basically one billion so that's also offloaded the network from many price gas action so i i think that there are many many positive i mean side effects of this of this stuff also if i don't like too much because certified that miners have a privileged position that's running i wanted to add like for the the protocol devs listening that on the general topic of mev i think that there are emerging design spaces and mechanism designs that are worth investigating um i think the two that come to mind are i think it's called mint x and cow swap which are approaches to implementing a dex that is resistant to mev in ways um and essentially using batching to bring together people on both sides of the trade you think of it like a alternative to unit swap you bring together people on both sides of trade you have a certain amount of time for people to come in um and you don't have that uh that same kind of like sandwich attack dynamic that you you tend to get with with the amm um and so it's not not necessarily to call it those projects in particular but i think increasingly it will be of the benefit to the protocol to be thinking about uh mev resistant designs and and new mechanisms that can improve the user experience and protect them against that kind of exploitation interesting uh we have a few questions um from the chat so uh we can start with that or if anybody has anything else they want to say about mev nope let's do a couple of questions so um on the topic of l2 that you know it's becoming more and more common does anything change as you think about deploying contracts to l2 with regards to security sure well uh like one one example that comes to mind is especially if it's one thing if you're operating solely on a specific l2 it probably does not change uh too much depending on the the platform itself um but i think an obvious example is is bridging um and so with optimistic roll-ups you tend to have a fraud window that uh you have first of all you have like async cross domain calls so there's uh some delay you send your message from l1 to l2 uh you don't really get a response in the way that you do with a fully atomic transaction on on just in the evm um and uh you send your message off and you hope things go well on l2 um what sort so like an interesting example that came up recently was a project designing a bridge for their token thinking about pausing mechanisms so in the situation where you pause your bridge on l1 and pause your bridge on l2 because you have uh some some some problems there for whatever reason uh they chose and probably rightfully so to leave the well there will be uh transactions in flight so with that with optimism seven day window um if they pause those two bridges you don't want to have everybody who has uh tried to withdraw in the last week just have fun stuck when the bridge on l1 refuses to do anything uh and process those transactions so um i think that that a more asynchronous model that uh so that's a specific example of how a more asynchronous uh model is going to cause people to have to think a lot harder about some of their design decisions anyone else something about l2 uh i know in the case probably optimistic roll-ups um like uh uh arbitrary and optimism are gonna be uh i don't know this is my guess but i think they're easier to use than something like uh ck rollups that at least for now for what i've seen they require a bit more uh you know different languages things like that do you think we're gonna see uh more issues with the optimistic roll-ups just because we're gonna see the same you know copying of uh of protocols and putting them in uh in optimism and orbit room and have the cycle go all over again you know uh fork rockpool fork rockville just gonna take seven days for for the hackers to to release their their money yeah for sure no doubt i guarantee it no it will happen for sure mariano so i mean we we we can prepare a little bit more i i'm i'm really interested because we have here marvellion about the uh security aspects that you consider or the security requirements that you consider when you when you cross the boundaries so uh also just for the the audience that we have because i mean many uh maybe many don't know what happens effectively when you you know when you cross the bridge so you deposit some you send a message you deposit something just to be not so technical but you you deposit something on the bridge and then what happens so who who execute the transaction or the state change on the other side and it's a single entity it could be transferred it can cheat so there are many i think there are many many points i think that you are the most skilled to to explain us maybe with a very uh early five especially also where optimism uh position itself in this uh uh in this uh landscape okay um you can insult later you know yeah it is it is a big topic and i actually have not got as much practice explaining it um as i would like but i guess i'll say like so one thing you're alluding to is okay so first so maybe like the nuts and bolts is that uh or at the high level sorry we have an a you don't have there's no reason that you have to use the infra the messaging infrastructure that we've set up um if you're good at writing um merkle proofs uh you can go ahead and create your own pair of messages to send things back and forth from l1 to l2 on optimism we've built that for people we also have a contract that is is fairly easy to inherit from much like many of zeppelin's things which we call it uh ovm cross domain enabled and it handles that kind of the permission layer so you just you can import that and you can protect all your functions to say uh oh this is the l1 contract that uh you put this into an l2 contract and say okay this is the only l1 contract that is allowed to send a message to us to to execute some functionality and you can vice versa you can do the exact same thing um and then to not go into too many of the details but yes there's a uh there's an entity called the sequencer on optimism that many people have heard about um and so it provides much of the the throughput benefits that we have by centralizing this and having a big beefy node um you know much like you might have with a more centralized chain however we depend on the security provided by ethereum to help us provide better decentralization guarantees censorship resistance as well is something that we have worked into the protocol although in in to be completely transparent there is what i'd say like a a progressive decentralization approach that we're taking um so at the outset there there is more centralization um and we will be uh taking or like reducing that over time um deeply baked into the dna of of the optimism team is the idea of exiting to community so um that is very much on the roadmap and and i think that like i've always generally been in favor of having speed bumps and various safety features that that you can take off over time rather than starting with a i don't know what you'd say full speed ahead approach i see i want to touch on that because i've been asked that way too many times so for a project that wants to launch and this is not necessarily just for l2 uh there are many different ways of doing like a proper uh launch with you know safeguards what would you say the many different ways are and which ones you prefer i'm talking about you know restricting via the ui for example or adding actual restrictions on the smart contract using allow lists using upgradable proxies things like that which ones do you prefer and and why i mean i think my favorite is just adding a banner on the website that says by using this you acknowledge the risk of using this project and no responsibility to the authors and that's no um i i think he really nailed it there um you know the allow list is a big one uh i know urine did that for their v2 launch i believe i think i think my favorite by far is probably just a cap on the total um amount that can be deposited in the system and then that either ramps up uh with time or it gets adjusted by the by the team um the problem with other other methods like you know a cap on individual accounts is that it sort of becomes useless because anyone can you know it's trivial to create a new account on ethereum you just transfer your funds elsewhere uh and so like you know it's it feels like the most bang for your buck to just put a hard cap on the total amount of assets in the protocol itself yeah i would say on some that having caps particularly on the amount of money that the system can handle i think it will make the system less attractive for criminals and so yeah you won't have that much money deposited and and it might be safer and having emergency emergency shutdowns knowing that the first persons can fail and might be a little bit more centralized and i in my opinion that's fine and i'm also like a supporter of the slow decentralization model and i think that works i see projects going down that road and succeeding um monitoring that's a huge thing that people that want to launch first my name should be doing as well and publishing security contacts um yeah i really wrecked red sign on your front and saying this is experimental things can fail don't put your life savings on this product yeah i i like a lot the uh let's say we don't have to reinvent the wheel so having let's say a staging environment like a beta for your protocol uh especially if you let's say uh are already mature like for instance wire also idle finance has let's say a separate section of the protocol of the application that is segregated that basically allow you as a protocol to experiment so in addition to let's say protect you from a security perspective you you also can test if what you are going to release is attractive enough and working backwards to improve it and this is the example of eight tax so with white earner before going to production basically you test with the other strategies if your strategy is working uh good and also you shout out to the to the users that let's say want to experiment with you and provide you a feedback and with caps these help a lot so you have caps but also a separate environment it is not tested it's still maintenance so real funds and and you test the changes that you that you are going to do so i think that this is a very good uh good approach honestly i would like also to see more usage of the ethereum test that we have i don't want to say that let's say kovan if should have value honestly it could have but we should uh use more other test net or uh let's say staging environments and we don't have to reinvent the wheel do you think after i know some d5 projects are already three years old uh well maybe two and a half do you think any one of those uh would be okay to remove that big uh you know use this protocol at your own risk or or do you think no matter how much time passes that we should always put those disclaimers even on you know the makers compound service uh uni swaps i don't like honestly because it's a it's a barrier for me so i mean if i'm already there probably i i i know the risk i i don't from a ux perspective ui perspective i don't i i if you think also other let's say web 2 platforms no one says so explicitly that you are let's say opposing i mean i don't trust so much people that say it's all your liability responsibility whatever if something goes wrong it's up to you i i think that is not working it's working if you let's say beta staging environment or whatever but otherwise it's like okay i get a car i know that i can do an accident but not every time that i turn on the car hey you know what you can die what no i want to drive the car because i like the car i know that if i you know uh maybe at the very early stages but in general i i from let's say from a ux perspective i don't like a lot i'm not a ux expert absolutely not but as a user i let's say i don't like to see it i'll just also add on that i think you know if you keep the alerts on you know long-standing battle tested projects you run the risk of alert fatigue on users and that's something that we should really be aiming to avoid as security experts is you know if you flash an alert on every page then none of the alerts are meaningful so keep them you know where they're absolutely needed and then remove them everywhere else that's a very good point um okay we have about five to eight minutes left so um i have two last questions from the audience which i think we can compress into one uh so there are there any other tools or resources you recommend for security best practices and the other one is advice and tips for um you know the hackers that are going to be working on default integrations at hack.money for the next three weeks so free question for um the four of you you have any advice and tips or tools or resources i can chime in on the resources side i think that all major security companies have been publishing lots of reading material and um best practices and i think that if you're it will be security consensus is it with open circle and if you read others probably they will have as well there are lots of good practices published and security recommendations and well-known attacks and so on there are couple deflect challenges that will teach you about uh which are the bad practices and and probably how to you can start thinking on how to solve them fireline and and some need one recently we have them on i think there are plenty of resources out there in the community the challenge is keeping them updated and with the latest vulnerabilities and hacks that happen so there are already other security researchers out in the space that are constantly publishing its lists of synthenes and with explo analysis and so on that are really really good resources to to keep an eye on and to constantly be in reading to be aware of what are the latest hacks that you should be preventing i think if there's one piece of advice i'd want to give to uh you know the people working on integrations it would be please do not use the spot price if an amm has a price oracle we've talked about this for over a year now and it's still happening and just please do not use the spot price it's not a price workout that's that's all i have to say is there actually because i've seen that so many times would it make sense from somebody to just create a do not use the spotprice.com and and put in some amount of information about why for everybody is that is there some way uh to go and and read about why you don't want to do this mariano i will support you like dice that's created no i mean uh yes for sure don't you use them is a good approach probably we will let's say just expose not directly spot prices but always you know top or other let's say estimator of the prices so it will be let's say if you are skilled enough you know how to get this spot price directly uh so that could be a good approach so basically rising the barrier for for doing that but coming back to the your previous question i would like to see two two practices starting in uh to to become more trendy in this industry first one is shadowing i would like to see i mean if you see practical stuff and let's say practice a lot you learn a lot so in this sense i will shout out to everyone if you wanted to participate to let's say to some late stage war room or whatever uh i would like that you contact me or anyway shout out on twitter because you will learn a lot and second role plays i would like to see experiments in testnet where we simulate past accident so you not only read about the events what generated them and how we solve them but at the same time to try to repeat those stuff and experiment how to react that's very important also for new teams so simulate security incident so those two things at least for me was really helpful for many things that i did in the past before let's say dive deep in security uh i read on my own what was going happening with ethtx just dive deep on what's going on immediately and also pairing with someone else maybe more expert than me and at first shadowing and then participating actively that's something really i mean there are some risks obviously an evil party could let's say uh doing those stuff but uh i think that if you we use let's say for instance a candle program where we have fellowship when we know the party okay we don't know 100 but we start those training programs with shadowing with whatever that's that's really effective and honestly i discuss it with some some some peers in wyoming during the let's say y academy uh initiatives so that's that's definitely something that you have to do excellent um morrelian any last tips yeah keep it simple just like don't add every single feature that you can think of write less solidity [Music] and be safe out there kids that's great advice awesome well um i think we're at the top of the hour so we covered plenty i want to thank uh maureen sam um emiliano tincho for this uh awesome panel thank you the four of you i was i was waiting for this uh ever since we did the first one and um yeah uh thank you so much sweet global congratulations uh for all the hackers hope you create some great projects out there uh i'll be looking at them and i don't know if cardtake is around yeah but i just want to make sure that i also get to thank you mariano for not only just moderating this chat but also facilitating a super interesting conversation and um a lot a lot of good uh notes here at the end uh just advice for all the attendees for the hackathon i think uh for we'll uh we'll make this like an open call whoever buys don't use botprice.com first now is in charge of making that website work so for those of you who are listening as actors and still waiting on a project well there's a incredible challenge for a one-day project for you it could be an easy submission that'll definitely help a lot more people over the course of the next year for any d5 project so uh sam thanks so much for suggesting that and uh yeah i want to thank everybody here for uh giving us your time today and we'll see you all over the next few weeks and i'll show you what comes out of the thousand person hackathon with d5 so thanks everybody and uh with that i just gotta say one last thing and that is happy hacking um we'll uh we'll follow up with everybody on discord from here on and you'll be able to track the rest of the event and the nest of the summits and everything else on b5.18.co so hope you have a great rest of your your day and i will see some of you at the team formation session later tonight thanks everybody enjoy similar phi beats you
