so I'll get into it okay so just two seconds on what Universal market access or Bluemont or we say what it is what we're trying to do so we look at it as a decentralized financial contract about one I'm really trying to build infrastructure to let people like you guys build financial products the mission really is you know access so this really cool idea that hey you could actually create potential products that are actually globally accessible and not tied to your local like beyond government jurisdiction and also guys like there's really two parts to overdoing their what we're calling himself enforcing contracts and patterns a mouthful but what we really mean on the contract design patterns yes the country design patterns these are going to be contract types reflect weights that let us create useful features for pens examples are like what we're promoting for bounty synthetic assets organization so let's create a token that tracks some synthetic acid in the world these could also be Swaps and Derivatives like a decent and then the second part of that is on this Oracle concept this Oracle that's going to power it and provide real-world data on the watching on that drives those contracts are totally pretty totally accessible the Oracle is our solution powering how we resolve disputes so what we wanted to talk about is this idea of adding an economic incentives to so it's a useful analogy and again guess what giving is like pretty theoretical sort of you don't like to sleep deprived some of this might be but ask questions these pulmonology here's to think about contracts in the other world so spending in obvious legal contracts are really useful they let us build our modern financial system they depend on counterparties believing in the contract and the reference data cannot be manipulated so here we've got just a theoretical example of Alice and Bob they write a potential contract for a million bucks and it depends on some price of some external reference they're both happy to do this under the state of Massachusetts law because they believe mostly that the court system the scene in Massachusetts can be crowded and there's laws in the yellow secret news both this concept of laws against fraud of manipulation that we needed Bob here tried to go and write the data source for this contract he's given go to jail and you literally like think about that economically as having a huge economic cost to attend private colleges so the problem or really the opportunity is in the watching world there is no concept of pride in this pseudo anonymous permissionless watching system like ethereal there's no laws against bottle bribery you can think of that actually is that a teacher not above but it means that there's nothing to prevent fog and corrupting and Oracle system or D levels and so what that means is the Bob can totally go ahead and ride and we should think about this this scale is to be a really big problem so we had this million dollar theoretical contrast to Allison Bob engine to where Bob can steal happening during Lincoln's co-founder grant if you were to drop this water system but now scale that up and Bob Suter anonymous you know who he is and you read contracts with Fred whatever right and now of a sudden she steal two half million dollars by corrupting this internal price reference and of course the scales to unlimited size so Bob can theoretically had a massive incentive for trucking absorbances so our point here of all this is that in permissionless blockchain like aetherium private economic incentives are the only told me I have to incentivize behavior if we're not going to go back and so that's why we argue that economic guarantees here matter in order to be able to trust the smart contract that relies on opportunity puts is gonna do what it says it's gonna do we need to somehow prove that there is no economic incentive to corrupt the Oracle or the Press reference so far so get through this is tough the chain link chain link is great for a second like that I'm just talking with different types of Oracle systems here there's other systems that are really usable providing constant API programmatic API access what we're talking about it's a little bit different we're talking about something that it's like more is super net more expensive but you really guaranteed so okay how do we build have any billing oracle will be coming guarantees so we define this concept of an honest Oracle and there's two sort of sub concepts here we start with this idea that any Oracle on a blockchain is profitable because our only tool is private economic incentives to incentivize behavior it means that there is always some amount of money that can pay somebody on some watch-chain system or off change price or whatever to corrupt it and so we define then that the lowest cost at which you can drop the system we define that as our cosmic corruption separately if you were to corrupt this Oracle system there's all these contracts and all this value theoretically linked to it what is the maximum profit what is the configuration of the universe in which you could steal the most money can we define that as our and then produce together we have our kind of definition of what in a historical website and on historical is one where you can prove that the caustic company's Oracle system is always greater than the profit you could make it work across so this does depend there's rational and actually get really nerdy per second you can make an argument that say Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan doesn't like this ginger finance world and so he spends 50 million bucks to get all my clothes they are right and that actually might be rational but the this is actually Albert mentioned this and that prisoner's dilemma and turn into the iterative game it doesn't make sense anymore because this is just gonna pop back up and Jamie Dimon can pay 50 million bucks every time to shut it down so ultimately rational economic incentives you can make an argument will win out in the end yeah anything else guys so okay just to explain this concept is a little diagram here so al-shabab have their million dollar contract the profit interruption is how much money you can steal from this contract if you could control the press input in this example Bob can steal half of the contract but that's not a number our cost of corruption is whatever we call Bob to go and bribe external price reference to two promises okay so then how do we go about actually building this Oracle with economic guarantees it is three-step process create a system to measure this cost of corruption create a system to measure the corruption and the design I'm keeping this high-level about lots of wait wait deeper in the resources and can run deeper on this with a high level of how we do these three things so we measure our cost of corruption in tradable voting rights so here we have a token where token holders have voting right their voting powers way to positive retro things that have and we use a Shelby point style system where voters vote on price requests or prejudice beans here and they're paid a reward for voting correctly voting that the majority they're trying to penalty for not to gain through behind this is that it's like the 51% attack on people work networks as long as it is an honest majority the system will go result record which allows us then to measure our cost of corruption our cost of corruption is whatever it costs to buy 51% not exactly right so this gets really interesting here to where if you could borrow big 41 51 percent of the voting power that you win for sure but then you got to think through what the economic incentives of the lenders of the weights are if you're lending your voting rights here it's not like like you're lending something really valuable so you really should be very very fearful of lending your voting rights to the wrong person because if you lend them really cheap then someone can corrupt this thing and this building right that you have that was valuable goes to zero so but it's like a really interesting line of thinking about like okay what happens if people do lend their voting rights majority majority rules which is also a really interesting question right it's like you get like really philosophical like what is the truth here the truth is whatever the majority says yeah yeah really oh stop it but it's an interesting question when you actually think through like like some kind of real-world examples that are kind of funded because remember the coin base flash crashing right where actually well the price dropped like like 50% these sets of flash crashes happen in like other traditional financial markets - do you consider that a good price or not like did did that is that price considered accurate or not and the interest depends right so like the see me when this happened with traditional futures contracts they decide whether they want to honor those prices and consider that we or not in this case if you think about it from this context whether that happens or not second part measuring our profit from project so when we go back to the individual contract it's easy on an individual contract to figure out what the proper instruction is how much money could get stolen out of that contract if an attacker were to control this price B so our system-wide cough extortion corruption number simply sums all of the contracts using the system and it's like a worst case analysis in the worst case how much money could be drained in order for us to measure that contracts have to register in the or to allow us to calculate the system it is a super interesting it's really cool but we have a theoretical solution in the early days yeah this whole concept of measuring our profit impression if premise on the fact that we know what's using consistent if we don't know what's using the system and you can then make an argument we'll wait if there is a cost producing the system but but then people don't have to tell us they're using it well then there's an incentive to parasitical use the system auger and it kind of introduced eternally so there's no audience eternity where if the parasites get too big they kill the host we again do have a solution for how we can absolutely [Music] okay so we got part one done we can measure our cost of corruption got part two we can measure our profit production powering this Paris any question ready part three how do we enforce this inequality where we make sure that the cost of corrupting system is greater than what you could steal and we do this with what we're calling a variable V policy or very good tax policy where if and when the caustic parking system approaches the floor so basically as that inequality gets threatened we levy attacks on the users of our system so these are on the contracts using the system in charge from the feed and we use that feed to purchase the voting rights in the open market to support the market cap of the casa project and because we do this programmatically on the blockchain it's completely credible and you know it's point a happen so we have a very cool circular effect right we're actually users of the system the reporting speculators if they see this inequality getting threatened they know that this market force is going to comment start buying tokens so arguably you can maybe you can you can think of third party speculators having a free option as a market price approaches this floor that's the probably the funkiest part we'll go in a bit more detail on it but that's like the high level yeah no I don't think so so there's this um going on fun thank you but this from a business perspective you think of a lot of the business residues they try to like maximize profitability right they want to create the most money possible and in that case they might issue shares or something if like their share price is really high that your try to like raise money or something like that right in our case what's really interesting is we are not trying to maximize profit we are only trying to ensure this inequality stays in check so it's like we want to make sure that we we're gonna charge enough we're gonna charge enough fees to make sure this inequality stays in check but no more and actually it's kind of really interesting this is a fun  about this like you're watching crypto stuff like it's a fun and interesting weird business model think about it wait hey you're trying to make enough money just to guarantee the security system but you're not trying to extract write a fast life alright there's some math here you guys wanna go than that yeah all right so to measure the cost of corruption an attacker must control half of all participating tokens so what I mean by participating tokens is if there's a lot of voting rights out there that aren't going right they don't actually secure the system so we have this in a parameter is just the percentage of non participating targets so our Y value here is the number of token rights that half of the participating tokens spot that an attacker would need to control the crumple system then our cost of corruption is then the the price at which it costs to buy these tokens we call that our caustic rupture this is actually pretty simple this is just what I said in words measuring our proper compression is simply the summation of all individual contracts from the corruption numbers and that gives us our system-wide key ste remember then we rearrange and solve for this inequality so we put those two things together and we solve for the price of the token that needs to be maintained to keep the system secure under this caustic Russian proper eruption and basically what it's saying is we need twice the profit of Russian divided by the participating supply and if you just to put some real-world numbers around this if we assume that the token of the contracting system are symmetric so let's say we have going back to the Bob house example we have that million dollar contract let's say we have a hundred million dollars of contracts in the system total margin in the system at any given point in time to the profit production manipulating box half the dollar the system which means we need the cost of half of the voting rights to be more than 50 million dollars multiply everything by 2 we need the market calculus voting rates to be greater than the total margin nurses this is a short presentation so I go how do we and then I add this last thing we create like a buffer so we call it a safe price as a bumper above this for us okay so then how do we maintain the same target this is just through this programmatic buyback so every period every voting period we calculate what our target price is by observing the system-wide copy corruption we look at what the current price is the market cap is if the system is below where it should be we levy attacks we calculate the fee we need to keep the system secure we love the attacks in the conduct of my back and we do this repeatedly this is like simple Bank contain and currency thing we do this repeatedly and programmatically more math but what's really cool about this so this what this actually looks like is sort of a perverted discounted cash flow model for traditional like companies where the value of a company's stock at any given point is the markets expectation of all future dividends in this model the value of our voting token is the markets expectation of all future buybacks of all teacher taxes and what's really cool about that is that in the early days of the system when there is growth expected and use of the auricle the market will put the price based on that expectation above the floor above where it should be which means that in the early days of the system its costless to use the or of the system where as long as there's an expectation of growth it's cost less to use it that we think is kind of cool and kind of wild we were actually able to use economic incentive were actually able to use the expectation of injured by box to subsidize the cost of using the Oracle system all right so where are we in implementation we have a white paper that's out this this whole presentation does is linked in the discord channel and elsewhere and it's all on our github there's a tweet storm that you guys can check out it summarizes some of these concepts and it goes through what I've talked about here we would love feedback on this white paper and feedback on the mechanism and like critiques on this whole way of thinking about the world we also have our code out and it's on test net it's all up it's live but we've actually built this thing it is DeWine right it doesn't do every is it doesn't have all of our teacher said but this is more than theoretical and again we love any feedback or critique on it and then yeah these are the four of us that are here come find us and talk to us about this remember we're here actually doing the the more concrete day you've got this synthetic token thing right where you can go and use our system our infrastructure bill isn't that it token to track the world assets this is an example of a use case of defy use case that then plugs into our corner backyard so this whole talk is about the theoretical Oracle and that's it and actually I think I sort of fall in time mostly so yeah oh yeah how are you making money off of this thing I mean we in crypto forum we don't want to have a business we just want to own some of the total supply so the whole premise of this is that devoting tokens should be valuable if we can make this Oracle be useful as this disappear resolution mechanism this Oracle last resort that is truly decentralized if we can make that a useful thing these voting tokens will ability and so we actually want to provide a lot of for free a lot of it's just opening contributions specifically when it comes to financial contract infrastructure so stuff that just uses meets some horrible we want to buy that all for free like our synthetic token at synthetic tokenization contracts and and other things pureed out of the intention that means D by contracts that defy will grow and will use and our Oracle increasing yeah so that would one path to profitability to set up a consortium or join one or basically like the mass like a mass that saying that it's ten members and then try to get them in on this document right away in some weird poster slash whatever it's called try to bring some of those contracts that change maybe so to give everybody else in context like is that stands for International Swaps and Derivatives Association they are like the main Association that actually writes the legal templates for institutional derivative papers I think it's interesting right but I frankly a waste much more interested in the grassroots approach where traditional institutional derivatives work well right they work well enough if you've got five million bucks and you want to like trade Shaco for it ready we're really much more interested in bringing creating a system or putting this deep i thing where if you think about what our name is universal market access we're much more interested in how we can create synthetic financial contracts for this global financial infrastructure and this is a grassroots de Soto key distribution like we're not we're not doing some like crazy token launch pretending is very organically and the spread listo consider two people that will go to the one thing we care a lot about is voter participation so we want these tokens to being spread far and wide and pretty organically in pretty grassroots eat and frankly I think it is a long long way before institutional counterparties care about doing something for you this part another person so this they admitted to what they presidency but they found so the outline building the demand for the token but under what conditions are you you're gonna sell this how's it work do you have anything is Excel took it if it to balance these the cost and the profit are you selling back in any point in time kind of like in an equally agreement in future yeah you need the D return like what is it talking associate you know what you're worried about the cost being less than the profit right so you buy right to make it more expensive yeah probably system did visit working the other way that's interesting so I we don't think it needs to because in the other way basically if the token value is trading way above where it leads to that should be market expectations of like introduces and the whole thing which means it's more secure right now what I care a little bit about is like great bit speculoos ain't gotta speculation like that kind of that's sort of bad but I think we just use words and rhetoric to kind of temper people's expectations so there's always been mine to look in essentially yeah there's like a fix this is like a food supply yeah so um there's a few different implementations what we do right here is there's basically like I notice it's almost like consider like a tax notice that the way the interface for contract season you articles written we want to be able to go and collect those taxes like close to real time basis but in all honesty this isn't at all like totally finalized or settled so it's still sort of it there's a few different possible implementations and frankly we lucky
