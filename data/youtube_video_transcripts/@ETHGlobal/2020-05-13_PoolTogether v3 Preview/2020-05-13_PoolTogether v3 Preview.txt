be good to just get some inputs to you where the audience is that I'd be most interested in your story of how you career okay that's one voice second okay awesome kind of features so we'll the main features ooh they're gonna be fairly distinct so I think like the first 15 minutes will be about more about how it grew and then like will transition more so to like the nitty gritty of the features and like we have we have a demo to share we have some alpha documentation to share so if you are more interested in the features and not really interested in the story at all you could also kind of just zone out a little bit for the first 15 minutes I know this is vana I'm interested in the story and curious to see what you present it the first time in like a slide or something like the first time we ever pitched pool together yeah be really amazing to see that journey the story is important Jenny yeah I definitely I definitely have some slides for that yeah for sure Trent just let me know when I should get started I can start sharing my screen for sure yeah we'll get it like I said a few more minutes to just let people trickle in I think I think the live stream should be good Andrews giving me some nods yeah it's gone so yeah well we'll drop those some of the stream links around and then maybe two or three more minutes oh so this is like live streaming out to Twitter right now and stuff yeah yeah it's on Twitter it's on YouTube but but this is where the action is everybody here you get the the personal interactions yep this is where people hopefully can ask questions we can get in and so we'll also ask questions after each section so we'll have a little section on like you na just about kind of the story section and then Q&A more unlike the v3 and the features come in yeah you can um you can share your screen if you wanted to put up that like initial slide well I'll do that make sure that's all working and then you've got the right set of slides yeah I think I do the only issue is I can't see our chat window so people Trent you always have to tell me yeah for sure and as is tradition feel free to leave here your local time in the chat who's up latest to join this yeah that's a fun idea I like that wooof Rosh Hashanah 3:00 a.m. oh wow I think that way that might win there's no way to verify this but people trust you we need foam for this right if only oh yeah old oz the opposite side mm-hmm only uh 1:00 p.m. I'm in New York City quarantine I mean all you guys are probably in quarantine somewhere but yeah I feel like the quarantine New York cities may be a little bit more stringent than some other places this is murder but you are worth it from the chat Wow never felt more loved if someone's willing to come to your live stream at 3:00 a.m. what's good you got something special your questions get priority yeah all right I think we're uh we're good at the live streams are going we've got Suites out awesome take it away cool so yeah in case you guys missed it basically two parts to this kind of presentation today one is going to be basically how do we take pool together from a hackathon project to a you know protocol that's being used by a lot of people and raise venture capital so I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to most about that and then we're also going to talk about kind of future pool together in the v3 for for pool together and Brendan's going to talk most about that he's gonna share some stuff for the very first time some Elfa documentation some demo stuff that's on test nets it should be pretty fun but the pretty sorry I just took my I had my notes on my iPad I just ripped it over there pretty yeah give me once again they're pretty they're pretty disparate kind of talks but yeah so and we'll take a QA after each every section so just give me one second it fits this okay so first very first before we jump to the story just in case anyone doesn't know what is pulled together and pulled together is a prize savings protocol for aetherium or built on ethereum and if you don't know what price savings are it's a really interesting concept basically it's a Stevens account where you don't earn any interest like a normal statement account but instead of earning it not instead of earning interest you have a chance a reoccurring chance to win prizes every day month week year depending on how the prize savings product is structured so just wanted a level set I assume most you guys know what pooled the other is but that's the very first part so that's what pool together is it's a protocol for prize savings on aetherium so then let me hop into kind of back story of how we got to where we are today and I think hopefully my goal in sharing this is that it's really encouraging for people on this call because pool together started oh oh yeah Trent was super generous he said the subtitle I think for this talk was like turning your hackathon projects into a defy juggernaut and I was like nice I've never thought about of well together as a dpi juggernut but I like I like that Trent Trent said that so anyways how do you how do you take your hackathon product akin to a dpi juggernaut and yes I just want to share some some lessons from our story and again just ask questions didn't go through so our story starts in January 2019 that was when I first had the idea for pool together and I think this is kind of important is like the IDE we started working on pool together for the first time assirram Denver in February 20 19 so a little over a year ago but I do think it's worth noting that like the idea preceded that and I think that's the reason I think that's worth noting is that ideas do matter right and like what you're working on does matter and I think the first step to building a successful hackathon project that you can then turn into an actual protocol is to work on an idea you have a good rational reason to believe can be a big idea where the you know with with a market size big enough to be a protocol and so um the idea for a price savings account came from basically just looking at price savings accounts that were all over the world already in normal Fiat world and seeing how popular they are seeing that no one had ever done one on aetherium and then doing that aetherium so anyways that's the idea so then East Denver is when I first started working on pulled together and at the time at during that hackathon weekend I worked with two other people who haven't worked on the project sense but they they worked with me at Denver and I think that the good thing to capture from each Denver is like we didn't get we like we didn't even get in the top 20 teams that use Denver so I think the thing I want to share from that is like don't get discouraged if you're hackathon project doesn't actually get any initial recognition so the start of pulled together was was pitching at Denver and it had a good reception to the pitch worked on it that weekend but the judges weren't as keen about it and yeah we didn't even get in the top 20 teams out of like 40 teams so it wasn't in the top fifty percent so left eighth Denver but I personally still really want to work on the project and I met Brendan and Chuck who became my co-founders and Brendan's gonna talk of this call at the end of youth Denver at the happy hour at the very end and basically decided to work with them on continuing the project and so we spent one week and we built a rinkeby prototype for pool together so you know and honestly we got to the end of this week and I was kind of I was pretty discouraged I was like this does not live up to like the product that I wanted to be this does not have like the UI that I want this does not have like it doesn't catch the value proposition but I was like okay I kind of thought about just like shelving it and just being like okay this is done but I was like I'm just gonna try and post it on the maker Dow reddit and so this was the post I put on makers now reddit and this is like the only thing we did to like launch the rinkeby prototype and I basically like no loss lottery with die shared the project and it got some good reactions right you got like 99 up sixty-eight comments so it was like a pretty popular idea and because I posted this I got connected with rich maker Dow and they gave us a fifteen thousand dollar about a grant to bring it to Maine that and they also paid for our audit and I also got connected because I posted this on reddit to Dan Elliott sugar at idea Cola ventures who became our lead investor so I think the reason I say this is like um you never know like what impact taken the next step might have like you can think like Oh posting it on reddit like that's not gonna really help me grow this project but the reality is if I had to post this to Reddit I never would have got we we never would have gotten that grant from maker we would never we wouldn't have met Dan we wouldn't have gotten like our lead investor and so like I would just really encourage you guys to take the next step with your projects even if it doesn't seem like it's going to lead to something you don't know what it will lead to so so that got us to our prototype launch which is in June so we posted on reddit the rinkeby prototype that got us enough leverage to get the 15k grant that funded us to get the prototype launched in June and the prototype launch was really good I would say so we got like we were like top of product hunt that day we had a lot of like Twitter influencers talking about it at the time we didn't know what crypto Twitter was but it kind of it definitely became a thing and so that gave us a lot of momentum and this is what that first site looked like what I'm calling like the prototype of the main net prototype so it was the same core idea it was implemented in like a really clunky way so like basically I don't necessarily to go into all in anybody but basically it's like the same core idea is what we have right now but implemented in a in a very in a kind of clunky way that was optimized for like speed and we took two weeks to build this prototype so one week on the rinkeby prototype two weeks on the main net plus you know plus the audit so just to give you a sense of like how much time we were spending so this is very much like a fine product market fit and then like build rather than like build and then try and find product market fit so launching though this prototype is what got us further market validation which led to a lot like once we launched in it we had a lot of like the C's reach now and being like hey want to talk and like a lot of other projects and a lot of other people in the crypto space just kind of gave us like a name in the crypto space and that basically allowed us gave us like the momentum to get another grant from maker which was even bigger I think it was 30 or 40 thousand so we've got an additional thirty four thousand grant from maker to improve basically the implementation make a better implementation of this and it also gave us a momentum to meet with investors and ultimately to raise the 1.3 million dollars that we raised so basically that prototype launch took us to what I call the product launch September 2019 and that's what we have today so what we launched in September 9 2019 like from a core infrastructure perspective is the same thing that we're running on right now and it's been quite successful I would say it's you know we paid out 21,000 in prizes to people who have saved their money we have you know we just share this day yesterday which i think is cool of there's more wallets holding pool together die than compound die which is obviously like it's a great step for compound to because like that means people are building big things on top of their platform but yeah so that so that really got us where we are today and now what we're really looking to do is make this oh and sorry this is our this is our so this is like our current our current website um but now what we're really looking to do what will kind of transition to with the preview of the v3 is is really try to transition pool together with a v3 to be truly a protocol and not a product and the difference between like product and protocol I think is definitely it's definitely continuum but in our mind like what makes a something to protocol versus a product is the decentralization of that thing and also the extensibility of it right so right now pool together it's fairly you can build stuff on top of pool together as is and the codes open-source but you're you're limited you're pretty limited and what we've really wanted to do is basically define what's the core value proposition of the pool together protocol and then what are all the things that developers can play with and the core value proposition of the pool together protocol is this price savings idea right no Austin deposited funds full liquidity and a chance to win prizes so anything built on the pool together protocol needs to maintain those characteristics but there's a lot of other characteristics like the price frequency is it every day is it every hour is every year the price strategy which is like is there one winner is there ten winners just have to half the price go to charity just half the prize does a hundred percent the prize go to charity you know there's all these different things like the prize distribution strategy and then there's also these other things like where is the interest Drive front right like you can't multiple interest sources you know there's obviously more protocols than just compound so where's the interest drive from how is randomness Drive etc and those are the the tools that were giving developers with v3 that these things will be static right everything built and pull together will keep these seem core characteristics but developers will be able to build things on top of cool together that have all sorts of unique pry strategies or frequencies or interest bearing interest bearing methods etc so anyways that's kind of me transitioning for Brendon so let's pause here though before we talk more about v3 and all that and like let's go back to like questions about this story of pooled together I was trying to give you context for how we got to where we are right now and but yeah let's pause and and I'll talk about if anyone has question on the story pool together and and then we'll transition to Brennan and he'll dive more into this p3 stuff so do you want to go ahead and ask yeah sure hey Layden I remember hearing like when pulled together launched and I was really impressed by it like what good ideas are hard to come by at what was like the inspiration or like the thought process that went into pull together you said that you were thinking about it for a while just like curious to hear about how you came towards the idea of creating like was it a product at that time where was it were you already thinking about like making it into a protocol I think are already thinking about making a protocol so it's a really good question so I definitely was spent like months kind of thinking and researching on this and basically the starting point was like how can you build a financial tool that helps people achieve economic mobility and economic mobility right is this idea that people are able to move up and down income brackets like you don't you don't live and die in the same income bracket you don't you don't die in the same income bracket you're born in so like a healthy society has high economic mobility meaning like if you're poor you can become rich and so I started with like historically speaking what has helped people what has helped of society have higher economic economic mobility so I was looking at like the invention of the stock market the invention of the limited liability company the invention of the bond market credit cards etc and so I started thinking like oh maybe I'll do like well yeah so basically to have economic mobility you need to have a valujet you need to have a value generating an asset you need to be able to own something that creates value even if you're not working right that's the whole idea of like you're not just trading hours for money but the problem is most people in the world don't have any capital so they can't buy a value generating an asset to begin with and so if you want to help people achieve economic mobility you have to give them a way to get a value generating asset and to do that they have to have capital so you have to start with savings so that was really the the logic that got me to prized savings as a mechanism of helping people save more money by basically incorporating human psychology into savings so this is probably that's a long answer but I don't it says if you don't have enough capital to begin with there's you're not you're not really gonna be able to win the lottery and and move up in mobility so how does that how does that work with like if you have a very small amount of capital how can you actually win and be able to move up well the the idea more for pool together is that people will the winning is a bonus that some people will get but it's more so that like it incentivizes you to save over time and then you can take your money out and put it into other things that have yeah more traditional investment assets like stocks or bonds or bonds or things like that but until you have like free money you can't until you have like excess capital and your savings you can't you just can't do that I mean like Mark said we did have we did have like one winner that had ten ten ten died in the pool and they won like sixteen hundred dollars so for sure that does happen and that's like this that's like the awesome awesome story you want to tell but but that's how we think about it is like the winnings kind of like the bonus it's the incentive to get them to say to get people to save cool thanks yeah any other questions on the story doesn't I'm just looking to chat here a question on randomness maybe we could maybe we could address that into features or the v3 section yeah so I one question I had is like how long did it take you to settle on like your plan was it was it always sort of in flux or did you guys sort of have a point where you decided it after the hackathon like this is the system real potential or at what point like was that milestone reached where you're like alright we're going to commit to this and we're gonna kind of build it out as much as we can it was definitely an iterative thing so we weren't like we weren't thinking of it as a full-time project until like July like of 2019 so like after the prototype launched so we were it was it was it continued to so yeah so he's definitely iterative and it was definitely like okay what can we get done in one week of time and like let's do that launch that what can we get done in two more weeks let's do that launch that and then it was after the success I would say afterwards that after the success that we had with the initial main net launch that's remember like okay we really feel like this has been fully validated we really want to spend her all of our time doing this but yeah there was you know we were working on it for six months before that happened for seven months right yeah the other interesting thing that you pointed out was you didn't you didn't come in the top-ranking at the hackathon thank you mom said you were you were pretty low on the list but it just kind of proves that just because you don't necessarily obviously we want all of the hack money projects and any any event that we have we want people to be successful and feel passionate about what they've built but just because you may not have had a super successful event that doesn't mean that you can't take it and continue building afterwards we're sure yeah yeah so that's hopefully a good encouragement for people Vanessa did you get I know you said you're Vanessa you said you were specifically interested in the question or in the story I if you have any questions let me know on the story forward transition yeah how does pool together make money I can answer this real quick well maybe talk a little bit about it with v3 we don't make money that's why we raised that's why we raised money from venture capital I think like we don't know how we will make money I think I think that our general thesis though is like were we're super early and defy and if we can figure out a way to create a lot of value for a lot of people then there'll be a way to capture some of that not sure what that would look like obviously like we're seeing a lot of examples with how unit swap with how compound is well I guess some more unit swap compound hasn't done this but at least you know swap or even even like are they with their with their land token which I don't actually understand full economics to that but there's there's people who are there's pathways that are emerging to how to monetize these things but that's simply not a primary Frosch yeah let's let's actually some of these questions are getting more than B 3 so let's transition to B 3 and then we'll and then wall on and then if there's if those questions are still outstanding let's uh we can we can take those that sound good Trent yeah perfect all right Brendan you went ruin away excuse me let me clear my throat yeah been quiet for too long thanks Leighton thanks for that intro that was great and and thanks Trent for having this having us I'm really excited to be here especially because I'm very I'm very excited about presenting the v3 and what we have coming up because like Layton said it's been a very iterative path so we began with a very simple prototype that we built in a week and Layton there's only so much you can build in a week so I know it wasn't necessarily up to your standards but then the the following iteration was much more of a product and we emphasize security and simplicity for us both for the users and for ourselves and so that's one reason why the random number generation was totally centralized it was small enough prizes that it didn't matter and it also meant that it was very simple to use there was no commit reveal there was no complexity to it there was merely a deposit and a withdrawal especially once we implemented the kind of deposit and then you're eligible for all subsequent prizes that was a really great feature that we added but that being said we do want to transition to a protocol we do want to make it so that anyone can spin up their own pools they can run their own tests and it becomes a more extensible system so let me let me bring up my slides I have a few slides in trowing us and then I want to give a demo and then talk a little about the vision so let's this is a little bit new to me so bear with me let's pull up keynote hit play come you'll see great okay so so at version 3.0 it begins the transition to a protocol and a big part of that was the ability for anyone to create their own pool and the reason that's really important is because it means that there's no administrator we didn't want anyone to be have any special privileges when using the pool because that would mean that they would have some degree of control over it whether it's upgrading the pool to essentially take custody if they want or if it was manipulating the entropy so they could actually effectively select the winner so there's a couple of things we're doing for this new version while we're not going a hundred percent autonomous we're going to make sure that the users principle is in a non upgradeable escrow contract so that means it's not going to be there's no way anyone else can have access to it at least after audit will make sure that everything's tickety-boo the other aspect of that is the administrator and the all the administrator did was enter the random number and then select the winner essentially they push the prize button which used the random number to pick the winner so what we're doing is we're exploring different RNG options for decentralisation and one of them was actually announced last night was channeling they've implemented a vr F and the VR F has some really great properties essentially it allows you to derive entropy from someone's cryptographic signature with a few extra little bits to make sure that there's only one unique signature for that particular piece of seed value that they're signing so we're excited to introduce this as well as PDFs and other instruments that are coming online and so that part of the protocol will be upgradeable we don't want to swap the RNG because that is still a moving target right now and so what we're gonna do is mitigate trust mitigate the risk to just the interest on the pool and so we feel that a good halfway point the other part of a decentralisation is the the administrator excuse me no I covered that so extensibility is much more interesting so ever since we began this we've got we've gotten requests from people there are people talking about philanthropy philanthropic pools so when you deposit the interest actually goes to an organization maybe UNICEF maybe the etherium foundation and we've also had people asking we have multiple winners they want many different ways to award the prize and additionally we've had many different requests to have a different interest source whether it's say for example Ave or any other alternative to compound so we're building the protocols such that those pieces are very swappable especially in light of becoming more decentralized it makes it easier to open it up to people with certain precautions to make sure that it can't be manipulated because we do want to make it such that if someone creates a pool together pool they have a guaranteed minimum of security we don't want it to be manipulable in any way and the other piece that we're really excited about is onboarding so pulled together from the beginning has been seen as a very awesome onboarding tool because people just understand the idea rights and savings accounts are very old idea and it's a very intuitive idea to people I can explain it to my 80 year old uncle and he knew he understood the mechanism essentially a big problem though with adapts these days is gas and fiat onboarding and so fiat onboarding is seeing some solutions like wire like moon pay these payment gateways that are really simplifying the KYC in terms of gas we are seeing some really awesome solutions we really hold Dharma and high regard for the custom smart contract wallet they've implemented so we'd love to see something like that for us and so we have integrated the open GSN version two into the pool together 3.0 contracts so what that means is that we have full meta transaction support across all functions which eventually will mean that will able to have a very simple front end where we cover the gas as part of our again we don't have a way to make profits so we're just gonna keep making things as simple as possible you know that's that's a future problem to have and so in this way our focus 43.0 will be decentralisation extensibility and onboarding we really want to try to keep things simple I do see notifications pop up I'll try to address any questions after after I talk just want to keep keep rolling here but let's talk about some fun stuff so in terms of extensions one of the most exciting things were going to present to our users 43.0 is the pod Factory so we did deliver pods for 2.0 but it was a single pod it was very much it was very much an experiment we wanted to introduce a way for people to have a spectrum of choice between pure chance and a maximum prize and interest there's a whole range of exposure you might want to chance in that regard between those two polar opposites and so the pods is a very interesting mechanism that allows you to start to play with that spectrum and we didn't do the factory at first because we wanted to do it very simply and very quickly it's it's gotten a full audit so this code is fairly secure as far as we you know not no hacks have happened yet but with 3.0 because of the simple simplification of the token model oh yeah that's another 3.0 benefit but I've been really I think that but the pod Factory will be very easy to do it's 3.0 and so we're excited about delivering that something else that we've heard from a few people mostly in terms of the ability to easily track who owns what tickets is the idea of binding tickets to entities this is a very neat idea and I was referred by a friend to a project called charged particles that captured this for DSR for the for essentially for chime and so the fellow behind that Rob Secord I'm also really happy to announce that he's now part of our team so we're really excited to onboard rope over the next week yeah well whoo yeah he's awesome and he's gonna make a great addition the team so really excited about that and yes let's let's just go straight into the demo so give me bear with me a moment while I while I switch context here you just bump out of here and hit a browser so like we mentioned what we're really excited about is allowing people to build and test their own pools of course we're still gonna be running our quote/unquote main pool but we really want to start building this app as a protocol as a platform for anyone to use that has a certain amount of flexibility so as part of the v3 alpha launch we've launched a prize pool builder and so you can find this tool and build it up pull together calm and it allows you to spin up your own pools bonnachoven and so here you can select between dime or USD see Brendan I'm still seeing slides maybe it was bound to the window rather than the here let me just stop sharing and share again this is what I was worried about it just can't go perfectly cannon there's only something ok can we see everything yes great ok so so yeah this is our prize pool builder so we can see that you can select the token to use right now it's currently bonded to our bond to compound so we're still attached to compound for the time being that's gonna be a slower process we believe because we want to minimize risk we want to make sure that were we're binding it to protocols that have proven to be secure but we are planning to introduce more acute in the future and now you get to select the prize distribution strategy so this is a point of extensibility that we're really excited about because right now pulled together as a single random winner one person gets chosen but what if we could choose 10 what if we could choose 8 and then have a fraction of that go towards some philanthropic cause there is a probably the biggest prize link savings account in the world is the UK premium bonds and while winners receive a lot of the prize money a large fraction goes towards the government to fund public service and so there's there's all sorts of different things you can do by implementing a custom price strategy that we're really excited about so here we're selecting and so here if you select a custom price strategy you can enter the address of the contract I'll show you the documentation on that after but so if we go with a single random winner winter let's say a price period of 60 seconds and sure you know pins there's the sponsorship token so that's the token that such that you aren't eligible to win but you contribute to the prize and then there's the ticket and so here he'd name the ticket so let's let's create a prize pool demo time everyone cross your fingers fortunately it's covin so I think it has fairly fast confirmation times so they should pop up in just a moment and this UI was built by Chuck who I believe is also on the call another slick UI very excited I was expecting to build a prototype this turns out to be much more polished so so now the contracts have been created and now we open the pool in our reference front front end and so this reference front end is going to be made available to everyone so we wanted to get four two we wanted to get customized we want everyone to be able to have access to be able to build their own front end so far we've kept our front end pretty tight because we actually have had clones in the past and so we're very concerned about phishing attempts and so we've kept that pretty tight on our end but this reference front end we want to make sure that it gets opened up to the community and you can see here we have all the stats that we want to see you've got the ability to deposit and withdraw and also wants this reward of all times down to zero anyone can hit reward and so this is the sort of decentralized component that we're really excited about is that anyone can keep the pool going it doesn't need any administrator so this is going to be just leaps and bounds beyond what we have now so so that's a quick little demo I'll make sure that you guys have links to that after the call ends and now I'll just quickly show you the documentation so these Doc's so you go dark stuff pulled earlier pull together calm these are the 3.0 Docs so these do not apply to the current system we are releasing these to help encourage people to start building early ons that we can actually iterate with your feedback because we want to make this as easy to use as possible so here we cover the the builders themselves you can actually access them on chain if you want we cover the prize pool itself so you can actually look through all the different functions that you need to call fYI the token model is much simpler so when you mint tickets they are minted right away this is a pretty critical difference from me too as well but it's a little less less known I guess because people tend to just deposit it to pull together and just you know be done with it but in reality we want to simplify that as much as possible as well so again I'll add that link to the to the chat channel so you guys can see after if anybody wants to start building on it and and so I just want to close by talking about the sort of long-term vision of where we want to go with this protocol because is we kind of alluded to this with a decentralization but we just really want to reinforce this in the sense that our long-term vision for pulled together is for it to be community owned and governed that's the whole purpose of a protocol it essentially gets turned into I want to say public service but it's almost like a company that anyone can be a part of it's it's like you know it's not only just public trading but it's also just in anyone can engage with it so we've really that's that's our long-term goal and short term what we're gonna try to start doing is progressively increase community engagement so we want to start a involving people in developing bits and pieces of protocol so start you know farming that out to people who are really interested in it as well as we have a really interesting mechanism that we're developing but it's still kind of in the process but we want to essentially build loyalty tokens into the protocol such that if you've used pool together for a long time you just accrue tokens that could eventually be used for different parameters different ways to engage with the protocol so that's something that we're getting started with it's a little bit under wraps so I can't say too about it at the moment but I just wanted to throw it out there because we are thinking about it and it is really important to us so so that pretty much wraps it up open to any questions about v3 or about the protocol in general anything technical I think there was something mentioned about the orangey and I'm happy to answer that so let me just pop out of screen sharing so I can so I can see everybody okay so let's have a look at the chat here um it looks like I believe the orange e was the first question so let's dig into that a little how we did it previously was we literally generated a random number ourselves and submitted to the contract in v3 we're exploring a couple different ways of adding random numbers but what's available right now which were very really excited about is the chain link vrf and how this works is it essentially allows an operator to off train operator to sign a piece of data that we determine on Ching and they don't control what they can sign and they can't actually control the signature because they've already committed to what their signature is and then they submit the signed data on chain which we can then consume as a random number it does have a few drawbacks in that there's potential for griefing so we're looking into additional RNG sources such as a PDF PDFs are slowly coming online it's actually the same technology used for 2.0 is being brought into 1.0 so we're really excited to see how that plays out but it is evolving and it will continue to evolve with the next couple months so that will be a slight moving target for us but we do have some really great options now so it's only going to improve which we're really excited about so let's have another look at this so a c1 from current it's just the last one how long was your team familiar with crypto before it's starting to venture well let's go back a little bit to Layton's narrative so I can tell my half of that so for about maybe a year and a half for maybe almost two years before that I was running a dev shop called Delta camp with Chuck who's also on this call Chuck is the the design front-end half I'm the smart contract side and so we were doing work for open Zeppelin we were doing work for medics protocol and then we did some work for Layton and Layton Layton's work this this this idea really blew up and we were super excited to jump on board with it in fact actually late now I want to go back to that night because it was the Thursday night at East Denver where it was the pitch event and I actually since then I'm sort of disappointed that there haven't been other pitch nights but this one in particular was great because it was in the big castle space if anyone's been there and it was each hacker went up and on the microphone discussed the idea that they had and then they would organically form into groups after and lame idea and I just loved it so I made sure to to just stay in touch with them throughout the event and then and I'm so glad that we ended up getting together because I think it's a really exciting product I think it's going to be so good for onboarding once we simplify some of these gasps issues so so yeah we've been working in crypto for a couple years professionally before that in previous to that Chuck was involved in I guess speculating you know buying and selling crypto I think my my real entry into either I think I first bought East maybe two and a half years ago three years ago something like that so yeah that's how long I've been I've been involved so I do see another question so don't have to wait until the next round to be eligible when you deposit exactly so let's talk a little bit about the new ticket model so previously previously we wanted to prevent people from gaming the system by ensuring that everyone has had their deposit in pool together for a minimum length of time and so that's why when you deposited it took a week until those were eventually minted into tickets so that everyone had a kind of minimum week period so we kind of ensure that no one can just pop in and out like sort of flash loan you know bust the system although flash loans weren't a thing back then but and so that's why we built this kind of kind of this mechanism the problem of that is that you have to batch mint tokens and nothing plays nicely with that it's also conceptually difficult because you put money into this thing and you get nothing in return right away you just get a balance update you don't get any tokens you don't see that there's no sort of visceral change and so with this new model we've actually flipped it on its head and now we're having people wait after when they withdraw but they don't really have to wait they can convert it back into tickets it's not locked by any means and through this loyalty token we're going to make that so that eventually they can just withdraw instantly without any kind of repercussions I guess so long story short when you bind to pull together you will get your tickets right away now so I hope that answers your question the the reason one here on any idea of non-random logic is good oh yeah so yeah that's that's a really interesting one we want to read it out oh yes excuse me yeah any so the question is any idea of non-random logic of how to distribute the prize for example connect it to a winning a game or competition because that's what our project is doing yes that is very cool and that's something that I talked a little bit about actually with your bridge team because they're doing a lot of interesting work with kind of memes and gaining because of course James Young is involved in gaming and so if I think it'd be very cool to create a custom prior strategy that does pay attention to a game does listen to potentially the the people holding tickets are there people eligible to play the game and then it can then disperse the funds as dictated by say the games Marc contract or something like that so while while we have baked the random number generation into the core prize pool smart contract it's up to the prize strategy whether it wants to use it or not we just wanted to make sure that the RNG was kind of baked in so that people didn't have to think about that it's really complicated but it's up to you as the price strategy developer whether or not you want to use that random number so you could do you can do whatever the heck you want with it so it's we feel it's pretty convenient I can I can take that second question on Scott just in terms of there definitely is the question is what rule says pull together have to abide by is it like a lottery and there definitely are a lot of rules that we have to abide by that was actually like one of the main reasons for fund raising was basically she appealed like hire lawyers to like do due diligence on all that and make sure we're compliant with it all pool together is not a lottery it's it's as you were in the beginning the talk it's a prize savings and they're legislatively legally there is like a separate classification for price it means products versus like lottery products and yeah and I obviously like you know that depends there's a lot of variables there it depends on what jurisdiction you're in it cetera et cetera so yeah I can't speak to all the specifics but it definitely is something that we have to pay attention to and spend money on in terms of compliance so I'm just having a poke through here to find another question do we have another technical question or not technical it could be anything Buffalo now your let's see Oh someone's asking about the nf a nifty idea yeah the NFT idea is interesting it actually was born well we thought about a long time ago but the the sort of more recent issue was went in really great discussions with avi because they're looking deeply into integrations and they've done some really interesting work and they wanted to be able to track who owns what tokens who owns what tickets and what's so cool but and if T's is that if we do have an escrow then we've added one layer of indirection so between the holder of the NFT and then the NFT holds the tickets and so in computer science if you ever have a problem just add one layer of indirection and so that's essentially what the nfpa are and so using these NFC's also it makes transfer super cheap because now you'd Piang be whatever fifty thousand gas or something to transfer these these let's call them you know gift cards token token bundles ticket bundles who knows but we're excited about that because i think that'll really open up some new interesting ways to integrate pool together to other products yeah exactly it's so somebody says they'd like to stake a pool to get to a mean NFT absolutely wouldn't that be cool there's also actually Layton show me last night this this new product Layton wasn't what was that really cool sort of aura yeah so you can basically receive these NF T's and then burn them to get the the merchandise and be kind of cool if like while you hold them you were eligible to win this lottery and then when you burn them you just got the dye from the ticket so at least you sort of while you're waiting for your merchandise you can have some kind of fun with it versus just kind of holding something until it happens so yeah there's a lot there's a lot of cool things you can do there really excited to kind of id8 about that yeah there's a few more questions on like regulatory stuff as well as does US DC present risk of being stabilized I think I mean on the regulatory stuff again you know it's it's hard to give specifics just because like that's that's obviously with our lawyers I think that you know the question was our regulatory requirements were pulled together extensive I mean there's an extensive amount of work around regulatory compliance I think part of what makes it extensive is because it's so so kind of gray right like there's a lot of stuff that I mean most these regulations weren't ripped with DUI in mind that's basically is what it boils down to oh there is an extensive amount of work that needs to be done to understand what is the purpose this regulation how does it fit into this ecosystem u.s. DC president risk of being centrally stable coin I say yeah it does but you know on the flip side die has a risk of being a decentralized stable coin so every stable coin has a risk associated with it and and I think what we're trying to do is present options for what people are most comfortable with using and also make sure they know what those risks are so it's not necessary but completely eliminating risk but it's about being transparent about the risks there's an interesting question asked by Harry how do you validate the payouts of community pools to a charity for example how do you prevent fraudulent pools from being created so that's a really interesting question and it kind of speaks to the scope of the platform how much are we I would I want to say liable for but it's less legalese and more just I guess responsibility because say for example stripe stripe is a payments platform and if I wanted to I could set up a malicious stripe account and a minimal of malicious website that just takes people's money and doesn't give them any products in return so I think there is a sort of limitations to how much we can enforce as a protocol I think the point of the protocol is that anyone can do whatever they want with it however in terms of the pool together the official pool together pool it's gonna be managed by us so it will remain a trustworthy source we're not going to be we're gonna be checking if we do add charities to our own pool will definitely be investigating them to make sure that they're appropriate and not fraudulent you can do a little bit of filtering on your front end too right if if you've got like bad actors coming in all the time just yeah well there's an editor well there would like you swap right like anyone can pretty market for their tokens but there's only a certain set that are supported on the swaps front end natively and I think that's like similar parallel that we'll see is that anyone can create a pool and you know they can do whatever they want with it we're not going to be presenting in our UI just any random pool that people create you know so that's that's that's a difference mm-hmm okay I'm gonna post links to our websites just to make sure that everyone has access to that so here is a link to the Builder the pool builder if you do want to try building your own personally enjoy discord yeah there's a builder oh how do I get away well you might have to cut and paste that but yeah I don't think it's friendly so thanks okay well I'll post them anyway and then come into our discord if you want some more I had a general question about so you your intent is to build a community around this of contributors and people that are sort of interested in building the pool together community itself over the long term how do you envision that happening if you guys sort of put together your initial strategy because definitely we've seen just generally with crypto currencies and then smaller applications like if you don't have a community you're only gonna last as long as your runway right so we'll just some initial thoughts on that I'd like getting people interested and maybe if you're gonna go the dowel route have you looked at any frameworks like Eragon or anything like that um I think I mean we haven't dug deep into this I think I think to me the first step is like tracking the contributions right of people and so that goes back to like that loyalty token that Brendan mentioned that were still kind of AI dating to some degree of like how it best fits into the protocol but I think what we want to make sure that we track how much people use a protocol and make sure that there's a way to quantify that so that the people who use the protocol the most have a way have a quantification of that and then can have a say in decisions related to the protocol and I think that's like the basic framework we're going in for I think the other like you know governance thing that has become really clear it's just like Minimum Viable governance right like maybe the governance as simple as possible and so I I think I see a all similar to like a compound model with with like proposals with votes on them versus something maybe more yeah something maybe more like a dhow where in my mind like cows are often more just like a little more intensive so we definitely want to minimize like very very few governance parameters variable all those things but this first step right now quantifying people's contribution and the primary way to do that is to quantify like how much have they put into pool together how much have the pools that they've created Jenner you know you know a crude like those types of stats so that's kind of good there's kind of a very natural way to track that so so it's you you're in the early stages of sort of framing what that's gonna be yeah yeah first row in the early stages of framing yeah play out but but it's not it's not like a stupor it's not like a 2021 thing it's like you know end of this year early or the next year is everything okay I know we're wrapping up and I see at least one more question in the chat but before while I have everybody's attention and you're not dropping off a few hack money updates so this week was pretty packed I mean you've still got a bunch of events obviously we're finishing up Tuesday's event right now tomorrow is the d5 panel we are having a discussion moderated by Camilla Russo of the defiant and a bunch of awesome defy builders so I encourage you to check that out it's gonna be a pretty high-level discussion but there it'll-it'll dip down into like how they actually engage with builders and and how they see define developing in terms of the tools and strategies that people use on maenette so super interesting I encourage everybody to come out that will be at 12 p.m. Eastern tomorrow then on Thursday we're running the second version of our hack feedback session you you guys had mentioned that there was a pitch session at East Denver that you really liked so what we did is before the hackathon actually started we ran a brainstorming session then we had like a mini pitch session last week where you get feedback from mentors and then we're gonna do it again this week and hopefully next week as well so teams can get get a feedback from mentors so again that's tomorrow starting at 10 a.m. we've already got a bunch of mentors lined up if this is strongly encouraged if you're gonna if you're if you're trying to refine how you explain your idea how your present so make sure to register because the space is limited for that all the links are in the information channel and half money and then the last but not least the Hayden's AMA the unis web founder AMA is on Friday we should have a time for that soon but again all of these things are going on I encourage people to check them out because it's all really great content and and people that you can learn from hopefully okay I'm done oh no I'm not week three check-ins are tomorrow so make sure you're checking your cohort channel and and you're responding to the eath global team member if we just want to make sure that you're kind of maintaining your progress and still engaged with everything you haven't hidden the huge blockers okay now I'm done thanks a lot Trent yeah and this is great I learned a lot of things from you guys that I hadn't necessarily I've been following pull together for a bit now and and it's always nice to hear these little tidbits mm-hmm there's so much going on behind the scenes and I mean we don't shout out all out publicly you know there's a lot of internal discussions and so it's really fun to be able to you know include you guys on some of what we're talking about right now because this alpha is still very much a work in progress I mean things may change things may break and so we're really excited to be able to incorporate more people's feedback and iterate earlier on the the new version so yeah I think there's a few unless we hit them all I think I asked I think I answered most of them in the chat I think there's one more about like what's stopping someone from creating a pool and reward into themselves and I think the answer that is like sure they could do that but like what why would anyone deposit into that pool and I think right yes I think that's the them but there's also nothing that's gonna make someone put money into that because they would have to be like we're not gonna yeah we're not gonna show that on the front end right yep any more questions from anyone feel free to jump in toward discord as well there's a lot of there's really healthy chats going on right now there sure awesome any final comments blocked all the hackers I mean I've been part of a number of hackathons and they're very exciting this is a really interesting format so I'm very excited to see what what products and and protocols come out of this because you guys have a lot of time so it should be really interesting and I'm glad you guys I'm glad you guys did a pitch event as well I mean I've been so heads down it this is this is probably my the most exposure I received for hack money right now so yeah it's really cool to hear what you guys are doing but um but yeah but thanks everyone really good chatting with everybody and yeah yeah looking forward to all the submissions it'll be very interesting to compare one three to two days and two nights skits versus a full month it's gonna be super interesting I'm excited it's it right on all right take care guys have a good rest of the week thank you everybody for coming yep see ya okay
