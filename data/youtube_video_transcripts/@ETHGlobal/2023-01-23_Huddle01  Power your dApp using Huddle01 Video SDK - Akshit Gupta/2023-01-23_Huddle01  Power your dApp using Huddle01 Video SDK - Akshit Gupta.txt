foreign good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you're calling from um we have actually here from huddle01 who is doing a workshop for power your adapt using title01 video SDK if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and actually we'll be more than happy to answer them and with that being said I'll pass the mic off to our speaker and thanks Anna at eight um I'll just share my screen yeah so hello everyone uh this is akshit I'm a full stack developer at hurdle zero one and I lead the front-end team over here and I am one of the founding developers as well so lately my work revolves around building the SDK infra which you will be using in this hackathon and it Powers the hudl01 web platform as well so uh what is how to zero one so hurdle 0 1 is a communication toolkit for web3 so we it's built upon three pillars so the first pillar is the Huddle zero one tab uh in through which you can do uh web free video conferencing and uh it's basically for Dao's and nft communities and it feels right at home for the web 3 native person so you can schedule a token gated calls use nfts as pfps and do a lot more with it and then we have our SDK infrastructure which are Plug and Play SDK toolkits for you to integrate inside your app and uh Empower your taps with the hurdle infra and then we have our drtc protocol which is called Divergent which we are still uh which is still in the works uh it gives you the power to perform peer-to-peer communication uh through audio and chat so I'll be giving a quick overview of the web app now so I'll quickly reshare my screen and give me just one minute actually I think you're muted foreign web app and if you connect your wallet over here then you'll be able to use your nfts as pfps if you own any nfts on the ethereum or the polygon chain and those will show up here right now I'm going to test wallet so there aren't any yet but otherwise if you don't own any nfts then we also have options for default avatars so I'm giving a quick overview of the web app so you understand the sdks better as well because our sdks power to zero one app too so once you join the meeting so this is what it looks like and then you have other streaming options as well so you can record your meeting you can even live stream your meeting via live peer or to YouTube or twitch uh from here so this is a basic overview of 3001 web app and if you'd like to uh if you'd like to create token gated meetings for your nft community or a web 3 dial Community then you can do that via the dashboard uh hurdles dashboard so uh if you go to dashboard.01 it will prompt you for a wallet sign in and once you do that this is the interface that will show up and you can go to the meetings Tab and create a new meeting and once you create a new meeting you can then select token gated meeting and select whatever nft or token you want to token gate the meeting with so it supports both the ethereum and polygon chains and you can just paste in the token address and create a token gated call so this is a basic overview of um how what Hydro 01 offers and now we'll be going further into the sdks okay so this was the 1001 web app which I just showcased you can even install the 1001 mobile app on Android um then these are the features which r201 offers token gated meetings nfts profile pictures and live streaming and we even store the meeting recordings on ipfs and filecoin so yeah so now we'll go over the sdks so our sdks aim to solve audio video for your dabs uh in minutes so if you wanna integrate a video and audio in your application then you don't have to go through any of your custom State Management Systems we have that all part built in into our sdks so you don't have to worry about any re-rendering problems or State Management problems floating your app we have uh created a resistance store inside our sdks which gives you access to all the peers and the metadata related to the meetings inside the SDK itself then you have features like recording and live streaming um built in as well so you can use that in our sdks then you have nfts as pfps and the basic audio video communication that our sdks offers so this is the SDK architecture of the hurdle zero one insta so this is our headl web app and the Huddle web app is powered by the Huddle client npm package and the Huddle client npm package talks to the media servers uh that hurdle has placed so uh the Huddle client package was an internal package at first and then we uh open sourced it and published it to npm which now you can leverage to build your own dabs and then we also have another uh npm package called the Huddle 019 so if you'd like a little to no customization inside your dab and you do not want to code the UI from scratch you can just use hydro 01 iframe npm package and install it in your dap and customize it according to yourself according to your tab and you can even use the CLI Tool uh create headle01 to generate uh applications based on the hotel client package and the iframe package so we'll be going over those uh in the Hands-On tutorial so these are the three npm packages we have CLI tool iframe and the web SDK so rcli Tool uh gives you a very uh very easy to use commands just to generate simple apps which you can then use for audio video communication so we'll be going over the iframe SDK first so if you head over to npm you just find this package under the hurdle zero one organization called huddle 019 stream it's a typescript package so if you'd like types you can even use you can even import those so these are the CLI commands for iframe and we'll be going over these on the CLI now so I'll just share my entire screen okay uh I hope my screen is visible okay so I have created this directory called spacewalk for this tutorial and you can just type in npx3801 and it will prompt you uh asking for what type of project you want so uh first it'll prompt you for the name so you can just name this whatever you like so I'll just call it iframe app then you can select iframe or the client SDK so for now we'll go ahead with the iframe SDK then if you want to use typescript then you can say yes so it will generate an app for you in seconds once you enter this app you'll have to install the dependencies with the package manager of your choice so I'll be doing so with the package manager for Leon um because I have the unlocked generated over here so it took one second and once I run this app this is what it looks like so what you can do is that you can embed and I uh the hotel app inside an ice cream and then call triggers from outside of that app to have customizability so say I joined this meeting and I wanna enable my webcam from outside of the iframa I can simply do so by calling um the methods inside on the Huddle client on the hurdle live stream so I just click on enable webcam from outside of the app then it will work and I can do so and I can even use reactions from outside of the app once you install the package so I'll quickly go over how the code is also working so all you have to do is um you just have to import Hudl iframe um from the idle iframe npm package and once you do that you can just render out the headlight frame inside your GSX so if you check out here these are all the buttons that we had created and if you check the headlight frame component this is all you have to do to render out the hard live stream if you want to add customizability uh to you know do methods as I showed before like sending reactions from outside of the app or calling enable or disable webcam or start the recording then you can do so via the methods that that are provided by the HUD live frame app instance which is also imported from the live stream npm package so this is how it's working um so if you even head over to the hudl01 website and go to slash talks you'll find the full documentation for this um over here in the iframe section so if you're using on the vanilla if you're not using react or if you're just using vanilla html.js then you can simply copy paste this flip it over there otherwise you can otherwise you can use this from npm and install this and this is how you can just import it just as I showed before just import a headlight frame from the package and render it out on the um on the GSX and then you can call instance methods using this hard live stream app instance so it just takes the method name so these are all the methods that you can call and these are all the allowed emojis and you'll be able to fully control the hurdle app from outside of the heart live stream so this is how it's working so I'll take a few questions if anybody has any questions then we'll move on to the next part you can just drop it in the chat if any questions okay looks like it's going pretty great I will move on to the next part I'll check that's it you're muted again foreign what we just did and if you wanna I'll just really real quick go back to the slide and if you uh don't wanna go with the interactive command and just wanna generate the app and just think just a single command you can pass in dash dash name tags and the dash dash tool tag uh to generate the app in one go so that's how that's working and these are some iframe SDK examples that we saw in previous hackathons so this was a pretty good use case in which we had a Creator economy and this person used to use live stream app to tokengate calls based on that is uh based on the artist's holding so you can check that out on this link then we had this uh integration with meet with wallet so they used a customized version of the iframe to have this dark and light mode using the iframe so it doesn't look like the Huddle app is being integrated here but uh they embedded the header and photos of their own website and use the headlamp in between so this was pretty creative and we're hoping to look for uh projects like these then we had this orbits example they did a similar thing they uh used the headlight frame uh on the side where they used a transparent background and used a custom background on the back of their website to give it a better feel so now let's move on to the client SDK so if you go to the npn um npim store then you can find the Huddle client package over there under the Huddle organization and this is also a typescript package so if you want types you'll get those as well yeah so the Huddle client package is divided into four modules so one is store the other one is Hooks and we have utils and then schema so if you're using typescript then schema will come in handy as it includes all the types for your fan package um then we have the store so store includes all the state uh the store management that I talked about before so you don't really have to create your own custom State Management solution you can just use the SDK store management it contains all the metadata relating to the meeting app so once you join the app all those States will be reflected inside the store so it put it on the iscamp host is my post and the peers metadata will all be populated inside the store then we have certain hooks that we've implemented to make your um react implementing it in react much more easy and we have some utils as well so uh all the functions that we thought were being used a couple of times we bundle that up into a utils package so all uh all these sub modules are intega are part of the hardware plant npm package and those are covering the web app so the store management is basically a wrapper around this is a stand store if you'd have heard of it so it's a Redux alternative which is much more optimized so we're using that and we have a Hudl client context which uh you need to wrap around which you need to wrap around your web application in order to get access to the hotel client state so we'll be looking into that over in the code as well then we have certain client methods as we saw in the iframe as well for enabling or disabling your audio video in the room or sending reactions or sending messages and so on and uh as a part of the hard Driveline context we also give the store management there so it's very easy to implement it if you have a fresh installation of react and like if you have a an app already built and you do not want to start from scratch you can just go to npm and uh install the headline package and then call the method of join uh this way so this is the random room ID that we've provided you can enter whatever you'd like here and if you want to implement your own um wallet authentication you can do that as well and pass in that authenticated wallet address into the join function in order to authenticate the user so we will be going over this in the code as well uh this is just an overview for it then we have certain hooks so we have this use hydro store hook uh to get all the states so if you're if you've used Redux and this is very similar to use uh use selector hook uh through which you can just select certain items of the state and get access to the particular State inside it so this is how we've accessed the iscamp or state this returns you the cam state of your peer so then we have the schema types so the these are all are included inside the sub module of the schema which I described before so these are the room State this is the room State type which you'll also find in the schema so let's get started with the demo so these are the CLI commands for the hardware client uh okay so we've repeated a slide here I'll just go over it uh on the entire screen share we have a Mist type over there so if you want to create a a client package then what you can do is go ahead and type in create huddle01 and it will prompt you again for the project name and you can say flying tab and then you can select whatever tool you want to use so we are using client for now then you can say yes or no for typescript and we have it here so once we enter this client tab you have to install the dependencies so we'll do that with the arm and that's done and once you say yarn def it will run the app on your local machine and this is what it looks like so we've even given some instructions on the left side um for you to use the app so you can just click on enable webcam and it will prompt you for your web camera and then you can join the room okay and if you join from another tab then you can join from the other side so uh if you uh if let's just go into code all right so if you're implementing it on an existing project what you'll have to do is you'll have to install the Huddle client package from npm and follow the guide given in the docs so let's just go to the docs real quick so we have this tab called add to existing project and you have to just follow this guide simply so if you're using the hard Driveline package then you'll have to get your API key so you can see this is over here and if you head on over to get your API key you can just connect your wallet and it will prompt you for the API key and you can just copy this and add it to your project then once you install the package on your app then you have to add your API key inside here and this will give you an instance of the hardware client and then you can use this adult client instance to call methods pertaining to it so as we saw earlier inside our slides so this is the first method that we have to call in order to join the room so once you add the room ID over here and the wallet address auth you can simply call the join method on the hardware client instance to join a particular room so if you see here you got the hydro client instance using this method and then you can call certain methods like huddle fan.join overhead to join the rule so in order to get access to the hydraulic line inside all your react components you'll have to wrap your app inside a hurdle client provider as well and gives access to the hardware client to hold to the whole of your app and then you can just uh get your headless line very easily inside any component and call methods on it so you can simply call it using this and if you would like to get even more insights on what all methods are there you can deep dive into the docs and you'll find store States over here portal states are there uh all the types for it and even you'll get hooks for using it and we have the client methods over here as well so it will show all the methods that will be required for you to create a meeting app using the hurdle SDK so uh this is how it all wraps in and then if you'd like to generate a hurdle app using just using the single command then all you have to do is type in the uh type in the tags for it so as we did npx created to zero one before so you can just type in dash dash meme my app and then you can say that tools right and at base flag and it will generate another app for you in a single line so you won't have to go through the prompts and you'll see that you have this my app over here so that's how easy it is so that was the Hands-On tutorial and we have seen like multiple uh hackathon projects uh from the hardware client SDK and these were really good so this was the Consulting app which used uh which used the hardware SDK and as well as it used money streaming so it charges the user for the number of minutes uh they've consumed and uh based on the number of minutes they've consumed the amount from their wallet gets deducted so this was a pretty cool project which we saw in the eth India hackathon and this is me three Club so it's a sort of a Omegle clone and it uses the hurdle SDK to match random people um inside uh like in the project then this was another very cool project um it was uh it was built in one of the hacks and it uh in this the two people could play chess while having a video audio video conference with each other then these are one of our clients uh Parallax so they've created this uh this now which uses the Huddle client as well so it is a metaverse of sorts in which you can roam around and um have uh have meetings as well uh so they've used the chat module inside a hurdle client as well they've used a hurdle kind for audio video and they even used it for live streaming so this was also a pretty cool project you can check this project out on this particular link mindblown.io so these are the ideas that we have for this hackathon so let me just reshare my screen real quick yeah so the first idea is a video conference a video conferencing platform uh that uses decentralized storage to store meeting transcripts and making them easily searchable and accessible so uh right now the Huddle client SDK provides you with audio tracks so using those audio tracks you can generate meeting transcripts and uh store those meeting transcripts onto the file Point Network and if you can make them easily searchable and accessible via retrieval that would be a really good use case over uh fpm and hurdle01 so we are looking forward to seeing projects like those then we have a decentralized reader conferencing platform built on filecoin that allows for real-time collaboration like Google Sheets so if I head over to the next slide this is a reference of what we'd like to see so say there are people on the meeting and they are collaborating on this platform and they are also having audio video calls and the metadata goes over to the file coin Network and can be indexed very easily so this is something we'd like to see then a Marketplace for a Marketplace platform for renting out video conferencing and live streaming event recordings so uh this would this would be also a pretty cool project so to see a like a Marketplace or a data Dao of sorts uh where uh people can share their recordings and have a data Centric approach where they are incentivized to store those recordings a particular type of recordings and even consume them then we'll also like to see some social media platforms uh so this also revolves around the idea of data Dows uh as you can see like in depth 3 social media is not working out so good but uh with the Advent of data tasks and this could really help um this could be pretty cool so we'd like to see something built around the data Towers uh and hydro zero ones sdps so that would be pretty cool so yeah so these are uh some stats so we have 50 plus projects built on the Huddle zero one infra in the past three months we've had like three hackathons so far and we've seen a lot of great projects and we're looking forward to seeing beautiful uh collaborations between the fpm 1001 STK projects and these are some of the projects that stood out inside our hackathons so it's peer code space meet forecaster spaces and fitness these projections were really cool and you can even check these out and get some inspiration from those and happy hacking so this is our Hydro zero one team a team of 23 members and yeah feel free to reach out to the hotel team or me and see you awesome um thanks so much action for taking the time to do this workshop for uh space War um always great to have you here and thank you for the rest of you for tuning in to this Workshop um like actually subscribe if you have any questions for him or the huddle01 team definitely feel free to reach out on Discord or email um or anything and with that being said I hope everyone has a great rest of your day I think there are some questions I'd like to address um of course okay can I use it as a classroom type app yes you can definitely use it as a classroom type app um does it charge to use no there are no charges as of now so you can definitely go ahead and test it and you can even fetch uh nfts and nfts on the polygon or the ethereum main net so that's not an issue uh does the SDK integrate with low code tools like ionic framework um not as of now like if you have if you have um like the sdks only work on the JavaScript runtime so if you can install it on there then it will work um can I use it on ipfs and other storage Tech yeah definitely like the sdks are meant to provide you with the audio video communication so if you can build something on top of that using ipfs or other storage Tech like fpm smart contracts then that will be pretty cool okay um any other questions okay all right and looks good to me awesome cool yeah we'll end this Workshop here and um of course feel free to reach out anytime during uh the hackathon for any other questions all right have a great day everyone absolutely
