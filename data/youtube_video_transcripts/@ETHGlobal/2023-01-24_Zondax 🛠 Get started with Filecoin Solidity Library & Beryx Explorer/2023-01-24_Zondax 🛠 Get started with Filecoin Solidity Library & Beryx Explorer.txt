foreign [Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening dependio where you're calling from uh we have Emmanuel and Luan here from zondax who's going to do a workshop on get started with file equine solidity library and Barracks Explorer if you have any questions feel free to send them into the zoom chat and our speakers will be more than happy to answer them and with that being said I will pass them the mic off to our two speakers so first of all thank you all for being here and we are Emmanuel at the own from sandaks I will share my screen so you you can start with the presentation uh it's natural and I think you're you know you are you're looking at my screen so everything should should be really distant so I want to introduce us as a company first because this is not signing we are a bunch of people that um we are distributed around the world I mean this this is part of the team that we haven't immediately in place and something about um we're a company that the we work like we Fisher and um I mean we work with with the electrical system from the late from the last four or five years we are actually working in in pretty Innovative Innovative Tech solutions for the for the blockchain system and we have a working we we have been a partner in a we have partnered with cycling for for the last three or four years really close partnership so we have been like winner of tools for for the ficon ecosystem and today we are going to talk about two of them two or three of them uh that they're really really specific for this for this hackathon and I want to go straight forward to to them I mean we have really research to talk about I've already covered them today and they're they're shooting I mean they are like two little groups and they're divided in two groups one of them is a solidity state of salinity libraries that we will see that the work they are for in the next flights uh but they're really specific or related with your smart contracts and your your code the way that you can Geographic movies from your smart contract and the other one he said it's a protocol Barracks that it will allow you to to to to see the historical data on the on the blockchain so anything you do or even interact with an API so anything you do with your contract some accounts anything that's happening behind the scenes in the effect on blockchain we will be able to see and interact with them from this disappensive product I'm going to talk about the solution address and John is going to talk about the berries the new product uh so I will start with the solidity libraries I think they're really I mean this study is really really specific for developers and what do you what do you what what they are I mean they're a set of libraries of solidaries what I mean without this function and types that will allow you to interact with uh five coin uh with the ficon futures from the solidity smart content so you're writing um if you don't have this address you will need to you would need to to do everything by your own and understanding how to call your the how to call the find connectors the fighting functionality from the solidity from your Solitaire smart contract so we have created a lot of functions in top of unsolidity that models all the types and the methods that all the actors in The FICO in in the file coin Network hub so for us for you it's just going to be a matter of importing this package and using all the methods that you would find that you you can find on the documentation in the icon documentation I will be at the so if you want to to interact with some minor letter with a with a market to see teams to create a deal um I mean it's you are going to to to do it really easy because everything needs a solid because you can see what is happening I understand the types and and match that with the frequency documentation so it was conceived to be easy to understand to use and deploy and what it meant with a wedding meet with with these easy to understand because it's an idity and it's a it's a it's a really there is a really close relationship between the the data types and the methods and the method names between the library and the fight coin natural so if you check the documentation for the file connectors you will you will be able to understand what those methods and types are and and and do it's easy to use because as as we're going to speak in a minute uh there is a NPR package so you can import it on your smart and your IDE on your developer tool that had hungry remix and just importing it it's um you you will get all the contracts and you will be able to question them and it's easy to deploy because they are libraries they're not contracts so they are completely available so it's going to be part of your slide contract when you compile them so there's no need to deploy them and and fetch I mean an interview with them through through an address in the blockchain so that's that's it the main three points that we we try to to focus on when we were trying to develop the Leverage as I mentioned before we have an FBI package it's called ficon solidity as you can see there in the images at Sonic by consolidity it has an entire set of libraries and you will see that there is some test libraries the libraries itself the types and there is some mocks libraries that don't don't do anything specific with the ficon network with the real orthogonal but they have some mock scenarios depending on what you pass to them but you will find everything there in the in the package we hand the inversion I mean it is it's easier to handle version in the updates because we are using sember standards so Breaking Chains uh three new features and patches it's going to be easy to to see what is happening when we release a new version and it's perfect for developers because as you as you might know it's easy to to use them and as I mentioned before from current remix channel of uh naming them on your on your smart contract called and I mean had fun with remix we fetch the package itself for you and that's when I have to tell you about the solidity Gary we have we will try to roll to make a boat through the library at the end of the presentation uh but I will pass the um the microphone for young I'm just going to tell you about the verdict API thank you everyone uh thank you Mario I'm playing me one um and wait I'm gonna talk about lyrics uh so lyrics I'll explain two parts one is the API that one is the Explorer uh what is the EPA so we uh lyrics API indexes bi then exposes it through the API um the filecoin data historical and real time next life is ml uh what can Varys API do it provides information like transactions account information fees addresses and stitches next slide please where you can find it you can find it at docs.ch slash Barracks or just go to dogs and you'll find it there okay Google go through all this yeah by the end um there are two steps you have to get a free token and of course you must have a GitHub account first and then you can test it right here on top of that for developers we have an npm package that has the same benefits as the API um and it's in typescript perfect for Developers next slide please okay in the Explorer um next door is a platform for developers uh like looking square that includes historical data real-time data streaming and metrics for the product on blockchain next slide please uh what can you do besides searching like a normal Explorer does certain transactions addresses tip sets uh you can interact with the contracts you can call read and write methods and you'll see their decoded API upload your own uh see the byte called the OB called of course for the right the right methods especially uh you will need funds for that and don't worry we have a faucet so we don't have to go outside coming back and move on and you can connect with that mask um we also have a mental view to check if your transaction got stuck up or it went through and the networks metrics uh are going to be in a second dashboard and they're going to come soon ASAP uh of course you can find it at there it's that zonex.ch next slide please and it has a nice feature because during these weeks we will progressively add more features I would really appreciate if you can give us feedback we can use the small uh at all while I'm on the right side uh it takes a screenshot but you can draw on it and write a message and you can even ask for new features if you need them urgently for your project we will be happy to help I'm not in camera um here is a summary of all the useful links you can take a screenshot take a picture then I'm sure you will find this presentation after yes I mean we can we can share the the links in in uh we can show the presentation and make it available for you so increments and you can check okay um sorry yeah you can contact us at hello that's annex.ch okay um how much should I go uh first uh the barracks yes yes yes uh by default we have we have no two hyperspace because hyperspace is a the long term just net that was deployed like a week ago uh that's why but while we are planning to add the wallaby again in the very Explorer because we we had it like a like in two or three weeks ago as well so it's going and it's going to be there really soon so I will start sharing an I'm okay um I think it's all right can you see my screen yes yes yeah uh perfect okay so we'll go first with the API uh see okay you can get it okay so you have to go to uh scranting the UC berries API or just type those that Sage lyrics and here you can get the key [Music] see the docs and CD M package let's take to get a key okay um here you don't see it because I already have GitHub connected but you will have to have a good practice I will count and uh accept it okay perfect um it really directs me back to the documentation when it pops up here with my token don't forget to copy it um and in here you can test it you can test all the endpoints um but make make sure that in case it doesn't it gives you a 401 error make sure to replace this one in here with the new one and press update okay let's make a try so let's choose the latest chipset this is the easiest one or one the same error so in case this happens it can go in here deleted one on top paste it and perfect hopefully this time works perfect Okay so you can see the latest information the same with all the others like on balance info uh transactions uh get all the transactions using Google from a deep sets or information uh good let's move to the Explorer um here's the Explorer uh at the very exciting.th and you can see on the left side all the tools uh we have uh we have the home which is the search part we have the interact we have we'll have the dashboard soon and the mempool and the faucet also is coming ACP on top you can select the network of hyperspace may not probably uh as someone said before will explain why we don't have what I mean um ftvf a surge switch the team Connect into your wallet to connect with metamask you'll have to use Chrome for the world okay and then here is the feedback tool well please use it okay let's make a test uh we are here in hyperspace let's we have three examples in case you don't know what to search you're new and just want to check it out uh choose one of them if you go to tip set you have a selective set information and if you are a developer and want to see a bit more you know more Dev styled you can go here on top and enable the dev mode and you will see the exact response on the right side you very you will be able to see either the transactions but first you have to choose one from the table below like this one and from this table everything you see in blue is clickable and you can go inside it for example let's see this account this is the account information police transactions that came in and out perfect okay now let's check into I have it here at copern the interact part you have to you can use both these change title address kind and a fuel and I took the contract if it exists if it's deployed view it's API by code op code and display mode still some books to fixing the playground like in the playground you will you can call the rides and read methods and you'll get the response start here okay let's see the mempool this is the current sample in the hyperspace um okay um apparently just want to mention that the gray ones are outside the memo but I can just get them there so you can access it so it doesn't disappear in exactly um okay and that's it for myself yeah thank you I will share my screen now I will give you like a work school the Repository uh I'll let me share on screen and go on and helmet fluent controls okay so do you see my opinion okay perfect as you can see here there is a link to go to the web to the to the Lux web and here you will find a really a short description about it an introduction about generation board some assumptions that we did when we created the library and we have all the methods that are marked and the libraries and you can that you can consume again Mozart it's they are like like the same method interfaces uh that we have on the real library but we are not calling the actual Pi coin they'll go to the actual actors we are calling we're responding uh answering to your request with a pre-loading scenarios depending on what you and what and what what you ask uh what you send and for the API you have a like an a newer description of how you can deploy how you can use it as you can see here it's really short let's see with an npm package if you're using hard hat it's just you know things in your ad importing them from the from the contracts and do the code as you can see here you are more than welcome to that wasn't invited to to check the the website uh and I mean the the Perfect Design it's all the contractor here in the contracts we see right there there are organized in a way that we have different versions for different solidity compilers for now we are using the lgo on data it's one of the latest one and as you can see here you have all a lot of uh the solute libraries the these ones and say API one for each uh for each actor that we have Exposed on the on the library and maybe I I mean if you go to the account API as you can see here is a library and you have three or two different in this case two different methods this is authenticate message and universal receiver hook and they have different parameters these parameters are exactly the same representation of pretty much pretty close to the simple representation the actors in the ficoid in the file coin blockchain have you can go to the types by file that you would find there leader of extracts with a description with each field that is this type has as you can see here we are calling uh where this is it they're really straightforward function there will be simple because we already serious in the data send me the sending the data to reactor again response passing it and give it back to the to the insolidity in solidity code uh here you can find the mocs uh those those are again as I said before it's the same signature in order for each method but we are not coding anything we are just doing a acting based on your arguments in a new different answer uh and here you can find some tests these are actual employable contracts because as you can see here there are contracts we are importing and in this case the the power API sorry library and creating functions for each of those methods so no now they are you can call them from this content that is going to be deployed on that or can be deployed on the network um what ends what is it can can be useful to to means like um words uh here is the mpm package uh says you saw before it's it I mean it's just saying it'll be classic npmgs Race Street um okay and okay I I explained the documentation and lastly I want to show you and and like I mean this is Linux and I think you you are seeing my screen here I don't know this is a test I don't know a smart content I created like like in remix as you can see here the only thing I did was to write that I want to get the market API library from uh from the sandbox solidity contracts b08 and greater than a in smart and M and short contract where where I am just creating functions that the Republic and I can call from via to work and getting the response for in this case for the git get deal labor or with a deal ID and returning the the neighbor's case in the string the same for the provided it's being compiled at this moment with the with this version of the compiler and if you deploy it as you can see here I have two two deployments here I think we can try to do it it will take some time because I mean it will it will gave me here I get some funds before I can confirm it and now I have to wait for the for the equation it will take like a minute because there is there are not many miners on the network so it takes more time that but that it usually takes in minute but at the end you will have something like this you can execute here as you can see they get tested get get there and get the label called pyramid and I mean I did it I deleted like one or two minutes ago or and mini pop and again when we need to wait here for for it but as you can see here it's it's just a matter of importing it or mentioning it at your smart router again remix really fetch the package directly from the MBR players that way it's it's really easy to to use it and again for all the actors and methods that you see on this in on the different actors uh they are like like in several presentation the fight going functionality uh the native functionality so if you check the F icon recommendation you should finding the representation of what each actor does and its massive methods and everything else I mean for this alleged Library we are not doing anything special in that sense so let's say I mean you know Lucas before if which you can from here uh and add some collateral to a new SRT or anything else we have a lot of methods here and some of them are commented we are we are trying to comment uh random ball so you have more information on the contract it's on the library itself but for now if okay you can you can you can check the message that you have there and what you what what methods of different access you need uh in order to do what you want to do and see if in that sense it's possible to lead from a solidity I know that there are there are a lot of examples uh is uh creating for you as examples using heart and opinion so we can point you to to those examples and you will see the Disco and I think that's odd for me too I will leave like a couple three or four minutes for any questions that I didn't see on the Android Channel and the chat if you have any please feel free to to write them there and thank you thank you all for for your time it's been a nice experience to be here and and explain you about this these two amazing three amazing tools that we have we are working on if we have supports on the global uh yeah I mean we are going to be there as a helping you know answering questions there so uh feel free to attack us there I mean we we are going to be there and more and some are say Badness from the company so feel free to to diagnose there and we'll be able to answer you us or any Japanese awesome um oh I know you have a question how can you see respectively produce I mean what we expect here I mean we we want you to to use their tools I mean the libraries are I must if you want to interrupt with five point features from solidity you know if you know I mean they're a must because it's going to take a lot of time for you to discover how to call the precon price that allows you to interact with the underlying five point blockchain so it's a really helpful tool if you want to do that I mean that's the the key feature of the the this evm this if you remember the machine running double Falcon solidity taking advantage of the fight between teachers I think that spirulina has and Explorer I mean it's it's a way for you to to interact because you have like kind of a remix section that you can fetch with an address and see they call the ebi and interact with with your Mana mask run view and any other method and even I mean change the state of your smart contract uh and at the same time you can you can see the main pool and you can see the entire your entire what is happening in the main it isn't a hybrid space one at the same it doesn't make so it's kind of like one of a kind tools because you have everything there the only thing you'll have there is like an easy to write your smart contracts but I mean maybe in the future and the idea is for you to give us feedback with us and we know that maybe bugs can happen I mean will happen and maybe features that you that want to have they are in a very Explorer too I mean and the API is for if for any developer that wants to integrate your in in in your application not for not for for humans that do something you can use post loan but just from testing and I think I hope I answer the question uh you know I don't think you're right it will happen but if you have time on to to to translate the last the last one maybe we can we can continue on Discord and I'm not sure I mean when you type uh feel free to answer that last one okay uh I think I mean minor type uh has only uh the types the structures that Define different methods for the minor actor uh for the manual actor I mean the man united is is the one that is created when a new Miner is deployed on the network and if you want to know uh the characteristics the features the the brand use that that liner has in the network you can use it to to fetch uh information about it you need to pass the address of that specific Miner that you want to to interact with and you will be able to see here I mean I'm looking at some functions here get out there I think it will give you the the owner of this uh of that of that nine you can see you can get the get the sex the sector size the balance that has some funds the beneficially I mean again this is pretty much related with a Franklin Network and the documentation so you don't you won't find like a really big documentation about what it what is an actor inside the study delivery because that's part of the fight clean network but if you go to the five-point documentation and check there you will I mean it will allow you to have a better representation what is minor on the network and then you will be able to come back to the solidity battery understand it better we're working on adding more documentation on the solid itself but we don't want to read redundant between the solidity Library tight clean documentation itself but yeah okay we are ready we already know awesome yeah thank you may well anyone for taking the time to do this workshop for the space floor hackathon um sincerely appreciate it for the rest of you thank you so much for tuning in um and as mentioned in the chat if you do want to look back on this Workshop it is recorded and on YouTube so you can access it at any time during the event or afterwards as a resource and with that being said see you all on Discord and also see you at the kickoff and Summit happening soon bye
