I've seen a number of projects doing kind of like verifiable credentials for learning specifically right so you you have some sort of an online Academy or or decentralized kind of learning program where people can present work that they've done and other people can come and validate those projects and then the people who did the work receive an nft in their wallet or pull up style you know kind of proof of work or proof of knowledge these projects really excited me because I think we need to build a decentralized education system
