so [Music] hello everybody can you hear me okay in the back the audio is good awesome welcome everybody to eat Waterloo - thank you for being here I know I know a lot of people traveled a long way to be here how many people are from the Ontario region or you know nearby in Canada raise hands a lot of people okay how many are raise your hand if you came from somewhere where is warmer than 10 degrees Celsius right now which in Fahrenheit is 50 degrees Fahrenheit okay what about 20 degrees Celsius or 68 degrees Fahrenheit was it that temperature when you left home okay we're thinning the ranks how about higher than 30 degrees Celsius or 86 degrees Fahrenheit okay there's just a couple now how about 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit is anybody in that category please shout if I can't see you no okay how about how about 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit anybody all right who thinks that they are in the hottest place before they came here raise your hand can anyone beat that all right can you come down to the stage please I am just [Music] [Applause] I'm just the warm-up act and I'm taking that really literally so thank you for coming to this cold and barren place we have for you a beautiful Canadian hat a beautiful Canadian wraparound scarf thing and submits please stay warm this weekend thank you for coming if you are also cold this weekend we bought a whole bunch of little mitts like these they're gonna be behind the help desk so if you want some after this just go to the help desk the information desk and ask for some mitts and we'll get you some please stay warm this weekend so with that little bit done I want to call up Liam and Karthik the other two co-founders of eath global to come and actually introduce you to this weekend so give them a big raise applause [Music] [Applause] hello hello yeah thanks so much for introduction Josh my name is Liam and I'm Karthik we're one of the co-founders we're the cofounders of Heath global welcome to East Waterloo so we wanna quickly before going into the details of Waterloo talk a little bit about eath global and give a little bit of about the story of why we're here today and how we've gotten to this point so if you're not familiar but with what eath global is or maybe you've heard a little bit you might know that what we do is we onboard thousands of developers into the etherium ecosystem we're kind of like the developer relations arm of the overall ecosystem trying to get more developers focus on etherium and the way we do this is we run events just like this one hackathons where we have hundreds sometimes thousands of hackers come together at a time and place all over the world and for 36 hours try and build a project that interests them in accordance with what's going on the theory met at the time so this has been our most successful year to date we've done I think six events over the course of the year and we've done this all over the world so we started it in Denver where we had hundreds of hackers come out we then took it to our first ever event in Europe this year in eath Paris this is Austin Griffith I'm not sure if he's in the audience here kind of presenting some of his work earlier Cape Town South Africa where we engage with all kinds of hackers from a totally different perspective totally different technologies in that area of the world New York where again it's a lot more hustle and bustle so hundreds of hackers come out and India we're like remarkably be shocked there's thousands and thousands of aetherium developers you know banging at the doors didn't get into this hackathon and Boston just a month ago and in Harvard and MIT where there's a lot of students kind of getting in the action so this has been our year so far and this one in Waterloo today is actually very special to us because this marks the two-year anniversary of the first event we've ever done of this sort which was eath Waterloo in 2017 how many of you guys were here in 2017 whoo so if you're not sure what's up with 2017 this was kind of a monumental moment for the etherium industry and I think myself obviously biased think that but a lot of folks would say the same thing and it kind of started off in this very grassroots swaye and almost as a hack itself a small number of people all volunteers all with full time jobs decided that you know aetherium is really understand what would be the what would it look like if we try to get hackers focused on developing for a theory instead of just talking about the price all the time so what we did is said literally three months before this Youth Waterloo 2017 actually happened said let's let's see if we can get some people interested in a hackathon so we messaged metallic and said hey would you be able to make it out to Waterloo later this year we want to do a hackathon and like to are like great satisfaction he said yes and so immediately what we did is we just you know relative as many people as we can get them excited and announced on reddit that we're gonna do is hackathon and we at this point we had nothing planned we had no sense of the scale of it we just knew we were gonna do some big hackathon and we'd see what happened and the response was like monumental Karthik and I have been running hackathons for years and we saw in just a month two thousand people from across the world excited to build an ethereal we thought we'd get 50 yeah like we thought we'd get like 50 hackers interested in this thing but this was this was like clearly a global movement and this was pretty remarkable to us and to keep it in context this was this was around the time that we did the first eighth Waterloo people had really kind of clued in that this this thing's kind of interesting and like I mentioned earlier there weren't really any events where you could go just to build stuff there were a couple of Bitcoin conferences maybe there was Def Con if there was always things a little bit focused around the price and so when I was looking back to make these slides I noticed this slide from the original Heath Waterloo which was rule number one to be 'the water low no price talk and trawler 'is no pitch in your IC o---- and this was extremely necessary at the time because as you can imagine from that graph there were a lot of i SEOs going around at this time so this was good sale if you look at the second line says if anybody caught you will be removed from the events yeah and unfortunately we didn't have to do that but there was a it was a phenomenal time I promise you so this was like I said this was kind of a Big Bang moment for the etherium industry and it's what spawned all the work that we've been doing that we'll talk liberal about about later for eath global we saw lots of great successes come out of it like three I'd like to highlight right now number one is get coin which if you Millett from with this EQ system it helped us projects put up bounties and internet for small tasks on github to get any developer in the world to work on something and get paid to do it the founders met and they spawned the idea of coin eath Waterloo in 2017 cryptic cuties he remembers crypto Kitty's character Kitty's like launched a Teeth Waterloo they were literally handing out pokemon cards with cats on them basically at the event as their initial kind of way to get people excited and the set protocol which is kind of one of the main protocols for basket up tokens they traded the first product the founders met and they launched at a teeth Waterloo so this is pretty amazing for like what was three months ago just like a maybe we can do a hackathon kind of idea so this is ye 'the water look kind of stands out in our mind as being one of the most exciting times in this industry and what spawned the initial idea of eath global which is why we're so excited now to bring it all the way back for eath Waterloo to which is with all you find people so thanks so much now I want to also highlight I just told you a little bit about eath global and the mission behind it but I want to talk a bit about from your perspective what is it like to be at these hackathons what can you achieve and then wanna show that with one story that I think is really representative of the whole ethos so here the Jain brothers they went eath India 2017 so before the one that we did this year 2018 has been two years 2018 before the one we did this year here they are with some of the maker team and they came as like beginners to aetherium they knew a little bit about it they wanted to build a hack and they maybe they saw on the Internet hey the school hackathon I can go to they showed up and they you know they met some great people like like these folks from maker and they built a project they called it into the DAP a pretty straightforward idea what if we could make it so the Annie token whether its die or whatever you got could be used to create a CDP let's build up all the contract infrastructure on top of that so it's like one contract call and you open the CDP and maker and don't worry if you don't know what a CDP is basically a very useful tool to make it easier to use this platform they work with some of the sponsors and some of the open source frameworks that were available to them and they ended up winning they want a prize they've got access to a lot of mentors they met a lot of great people there and they kept working on it they kept working on it for months and months and months afterwards because it was successful people were putting money into this thing and it was going really well and actually just a few weeks ago they were at I think over 34 million dollars were put into their contract which they wrote obviously they iterated on after the hackathon but that they wrote for in stood up and then they announced recently they raised two and a half million dollars to keep drawing this idea into a real business and now they're hiring people they're scaling a team and they're making this a real thing that can benefit users of this technology so this really is like one of my favorite stories because it exactly highlights what we're trying to do here get people that are a little bit interested that but that have the talent all over the world and get them access to the best of the best in the industry so they can take their idea and turn it into something real and that's exactly what I want to try to tell everyone here today is that what you should be doing is dreaming very big you're literally in a room with the best of the best in this industry today and over the next couple days go around meet people make friends think of the craziest thing you can build and don't be afraid to take take risks so um yeah with that that's what I hope you can do this weekend it's been in a phenomenal past two years for us this is our 14th event we've done all these events across the world and I just want to share some stats this is our last event in 2019 and we've had over 10,000 hackers apply for our events and we're just about to near a thousand projects coming out of global hackathons and so far we've hosted people from over 75 countries that is this is absolutely amazing we never thought two years ago that we would kind of be able to scale this beyond just this room with the same venue in November 2017 and we just wanted to build cool stuff but being able to see that effect translate to other cities other geographies other people being interested and they're trying to iterate on top of what they're building has just kind of blown us away and we're super happy that we're able to share that with you this weekend now what really makes these events great is sort of our philosophy we we structured them so that you can build whatever you want these are these are not specifically events about solving a particular problem or focusing on a theme these are these are opportunities for you kind of retain the creative freedom you have and and solve whatever the thing you find interesting this is an opportunity for you to learn about this ecosystem learn how to be a better developer for what you're working on get mentorship from a lot of the industry experts amazing sponsors that we're here the tools you're going to use are built by people who are in this building and and that's an amazing opportunity and in overall just grow to to learn this ecosystem and actually help and give back this is entirely about making this ecosystem better and more robust we want this to be an opportunity for you to in a way just reduce there the feedback loop that that gets that basically is needed right now to anywhere from make a project better by fixing bugs or giving them the direct feedback to actually doing anything we can to make this platform more effective and and also just to kind of highlight this is a hackathon not a conference so everything you spoke us around building and not just talking about things and to kind of say that again this is about showing what you're doing this weekend not about talking about it so we encourage you to still present your hacks to the judges on Sunday even if you don't get them working this is very much about taking the first step and actually iterating on top of it instead of just kind of admitting defeat so we have an amazing weekend planned for you there's about 30 companies here this weekend supporting this they have amazing developers amazing mentors designers anyone who's willing to help you is here to help you throughout the weekend there's over 28 workshops on various topics anywhere from beginners to advanced and there's 15 tech talks about what's going on in this ecosystem anywhere from research to best practices to what these existing frameworks are doing from layer two to getting better at the tools you already have and $100,000 as prizes are being offered by each global as well as the sponsors combined and on top of that we'll cover this in a bit more detail over the logistics but we have mentors available on all these topics that you can possibly get help on anywhere from defy to privacy to to gaming and and you're more than welcome to sort of find them and kind of talk to them and work with them throughout the weekend to make your project a great success so kind of with that what I wanted to do was I wanted to kind of give a a special shout out to some of our sponsors without their support these events would not be possible these are entirely run by the support we get from from the sponsors and and thanks to them we're all here this weekend so I want to thank first of all our gold sponsors there's a scale lap sport Matic Thunder core cosmos and new cypher please give them a big round of applause next up we have our silver sponsors consensus umma seller rivet DNA crawl cat maker often labs chain-link and brave please give them a big round of applause and our bronze sponsors Ave Orchid enigma 0x trust token the graph diffuse pep oh boy Bitcoin base Sabo taxa tourists gowling approvable ENS Aztec et Cie labs and and Kota please give our bronze sponsor a big round of applause and lastly these are our seasoned partners who've kind of supported us throughout this year's I want to give them a special shout-out and these partners are 18 foundation scale labs E&S 0x Taurus consensus Thunder Corps UNICEF octane labs new cipher Matic bounties network and provable things again - for for supporting us so we have a couple things planned for you we have an amazing talk an interview on the state of this ecosystem that that's up-and-coming but before that I'd like to invite a couple of our sponsors on stage to kind of share a few thoughts they'll tell you everything about who they are what they're working on and how they can help you this weekend so so with that I'd like to call Shawn up from automatic on stage please welcome to Shawn thanks guys good evening there are over 6.5 billion users who can't user that they're just too overwhelming for everyday people in a world of convenience that users are forced to struggle with browser extensions mobile wallets understanding block chains and smart contracts and worst of all having to manage their own keys and end up losing them here at Fort mattock we see much of the user experience problem it's actually a key management problem the mainstream users are underserved institutions are covered but it's too expensive and inaccessible for everyone else tech savvy users the early adopters are covered but it's too complicated and prone to human error there are also many centralized solutions that risks user losing funds and privacy mass adoption will not happen when we only build and stay our own world gardens and hope people will come and instead our mission should be bring the best part of webster e to the users of web to something that's accessible forgiving and most importantly familiar to mainstream users and that's the core of what we do at 4th Matic with the patent-pending technique we call delegated key management we took the highly secure and popular hardware wallets using web 3 and brought them to the cloud enabling users to recover their account if they lose them I know what you're thinking it is also a noncustodial soft 2 compliant architecture keys are generated locally on the client and encrypted directly with these cloud hardware security modules Ford Matic will never be able to see the private key at any part of the and to give users full control they will also be able to export or import their keys at any time on top of key management we are also bringing a familiar authentication experience to mainstream users if you know 4matic before we've spent over 2,000 hours of user research testing and complete redevelopment of this upgraded design with extensive white labeling so you can use 4matic without diluting your brand and user experience users will also be able to log into apps through email or phone with multi-factor enabled and if they're new to crypto they will be able to make a transaction just with the credit card no kyc needed for starters we've assembled a world-class team who've built products used by millions of developers spending many industries from dev tools infrastructure blockchain and finance to deliver 4matic into hands of developers and users worldwide we've come a long way in 9 months since our launch this February and I would like to offer my deepest appreciation to all of our integration partners and the theorem community token sets xiri on sent banker raid RDX open sea and so many more we wouldn't be here without your patience support and feedback therefore for East Waterloo we're offering developers who are integrating with automatic a grand price of twenty five hundred Canadian dollars that's around 1.2 K USD for the most user-friendly practical and original application will also be hosting an API prize workshop at 9:30 p.m. in room boo turin with some tips and inspiration that can be helpful for winning the prize you can use 4matic right now simply by installing our NPM package and using our fully web 3 compatible provider you can go to our website for maduk calm to get started with links to our Doc's disk or channel feel free to reach out to us anytime we'll be wearing these t-shirts and lastly an automatic is also opening up our delegated key management solution for enterprise use cases such as headless solution if you don't want use the 4matic widget please visit our pricing page for more details thank you so much and happy hacking Big Sean next up next up we have Ethan from cosmos please welcome Ethan on stage so I'm Ethan I'm representing cosmos in the interchange foundation that's the the nonprofit that's been funding a lot of the development of cosmos over the last couple years basically we're on a mission to create an Internet a blockchain so there's a lot of blockchains out there they don't really talk to each other we expect there's gonna be many more and we need to facilitate them interoperating and so that's kind of what we're all about we've been major contributors to the etherium ecosystem for a long time and we're very invested in aetherium success and in kind of interconnecting a theory and related blockchains I'm gonna tell you a little bit about that quite quickly cuz I only have a couple minutes so I hope you can keep up alright so we started launching maintenance in 2019 we've seen a bunch of them come online using our technology stack that includes the cosmos hub it includes loom includes by Nance maybe heard of by Nance they launched the by Nance deck completely written using the cosmos stack they did it themselves and D live which is a live streaming app that PewDiePie is actually streaming on right so all these companies all these projects come around they look at our technology stack and they adopt it why because we prioritize the sovereignty of the developers and their community the fundamental thing we want to enable is the flexibility and sovereignty of developers in their community so they look they look at the blockchain ecosystem they say what technology do I want to use they want to maximize their freedom of choice and so on that's why all these different projects and many more have chosen this technology stack how do we how do we do that we have something called the application blockchain interface the a BCI right and this allows a purse to build applications in any programming language they want so you're not confined to a particular virtual machine ocular language you can use any of these languages and potentially more most applications built in the cosmos tenorman ecosystem are built in go or in JavaScript the inventors of smart contracts they run a company called Agora k-- they're building their secure javascript solution within cosmos on top of tenorman so we have you know go JavaScript Russ Java C++ Python and Haskell elixir Erlang and more so you can build applications in any of these languages so we prioritize go for many reasons a very simple lovely mature language very easy to be productive in very easy for people to learn you know Google built it Google deploys it at scale you know you can trust it we built the Kosmos SDK which is effectively a Ruby on Rails for block chains with batteries included makes it really easy to build blockchain applications with your own custom logic really what we're talking about our application specific block chains where you build your own block chain for your own application designed in such a way that it's able to interoperate with any other block chains out there now of course you might say Abbot I want a virtual machine I want smart contracts no problem we allow make it very easy actually for virtual machines to be built in exactly the same way on top of a BCI at this point there's five different virtual machines that have been integrated into tenorman's that kind of interoperate with a cosmos ecosystem that includes the EVM of course we love aetherium we call this product Ethernet huge shout out to chain safe who's been developing this for us Greg what's up so if you want if you want to run EVM smart contracts solidity smart contracts exactly how you deploy them today but you want on a faster proved estate consensus engine you can use Ethernet we also support wasum a gorrik secure Ekman script packed from the kadena team and even more recently move from Facebook's Libre there's a project called open Libre you know so if you want to write smart contracts in this language and completely co-op Facebook's technology and prove that the open source ecosystem will always be better than the corporate Agra secret system you can help prove that yeah Libre sorry so so we're all about modularity we're all about modular block chains the cosmos SDK is this hyper modular framework like I said Ruby on Rails batteries included right so we have this thing called ether mint comes with a bunch of modules you know for staking governance rewards and fees and IBC is this inner blocks and communication protocol but it also of course most importantly supports the EVM you can deploy contracts to it like you would today no changes fully supports web 3 talk to any of the you know what 20 change safe people here today if you need any help of course the ultimate goal of cosmos to interoperate to interconnect many different block chains we do this with a protocol called IBC there's a prototype of that available today in the cosmos SDK so you can check that out if you want to if you want to have an example of say two different block chains talking to each other doing something interesting so ultimately the grant question for you is what will you build you know there's been this massive growth in defy on aetherium a lot of things were written in etherium and in the EVM the question now is can we rebuild those things in other more mature languages and more mature ecosystems and enable them to run in their own block chains and to interoperate between them so we have we have an API prize we have Billy who's talking at 9 o'clock in the Napoleon room on IB C and building NF TS and and sending NF T's back and forth between different block chains definitely don't miss that thank you very much and good luck thanks Ethan definitely the most creative use of stage time I've seen in terms of density next up I'd like to call Jerry from ecipher to talk about new cipher feel like at the purposely slow down after Ethan hi guys i'm derek from new cipher just a bit about us where the privacy layer for decentralized applications so I think you'll want to use this just a bit about us you know our vision is unconditional privacy is a human right and we endeavor to build cryptographic infrastructure for apps to assert that right without having to give up on your privacy you know for other reasons our blockchain tech specifically is our new cypher network I basically allows apps to manage private data and secrets management dynamic access control 4d apps so you know we're here all to hack and create a new app hopefully and the question you have to ask yourself is how do you manage this private data if your app requires it and that's where we fit in so I'm just gonna go through your thought process a little bit so if you wanted to create an app you know you we use P ke sure public key encryption you know but if you look a bit closer there's some issues there a the data has to be decrypted before you can share it you know you might want to ask yourself sort of where does that happen usually if you want it to be safe it has to happen on a client obviously that can't happen because it's a scalability problem if you want to share with you know ten a hundred people and have to do this process over and over again that's even worse when it comes to decentralized environment because your data is now stored on some random ipfs node and some weird dudes basement and you don't want them to be able to access your plaintext data so that's sort of week where we come in we use something called proxy encryption it's basically this magical pke scalable p key that allows this proxy entity to transform data from being encrypted under particular public key and to being cryptid under a different public key and this occurs without any decryption of your data nor access to your private keys yeah I know magic but but it's true and so what you can do is you as an owner you can encrypt some data store it in some stores that you want whether it's IP FS s 3 you can delegate access to this to some receiver that's done through a rien krypton key that only you the data owner can create and then you can go away and now the recipient can now access your data and get it re encrypted for them and so that's sort of this end-to-end encrypted data sharing paradigm and we've taken this sort of this scheme and decentralize it so now instead of having one proxy you can sort of split that across multiple proxies and have this quorum that's required for the data to be Rhian cryptid so now you sort of have solve this availability problem if a proxy goes down so you do something like a three or five kind of thing where three proxies out of five any three proxies out of five are needed to get the data re encrypted and the data is only reinforced if e n't and so that's our product our product is basically the new cypher network where are my fonts a little funny our our network is basically this network of proxies that facilitate this rien krypton for apps it's accessible we as a company it's public it's a public decentralized network we only control a portion of it the general public can run notes it's extensible in that we can implement other cryptographic primitives other than proxy encryption and it's pretty intuitive because we wrote it with this like continued character narrative that's using cryptography with Alice Bob and a couple other characters and so you might be wondering how to use that well you know basically it's just this method where you can store data once and then selectively delegate access so we've had some pretty cool hackathon projects like the Snowden project where this team decided to have encrypted posts on you know like a Facebook and then delegate access to their friends for their friends to actually see the post there's also this whistleblower app that somebody created where you can selectively delegate access to this to like data you know relevant to some investigation so some pretty cool stuff we have a $2,500 u.s. D bounty for best use case of new cipher please check us out we have a workshop today tonight at 9:30 in a Napoleon room so please come by I'll go into more detail about our technology and how we fit and you here are some some cool links for you to check out if you want to hack with us so happy hacking thank you so much next up we have Jack from scale please welcome Jack onstage hello all right good to be here this is ithi ithi is not just the snuggly unicorn which is the etherium mascot but ithi is a bounty so we'll learn about her later okay we actually were in the airport today and we rescued her from an FAO Schwarz so she's she's looking for a home all right so really good to be here I've been working in Silicon Valley for a very long time and I have so many friends from Waterloo and colleagues and it's awesome to be here pleasure it's everything it's it's been hype to be so very very happy to be here so who here is familiar with scale okay a few people so scale makes it very easy to take your etherium smart contract and run it incredibly fast in non hackathon environments that means fast an in a gasless manner so low costs high throughput fast block times and really solves for a lot of the usability issues that come with with trying to scale aetherium so that's what we do we've been at this for a while we're getting ready to launch the main net very soon and with just two lines of code you can deployed a scale and run sub second block time so we have to 1,000 dive winners and six 500 dinars more importantly we have ithi okay so one of the grand prize winners will also be taking ithi home all right so we have a workshop Christine Perry will be presenting and showing you how to deploy to scale showing you the process of deployment we'll be doing that tonight at 10:30 in the Napoleon room tomorrow well we get a lot of questions about scale architecture how is it how is scale different from a traditional sidechain how do you get elasticity into a blockchain environment where actually go into architecture go into economics and have a not necessarily hackathon oriented conversation but more broader architecture base and also talk about how scales built into the etherium Network so I'll be doing that tomorrow one o'clock in the Napoleon room so we've had 31 submissions thus far at evac athon and we across the board too many different examples so here's a few we're looking at right now and how do you win so one you can run a sidechain so incredibly easy to take take your smart contract put it over into the scale sidechain to two lines of code you can also do interchain messaging so you can have eath ERC 20 die and other other permutations of eath run on the scale chain and make them go back and forth with your application you can also do file storage so scale makes it really easy to run storage in the sidechain in the blockchain and it's actually cost effective to do that I'll describe tomorrow if you're interested please come by the architecture session and lastly we launched this at eath Boston it was very cool to see people actually leverage this but you can run tensorflow models inside of a smart contract so you can take a pre train model and then let's say you have an Oracle that's bringing in a price input you can actually do fraud detection price prediction and take these pre trained tensor flow models which there's you know many many of these available that are already pre trained for you could use it a hackathon or even do image recognition so we had somebody do immigrant image recognition to identify location at eath boston and use that as an input to the ESCO to determine whether or not it was a pass or fail so come by talk to us at the booth happy to get into that and I'm not going to go into this now but tomorrow we'll be talking about how we use randomness rotation and incentives to make the these chains secure and we'll also get into the architecture do any anybody interested in docker and kubernetes ok ok I see some hands come by we're going to see how this lives in a blockchain environment and we'll get into that tomorrow so no more for me tonight just want to say thank you we are honored to be here we love these Etha vents and and let's have some fun okay thanks jack we left scale too next up we have Sam from Thunder core please welcome same on stage hello there so I'm Sam Harrison from Thunder core I'm happy to be here and happy to be part of the community this is great so really quickly about Thunder core we are a fast blockchain right now we're at twelfth hour twelve hundred transactions per second although we have some technology that's being baked right now and are in our lab that's been stress tested at four thousand transactions per second so it's going pretty fast we're fully EVM compatible which means that anything that you guys decide to build that you want to be using the ecosystem everything that is fantastic and you can transmit bring it over to Thunder core really quickly with just change of a couple lines of code and of course highly scalable and a highly secure but let's get interest you know we want to talk about this sort of stuff right oh great that's great about Thunder core let's talk about bounties so first off we're gonna give out two hundred fifty thousand Thunder tokens tt for the best user experience Musa bility for that can support the Thunder chord stable coing ttusd T which is the equivalent for tether for the USD T the next one says we want to see the best game or the best infrastructure we have two different prizes 100,000 TT for both of them so if you can build the best game if you can build the best infrastructure project bring it by let's judge it let's give you a hundred thousand then the virtual design aspects we're gonna go for sixty-five thousand for someone who comes up and has the most users that they got over the weekend right this is basically building virality getting more users into the system and then also the super easy one the most social engagement so take a tweet you know take a picture do a tweet do an Instagram get the most shares get the most likes the thing that goes the most viral from here at eath Waterloo - and then finally of course just to really quick things on the best analytics and best user experience 35,000 aged so we have a lot of different things you can build in a lot of different ways you can earn prizes now of course terms and conditions they're not exclusive feel free to to go for as many of these prizes as you want have them demo ready by the end of the weekend so just be able to show what you finish what you were able to accomplish and then be able to talk a little bit about why you chose to build with Thunder core aside from the fact that the the bounties are great so that's me that's us come visit us out there in the in the hallway and I'm looking forward to a great weekend thank you and our last presentation is uh please welcome Ken from the theorem foundation [Applause] hello everybody this is cool cuz I don't really have to show ethereal that's what we're here for but I will talk about some of those cool stuff that work on their foundation and so what I work on is the equal support program and what button do i press green one all right green means go what is the custom is a program that's a good question you guys I'll tell you more so because a pro program grew out in this evolution of what we had as was the dayroom foundation grants program but what's different that's crazy right why did we change the name what do we do well the grants program since 2008 has granted and committed over 30 million dollars to over a hundred projects over a hundred different projects - so a lot of money has gone out to a lot of different teams a lot of them has come out with hackathons eath global one of them get coin another one of them shout out to all the people there's so much more yeah I only have three minutes I'm trying to like speed this up but at the same time I don't really you know trying [Music] what what we really kind of wanted to own in on was how for the grants program we prioritize addressing urgent needs and a lot of side effects right like in terms of balancing what's what's most important for the ecosystem versus what's the most urgent need and the you ever really kind of balance the scales there um but the the biggest thing that we kind of really wanted sonant on was instead of asking the authority foundation you know what should we be funding we wanted to flip that around and say okay we want to know more of what challenges are you guys facing right what are the needs that you guys have and how do we as the Thira foundation best leverage all of our resources in order to help support you and make you successful so with equal support program we wanted to expand on the idea of what support means right it's not just funding we want to be proactive instead of reactive we wanted to leverage more than just our resources in terms of you know what we have available at the foundation but also in terms of people how do we make sure the experts are brought in on these conversations how do we make sure that you guys have access to and channels of communication with the experts like this right and it's easy when you're at hackathons cuz everyone's here but in the decentralized world that we live in how do you actually you know get in contact with sake Arctic or Liam or Greg this is arc so what we really wanted to kind of get at is we want to be there as like an open door right open door policy come and talk to us and ask us you know if you have questions over who to talk to you where do I go parts of the different different levels of support that we provide and these are just examples we're still kind of growing and understanding as we start to address more and more needs across the ecosystem where we have done recurring research funding you know local grants across the globe targeted coordination groups right getting all the state general guys together mentorship technical feedback security audits introductions literally anything that you can ask for we will try to get for you and so past the weekend you know go to eco some of the support that's the website I'll be here all weekend so come find me and you know this is less of an application and more of a conversation right just kind of go to the website reach out and let's talk but what else is the ether about ation doing great question guys there we just launched challenges that if they are met org amazing so many huge bounties check it out we have pseudo-dynamic org launched today it's an amazing easy beginner-friendly ID for a theorem that org it is super cool I played with it for three hours today and it's just badass I don't even know how to explain it check it out and hack on e to this weekend we have prizes bounties we have huge stuff going for e to we want to make sure that we make it accessible and we want to make sure that this big thing that we're talking about all the time we want to make sure everyone understands it because it is really cool and something that we should all be kind of thinking about and focusing on and that's it thank you all so much thank you can I also have a quick announcement from the Bounty's Network they couldn't be here on state so if you go to Waterloo bounties Network there are a lot of cool bounties you can do in and kind of finish up small tests and earn some rewards so check out Waterloo bounties Network so next up we have an amazing fireside chat with two people that I want to introduce in a second it's it's been a long couple years in the development and in the growth of the theorem ecosystem from kind of 2017 when eath Waterloo started to to where we are now we've seen thousands of developers hundreds of projects and millions of dollars being invested into making this infrastructure a lot more sturdy and stronger and better and we wanted to see if if we can sort of cover some of the the good and the bat that's come up and and kind of resulted as as part of that so I wanted to invite two to stage Camilla Russo who is the journalist at the defiant and Vitalik deuteron who was one of the cofounders of aetherium two to come on stage and in basically chat about what we just said yep [Applause] we will have an opportunity to take some questions after this and we'll come to you after that I just wanted to thank each global first for inviting me to have this conversation with Vitalik this is an honor to be at eath Waterloo so yeah let's get started so it's been two years since the first eath Waterloo at the time crypto was approaching the peak of a bubble which later burst a theorem had really a front-row seat in this roller coaster and it's come a long way since then so Oh first everyone kind of hear me right okay okay so going back to that time in 2017 it seemed like I SEOs were probably the main use case for for etherium obviously regulators came and crack down on that market are you disappointed that happened or maybe relieved I mean I guess there is like two ways to interpret that question one is am I happy that then that the amount of attention and on ICS has decreased in general and the other is am I happy with the way in which the regulatory crackdown proceeded I'm definitely more positive on the first and the second like so like one negative consequence of say the way that the regulatory crackdown proceeded for example is that it gave people the idea that doing in ICO is not okay but doing a private sale and launching a VC coin and getting a bunch of rich people in the ground-floor and then doing some work one one and a half for one and a half years and then watching a coin and having retail investors buy the coin at 100x higher valuation is illegal and so people do the second thing instead are the first independents quite possibly even more exploitative so like this is one example of a thing I'm not happy about but I mean the facts that kind of ICO is in that particular format in general are Nick much less of a focus now is definitely something that makes me super happy basically you may think first of all it's like I ciose the mechanism or even though they're theoretically for launching decentralized projects and they're accepting decentralized cryptocurrency is they're really kind of out of touch with the spirit of what blog chains are about there's like block chains I mean among other things they're about decentralization and trust minimization and an IC o---- basically says hi I am a centralized King you should give me one hundred million dollars because you trust me and I will build this crypto project and I will make it great so it is like it's not aligned at all you might remember at the beginning of 2018 I release to this introducing diem instead of raising into directly into the creator's wallet you would raise into a smart contract that would release the funds over time and then more recently there is this post on research called Public Interest projects and there's our die which as far as I can understand is basically the same thing that also does another spin on that so kind of contribute money over time and use smart contracts instead of contributing money all at once and I think like trying to use the tools that the crypto space provides us tech to try to solve Nick the real like incentive problems within the crypto space is something that's kind of much more in line with where my own values are and I'm definitely happy that there's more people kind of thinking about that and there is less people doing the hey guys I'm I'm a centralized can't give me a hundred million dollars and trust me sort of thing I hope we continue not seeing watch over the first and we see more of the second so maybe this face can return to realizing crowdfunding is not a bad thing on etherium it just needs to be more aligned with kind of the ethos of the network great and also going going back to to that time you were very vocal about how you know there wasn't much actual value being created to justify the super high valuations with ease now below $200 Bitcoin below 10,000 and the whole space at around 240 billion do you think that's still the case I I definitely think that the amount of concrete value produced by the space has really improved a lot over the last few years a few years ago I think people's expectations we're definitely getting far ahead of the reality and now on the one hand the hype is lower but on the other hands the reality is better and and I think that's good on both fronts and I think we've made a lot of progress and and there's a lot of things that are have been and are being built over those last few years like whether we talk about scalability improvements user interface improvements and if progress to word proof of sneek progress on all day these defy friends progress on these other applications then I think this base is considerably closer to creating a lot of real value now and I'm looking forward to one and it starts doing that on a much larger scale would you go as far to say that maybe the space or just each specifically is undervalued at this point no comment you know I'll argue that in the in the past few years much of this value has been created by defy finance or open finance you know it's these group of financial services that are being created on top of cerium and you know some people have argued that III would be successful even if it's just kind of a financial chain what's your view on that I mean is is defined maybe kind of the last wave of aetherium applications you know I definitely hope not because I mean in terms of like what I as a person care about definitely be sad if if finance was the end of it though I mean at the same time like a furious and ecosystem and I'm like supposed to be not the dictator so if it doesn't like perfectly reflect my values that I'm not supposed to be allowed to complain but like you know there's definitely a lot of value that's come that can be come out of creating decentralized open financial systems and doing a and a really good job of making me not just payments but also like there are different financial tools like insurance smart contracts and kind of this whole suite of things available to the entire world seems been making a lot of headway there and I also exceed why finance has been the kind of initial application that people focus on like it's in both the one that brings in it brings money in money in the short term and it's also one where like finances the one sector we are existing centralized solutions are the most terrible like sending emails from country to country is trivial but sending money from country to country is still something that takes a significant amount of effort whereas if you just do it over a cryptocurrencies I give you an address over any of these messengers and then you send what you send money and it's done and it's like much simpler so like I see the value of behind the you know the the defy wave and I'm happy it's a seeing a lot of people building all of these things I mean I'm obviously once I kind of repeat my caveat about like guys remember that these smart contracts might have bugs and guys remember that half of these things are running with Oracle's that fall far short of my and probably your standards of what constitutes adequate decentralization and we needs to kind of work harder and keep improving but assuming that gets solved over time I definitely think it's great and going beyond finance I definitely think there's a lot of things that other things that ball chains can do like I view block chains more generally as being this kind of economic substrate for mechanism design and that includes lots of things it includes incentives it includes storing information it includes keeping track of like public keys that users have published things like ENS things like just using aetherium as a as an identity layer and I saw there's some recent projects like doing the whole kind of sign-in with aetherium thing and that's actually something that I think is like I it's not like super 50 million dollar a glamorous but it's like the reason I'm interested in it is because like so first of all who here has been sim swaps a bunch of people right and so like one like a common kind of belief that people have in the back of their minds is that like decentralized systems are generally useful in contexts that require like censorship resistance or like evading powerful governments and these things because centralized systems are generally more efficient and better for normal people's use cases but in reality the whole cell phone sim swapping thing and just generally identity it's like a great example of why that's not the case so like basically you know just any Rando and go and just socially engineer one of these telephone companies and get them to just turn over control of your account and anything that you and we started over the last ten years have creeped into using cell phone numbers as a centralized identity system and so if you capture someone's cell phone then you capture their identity you can capture pretty much any online accounts where they use their phone number as a backup and it's like all very terrible and so here's the key just want to finish the case for you centralizing the thing right so another one of the things that I've been like actively pushing for if like said this has pretty much every conference a smart smart contract wallets so things like social key recovery multi SIG's like going beyond kind of like one key being the thing that defines your ownership of assets and my theory is that like these kinds of techniques have to exist in a decentralized cryptocurrency land because the this kind of hostile trial-by-fire environments where there's huge incentives to steal people's money there is huge losses if your money gets stolen huge losses if your money gets lost and so if we make solutions that are good enough for this environment then we can also kind of export these solutions and make them useful just as accounts for logging into other things and now we have kind of crypto based and if I count management as our base layer and you start building things on top of that and now you've started kind of recreating more of this more of the stack on a decentralized base I've talked for enough so I guess do you think kind of the next wave of etherium innovation or applications will be kind of identity linked to to privacy applications hmm I don't think there will be one next dominating wave I think it'll be many waves right okay and then wanted to touch on something else you mentioned at a conference which is you know this question of whether eath is money you said eath is money if the community wants it to be so what's your opinion on that do you want easy to be money and if you do if you do how good do you think eath is at being money so in you'd Kowski and rational west culture which is my religion there are these there's there is this like I know of thing that you're supposed to do which is kind of taboo in your words right so when people have a disagreement about whether or not X is a Y like try and people and like it seems intractable like try to it's figure out your disagreement without using the word Y because chances are like a lot of the time what happens is that people don't actually disagree on substance they just like have different ideas on what this word is and money is this funny word that lots of people have different meanings for so like okay who here thinks that money and currency are synonyms who here thinks that money and currency are not synonyms okay I saw every I hands race for both like so we can't even agree on that right so like clearly the is the question liked me very well like not even points to any kind of substantive disagreement effect so what can be used for and can even be used for as a way of holding of holding value and sending that value between people yes the etherion foundation has even years now use if that we internally for years value within smart contracts yes that's a way for being paying for a transaction fees yes is something that I recommend as a replacement for US dollars next year even ten years from now I'll probably no it depends on kind of what your objective is here okay and then going to another topic to developer experience two years ago it was a lot harder to build something on Ani theorem over a weekend like all of these people here are going to do in the next two days how do you how do you think it developer experience compares this year with with 2017 I definitely think it a lot of things have gotten better mmm like first of all just a lot of the different tools that people have been using have improved more and more more over time unlike development environments like even just the ability to access the block to access the blockchain and run a full node efficiently has gotten better documentation has gotten better compilers have gotten better things that you can integrate with I'm Yoona swap now exists and lots of applications plug into unis WAP more mature so I def formal verification infrastructure is another big one that's made significant strides zero knowledge proof infrastructure so there's definitely a lot of infrastructure that exists now and a lot of things that have gotten easier now that we're not there in 2017 and also just kind of knowledge inside people's heads in the community so and I definitely think there's been a lot of progress so what do you think is missing like what are the big pieces what are the big pieces so this is the sort of question that where my answers have been kind of the same for about five years and we have been get we have been making a lot of progress though right so one is scalability make transactions are too expensive and now you know we have the the the new cool thing is roll-ups apparently and then of course that's the new the the short term you cool thing in the medium term cool thing is sharding and those sort of didn't made huge progress another one is just a collation C of transactions and this is just for you for user experience reasons like when I send a transaction it should be like ideally in Bitcoin was like 10 minutes to an hour than etherium got that down to like a couple of minutes but like block time is 12 seconds but because of like fee markets weirdness you most of the time people set their fees low and they often have to wait wait longer and I'm hoping like EAP 1559 can fix that and get most transactions included in the next block proof of stake I'm just we're kind of providing more consistent block times also with the way that cat like LMT ghost provides like basically 100 confirmations in parallel so with eath 2.0 we get no more confirmation sooner that'll solve some other more UX issues privacy I mean ZK snark based stuff needs to continue to get better I think we just need like more incremental improvements on things like improving time for example so that's signing a transaction or generating a zero knowledge proof can be can be just a little bit faster I'm also better developer tools for privacy-preserving anything security and kind of more user-friendly form of irrigation infrastructure is always go ahead so all of those things put together like it's really you kind of a bunch of these incremental so logs where I gif we make a lot of progress on each of them I think will do a great job and then speaking of things missing I think going back to earth water loo 2017 some people back then maybe would have expected that serenity would have lodged by now what do you say to those critics who you know criticize aetherium for for not having lunch if 2.0 yet considering you know some vid cleaners use that as an excuse to say it is a scam and yeah I mean I mean I guess like first of all means yes like I definitely was over optimistic about the timing of eath - you know at the same time like a thing I've said is that the property is that easy to like has continued to get better and better and like every time we make an action that looks like over going back to the drawing board every time that happens it looks a less and less drawing board II so like the most recent thing the switch from thousand and twenty four shards with cross-linking every epoch 264 shards with Kross waking every Sawad substantial reorganization of how charting works but it doesn't really smell down development it actually like it's a really substantial simplification and enabled a bunch of things that we thought we would not be able to have before and we've continued to have all these improvements of that type and so the e 2.0 final products that it's looking like will see is definitely much better than the e 2.0 that I was saying four years ago we would have - two years from then so you know there's there's the bad but also but also the good in in general like there's proof of steak house test net saying we're gonna get much larger public yes that's what gets across client tests that's we're gonna get to launch a phase zero and I got some points I think the critics are just going to have to kind of face reality and they're like look guys there is a proof of stake chain it's running and it's the other thing is not a scam yeah and I think it'll definitely make me very happy to see that day and like who knows maybe five years from now even Bitcoin will be looking at perverse take a little more favorably yeah now that's an interesting point I don't know if you wanna expand one more on that it's a little bit of topic but yeah considering kind of I mean Bitcoin switching to proof of stake I think it's it's an interesting notion oh yes yes yeah I love this I mean okay so go into like joyful heretic mode so I guess like the challenge is right that like there's this kind of looming elephant in the room over I mean a lot of different cryptocurrencies that kind of committed to a capped a shoo-in schedule and the like really committed to this idea that issuance is evil and we must have a hard cap and because a hard cap is the Austrian Way and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflation is Fiat gold bugs and but the problem is that like you need to pay miners for security and the story has always been what we'll use transaction fees for this right but if you look at reality right so right now like in think in Bitcoin for example last time I checked it was about the the daily block reward was about 7 million dollars the daily transaction fees were about 140,000 that's about a factor of 50 difference in aetherium the block reward is about to even the transaction fees are about somewhere between like 0.03 and 0.28 depending on like which day it is and whether or not some they are win or some other crazy application is burning a million dollars in fees because of bad mechanics or whatever but in general there seems to be this kind of about factor of 50 difference between issue and cynthia's and it's not at all clear that he is are going to be able to kind of like wait basically it's not at all clear that ball chains are gonna get him to be secure when issuance is 50 times over that or once the the the the amount going to security providers or miners or ass takers is 50 times the lower than it is now and like I do think that proof of steak does better than proof of work with lower security budgets but even with proof of steak like I'm not confident that aetherium would prove a steak with zero issuance or something that it is guaranteed to be able to survive for example which is why even past proof of steak like we're decreasing the issuance heavily but there's still some issuance so one of the common replies to this of course is like oh cryptocurrencies are obviously going to be a hundred times bigger in ten years since and that'll cancel things out but number one you're not allowed to make crazy super up to make optimistic assumptions if you're gonna argue that about the security of a system that protects people's life savings and number two that's not even a correct argument because if a system gets fifty times bigger then ensure the security budget becomes 50 times bigger but the size of the attackers who care about breaking it becomes 50 times bigger so like I think the relative actually matters more than the absolute and that's an area where kind of the people that focus on the absolute being canceled out by growth of the ecosystem are just wrong so like my view so I think proof of steak is important and it doesn't even have to be foolproof sake it could even be hybrid perverse steak is a good way of just getting more security with kind of a lower much much lower rewards and issuance which i think is like important especially for PF people kind of value these things like having having low issuance or potentially even zero issuance and so forth but then also I mean like my own views on my monetary policy for example like as some look this is the question where people ask like why doesn't aetherium do a hard cap or why doesn't a theory I'm like commit to a specific schedule or like something like this and I remember there was a panel at Edie Khan in mengapa sit side of the world and Sydney six months ago we're like this was this kind of controversial issues panel at them at the conference I asked a bunch of theory I'm community members do you guys support a hard cap in the answer I got was Universal we know and the reason why is basically because like people seem to appreciate a more kind of pragmatic approach and one that basically says that like instead of optimizing for predictability of issuance we're gonna optimize for predictability of security because the platform's surviving is the most important thing and if the platform doesn't survive we're all screwed anyway so predictability of security is really important and the problem is that right that like we don't we don't know the ratio of security of security like that's just a variable that the real world has and what we don't we we might learn things about at five or ten or twenty years from now so if we have to choose between like stabilizing issuance and stabilizing security and we want to stabilize security that does mean that there is going to be kind of some people would like but like that's something that like to a lot of Bitcoin people for example as but a lot of people I've talked to just seem seem fine with it okay maybe theorem will prove to be a good example of proof of stake for eight corners to look at it and see how it works maybe you go coffee it sounded line yeah I mean it's not just about Bitcoin to be clear like I hope like coin adopts prefer stake as well I mean I hope pick when cash adopts proof of stake and I hope bitcoins to say whooshes vision adopts per mistake like I mean I think the thing is a scam but I think scams running proof of stake is still like less environmentally harmful than scams running proof of work like you know like harm reduction is supposed to be the mature attitude to have so like whatevs yeah wrapping up and just looking forward once aetherium is running with this better proof of stake and sharding and it's more scalable why do you think it can achieve in the next decade hmm I still think there's a lot of unknowns and I think I mean decentralized finance is kind of the lowest risk thing which is a funny thing to say because the crypto sector as a whole is still kind of much higher risk than some people often give it give it credit for but you know just creating like an open global financial system that people can and if people can access to people can have savings then people can engage in contracts get things like insurance just to get kind of services that are difficult for them to get using kind of traditional centralized tools I think even that is you know I very much hope that's not the only thing etherium does but even that is something that's very valuable all by itself but in general and I think in very vague terms like the vision is this idea that you can use crypto economic and decentralized systems to create kind of incredibly neutral kind of social institutions and mechanisms and this can create platforms that more people can trust and more people feel comfortable trusting and kind of reach across barriers more easily you mean like Dallas so Gio's are one example of this right and and like I'm very interested in Dallas in the long term I definitely think that like present-day technology you know I agree with lots opinions here that like there's a present-day doubts are not super interesting what Dallas could be a super interesting and I really wants to see you kind of that gap being filled I think I think in the in general there is this whole branch of kind of economic research into how do we do things like funding public goods for example like I've I've been a big fan juist for quadratic funding people might have seen my recent and a blog post where I kind of describe do I get coins recents a quadratic finding around as a way of kind of detecting and finding public goods for the etherium ecosystem governance of kind of common shared resources even things like Oracle's like all of these problems Dao is our one valuable thing financial protocol is obviously another valuable thing the whole the space of kind of combining together kind of crypto components we have kind of social media platforms I think it's kind of an interesting thing like I mean PBS for example like I've talked about a few times if you look at things like steam it for example like this is something that I mean it's like theoretically part of yo saleon so we're kind of theoretically supposed to not consider it legitimate but like they've done a decent job at like creating this kind of crypto incentivized platform for a new content generation and at least getting it actually actively used by a user a user base of some size and I think like the mechanism design can be improved by a lot but and I think like things things like that and trying to kind of solve problems with just present day systems in a lot of cases that kind of incorporate elements of using block chains as a base way or incorporate elements of mechanism design but mechanism design done well and not just like slapping payments on top of everything and whatever without thinking through the consequences there's a lot of good things that can happen I mean prediction markets as another kind of big category of things that I find interesting two broad range of things that you know if you can disrupt probably okay and then just quickly to wrap up if there's one thing you could tell Vitalik sitting in eath Waterloo 2017 what would it be hmm I mean I mean the realistic and boring answer will be a crypto prices will go down sell and buy later this is like this is how we gotta miss the answer these time-travel questions right like provide a bits drink of like what the stocks will do really well and then like hopefully use the earnings for good but like otherwise no I like to think about kind of not only me answers to this question I mean the other kind of lame answer is just like here's all the bat here's all the baddies to ideas like skip straight past them and go to the good ones other thing in terms of like things that I could have done better if I had kind of better models of the like the crypto space back then I don't know I mean I think there was like I don't think there's a single big thing I think they're just saying if a lot of little decisions about things that we could have that we could have focused on earlier in the end yeah start sewing is a grievance [Laughter] [Applause] we'll we'll actually do three questions from the audience and if you have a question raise your hand we'll come to you and we'll just pass you the mic am i picking Thanks Vitalik question for you and that's wrong immutability you post on this on Twitter a few weeks back yes what's your thoughts based on the feedback he got from the community on immutability and what would happen if there was a massive attack my theory I'm rolling back so on and so forth what's the feedback I got from the community on immutability issues hmm I think the thing that I underestimated is that like it's not clear that guy never on the same page in terms of the framing of the issue so like one framing of the issue and the one that I kind of had it from the beginning is like okay there exists like like if there exists some hack that we could use a state intervention forked like reverse and and like get money back from a hacker or like stop a bug or do something some other thing then like on the one hand there is good consequences which are that like people get their money back yeah on the other hand there's a bad consequence which is and it's kind of a fixed-size bad consequence which is we kind of erode the immutability principle more and you just you have to kind of weigh the cost and the benefits and like there's some int number at which the benefits become greater than the costs but I mean it seems like it's and like there is all there is kind of a lot of different different variables at stake so like things that I probably wasn't thinking about enough or like one is like I said like the number of people affected and what kinds and what kinds of behaviors were they participating in like were they participating in things where they realistically expect it should have expected danger or was this something that was advertised as kind of the wallet that people should use another and also just measuring kind of the harm not just by looking at the amount of money stolen but like the number of people affected another thing is like how disruptive would the intervention actually need to be for like and how many people would be harmed by disruptive intervention is there some is there some way of compensating them so like there's a lot of these kind of other kind of complicated factors and the key there's like even like argue for if we look at kind of arguments against doing doing an intervention like there's like it's not just about kind of breaking the principle or weakening the principle it's also about other things like just disrupting activity of the blockchain like how much activity would be disrupted in these other things so that was one thing another thing is that a lot of things a lot of people don't have I think kind of either individually clear or kind of collectively clear mental models of like what principles as a thing are and like why and like in what ways principles as a thing or valuable so like I made this tweet where I basically asked like do you think it's it's possible for a principal to like literally have infinite weights so like it's never Pollock it's never okay to give up that principle and they're like absolutely any circumstance and like to me the answer is like obviously no principle has an literally infinite weight like if there was if there was an alien invasion coming in the only way we could stop the the alien invasion was by like some making making it illegal to criticize blue-eyed people then like I love freedom of speech but if like breaking freedom of speech would stop an alien invasion and like sure I totally do it and like I have similar positions with respects to kind of pretty much pretty much every every principle I mean including blockchain immutability so kind of my model of this was like this principle is really important but it's not infinitely important but I mean first of all like there's people who sort of say that it's infinitely important but like I'm not sure that I kind of under reflection they would actually like they would actually hold on to this opinion there's also kind of like a Bitcoin aetherium cultural divides of extent to this because every tiny mega Twitter all polders out there's always like people from these other communities that kind of step in to show their opinions I mean I don't know it's complicated and like I'm definitely of the school of thought that says it's good to discuss it more and not of this school of thought that says that like the fact that we're even willing to discuss it shows show us that the etherium community does not value mutability and their and therefore were the coin like I think that school of thought is like terrible and we should like not listen to it at all um yeah I'm Pro I'm Pro discussing things and like holding to principles for a reason so that we've kind of properly reflected on ok we'll do one more question thanks to the question about douse so talking about the gap between you know so we we could be with the functionality of in the output of them versus where we are now obviously we did the first experiment it was really like okay let's just do the Dow and then we all put money into it now looking at some of the more experimentation on the marks I'd was sort of mark tau itself and now marketing Dow they're just low intermediate catch a lot of the others it's this more like slow iterative process um what do you sort of think about the difference in large Dow structure and fixing things like that versus the small down structure and fixing things like that the differences between large Dow structure and small down structure well and like the value in terms of like solving these problems right so so initially was not it but the huge one and now we're doing this more iteratively small towers are definitely more tractable like one of the reasons why Moloch that was more tractable is because it's made up of people who kind of large we know each other and who are kind of trusted to not do nasty things like automatically vote for whoever pays them the most money and in like that I think if you like kind of do towers in contexts where kind of some level of social trust already exists then the problem is more tractable whereas if you do it in context where social trust doesn't exist or where people aren't even on the same page in terms of like what okay contact is and what okay contact essence then the problem becomes more difficult like we saw this with yo s for example right like with yo s I mean like the whole thing quickly collapsed into people bribing each other to vote for each other and like creating the sort of flu to credit cartel where you have a fairly small number of people just like help based vote for each other and like pH of the B Block producers and at the beginning like I saw a lot of people arguing that like hey like bribing people like buying people's votes is not illegitimate behavior like because it because like it's a mr. free market and aren't we about building a free market system and like when you're when you have a system where like people don't even like this kind of layer of shared moral expectations is it even there at the beginning then you're relying on kind of just the raw economics you know in a much more stronger way than you normally are and so the problem is more difficult so I can some ways I'm happy that kind of the simpler cases are being tried first and then we can kind of expand the scale more and more over time I mean I'm definitely like one of the reasons I'm not in favor of on chain governance at all for example is because it's basically saying that like hey let's make it Dow and let's start with a really big Dow and oh by the way we're gonna make the day I would be so systemically important that we give it control of layer one like this like it's basically kind of combining all of the kind of ways of doing irresponsible doubt developments together whereas this sort of start small and develop and have lots of little experiments approach I think is going to be sort of more fruitful over the long term okay thank you so much guys [Music] okay so yeah liberalism radical markets Bitcoin grew fast a moment of silence for Ford Alex DMS and notifications on Twitter after this okay so I got like two minutes of things to say and then we can go out of here I know you've been sitting patiently for quite some time so I asked for your attention just for a brief moment we're gonna go over a couple last logistics but first I want to say a massive thank you to the people that are giving us access to this building which as you can see is extremely stunning this is the Center for International governance innovation interestingly actually it's founded by Jim Balsillie who is the guy that started the BlackBerry and you might notice the Lazar eatest room that we've had that was his co-founder who also started the perimeter Institute across the street but I want to say a huge shout out and please join me in like giving thanks to cg for this beautiful space right on so you've probably seen this thing this is the floor plan please take note of the yellow rooms Lazar distributor and rent room at Napoleon room the sponsors had mentioned this during their talks and you see in the schedule which I'll reference in a second this is where various sponsor talks and workshops are being given you can see the pink area that's where the food's gonna be we got lots of food for you guys you know the slide in that in a second we are in the purple area now in case you haven't oriented yourself you can hack any of the available tables any of these hacking spaces and really enjoy the space take pictures out in the Instagram it's it's really phenomenal but important do not give up the stairs that you can go up the stairs that are in the main foyer the open ones in the main open-air area but do not go up the stairs that are like in the regular you know stairwells you will you will not have a happy experience immediately you're kicked out there's absolute ethically I think it's a government building so you just just be careful with that so don't go up the stairs like I mentioned this food we got lots of food for you guys as food trucks you can get them out the about the back of this area we had the food service area you probably got some curry earlier today from there yeah you're gonna be very well fed we've even put an enormous emphasis on a healthy food not like the regular pizza you get at a hackathon this is this is like great a stuff yes should be well fed and then I got a bunch of quick things here number one if you need help at any point in time go to this great URL eath waterloo comm says help the team at change safe has been very kind to us they've set up this system which you can go to it's literally a forum like I need help with what you can find me where here's how you can get in touch with me like literally anything it's a it's a basic system it'll go to a bunch of mentors who have communicated to us that they are willing to and available to help so that's great and additionally yeah thank you again to Shan safe for a lot of the work on that [Applause] additionally you can also get helping a more of a peer-to-peer online way through a photo lucam / chat now it's also important that you know even at this moment if you can that you get on to this chat server every official announcement you get an announcement this is where we'll contact you for one of the winners so please make sure you're on discord yeah echoing what he said this is like the place to be all official announcements the sponsor chat rooms are on there if you want to find people to work with basically what I'm trying to say is like take this time while I'm speaking to like love your phone go to this website it's it's really like this should be the beating the beating heart of the event anyway so go to this thing important note though at this type of a hackathon it's very easy to accidentally start downloading an enormous amount of data and although we have like you know great internet directly you know fiber optically entered into this building it's a great building if you start doing all kinds of crazy stuff like you might screw it up so make sure you do not sync it get the parity note that's the most common way you could you can mess this up don't do downloading 4k videos you know lower the bandwidth if you can every little bit counts we shouldn't have any problems but just in case don't do the obvious stupid things please and thank you yeah so uh great the full schedule you can get on eighth Waterloo com if it's on the TVs outside you can get anywhere pretty much make sure you check this out in about 17 minutes the first workshops and talks are going to be starting in those yellow rooms I mentioned so maybe take a moment pick the ones you think of the most interesting to you and spawn just mentioned a bunch of them earlier I highly recommend going to one of those to kind of kick start the evening again there's prizes which the sponsors had referenced eath were little comps uh surprises has all of them it's a good idea to kind of get acquainted to what they are to even orient yourselves to which room to go to and finally it should go without saying but you know this is a great environment it's a fun environments an easy environment don't don't break the rules we have a very clear rules if you want to know what they are precisely but you should know what they are this type of an event respectful don't harass others don't don't abuse the situation anyway you know do unto others where you would expect them to you auntie you'd be respectful so with that being said let's get hacking thanks so much and let's get going [Applause] hello hey we're gonna do team formation here so anybody that doesn't have a team just stick here and we'll try and sort you out
