hello everybody welcome to hack money defy hackathon judging day three I am Karthik one of the cofounders of eath global and we are on our third day of judging our amazing submissions for the defy hackathon that we've done for the past five weeks so for those of you who don't know from the live stream hack money was in hackathon organized by eath global and over the past four weeks we had a little bit over 350 hackers from 40 different countries in 15 different time zones compete and work on a lot of projects in the space of D Phi and etherium we had amazing people from all these countries we had over 40 mentors who were available and and helped out all our hackers with anything technical a product and even market related help requests and an amazing set of sponsors that made all this possible by dedicating their time and resources into making sure that the teams who wanted to build on top of their platforms were successful and got the help they need to actually take composability in the space to the next level and let me say this one more time we hit over at 350 hackers spent four weeks on hacking towards amazing projects in this space and as of Sunday night when submissions ended we had a hundred eighteen dfi projects that came out of this event and this is the entire week we're taking to make sure that we review them and they get to talk to the judges and everybody else about what they've done and the third day of this is about making sure that we get to see the top projects for today so I want to quickly walk over the logistics of how the next two hours are going to work we have 14 teams today and each team will get four minutes for a demo and three minutes for questions so seven minutes in total per team and just to make sure that we're minimizing any AV difficulties we're gonna we've pre-recorded the demos for all the teams and we'll be playing those videos directly as the team's goal of and as a quick overview of how this event and the teams were set up the rules for this whole event or simple a team could have a maximum of five members they were so allowed to work individually if they wanted to and a few of them did and the only kind of main criteria was that they must incorporate defy primitives in their hacks and then of course because the event started on the 24th of April all code that was submitted for the hackathon must have been written over the course of the hackathon itself so everybody is they everything you're going to see today will be the result of what was done over the course of four weeks and in terms of kind of how judging will work our judges will be rating and scoring these teams on these five categories which would be the technicality and the originality and the practicality of a project and also the design in the UX of their submission in a general catch-all for any outliers that we call wow factor and just to remind everybody on the livestream that this is not a competition the teams are here to to learn and built the hackers are really here to share their excitement and the judges are here to primarily give their feedback not everybody's trying to become a business from these companies nor do we want them to do that necessarily a lot of them are free to try out and experiment with this space but the goal from our side is to ensure that there's a lot more experimentation so quickly the schedule for today is that these are the teams that will be going up one by one and talking about their demos and the the judges that we have for today Calvin Liu from compound alice crostini from provable things in Austin Griffith from the theorem foundation will be our 3 main judges that will be looking at all of our demos giving feedback and asking questions to to these teams and doing the hard work that frankly we are extremely thankful for and getting their comments on these projects so so with that I want to actually kick off our very first demo for the day and that is project context so please welcome project context to the zoom call and I'll let them take it from here hey guys so okay I'll share my screen but no I can't cool so I joined had money to see if I can put a theorem app on my own basically and I took a Java class and react class and then spent a decent amount wait mistake overflow and I noticed especially on the film problems I still relied mainly on asking friends all the thing as solutions were there but they were pretty hard to find and they're pretty hidden so what I started to build was the social node tool that would be able to scale it is if you're a mentor relationship and it's not a problem of content creation like we don't need a patreon clone but rather a curation I want to incentivize people to link all those juicy bits of information hidden in newsletters and special forums and the depths of Twitter feeds I linked a bet back to relevant sites with graphics like you can see here if you're on the rock so with my Chrome extension I can now edit a site's content up nodes at highlights or simply add links to useful related content and save everything to ipfs using three books and then any other application can pick this up in this case is just my extension also being able to read that so obviously you can edit and share just like a shared Google document only that now the whole Internet becomes your shared Google document and it needs your exit also follows the advantages of Reddit so there are awards and downloads summing up to public measurement of reputation just like comma and advantage of Twitter which means you can filter all public messages through your photos and allow the accounts you follow to retreat into your feet so additional to savage storage also the differences that your reputation is bound to your address which will example lets anyone directly reward you with crypto money users can choose to say anonymous or they can verify your web to their web to identities from Twitter reddit github or any other social platform and this way import the existing reputation so now also anyone could look at their Twitter name and find their corresponding link ease account so it's like a decent list after spoke right and I just want to make clear quickly that right now I'm using speed box interface and but later I want to integrate that into my UI just make it feel like a product right but it's just awesome that they've all simply use their work and played on top and just prototype quickly I know Austin laughs Ted and up until now we so we added content right and which is sort of the supply side of information and but now let's look at the demand side and those guys who need content curated for which I edit bound is so they allow anyone to secure the need for information and to add a price tag and then match those guys with content curators it's pretty similar to get coin it's nothing new and with the difference that in the end there is no wrong or right there is no working code versus program code is just information right so to fairly reward contributors we need some subjective measure of quality of information we want to contributions from accounts you follow but we also want from strangers why do you want to scale it and you want to make sure that those guys also don't spam you so to guarantee this you want to make sure you use your wealth trust and right now I'm following this guy and this is just a sort of like defy copy of Twitter you simply start by opening a funding pool of certain topic which could be say it's your own foundation who want to have a continuous pour dedicated to creating links to defy projects or assumed org you open front you yeah your Fanta pool then you follow your friends your friends then uploads a stranger post and when the body ends you world you can feedback on every every post and reward everyone according to those numbers to the upwards and finally this curation game is not just great for defy education but because it's totem ipfs any application can exist security information of these web of trust relationships between is addresses so for example you could support fake news or you could generate meta masks warnings for phishing sites right or you could have use a skin to take malicious addresses quickly or you could do stuff like your age CSS code for any web site so you can get dark mode anywhere all right and pay people for just putting up this CSS and whatever you can imagine right so yes thanks for tuning in and I'm looking forward to get your feedback so just to start it off just to think through so basically it's it's a browser extension that lets you write notes and share those notes with your social web of trust and then using signed messages basically you can basically build a web of trust between people and that's all stored in ipfs it's at a pretty good way to sum it up exactly and there's two ways to build as well trust like you could import your Twitter get up or whatever right or you could build it anonymously just for three bucks just for your address and is there a private key that's stored in the extension or are you extending some other key management system so I mean it's all good on three bucks basically okay and I'm using what is right okay so Portis Portus for the private keys and three-box for the storage and social graph exactly cool that's pretty interesting yeah I think the project is really cool what I was interesting to know is I mean to me sort of a mix between something like Wikipedia and something like Twitter so I was curious to know if you have implemented some way for the information to be accurate so some sort of filtering like Wikipedia does or if it's you know just like Twitter where everyone can you know put information there yeah I think I want to stress that this is not for information where you could say that it's wrong or right but it's a movie recommendation or restaurant recommendation which could be really valuable for you and it's like huge business in oh you know Netflix and take talking song you you cannot judge it but you cannot make a normal bounty so you need to filter it through your wealth trust for example like Twitter so I think part of it you can you can compare to Twitter a part of it you can compare to Reddit transferred to Wikipedia and yeah that's that's where God inspired from and I would love for it to become sort of Blake ground for for this kind of identity reputation stuff and so on make sense yeah so as a as a user I get this Chrome extension and then I can go to any website and basically leave a comment there and then in ipfs system is stored like a link to the website and the comment I missed the first half of his sentence as a user I download this Chrome extension and then any website I can basically leave a comment and then on ipfs there's like you know is stored all of my comments that is sort of linked to the websites that I visited I again I don't know if my problem but just like parts of your sentence dropped out but but I think you're right yeah like everybody can download the Chrome extension and then yeah comment or read the comments what one worry I think he has is like is your browser history stored somewhere where other people or even like a deaf developer could access it I mean right now everything is public right so it's pretty much like Twitter where all the messages are public but then you just saw to spam our to yourself basically but I think like with three box you could also do it privately right and you could yeah you could have a button where say you're just shared with people I follow right people I trust yep so then what was the bounty thing the bounty thing is basically like if you have a site that needs some social annotation added to it you can bounty someone to come in and use your tool to to put content there is that right yeah I mean I would see it as an exchange right like you need both sides to crawl the network so yeah pretty much like you saying right like either foundation say then we have a problem like we we cannot make everybody happy so we need to have some tour yeah 220 everybody to see what they all wanna see right like you introduce a new problem but maybe that's part of a solution yeah yeah when it sort of makes me thinking about that site that used to be pretty popular StumbleUpon like you could kind of have like curated lists of things people have stumbled upon that they want to share with their commentary on it is there any like specific yeast case that you're super excited about or that you would use it for immediately yeah just like notes or anything really like that that's littering the problem I had yeah and I can see the problem of intimidation right not not to put everything there because party could be advertisement and people are not happy about it and so on right it's like it's a thing so I would totally use it for that I will awesome well Chris thank you so much for sharing his context and what that will get the next team up on our stage and that's team income jar please welcome income jar am i sharing the video are you no you are not but there should be like a button somewhere with share screen okay yeah I see if the video pulls up you can share it yeah you have to share it at him hi my name is Adam Bloomberg and I'm here to present our hack called income jar what we wanted to do based on our time in traditional finance is find a way to give people an income stream from the assets they already have so in this case they will deposit crypto assets and we will give them an income stream with a really good rate of return behind it so the way it works is a user is going to connect their wallet decide on ether dot eath or dye a length of income which could be one three or five years in this case and their frequency which is monthly quarterly or annually connect their wallet approved the deposit will leave their wallet they will receive a jar tokens and a gr token is worth one died and will be paid at the first of the month so now we'll talk about how this actually so now we're at the income jar website where we have an explanation of of how it works for our users we go into a little more detail out some frequently asked questions and then you can create your stream so we decide we want to be paid over three years for instance monthly payments and we're going to make our deposit in E because that's what we have in our wallet or we want to pay $300 with the Beast now we've calculated that takes one for 801 6es this is from chain-link and that we will paste we will get paid 386 and died over the course of the three years and we will get 11 die per month now we go to create let's do this and we have to approve our transaction and meta mask and now we'll wait for that to tick okay now that the transaction has gone through the ralston test net I now have the jar tokens in my wallet and if I connect my wallet now I can see to get my streams and I will see this is my wallet address I make a deposit of 300 died in this case my payments are going to be 11 died every payment period the frequency of 12 cells means its monthly and the duration of 3 tells me that it's annual we'll also be able to do with transfer the street so if I want to be able to send some of my tokens to someone else or sell some of my tokens to someone else I can do so and they will then get my payment stream ok so behind the scenes is the fund management once a user deposits their funds in it goes into an investment pool we then look at the investment pool and we take two months of worth of payout and put it into what we call the payout pool this is where we keep money safe it will be saved in died there will always have two months worth of payouts and very safe we will then have an investment pool that we will manage actively some of this will be using liquidity pool some of it will be doing various sorts of lending we might do some staking other ways to manage this investment will also be calculating the net present value of that investment pool and anything above the NPV will be sent into a safety pool which we will manage only in lending protocols here's a diagram of that fund management some of the use cases we see are to remove the investment risk if I've already made my money I can now create an income stream of I can send remittances back to my family in another country I can use it for a while for my kids in college I might use it for certain payment terms like rent and mortgage or some sort of project escort please visit our website income Giorgio if you have any questions we look forward to answering okay thanks to Deena guys I feel like this is probably right at Calvin's alley he knows he probably knows more about this than I do so I yield to other questions from other judges on this one first oh yeah this is really nice so one thing I'm not sure I caught is how the jar tokens interact with I guess the stream so do you have to redeem them are they like somehow bird or like how do you actually it looks like they're sort of fungible tokens that are one diaper one month but how do you actually redeem them for the for the die there er see 20 tokens Jason can you tell him how you yeah for now we started with the ERC 20 tokens and thinking of ever venturing to seven seven seven later but because the whole key was tracking the tokens so we're gonna send you all of your jar tokens upfront so we know how many we sent you we know the date you set them to uhand so when we go to send you your monthly payment we know if we've sent you any already and that sort of thing so we know how many died to send you for that amount with Jar tokens that you carry and then the jar for instance that Jar tokens for a June of 2020 will be burned right yet the number of dyed tokens yeah that's yeah that's the idea same with a transfer essentially with the transfer you're gonna burn what you have in the new person he's going to get minted their new stuff so every day the day that you make the deposit you'll get your June tokens your July 2020 your August 2020 and such and so at that date on the month those will convert into dye and then the nice thing is of course we always know how much our cash flow is our cash outflow will be and you can then again trade those tokens I send them to someone else but they can't spend them until that date guys make it transfer them all they want but the the numbers still say the same for that stream owner where it originated from the counts we can keep track that's and of course some of it is still in the works because there's a lot of ends to touch points with that yeah once that they start moving around from wallet - wallet I can see it getting a lot more complex yeah where do you actually track the sort of movements and you know what to do in which month oh I've been using essentially events that admit the strux that were created from my contracts cope with the just the data that I push through the contracts and again just from a financial perspective this comes from our time on my in Ron's in the financial services world traditional financial services comes from the idea of annuities where our clients have wanted to generate an income stream based on some level of assets they have and we feel that as as we try to get more adoption of defy and and cryptocurrency and such there needs to be more applications that kind of mirror what what we've seen in traditional finance because we feel like traditional finances come a certain direction because there's been a demand for it so this is something that we didn't see a certain product in the marketplace and we decided that eventually that there will have to be something like this and our goal is also to almost make this a white label or someone else could take the the workings of it and do their own fund management behind the scenes whether it's completely defy based or defy and C Phi based and be able to create that income stream much like an insurance company would create an annuity for their clients anymore final comments from the judges just making sure I understand it so basically you guys set up an ER C 20 that is locked in a contract and then they invest and get those lock tokens and you kind of run the fund and make it generate money and then later on they can turn their tokens back in at some time and the smart contract basically says it after this timestamp and if it is and it lets them swap those 20s for die or something like a stable corn yeah pretty much cool yeah cool awesome thanks guys thank you yeah all right next up we have team naive dot money and I'm going to play the video for them you this is naive a stable can aggregate with Putin foreign exchange I'm cured Fernando otherwise known as Luka number on Twitter once is used ooh ma you swap chain link the problem foreign exchange risk for non-americans in the decentralized finance market take my word for it it sucks like a go on the battle for days we're going at 4 minutes I'll just take my word for it dollar buyers I feel the best way to fix this is basically through like local stable coins right you're stable quite unstable Quinn's where we from Ruby stable Quinn's the problem is is that the market doesn't reflect this right the majority of the market is driven by US dollar questions and yeah and you just what we're lucky enough to have one year obtain a top ten but still it's because of course October basically the entire market depends on tether BTC Perry and multi-cap drive stability stability drives monkey cap and that's why you can see like comparing die with us DC well bam dazzling place so how do we fix this how do we and they will non US dollar coins and even smaller less established you still quest again to the game right the hypothesis we can bootstrap let's establish table coins for providing and or encouraging liquidity but facilitating look up domain-specific stable coins you can drive the free market bring you defi everywhere Dyson dream essentially how it works is you have source assets like I turned it the night through depositor you can take one die get one night don't think 1 million die get 1 million nine dollars for you can take how many stasis could say my naive us right and that works for every SIM cards that we support the ideas that become maintains like the useful and also he will tell you now you dollars into euros whatever but naive exchange takes right price retraining all right so the postal contract beautiful takes the input capital goes you so sure how that works right now you my Jewish great facility you want to tell 90 naive because now using liquid found that's the transaction to sign it and see what happens okay magic I'll show you that Casey I'm some magic happens some some stuff happened unuseful it quickly people created and my ears sent it to someone's eye right now man one thousand nine years amazing so suppose that really simple doesn't have an Oracle doesn't have anything like that just as a minimum buddies naive acid by body for the nyeba tolerate and so met it reverse with wintry Stability Mechanism ok the naive exchange that basically what guarantees your tokens will have pound tokens contact what it should be because we can just turn them it'll I thought this let me show you how that works I want to turn 500 years into 540 490 the transaction was a sign it and time I get around to it and look that's it the cheaters changing we take the green burn it and I'ma really simple and highly accident demo you going to get home get some Rick can you die for the instructions back you're good okay use cases remittance the tree you can turn your money any currency instantly you can bootstrap will like them only station able Queens whole powerful investment although the globe etc right yeah won't work in rule like this demo will not work that's why we're working on some more sophisticated solutions that would include the entire experience deposits because cash I instantly if they have like changing their components having a Dow stuff just basically awesome about one paper hey thanks a lot for presenting this I think it's a very interesting concept and I have a couple of questions actually so our first question is how do you so my understanding is that basically this project focuses on sort of converting the stable coin impact to US dollars into some other country specific currency so while I understand the part where you convert from US dollar into night token I was wondering how the other the other side of things works so if I'm supposed to receive I don't know like euros or whatever other currency or I don't know GBP so is there an interface where I can convert my night token into this other stable coin or how does it work okay so right now there is no interface it's just three to scan the contracts of you can't like have to manually do it the I'd use that if you wanted to turn like a Fiat euro stable point into you like USD see the ideas you turn your your stasis yours into naive viewers and then you'd go through the knife exchange and then you get night dollars and then you'd go through units up to that you redeem the USD see I see okay and then I had another question that I I think it was me not understanding how it exactly works because I think at some point you mentioned that it doesn't depend on an Oracle but then you also mention that you're using chaining so I was wondering like how yes so essentially like why this is that because it is are different from the exchange so which turns us DC into naive dollars which is like a one-way thank you tell us DC in tonight those we can't tell you back you have to go through unit swap that doesn't use an Oracle what that does is it basically compares the reserve ratios on unislope based on the given user parameters it doesn't use a use of Oracle just checks whether the ratios or within set parameters I see okay thanks that's interesting could you is there a reason you can or can't just I guess you have like the collateral assets pool you couldn't just let people turn naive assets back into the underlying assets if there's enough liquidity yeah so this is sort of I guess reminds me of like the synthetic assets on synthetics a little bit but it'd be like if you could deposit any form of dollar peg stable coin and then you sort of get like one naive stable coin sort of so instead of like with synthetics do you have like get at the next we have to get as if tonight like balloons the ideas are basically any currency within the network with technically work I would just build more units for yeah I've seen like you know like high down with the sort of btc-e the different year so you when you're PTC's that are wrapped together into one token I feel like this is a pretty interesting trend that's sort of trying to arise that you're tapping into yeah it's you you weren't just wrapping one asset but you're wrapping a bunch of things and the fact that they're all wrapped with the same wrapper gives them some kind of exact audience way of exchange advice like so you put dye in USD C and tell them they don't really need it but let's say for example liquid tea protocol is about to come out how do you trap look I'm the quiddity for liquidity protocol a brand new US dollar stable coin or even like if I wanted to create a really nice table coin for a developing country how am I going to like me shopping because it is the is essentially a aggregating like you're using more powerful stable coins the back less used ones and also your mean game was very strong that's an important part of the presentation gotta have strong links thanks a lot man this is great but you can only agree that means are important yeah thank you thank you all right the next team up is flash for all I guess sharing here the second hello thank you so much for allowing us to present this amazing project to you we're excited to announce flash for all flash for all is a simple UI that allows anyone to benefit from arbitrage opportunities and defy without the need for capital or code this is our team you have able Alexander Chris and deal so well defy has defy has allowed for a massive amount of economic opportunities one of which is arbitrage opportunities between Texas right the market is huge but the market is inefficient which means that there's multiple price discrepancies amongst the same asset in the different decentralized exchanges right but to take advantage of those you have to be a sophisticated developer with the deep understanding of defy and a substantial amount of capital to invest less risk which leaves out a lot of people with the ecosystem awesome so our solution was built with this in mind we built a simple interface the last anyone's able isn't saying we're gonna continue to iterate through the presentation we want to make it so you don't need code or capital restraints on your opportunities to trade and earn money in defy space this also helps our solution also helps to defy market a more fair and more efficient in what they're doing do you know is going to show you the demo so this is our simple easy to use UI at the very top you can see the technically she able start with trust between we're gonna select die and trade between that with the results are organized by return on investment as you can see it goes to you the first one goes to Eunice flop and it's died can't see the link because current user has 40 minus wallet any additional ones would be using a flash Lombardi to to get the additional funds wants to use let's go to trade it would go some in a minute math transaction and if it's confirmed in the user will create his return in more tokens if it fails don't in user would lose would be his guys for the transaction fee no bills okay so how did we achieve this so what is under the hood a three-step approach so first we grab surprising data from various Texas currently Eunice WAP and Cairo are supported second we calculate the arbitrage opportunities those usually a regular regular arbitrage opportunity and also treat triangular arbitrage opportunity and the good thing for the users we include also the the trade fees so we find the trades so you don't have to and finally also if you don't have enough funds in your wallet we are able to provide you the funds was a flesh wound too fun to trade so this is a solution how can we think of extending it going forward so one possibility is to provide an automated execution because as you've seen most of the times of course negative and so it's difficult to find the right opportunities on the spot second is we could think of that you invest your money in approach one interest when there are no opportunities at the moment third is also true yeah have some kind of guess tokens covered and balanced guess prizes when they're quite high and as just at the moment and also more features like further flash loan use cases to it and finally I would years to establish a business model like taking a fee from assets under management also take a share of each successful trade so that is in fact our solution and our ideas going forward and we are looking forward to your questions I'm all about giving users that don't have access to something a beautiful UX and let them let them use these new primitives I really like the idea of making arbitrage they're accessible to to a lot of users that I'm worried that like within your Koran or is like it's almost like arbitrage I don't know a turn about it but it seems like if you have all the available parameters on your website you could probably just figure out what what are good arbitrage opportunities yourself like why even expose this to the user why not just have it automatically looking for anything that would give you value and have it working like is it is the goal just to expose users to defy and get them in because if we say the goal is then then we're throwing on a slow pitch and that's great but is the goal actually like making money and have people incentivize by making money then like could you just run this yourself and make money so we thought about that a lot actually at the beginning the thing we found inspiration from was like defy zaps and pull together so in something we did get to and kind of realize later of what you're talking about is adding that where you're just earning interest and then we have the proprietary trading algorithm basically that's just executing on those trades to add more value to the people that are in the pool we're in and that's like the perfect way to do it if we're not everyone's able to see the arbitrage opportunities but you're able to get the benefits of everything at that point that's the next iteration just adding on that interest their income and we can do proprietary trades there at that point graduate trading outlet I'm curious as a consequence of building this which is it's really slick and well presented to if you learn anything interesting about like the amount and magnitude of arbitrage opportunities that actually exist so we like three weeks ago there's probably I don't have ten to fifteen opportunities every hour and now the I've watched the efficiency of most of the stuff like become the markets become more efficient also what was it Black Thursday really allowed there's a lot of space there so whenever there's a big upward swing just understanding how long you have see about three weeks at every time before the markets become efficient in the deck space is pretty cool so that was really cool yeah yeah it's interesting yeah I think it's a really interesting you know project if kind of for my many of the automation that gelato finance proposes but I think it's a bit more advanced so I was wondering specifically like who did you build this for because I mean it seems that to me you need to be able to understand pretty well how things work to use it but at the same time like not so well so yeah so I'll say I built it we built it before us we built it for a kid I had because I was having issues rounds like I don't have enough capital to make all these different trades and I was like there's got to be a way to do this more efficiently and and then from a user perspective we did want to dumb it down a lot so if you're familiar with trading or if you're like kind of new to this space it shouldn't be too cumbersome we didn't if we'd like to continue to I'm probably to add like that how to use the the platform kind of page but it should be really easy to just say I clicked on die I want I see there's a positive trade I want to execute the trade I don't need any capital if I don't have any capital and then it executes which we've been able to do that so that's what we wanted to happen awesome thank you team splash for all oh can I just add a quick thing as well just for that so um another another interesting way that this could potentially develop is that say for example you have you know fun city in a smart contract our technology can work in the background and look for arbitrage opportunities and kind of spot ones that are perhaps maybe profit support and then actually execute the trade and without even without you even knowing right and then you're able to kind of get take advantage of all these opportunities and it's kind of all automated so yeah that's something that we're thinking about as well in the future awesome awesome stuff guys I'm always looking to see this really heady technology get exposed to manual users and have them be able to figure this out so I always look look for projects like this to kind of glaze those trails thanks guys thank you thanks good thank you next up we have my d5 pie Jeff you want to join and start your speed sure okay all right so yeah this capital is on the trend toward personalizing investment you hi this is Jeff Bennett with my solo hack I defy pilots you roll your own absurdly diversified mutual fund powered by defy customers for this include anyone new to investing and anyone terrified at current world events that's crypto people who don't trust banks and retail investors who remember 2008 now you can buy a mutual fund if you live in a country where that's allowed and safe but you have to choose from whatever the broker offers it might have gold stocks but not physical gold paper bitcoin but not real crypto and of course you're handing over your funds to them and paying peace for the privilege with my defy pie you can have all these things at any level of investment experience and through the magic of defy instead of paying someone to manage and rebalance your portfolio you earn fees while traders do it for you you land on a home page showing the underlying technology and how it works say you're a novice with no idea what to do just go to the model portfolios with performance metrics and copy one to start with now you have a pie for gold as paxos tokens crypto is a basket you've chosen by sector and settings cash is a basket of stable coins also chosen in settings equities are implemented by uma synthetic tokens to customize click Edit pie and now you can set the asset class allocation on the left and choose for proportions of coins in your chosen crypto sector and stable coins by moving the sliders for equities you can pick stocks or ETFs when you're done Save Changes will calculate returns and back tests when you're happy with it choose an investment amount and create your portfolio now it gets complicated but I found two ways to make it as easy and user-friendly as possible if you know nothing about crypto you can start with the Portus wallet or you can use meta masks it'll resolve your ENS name and avatar but the biggest convenience is the mapping engine that finds a path between what tokens you have and what you need here you need us TC and you have it so it just takes it from your balance if it's infeasible it tells you why if you don't have P BTC you can't get it on Shane right you have to make a Bitcoin transaction so it goes out to P tokens and gives you a deposit address if you have us DC it would rather earn 8 percent of Nexo then use it here it'll swap your died for us DC when you're happy with a plan click create balanced portfolio and it'll walk you through the process first it shows you the plan which you can revise at any time if you have equities you create the synthetic first then it shows you all the swaps it needs to do with Rafa and Eunice whap and the resulting final components of your balanced portfolio finally you can manage your synthetic and the portfolio as a whole if your synthetic is in the yellow or red zone you can deposit collateral until you have a safe green bar you can also request it withdrawal which takes two hours anytime before that you can cancel your request if you wait the two hours and no one challenges you then you can actually withdraw and your metrics will update you can also increase your collateral by redeeming some of the synthetic tokens and you see the metrics change with the balancer you can edit the allocation say you want less Bitcoin and more gold you tell it what you want it lets you know what token transfers that will cause and if you approve it and have the tokens it will change the weights you can also finalized which prevents further changes but it's better for the quiddity when you're done and logout everyone can see the current says synthetics with collateralization metrics and balancers with their allocations you can click on a balance and bring it up in the balance recite or clicking a synthetic address and interact with the contract i built this with builder and ganache on a fork of Maine at the scripts to initialize token balances and everything uma needs in the rails back-end thank you Wow super cool yeah it's really really nice you somehow got every single piece sort of like a mutual fund ecosystem nice work via a nice UI too I really like how you expose basically how everything works in sort of a user friendly way even though it's really complicated under the hood when one how it works question uh and this is me being a little bit unfamiliar with uma are you actually collateralizing and creating the synthetic acid are you choosing from a list that they already have well it makes it okay now there are there are so that was a lot of prep work in order to do that I have to deploy you're the creator contract and then that has to be initialized as much stuff so that's all the scripting does in the beginning so there's the app has the Creator contract and then once you're in there it actually it will create the expiring contract and then deposit into it and there are some subtleties to it for you know if you want to use to it you directly there are a couple levels of this too because it's it's it's meant to be personalized for any level of user so this is kind of intermediate is you already you know to understand synthetics you have to already that's a little heavy weight for a total novice but you could easily have something where either it doesn't have synthetics or it picks a like one that already exists and uses that or it uses a I also wanted to get to this but I want to do because I don't think the balancer supports it yet but there's a way to have a perpetual synthetic which there was a paper on that that I saw you basically make a balancer that is to synthetic tokens with different explorations and then it relates it automatically and then you know it swaps it but the balancer has to be able to do that per block I don't think that's quite there yet but when that's there then I could do one of those as a perpetual synthetic and I could even pick a synthetic like an index fund already exists and then I would also have a price identifier already existing so it would be a lot it'd be no barrier at all and also you could do also with the peak I think the P tokens thing is actually critical to have other part of diversification diversification is to have other non aetherium things and of course you can compose an infinitely you could have a PI - Eric don't beat et C++ right you could have shares of other complex things in this is part of this it's really complex you put a ton of different options and and baskets here like it's really there's just a lot here it's really cool to see the difference between a one-month hackathon project and you you just skimmed you skimmed right over the back testing and I think I've seen you submit something similar with but that testing stuff you there's like a whole back testing engine so weird because I come from traditional finance right yeah okay by here so finance that's where the data comes for this and we do like custom ETFs but obviously only with stocks and and even we've rebalanced quarterly and even I was trying to say well why don't we balance monthly because our data's monthly and they're like that's crazy talk monthly you know this is daily so I had no idea what a daily rebalance would even do because no one does that so I did it and what it turns out and yeah you can look at the demos live I have a demo that comments out most of the actual blockchain stuff which doesn't work you know it's not deployed I mean anyway so it wouldn't work anyway but it just kind of like skips that and goes right to the server and assumes it worked but you can actually play with the back testing and look at the zoom in on the thing we had a convenient apocalypse you know so you can see the dip and the price and then you can see how how it had to rebalance really hard I just only had four minutes I couldn't show all that but it turns out the rebalancing daily really preserves the value interesting you know is there any calculates the returns it calculates traditional back returns as if you just bought this thing and didn't touch it for a year I mean it does the return on the back testing is what if it rebalanced every year what if you actually had this in the balance or the whole time what would it do it it actually gives you more like goes minus 50 and it was like 2.8 or a 3 or 4% or something so it seems to like slightly rise and maintain the value when you do daily rebalancing because I don't think anyone does this or this has never been done in finance so I wanted to see how it would look awesome it's really cool it sounds like you also use like a lot of like protocols different protocols and you them together so it's really cool to see such a project and yeah I was just wondering like one last question so Easter is pre-allocated I mean like do you have a series of sets that are already pre allocated with a series of undermined opposites so that users can only choose you know the profile risk they want to keep or ease the users that basically is educated enough to be able to choose the education himself well that's what the model portfolios are for in the very beginning right so there's a they're a bunch of Muslim conservative one crypto there's some that don't have synthetics there's some that are just mostly crypto in cash it's all on the demo you can see so you can pick that you can start if you're a total novice like I said in the demo you can start from one of those like that I started with a conservative one which is a mix which is a lot of cash and a little bit of can you know synthetics but you can you can pick whatever you want or you can design your own you also can pick which which type of kryptos you want there's by yeah you can Jeff you want now you're limited by the balance or it can only have eight things Jeff I hate to cut you off but we're gonna have to move on to the next team we're a few minutes over for the session but really awesome presentation up I'm very excited to see how it turned out thank you right the next team up is open kyc protocol huh hey I'm gonna share the video for you this is relize financial ID so it's only me in the team and why we need a decentralized financial ID if we treat each address as a blank address will not be able to give lower rates better credits and add a layer of trust so we get more loans or we add new services that a lot of banks has we also have a problem of proof financial support in the unbanked countries so it's going to give us a lot of benefits so what I'm trying to do is have a credit score verification ID like document decentralized - I like transactions and activities and you scratch ography to use like zero knowledge proof or corruption to keep the privacy and let's go into the path of panics so the current version is not working fully decentralized it's not well crafted but the upcoming version will work on having a decent fully decentralized it's going to you IDs so it's not to rely on any provider is going to use decentralized articles instead of the graph it's going to use no J's in MongoDB and we are going to have new standards for credit scoring kyc one thing that I'm trying to do is so we swim or encryptions you don't want proof and we build the service exclusion protocol so you don't have to give the full data to the services let's go to the demo so let's sign him like the profile we'll have some statistics and we have the courtesies that we support and the identity section we have the verification that we are going to do maybe you are going to use some API or we are going to do a kind of foundation to verify we have the ability to add addresses by signing and in the future we are going to have like the ability to add bitcoin addresses and here we have like the proof of financial support that have been done here we can create one but it's not like fully done so and it's going to be hard on a smart contract and after that so other people can verify it as it's coming from this ID provider and here we have to define usage history and we have like here this statistic about the totally like locked in the defy services and like that and this is my demo thank you awesome so it's kind of like like a web 2.0 signature-based system for defy accounts or like an attestation to a person's kyc is that is that am I thinking of it correctly yeah like so taking the data and trying to make kind of IDs or other device services can use it provide like and does it does it write anything on chain or give them some kind of nft that another service could use to like on chain check that they have already gone through kyc I'm trying to like connect it with tid so even if the server is shut down another services can continue Carly oh yeah I mean identity on chain is definitely like a very big problem many people tried to solve in the past years so it's cool to see that someone else is working on it so I was just wondering like what like why did you build this I mean did you build it for it to be interpreted specifically by other projects so that like is it an easier way for projects to process kyc or is it or is this a way for users to you know like log in get KY sit there and then sort of free use these in other places like porting these somewhere else like I think the client of it will be like compound and others because if they weren't like to provide the other things we talked about they need to use it so it's not directly will get to the user maybe it will go into the process when I registered to a therapist create I see thanks yeah I guess that like one last question is like it seems that you use some that you are quite familiar with what you're doing so I was wondering like if this was your first arc or if you are you have been you know into the space for quite some time like blood chain space make for second masters and like for defy I'm totally new like don't have much experience I was just trying to think like how much it's working and how much it's providing value I think like that I thought this is important like point why we're not having a lot of value in the space yeah keep hacking it's it it takes it takes some time in this space to really figure out where you can have a lot of effects so just keep building and keep hacking and keep attending these hackathons and we'll see you at the next one - thank you for this there's a good project Thank You shocky next up we have team opium sorry okay team they're gonna show their project and just after this we're gonna have a short five-minute break but I will let the team start the presentation my name is Ali I'm a team lead at opium and I wanted to introduce you our project for hike money hackathon initially we wanted to build so-called opium smartphones which supposed to bring people better yields for lending and borrowing the money using the peer-to-peer lending and that utilizing opium protocol and many other projects we wanted to be like holder book version or OTC version we thought a lot about math but you were so busy with our main project so at the end we understood we are running out of time so I'm gonna show you other project which we built specially for hackathon it's called opium dashboard we tried to put some publicly available data in there to gather them together so it's gonna be easy for opium protocol users to browse the opium data and here is the DAP we deployed it on side Skynet here is the possibility to log in with many different wallets especially parties you can check it out here we can make it our wallet we sign the message to form an access token here we are they are logged in unfortunately this account doesn't have any positions on opium so I'm gonna show you how it should look when you have some positions here the positions which are gotten from the graph protocol thank to them we can browse easily a lot of data on all the projects in d5 and here is the explore button which leads you to the more explained overview on the positions and on the derivatives and we actually wanted to add more data but we faced some problems at the end which we couldn't resolve in time with the the graph with our sub graph which we implemented but also we have some data from Oracle's which we are currently using it's like chain link eth to die source here is the link and more data is coming unfortunately we couldn't make more so we will be working on that definitely in future but thank you for your time good bye so it seems like it's kind of like a web 2.0 dashboard for the Opium protocol is out what could we can we dive in just a second and talk about what the Opium protocol is so I understand it cuz I don't think I even know what that is sorry I think some problems yeah actually we were thinking a lot about our hack and we thought that there are plenty of time but we understood that there is not that the last three days and we need to do something with that and we wanted to I don't know P but somehow at least to present something because you were like as organizers we're encouraging us like bring something like at least something so yeah we tried to use some of the technologies that we developed like so far like we have some kind of library for authentication which handles like different kind of libraries so we created our cool way to create access token for web 2.0 but using web 3.0 so we are like having a heap 7 171 to sign type data so people could see what exactly they're signing like you see that there is a signature to login to such project there is an expiration of this access token and so on so you don't even need to like ask your users to register to save passwords or something but you can simply use your web 3 as identity web 3 like provider as a identity and you can even like allow you just to do something on their behalf on your back-end for example in our balance we have order books so people could cancel their orders and we can make sure that they're the right person yeah and here we created the dashboard for for the open protocol positions we really like the graph protocol because they're doing really good job for the community and they allow you to just create some graph structure for the data and connect them together and query them so yeah that's my sleep it's funny how building I built a lot of doubts and it's funny how I'll get the contract done in an hour and then it'll take me three days to get the front end where I need it to be so I understand that there's a lot of those primitives in within the front end that take a lot of time and also you use these kind of events to like motivate you to just go hack on something right like it's just it's just a good time to go build something so get your good work and keep building thank you OPM network is for swap swaps right it's basically a protocol for any kind of derivatives and we were mainly focusing on swaps first so we made the interest rate swap for compound rates for example like you can get a fixed rate and swap it like you you can swap your floating rate to the fixed one or if you want to I don't gamble on the floating rate you can just simply imagine it as a futures on interest rate so and many other derivatives like options on gas price and functions on a tearoom to die and futures did you build your own sub graph like two months ago and we are still upgrading it more and more and actually why we don't have much of the data right now on the dashboard because like exactly few hours before the submission there was some bug with them or with us we didn't figure out it yet but we created like some cool stuff like we wanted to show the chart how how much total value is locked in and but that couldn't didn't work so well just get it only did it to point get it all right I think we're going to wrap there thank you for presenting oh my gosh like I said earlier we're gonna move into a short five minute break so take this time to get up stretch your legs do a quick yoga session and get prepped for the second half of today's session see you in five minutes you you you you you you you well guys hey Ethan let's give it a little bit to make sure everybody is returned few seconds and then you can kick it off okay I'll just share my screen in the meantime all right looks like everybody's back take it away so yeah um so about two weeks ago before did this play before the hackathon I was setting up a referral campaign for the company I worked for and just notice there were so many problems and it was frustrating so what we did was came up with this idea to put to create a peer-to-peer referral system where you can create referral campaigns within minutes and it involves us connecting your Google Analytics through UT perimeters that connects your public key to the referral marketer you deposit f or stable coin into the Portus wallet and then it distributes per click or sale to the referral marketer right now pricy software time-consuming to set up and there's a lot of intermediary Clair's in the loyalty market so what we're doing is we have no upfront cost doesn't cost any money for the referral marketer takes minutes to create and instantly connects your referral marketers wallet for the payout so the demo unfortunately we were one of the teams I pulled an all-nighter on Sunday and we had performance issues we were all pretty sad being last minute but I'll kind of explain what we built to you basically you as a referral marketer we have this is our reward per sale is our trademark product that's where it will go out as commission when a sale happens from the referral market but what we did was we built a reward per click scenario that we're trying to showcase to you from this video but I'm gonna explain so basically when you create when you start a campaign you sign up to Portis and then goes to a screen where you select your either if it's per click reward per click or reward per Commission obviously we're skipping the API connection to Google Analytics here and then you basically go to the campaign feed and you're receiving a referral campaign link that you give to the referral marketers and it's that quick and then your referral marketers use that link and if a purchase happens from that link being tracked by Google Analytics the payment actually goes out instantly from that commission and that's after you deposit crypto into the wallet so go a little bit under the hood here we use Portus for the sign up and also supports the distributed infrastructure we also set up in a CNS and we actually did test bots on telegram to interact with crowd link and that gives the proof of ownership also P tokens allows for different swaps and we actually did built the Bitcoin the P token part not right now in the demo but so I'm get help for you to see but we plan to actually incorporate that later on add more to it so what we need to do now is test with some projects because we're pretty ready uh what we're gonna do is a white label for any company that wants this for free we actually don't charge the referral market that could've sorry the referral creator so that's really our next step but as you see from the referral how revenue works we charge the referral marketer so basically you average $100 as your the cost to buy your product you want 20% Commission it's then that we take a small cut when the referral marketer makes the sale so that's why it's no cost for the referral creator this is our team actually our second hackathon we've done together we did one in September or by Nantz hackathon for a project called crowd click that did paper attention model for advertising we're actually still working on that we got a grant from Matic Network so we're gonna launch that product this year also now in the books is to launch this product this year to go live so thanks guys it's awesome so let me first a little bit so we've got so much running say I have my website like each build or something like that but I want to drive traffic to it so I set up referral links for other people that can post them somewhere else and if traffic flows through those you guys are kind of using Google Analytics like an Oracle when someone hits it then you trigger a payment you know web 3 wallet using port is very cool yeah exactly and this API we're gonna find out when we talk to companies that we can connect to coinbase commerce right if they're tracking their sales through coinbase we could do PayPal so it's actually the possibilities are endless it makes sense really we we do like five companies first we do white labels for and then we discover the pattern and then we can scale that product for anyone to use that's how we have to go about it yeah Nate this is a great a coupon project project right it's like it's it's it's inventive and then when you're on the other side of it you're like oh yeah of course but you kind of have to have the idea yeah yeah and I couldn't believe no one I don't know why the loyalty market isn't testing with peer-to-peer infrastructure for this this really automates the whole thing so it was a it was a fun discovery now we'll see what challenges lie ahead though right it's sometimes when something seems too good to be true there's something amiss right so we'll see did you accidentally trigger something and pay a whole bunch or something like that some weird civil we did find something concerning with Google Analytics we figured out how to manipulate and hack it by ten so we could literally now if we wanted to be a fishing company right we could actually change your Google Analytics data as it used not even connected to it so we need to what we have to really do is look at where people are getting their payments and connect there but I'm going we're gonna send Google this vulnerability we found so we'll see also what they said but yeah so that was already one barrier that we're gonna solve but that's gonna be probably through just connecting where people are tracking their sales exactly for their APs yeah it's actually a really nice project and I mean like like I remember that we did like within our team with the other Hawks some time ago just for fun and it was a similar project but for YouTube videos so and basically the Creator was getting paid like based on peers in crypto currencies so this kind of reminds me of that and I really hope that you guys will bring this forward so yeah I was wondering if of course now it's based on Google Analytics but is there the idea to expand that and like bring it into like specific platforms such as you know YouTube or other platforms well I actually don't see anyone stopping using this system for like their YouTube channel if they did want to do if the reward per click looks attractive you can put a low amount there and just move traffic to your YouTube channel from the referral marketer and we'll have some like security options were like trying to look at their IP so they're not copying but we'd have to look more into that what we believe works the best though would be the sales per commission when I started talking other companies they want something like that so it sounds interesting we just need to you know find the right ones that want to try it out companies do the white label and then we'll see how it goes yeah yeah good luck with that I mean like I think it's definitely a use case that exists and people definitely want to you know promote their websites and their services so I think this is a great hockey yeah thanks yeah great super interesting um and yes surprise that hasn't been tried yet but a lot of potential here really interesting to see like what specific use cases make the most sense are you trying to talk to non crypto companies to you try to deploy this well I think it's smart we start with the crypto neat right but actually using an onboarding ramp for Fiat is very attractive because actually companies we would pull from their card when a sales made so they don't pay anything they just gonna have their card so I do and you these the companies that are making sales they needs to be quick sales these can't be like you're talking with a customer for two months then you make the sale this has to be like a saws model where you look at the site for ten minutes you buy or a product a general product so it would be it's gonna be interesting to see if crypto how to analyze how actually crypto companies are tracking their revenue and how long it's taking what is the process to eventually get revenue but yeah yeah I it does seem more attractive though just general Fiat like companies that are not even part of blockchain I think would probably use it the most yeah awesome awesome Thank You Ethan he really appreciate that thank you thank you we're gonna move on to team Octus you can start screen sharing if you're ready to go hello we are out to steam and we are presenting a CEO a protocol for decentralized options SEO is a protocol for trading mining and exercise tokenizer options there are three different parts the first is a factor for creating new call or put options tokens each of these talking contracts allows users to might and exercise options there is also an interface for trading those options using 0x protocol on this demo we will be using a material called shown with a 200 TV as destroyed brands first step we create the token using the SEO token factor using the effector to create a new option generates our talking with a standard name that contains the most important components of the option contract this is the token we have just created and its name let's consider that the price of the ether right now is below 200 and Bob once yourself the hitter for 200 here as DC he could place a limit order an exchange and wait if it gets filled or it could write a co-option we just created to make this token Bob loves one eater and now he can sell it for someone else I've been selling this token someone has the right to buy his eater at 200 USD see he goes to the website hitch we should mind the call option it selects the workshop he decides shall collateralize one eater is 19 102 in confused and it's done now he can place the other person selling the stock if we choose the amount one and the price 5 USD C and place the limit order now let's consider a lease at least belief the interim price will rise because they knew it didn't kill it will fail and the market is still not pricing this she wants to limit to a disc to a smaller amount than buying one in two so she decides by the eternal call option for 5 us this is quite simple she virtua the website she place a buy order of one option and completes the transaction you at least can now use the token to buy one eater it 202 USD see she sends 200 USD see and the talking and she has hit one hit from the condom now that the intima price went up she can go to the website and still buy for 200 to USD see she completes the transaction and what happens is that the 200 USD seal will be sensible and she will he sealed his one-hitter now it's processing the transaction and we will show it was processed and that the ETA went show her wallet while the 200 music s deceive when she Bob's well thanks everyone we are live at issue dot finance and we are planning to develop next we want to make possible to exercise options without sending the 200 USD see using flesh swaps and also creating products like a volatility index or capital guaranteed products using interest to buy options yeah this is extremely cool I think it's you know we're sorry see a lot more interesting options at defy yes the first question I have is I I'm not super familiar with a like open I think is probably one of like maybe the main name and decentralized options right now how is this in what ways is this different than that yeah okay use only swap right so you can choose the price you want to sell and we believe using 0x or the book maybe another what the book is better and there are also some small difference like we support call options more similar to traditional markets and also we always use the collateral that represents the obligation so there is no so in so veins risk yeah that makes a lot of sense actually probably the interplay between the two different systems like a water book system and that system will be really really interesting it hopefully helped bring you liquidity as well what are the constraints on adding other assets so like you want to add fixed or just liquid it is very simple to add the it's a we defector Allred supports any talking or heating as collateral it's pretty simple even the name we showed would be a standard for all using the and symbol so we already support is more about having liquidity right so we are focusing on a didn't first and then we can expand to other tokens interesting so you don't even need an Oracle because I can specify like whatever strike price no big encoded right in the contract right like you I can coded into the ERC 20 and then someone basically just chooses to buy that whether or not like looking at those hard-coded values they choose or not it's just kind of like escrow it's like a national contract on an option and it isn't it provides simplicity because you have a very hard coded right into the contract that's neat yeah I'd be really interested to see it like really generalize beyond just ether USD price I think that could be really cool but it's awesome that you put this together over a month or so and it makes sense to it's like one of those good ideas I said this earlier and they call too but a lot of times a good idea when you're on the other side someone's already had the good idea you say oh of course but you don't have the idea yourself it doesn't count this is one of those ideas it's like it seems very obvious to load up those parameters for the option in contract and just deploy it very very like simplistic and kind of not brute force but very visceral it should be right there and everybody can see it exactly and they can choose those parameters they don't have to like dive into some weird equation to figure out whether or not they want to buy they can see right in a hard-coded details if they want that RC 20 or not that's neat dude hackathon project thank you excellent Thank You team for presenting really appreciate that we're going to move on to the next group which is varus in numerous hey guys I'm gonna present my screen no song yeah I guess there is no sound coming out did you did you check the box Bona I believe it's Vitaly who hosts the video okay yeah there's some problems there is no sound coming out from the video the buck stops just ringing and start the share screen again yeah but this will set me okay hello my name is Bohdan is it okay now yeah hi my name is Vitaly Willis in numerous team and we want to introduce you immortal finance project that's our team so what we built we built a service that automates CDP protection using user tokens as a fuel so when a colonization level drops we use the layers to recover to reserve to cauterization ratio the car concept is a layered CDP protection that allows for users to set up and arrange tokens from their wallet that used to automatically recover to set cauterization ratio whenever it's in danger of liquidation so how it works we have a user user of CDP and that user want to be ensure that the CDP won't be liquidated while he sleeps at the cost of some of his targets so the user generates a protection contract from the factory he stops operator address require after mission minimal cauterization and ridiculous transition parameters he also approves collateral talkin like a token for the contract to rebalance EDP then the user decides what tokens are going to be used as a protection layer determines desire to gradation order and approve them for protection contract note that that tokens remain on users valid and when collateralization level drops below minimum cauterization parameter CDP your coverage becomes available so operator automation service provider is now able to call hill method to liquidate the required amount of tokens from the users valid to restore characterization level to target culturalization evil lair tokens Ranaut repellents mechanic as it sells part of a collateral to replace the depth will close the gap and now we tally will show it how it works in practice yeah I'll show our two key features first one is or heal so my coin till you can restore cauterization way well from 150 to 165 yeah and the second feature is you can use your collateral to pain you depth so let's say you want to pray certified oil and turbulence are slipping so we have basic CDP features here such as Quattro and Deb ball will repay and also we have protection features such as options balance options and protection layers as well and you can add other protection layers so now you can see that we paid our depth using our Quattro and we currently work on re protocol using unis hopeless loans but we also will add support of compounds maker and logics thank you for your answer so just to understand that real quick basically when you collateralize them either get some dye back that price of it could go down and you are at risk of having bad liquidated so you guys have a service where they can define in a contract where to keep the minimum and basically some automated some operator will sort of automatically move those tokens in and and re collateralize that loan to keep it from getting liquidated is that is that a pretty good summary of it yeah yeah exactly and I think that what is cool that you can use any token that's traded in in unit slope for example you can use open tokens as we showed and I'm gonna show you think game you can see our use cases so when open tokens when Atun jobs open tokens go up so it's really cool use case also you can use pool sets portfolio tokens yeah so for 400 servers yes so literally when you use and for example a put option tokens like open you can make your CDP literally immortal and so how our project is called so when theorem drops down Boot Options tokens go up and your your CDP is fully mortar fully fully secured the operators are the operators just basically incentivized by some fee to do this or do you guys run the operators or can anyone run an operator well the user can set up the preferred address of operator thinking about a incentivization of operator but we not implemented it yet so operate so when the cauterization drops minimum cauterization parameter that's set by user a heel and window is open so operator can call human at the human at we'll take a look on on water layers present by user and liquidate the tokens from a user's ballot in order of preset layers and if all the tokens run out then the Rebellion's option is available and so the CDP going to be repellents by using a collateral and I'm from compound and this is the biggest problem that really big borrowers have and one of the reasons that they might hesitate to use like a decentralized borrowing protocol is because of fear of liquidation so I think this is like a gigantic problem that needs to be solved I like that you put together a lot of different pieces to do it I think that like being an operator could be its own business you know like someone who's a very good operator actually like an insurance provider for CDP's it's it's a huge in sort of useful and impactful problem to solve is there a lot of people that want to borrow a lot of say stable coin sir crypto but they never want to get liquidated and right now you have to sort of self monitor and do it yourself very manually to avoid being liquidated so system helps off that is super useful can't we gonna it's compounds in next Sprint's it's a really nice project and a really useful I think one question I have is like do you have some sort of I mean like it looks like the system is really well done but I was just wondering what happens like with adverse market conditions so what happens if there is like a really big spike or market fluctuation so how does the system react to this like are you just I mean is this it do you get liquidated is there like anywhere a chance to ever get liquidated or is that like this never happens well it depends on CDP provider protocol Oracle's so if you saw our then Oracle's by our so if our protocol say that it's a spike it's a fear on drop-down so as I say hidden window is open now and operator could liquidate it so we've been thinking about this was a problem spice but still not implemented solution you know of course it's definitely not the very first thing to do just like future proof I would say excellent yeah great project guys thank you thank you thank you next up is team cover with both of the Tom's I'm gonna play your video for you so just give me the signal when you guys are ready to go I'm good Tom you good yeah I'm good cool yeah fire away oh geez that's something on YouTube we were having a resume related difficulties fantastic oh this is our hack money 2020 presentation I'm going to present you cover this is what we've been working on for the last month so I'm gonna say we who are we so if we flip to the next slide there's me Tom Waits and Tom French we're buddies from a university and we both kind of ended up working in these studying a theorem and so we came together to build what we call cover so what is cover so our hack so that's its core it's a die to an unstable coin in this case be USD protective options market and it was motivated by the ends the events of Black Thursday they all know on Black Thursday price of eat the collapsed and this pushed up the price of die which in many cases burnt some CDP holders because they had to buy died to pay back their CDP's but the price of die was higher and so it cost them more so this hack is an attempt to try and think about some possible solutions to that and we flick to the next slide so what is this hacked so basically somebody can see beyond it can go along and pay for the right to buy die in the future that's a particular price and they will pay for that right in a separate stable coin such as being USD it operates around all the quiddity pooled model where option sellers are adding liquidity into this pool and the in return they get minted LP tokens which entitles them to share the premiums and we use various technologies to make this possible so where we link to are they to and from you if we use units for the uniform be to exchange the price Oracle's behind scenes through the swapping we used to put all of the testing in bellman and on the front end react and yes we're now going to cut through to a short demo just demonstrate what we've been working on and so this this is the the page of our hack on the left-hand side you can see various columns for to buy options to exercise your options at the moment we've deployed on this screen that you can see here the market deployed a between DIYing be USD we use various factories deploy D so anybody could go ahead and deploy any other option market they wanted Tom's I'm just gonna do a quick demo of what buy options might look like and this the interface you specify the amount that you want the option you'll see a premium pops up so this is the amount you have to pay and then you go through the year we don't need to do this right now but you'll go through the approved by option metamath will pop up all that good stuff if you go to exercise options I think we sell soon before there we go so this was playing around before so you're noticing stuff with an option there's an expiry time which is the time by which you have to exercise your option and basically cash it in or not cut it in and so this is a platform where people can manage this and the whole idea is that someone can go out and take out an option to buy diet by an amount of die for the USD in the future we're looking to add and this is a good example Thomas demonstrates in how someone could deploy in this case an option market between Diane s USD cool but that will flip back to the presentation and wrap up so what are our next steps so we've got a few next steps we want to improve our pricing and benchmarking inside support for all the stable coins with some difficulty around differing decimal places for different stable coins I mean once I did a feature where you when someone exercised that option and they get all this die back we want immediately then to be able to transfer that to close pay off their CPP in close it so that's us so you can find out more about this at our github and thanks for listening we've been cover and thank you very much great yeah that's great so I may have missed this but how our options are priced on a curve right now Howard how is the price set or determined a really good question so often pricing surprises this the first time I've ever looked at option pricing is like a highly non-trivial problem and there's all sorts different ways to do it you can you can use something called a binomial model where you could try and like sort of model so I'll predict how the price will change in discrete steps as you go along there's a quite a famous popular thing which is called the black-scholes which relies on quite a physics e sort of underlying theory book it allows you to try and incorporate things like volatility and strike price and all these sort of things to try and predict what the price would be in the future so at the moment we use a black Scholes approximation that's valid for a short time period it's valid for not too large distances between the strike price and the price of the underlying asset so there's some assumptions around the current model and so that's for why I was referring to in terms of venture Parkington pricing so it's a black Scholes approximation yeah just fix fun dude sorry gone no no sorry go ahead now just gonna expensive this cover was kind of like our approach to solving this one particular problem that we found well then along the way we kind of realized that this can be a lot more general as you saw on those screens you can deploy an option market for any other we wanted to go down like a very uni swampy type thing where anybody can go onto the platform and destroy and deploy a pair for the two assets they're interested in and one of the big design challenges that we came across was the liquidity in this because liquidity is key when you're building options and so we decided to go not down like a vault sort of single token type model but instead have a liquidity pool because then if you've got like a die be USD model all option series all different types of options with different expiry dates can all be poured into this one same place and so it's a model that's been pioneered by a hedge Akande a couple of others and that we quite liked it so we took that and then we built these kind of infrastructure around it we built unis what stuff we build these factories so you anyone could deploy a market we build a subgraph to index option acts in C on chain and so yeah so it was kind of like an attempt to solve one particular problem that we we came across and found ourselves and then it yeah do you think it can maybe go a bit further yeah that's awesome yeah it's it's really interesting and um one question I have is if you are planning to on adding any other assets as well like other than cause I mean sure sure well the whole what we're aiming towards in the second half the project is generalizing this so that's it's a one-click deploy for any pair that you could want so we don't have to deploy this for other signalling markets if if you ever if your pad that you want you can go click deploy and then it will shoot out the quiddity pool and options market and an Oracle based for that and yeah here is the extensibility anyone like you said anyone can take like like nuna swap anybody can take any given token I can go deploy some I can go to ploy Austin coin and then I can create an option pair between that and like us DC or something that's why you here yeah and quite often that could be problematic because different options to is quite often they look at you like siloed by themselves so you have this like food liquidity then it definitely helps make that a lot more feasible with suicide with the downside of systemic risk possible exactly but yeah that's exactly how things should be yeah I think like it should be like okay people can interact with it and take things forward and sort of it's very and deploy what they need and what they're interested in and for sure and yeah it's been really exciting learn a huge amount and there yeah to try and tackle this one problem and then the pricing curve is definitely over my head but this is interesting guy this is a great thanks this I want to see the exactly keep building everything appreciate it yep Thank You team cover up next we have team rare birds okay all right I'm gonna just play my video ten or fewer birds here just showcasing the private areas worked on what we focused on is a platform for connecting investors in the Diaspora with entrepreneurs locally so say someone from Nigeria would like to invest back home and someone working on an interesting project they can come on the platform and raise some funding for that and so I'll just jump right into it I've had some projects on some campaigns we can take a look at here so I put a campaign and I can go out and raise funds for it so as an investor I can drop in a couple east here and the entrepreneur can go ahead and with make withdrawal requests from that once the money is deposited into the constancy of the campaign it is then sent to well it is swapped for a cerium to us beast to s USD just so we can have some stability when Solaris was with crypto and that is then sent over to Ave to Cuba to the lending tools to accrue interest over there so before the entrepreneur can redraw it once they add a quest they will you know go ahead get it approved and once you get all the approvals you can finalize it and the money will then get put into your list in your wallet and then he can go ahead and spend it as you like for this you need to have I think 50 percent of the investors approving what your what your request so you can go ahead and request based on milestones and you can just just tell the investor what your look using money for a prove it and you're good to go um so yeah once that's done we haven't really figured out what we're gonna do yet whether the the entrepreneur will repay the loan once they're done but I think that will be the best option that we have right now so the interest that comes from the money that's sitting in Ave can either be go can we use for recapping the odds going to repay the loan or sending a return on investment to the answer to the investor some of us can go back to two rare birds the platform itself to help to keep it you know alive yeah so that's that's what we have and yeah so that's it for now so hopefully you guys like it and looking forward to some feedback thanks guys alright this is a it's a good example of like when when value and money is the the baseline of the protocol once you can send value around what are the first things you're thinking and it's like well an investor and an entrepreneur connect them on this like web to ish site there's a lot of web 3 looking things in this app though right I'm seeing a lot of addresses and things that maybe if we could express abstract that away into ENS or something at might you might be able to have a few more users when I think of the the Venn diagram of people that could get in here and use this thing right now it's probably a lot smaller and if you could abstract away just a little bit maybe account stuff and some of the the other kind of web 3 things you probably get a lot more usage on on the app no that's that's very true and we were supposed to import incorporates Portus wallet in there to make the onboarding a lot easier but I think the the cash onboarding or debit card onboarding wasn't really working yes so we sort of put that to the side and yeah so we definitely have to make it a lot easier so the campaign will actually have a name with a description like make that super simple the other problem Embraer had to deal with like the off-ramp like how do we get the entrepreneur's to pay without you know if they're not familiar with hiriam and then having to to not go and swap it themselves so that's the other piece that we have to think about outside of that a few examples of things you're looking at was finance card as one monolith is another but that is it's not exactly it doesn't really I don't believe it works out in the UK just yet so those are some of the other problems that we're thinking as you know if someone comes on and for example in a an investing would also like to know like how the the entrepreneur is spending that money getting some some more transparency outside of what happens off the platform is one gonna build some confidence in saying okay I know what's going on they're actually hitting them all so it's properly and so on so those are other problems areas that I have to look at later on yeah and we have neat mechanics with with funding with aetherium we're seeing things like get coin grants and quadratic voting there's so many new mechanisms and you go to apply to this age-old you know entrepreneur investor relationship sorry I think I jumped onto that where I'm gonna mute I'm muting no exactly I mean it opens up it a lot because one of the problems that a lot of these entrepreneurs and investors have is that there are no institutions to help with these these sort of investing like you have a lot of people indeed diaspora who have the knowledge and have the resources but the trust to now give it over to someone else to do the investing and hope that they will do the right thing with it is the the part we're trying to bridge and sort of open that up with the blockchain dealer yeah I mean I think that one piece that could be added is the fact that maybe funding is delivered in multiple tranches so basically like just one-off but it's based on some somehow based on progress so that could be like one addition that you could put in the system yeah I mean right now and say an investor can put in like four es you can request a 1 e and tie that to one milestone so once they approve that then you get you get the one eats and then you know once you show progress and you come back and do another drawdown so that's sort of what we're we're looking for or at least working for it now yeah yeah I I really like this problem space basically like taking a pool of funds and then trying to side where to allocate them I think there's like ton of interesting projects coming out now it makes me think of doubts like Eragon out attack but also even these newer projects like Zora or foundation they're trying to connect creators to like fans and there's so many different sort of businesses and web 2 that are just niche use cases of this basic concept like GoFundMe or split wise and like flitting bills I actually think there's a lot of room in web 3 to find the right application of this this technology and yeah the the front end yeah it'll be interesting like you could make it more like protocol ish or like other people can sort of build a front-end to it and decide how to use it or build your own application if you choose the vertical that you want to go after but this general this general space is is super interesting no it's very true and I think from research what what really works is that if you're gonna come in with crowdfunding it has to be very focused if it's too broad it tends to fail so when you come in and make sure that you pick a vertical to start off with and if you want to expand later on then you can do that so weird I think working with the disaster because we know that there's a pain point in there with entrepreneurs on the ground one good start whether that's going to be where you know within that looking at tech or focusing on say consumers you know consumer products that's that's like you can then divide it a little bit further but you definitely want to focus a lot Holmes one area and then cut off I really like that focus on the vertical where that's needed see what they need like give them what they need now and then watch and see and find out what kind of things emerge from that and a whole product can you know emerge from that good good not that good use of it thank you awesome thank you thank you Ken Roy and with that we're gonna move on to the final presentation of today which is team pay maestro and I'll let Adam share a screen and start when he's ready also I'm just for click play we're in the world of gasless transactions which trying to make things easy for users but they're confusing and onerous for developers gia sent to is great but it's pretty complicated pay maestro is about a pain master as a service which is taking one of the components of GSN to and trying to offer it for developers and easy user friendly way so with that I wanna press play let's talk about maestro maestro maestro is a master services to manage their contracts page X Augustus come transactions and yeah awesome funny little incentive oh I'm so I'll walk you through so this is running monkey that's a principle we've got and to think about the payments for comes the contract which has been deployed here and then we've got a smart control it so this is just a dummy dummy contract that does a couple of things and as you can see got our contract here we want to enable it for gaseous transactions so actually said it one things you can do here you can change the owner I want to claim ownership of this we were on out there hopefully you'll see actually yeah we can't do that because um yeah contract hasn't been added to the paymaster yet which we tried to consider the payments that we completed it locally I'm actually not working so I run through let's see what we may have to do so um but I can go and take my control it Wester get a second and you can see it's shown up here which ok you can see that it's time to address exists here under dresses me notice active that's cool and my balance is that is 20.5 ether as I mentioned was no key event which you can configure it so severide like any new funding as a status handsome they don't live either um so now you guys are gonna remember that I'm wearing two hats I'm also that I'm oh no it's the pain maestro - you can see things aren't that great right now that much cash we've replenished with really have a zero um so let's just actually can do a little cheating let's just chop up a my strength cool but some cash they know okay so as you can see now who should be in reasonable shape we've got a maestro has got advanced the readout reading up we've registered a small contract on it that's why I'm done and it too has a has a balance so let's turn back here let's gonna try and do that thing again so let's try and take ownership of this using me damn damn it worked damn it works some good stuff so as you can see over the Gus's transaction like on interchange tuner again let's look at 1953 is he using it staying this thing in charge nothing at all that was am a transaction alright alright so you pretty constantly previous it so thing kind of works it kind of does what it's supposed to do what if her maybe win undecided that actually we didn't want us 100 wallet to be making any transactions anymore see this I'll be going do you have to beat it ok let's got it smell happens you're gonna try and take that back that's all he's not contacted it's been D been deactivated so you can see take it event you activate it no see my balance is drinking awake stop playing on it what cool that's the pain maestro it's pretty simple um see you have more contracts easy to anthem easy to give we got one balance force all of them I'm sort of going to be managing it was very very cool yeah so this one's near and dear to my heart for sure so this Lee provides some context basically GSN does gaseous transactions they do meta transactions and they've recently split their architecture into this kind of you're either the pay Meister or you're the app builder or I don't even know really a ton of it but basically what you've done is said okay so you've created this new pay master class for gasoline's and what you created was a smart contract that's basically like a whitelist system for that pay master is that correct and then put a UI in front of it yes it's so with new Jason it's better but you've sort of gotta manage more stuff to get set up and one of those things is like it basically just deciding yes or no I are you gonna pay for this transaction and it's a thing we do it you need to deploy a whole other contract and so so she's saying you don't need to another contract will pay for you just need to give us the money well we'll take care of that and trying to provide that UI so it's bit more like plug and played like there are free payment paymasters on say Rob stone on the test net but that's still kind of fake like if you actually want to like realistically test for getting set up you need to have a proper payment play maestro and so it sounded kind of spoofs that but then also would then exit in production do and this paymaster is basically a whitelist system for the content like you had smart contract while it was just some arbitrary contract and you whitelist the contract is that right like you're allowing anyone to make transactions on that contract that you pay for them yes so so so I had these grand plans of creating a whole range of just a little plugin but then like ran out of run out of road a bit but yeah the idea is that you've got this conservative funders and these comes with their targets and funders are able to essentially add targets to the contract and a funder then has like one balance across all of their smart contracts so instead of having to have a different pay my master with a different balance and having to manage that you can just manage one balance in one place in the air you can more easily like switch them on or off and like down the road you could get to a five-way you say apply different logic to different contracts so maybe in some cases you want to offer gases transactions in some case you might want to offer token transactions and that would just be a matter of like augmenting the pain the pain Westra contract contract to know about those different classes is that logical chain or could you do off chain can you do anything off chain logic or does all of this have to be in solidity um I think you I think you I think well send me the way I thought about it was mostly owned in solidity but like it kind of depends on what the pain maestro like that looks like for about up is managing it awesome I'll be bugging you about this when I start working more on GSN stuff in a week or two like I should have said this carefully like framework was Austin says is really great starter started back home on ethereum I'm partial it can help in improving UX as well for a lot of tops so yeah looking forward to see that like integrated like are you planning on reaching out to some some specific Dobbs or do you have anything in mind because I see that like especially you know for beginners approaching the system I see best to be useful I don't know like for example for wallet being able to you know like sort out things on behalf of their users and simplify the experience so yeah I don't know if you have anything like that in mind yeah yeah I think so me that um like like I think my first part to be I'm like really locking down the like payment like money management money management side of things and like the thing I like about it is that it's building on GSM which is this open this open Network like it is quite a crowded space that I've got a lot of people I'm creating sort of relays that enable gaseous transactions I like the open open side of it but then like I see it being sort of just an extension part of that utility um where yeah it's yeah it like it doesn't necessarily need to be wouldn't need to be like fully endorsed by GSM but it's an implementation that is like presuming the in line with their whole thing which is like making it easier but also making it open and doing it using those open source contracts you I really like it it's pretty like in concept simple but really effective like just a sort of really good abstraction means to deal with gas I like this sort of funder targets framework as well I think there's no I I don't know where what you plant do with it but I think it could be pretty useful and even like maybe a business - giggles let me ask for a variety of different contracts or something and even even done like down the truck I thought if it again give them more time there's like a walkway yeah you charge a fee for as the pay my pay maestro and there's a business like there but also there's this thing where if you've got all these bins - having to look up etherium to pay for their users transactions if you've got it that's happening in one contract the pay maestro could be smarter and actually be making interest on a bunch of that and only be funding the relay hub with the balance that actually needs to to run the daily transactions and sort of getting not using that economy of scale so you just not got all this like ether like gathering dust I was spending on gas it's just just the building that's happening here right like the the community and the extensibility and probably some of your work that you did here I'm gonna merge back into scaffold eat so there's a lot of like compounding pace that happens with this like extensibility and it's really cool to just have more people building in these weird corners of theoria helped us you know helps everyone kind of stand out those shoulders so good job good hackathon project yes really useful I think that's it thank you out of presenting thank you it's another hack money judging session that's on the books I want to thank everybody who ever still on the call feel free to unmute we're gonna give some appreciation for the judges and the team that are made it this far it's it's a pretty big milestone to be presenting to a panel of judges after a month of work so big kudos for the teams that have presented on Monday yesterday and today we've got a bunch more sessions coming up so just just a recognition of that and the feedback of all the judges let's give some golf claps there we go again there's a bunch of sessions in the next few days so follow along we'll be live-streaming them on our YouTube and Twitter and the next big thing is the closing ceremonies on June 2nd I would love for all the hackers to attend that so please make sure to keep an eye out for that we'll be sending out a link for that shortly we've got a ton of awesome judges lined up including Andreas Antonopoulos and botella computer in and a bunch of other people so we'd love to have you join us there and with that I think we can wrap up so thank you easy to get everybody happy Wednesday yeah bye thank you
