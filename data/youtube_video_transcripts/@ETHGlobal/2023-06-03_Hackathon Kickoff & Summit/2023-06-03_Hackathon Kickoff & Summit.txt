[Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you thank you [Music] foreign [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is car take I'm one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to hack Fest 2023 let's get started all of you are watching this on eveglobal.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is what we'll be using for the rest of this event to talk about all the things that we're doing whether it's the kickoff the closing to do all the demos and all of our summits in case you don't know what if Global is or an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to get thousands of developers into the what three ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits both in person and online and hack FS is no different this is going to be our third one for from in the past few years and today and this time around we also have a summit that we'll be doing immediately after we cover the hackathon logistics the summit will take place today let's kind of talk about all the interesting things that are happening in the protocol Network and before we get to all of the summit stuff I want to cover all the things that you need to know for the hackathon so let's get right into it this is already shipping up to be a massive event we have over 700 hackers who are coming in from 72 different countries spending 23 different time zones there's going to be so many creative ideas that are going to be built over the next few weeks and kind of looking at what people are coming from it still impresses me every time to see all the countries and six different continents being represented in where developers are excited to build on top of ethereum protocol lab networks FL coin and ipfs and all things in between that help make us a better decentralized feature on top of all the hackers we also have 29 ecosystem partners and 12 dedicated mentors who are going to be here with us throughout the event to really offer you the best experience in helping your project go from start to finish and to top it all off we're going to be giving away a hundred fifty thousand dollars in prizes and I'm going to cover all the specifics on what these prizes are how you can win them and all the things that you need to know about the best way to go that participating in this event so the most common question we've gone from everybody is what can I build here this is a very open-ended event which means that you are not solving a particular problem our goal is to help you build anything you're excited about as long as you are using interesting and new web3 technologies and some of the ideas that you want to bring up is that there's so much you can do with decentralized compute especially with the Falcon Virtual Machine there's a lot of room to experiment with data dials and different ways to manage storage and storage derivatives of course the second you have decentralized storage you can do so much more with nfts whether it's in the art or music side or anything else in the social category and because all this ecosystem is still currently growing there is even more opportunity in making better developer experiences better tools and utilities so the next thousand people can do anything that you wanted to do even faster because they have better abstractions to make their lives a lot easier this is just a very high level overview there's a lot more we have covered today especially in our Summits we're going to talk about what you actually can build in terms of bigger opportunities there's a lot of things you can do with just talk to our mentors and get more ideas we also are working on a list of potential brainstorming ideas for the hackathon if you are still looking for an idea to uh to go off of and experiment and kind of tweak around and make it your own and I also want to give a special shout out to some of our amazing Partners there's so many different protocols and companies in this space that are here excited to support this event and you can also get some inspiration for ideas or how you can not reinvent the Wheel by using some of these amazing Protocols of course we have filecoin we also have eight coin lit P2P acalao ceramic Lighthouse tableland poly base live pure hudlow one Barracks push protocol ens nfts storage spiron and lit protocol dran dataverse OS Vision Mona chainsafe ipfs altcoin data tools consensus lab Saturn secured Finance graph paper Capital online Ventures and Falkland foundation so on top of all the other ideas you have so much you can do in terms of leveraging anywhere from a Centra as a real-time live streaming to push notifications to anything else in between to help make your creative ideas come to reality you can check out all these companies and protocols and learn about what they do and how you can simplify a lot of these things and they're also giving away a lot of prizes I'm going to cover how you can win specific prizes for different protocols by using their sdks so let's talk about what the next three weeks look like my goal here is to cover a handful of logistical things that you all need to know and especially kind of how judging works and then we're going to go into all the prizes and then end off by taking the summit off with all the things that are happening in the protocol Labs Network so I want to cover how team formation Works how you can get help all the prizes of course all the talks and workshops and judging so let's go into the first thing which is communication the most important thing to know here is that everything is happening over Discord for this event which means that only hackers with rsvp'd will be able to see these channels you'll see a hack FS 2023 header on your left sidebar on Discord which will show all of these amazing channels to you uh you can get that confirmed by also going to your dashboard on youthful.com and clicking on sync with Discord to see all the right permissions you need to get to see all these things these are all the activities are happening for this event this is also where our mentors and our partners are hanging out you can ask direct questions to different protocols and ask any questions that you have on the technical side or non-technical side and a mentor will be there to help address these requests on top of all of that we are also going to be sending calendar invites for all the talks and workshops that are happening that spends today in the next couple weeks including all feedback sessions and some of these things will be repeated multiple times to account for different time zones we really want this thing to be asynchronous and as part of that everything is going to be recorded and everything is also published on the website which means that anything you see on the website is the source of Truth and that is going to be the record of kind of primary way of us keeping track of everything that's happening if something changes they'll be first reflected on the website and that is how we're going to be communicating everything and all the invites or anything else we'll update and nothing should change but in case it happens you know that the website is the only place where you need to look what is a website well you can go to hackfs.com and see everything about this event there and that'll also let you in to your dashboard directly from that same page where you can see your internal progress by your own projects so how does the hackathon actually work effectively you can start working on your projects now you can work on your projects with up to a five member team you can also work on them individually and you have the next two and a half weeks to to hack and work on your projects submissions are due on the 18th of June which is the Sunday at 12 pm Eastern which is noon and we're going to talk about what this means and all the things that you need to be mindful of as you approach June 18th so the rules and criteria of this event are fairly straightforward everything that you are doing must be done from scratch which means that you cannot extend or work on a previously started personal project you cannot add features to something you've already done before you cannot continue something from a previous youth Global hackathon if you are coming in again everything should be done from scratch to keep this fair for everybody else and also missions must leverage ipfs or filecoin or any related technology which is in the evm ecosystem as part of your submission to qualify for any prizes this also means that if you win any prizes only RSVP hackers are eligible to win which means if your team members are not listed on your dashboard or if your team members do not RSVP then winning a prize will only entitle just the people that are listed at the time of submission to those prizes so please make sure that all of you who have team members are listed and they show up on on their dashboards and everybody is confirmed and also has Discord access also another quick clarification there is that although all work must be done from scratch you can use boilerplate code which means anything like scaffold eat or react boilerplate all that is allowed you can use an existing open source project if you feel like you want to add something to a existing decentralized protocol and you want to use their open source code those things are allowed if something is already in the public domain as a well-known open source project you can use that you can use all the sdks in different boilerplates you don't have to do everything from scratch but you specifically cannot extend your own project or use your own project again for this hackathon and of course there could be some match cases that we haven't covered here because we want to keep this very quick so if you have any other questions or any other clarifications that you'd like to know please helping us whether it's on Discord or the Global TV chat or hello added global.com on email we'll be happy to assist you with any of those cases now is the most important stuff which is judging so there's a lot of stuff that you need to know about for judging submissions are due at 12 pm noon on Sunday June 18th and the next few days are the most important after that I'm going to cover what what submitting means and what happens immediately after to submit your project you will have to make a four-minute demo video of what you built this is a required video submission this helps us ensure that everything is concise everybody gets the same amount of time and you have the ability to focus on the key things that you want to do which you may not be able to do in a live demo video submissions are required and please trust me when I say this it will take you more than four minutes to record a four minute demo so don't prepare this last minute there's a lot of things that you realize that you could have focused on you should have focused on or the time you want to spend on introduction versus the actual demo of what you built all these things will take some iteration and we really want you to get a head start on this so please get started on this as you near the deadline instead of the day of to submit your project it will take you at least one hour to submit your projects because we will require you to explain a lot of stuff around how you build things you have to reference code in your submission to tell us exactly how you're using what sdks and what apis and how everything else Works under the hood on the back end or the front end or everything Beyond just the basic information of your project including a few screenshots and of course this video demo so please bucket in enough time to be ready to submit your project and don't do this thing last minute all this thing will be done through your dashboard and if early next week you'll be able to see what all these steps are as we open up submissions and this will let you see all the multiple steps and Fields that you need to think about and be ready for and we also have a lot of reference videos and demos and submissions from the past events that we really like for you to use as guidance for what it could submission and a good video looks like so you can draw inspiration from all of those previously done projects and make sure that you are ready to submit on the 18th after you submit you will have the option to go through the main judging process or just the partner prize judging process and what does this mean this means that you can only submit to your work and qualify for some of our partner sponsor prizes or if you want to be eligible for the top 10 teams you get to click the main judging process if you click on the main judging process you are also automatically going to be eligible for partner price charging but if you select the partner prize judging only then you will not be able to go back and submit yourself for the main judging process if you are interested in just being reviewed by our partners and not the main judging or you want to apply for different prices in both of those scenarios that process will be judged in parallel by our partners they will not specifically be doing a one-on-one call with all of you we expect a few hundred projects here so all the partners will be looking at everything asynchronously and they will reach out to the teams and message you whether it's on email or Discord if they have questions about your video or your code all of that will remain asynchronous however on the main judging side this will be a synchronous process you'll be presenting to a main judging panel and they will be talking to you live you'll be showing what you built there live as well and there'll be questions there and that'll be a synchronous process where you will have to come on a zoom call now the partner price judging is a very obvious thing which is you submit your project the partners will get a notification and they will start looking at what you built and ask any questions if they have them let's focus on the main judging which is broken into two rounds so on Sunday when you summon your project some of our judges will be on watch to review every project that was submitted and they will watch and look at all of our submissions for round one what round one is doing is going through every submission and evaluating the Prototype the quality of the project checking if it was indeed built during the course of the hackathon which was going to verify the git history and we're going to look at what you built and is it creative interesting or a hard project if our judges like your project you will be then selected to move to round two and you'll be notified in the 12 hours within the 12 hours of submitting your project so that's midnight Eastern on Sunday and you'll be notified to go to round two and that's the day after where you will be selected to come on a zoom call so what does round two mean so round two lets you go and present what you built to our other panel judges in a live call where you will get seven minutes where four minutes of it is for your demo and three minutes for a q a from our judges in the projects that are going to qualify for round two will be the ones that will be selected to be potentially part of our top 10 teams that'll be our finalists for this hackathon the round two and then live judging takes place on Monday at noon which is exactly 24 hours after submissions are due and you'll be notified if you've made it to round two within 12 hours of submitting your project and as I kind of mentioned already the partners will be reviewing your project asynchronously based on all the things that you specify which also means that if you are trying to go for a prize from any of our partners you have to select it in your submission process on your dashboard because if you don't tell us that you want to go for this prize we have no way of knowing we need to do our partners so don't forget to select I am looking to qualify for this prize on your submission process and then as soon as you select a protocol that protocol will be notified on their end to review what you built so make sure you keep all of that in mind and of course I'm looking at questions from the live stream uh this is going to be made available immediately after this video stops but you can also rewind so you can simply just go back in this video and review everything that I've said in the short description of all this thing for judging is that make the video good it's what shares the best story of what you built who you are why you care about that problem and you have four minutes to really tell us why everybody should be excited about what you built this will be the best thing you can do to qualify for round two on the main judging to win a prize or really kind of get people excited about the potential of what you're trying to build and what could be possible what three at decentralized software and of course we recognize that there's a lot of you who are trying to understand what's possible here before and you are trying to learn what you can do here and it's totally okay if you are brand new this is your first time doing any what three hackathon and there's a lot of stuff that we have planned for everybody here no matter what your skill level is whether it's a beginner or an expert so there's a lot of talks and panels and workshops especially today we're going to cover so many things from beginners to experts level ways of getting involved in this ecosystem which is this Summit there's so much more resources documentation on your info center which you can see as a tab on your hacker dashboard and on top of all the workshops and talks everything is recorded because we want to make sure this is an asynchronous event that is global so immediately after something ends it will be instantly available on our YouTube which is youtube.com youth Global and you can go watch rewind it and pause at any time at your own pace and really keep up with what's actually happening for any of these Technologies and of course everybody who gave a talk and workshop is on Discord so you can individually message any of our speakers here to ask any follow-up questions especially from any of the technical content that we cover and of course a lot of you are still looking for potentially an idea or a team you can go to this channel on Discord to reach out to others who are also in a similar position there's a lot of people who are looking for different team members there's a lot of people who are looking to join a team and they can contribute different skills you can do all of that directly on this channel and we'll also be hosting another live call later today and some of them already have happened yesterday and today to uh brainstorm and get to meet other team members who are looking for different teams and all that is also happening on Discord so check out the hack 20 hack FS 2023 chat Channel or say hi tell us who you are and let us know what you can what you're excited to build and also we'd love to say hi and meet all of you from all different parts of the world and of course it's not required that you work on a team it just makes things a lot easier if you have a team so it is totally okay to hack solo and use this as a way to challenge yourself and learn something in the next over the next two to three weeks let's quickly talk about check-ins so checkings is something we'll be implementing for this hackathon which is a check-in is something that happens once a week it allows us to get the help give you the help you need to really make sure that you're not blocked on anything this will be a simple form that just appears on your hacker dashboard it just asks how are things going if you have an idea are you stuck somewhere or do you need help or did you need help or you didn't get any it helps us really prioritize and get you unblocked on anything that you are looking to get checkings are going to be required for everybody here as a team so only one person on the team has to fill out that check-in they'll be couple of them over the next two weeks and all this thing is going to happen through your dashboard we're going to really want to make sure that you're getting the help you need especially as we do this thing for hundreds of people across so many different cities and countries and similarly there's also going to be two live feedback sessions for getting direct comments from some of our mentors potential judges and other partners of this community you can join these calls to get direct feedback that's live and get help and get ideas to kind of make what you're doing better by uh just showing up and telling everybody else about what you're building and and if there's anything that you can do to improve and before we go into prizes I also want to cover some of our code of conduct everything that we're going to cover is written on ecobo.com rules it has our privacy policy it has our policies on the events the rules anything around what it means to participate in any of our events whether it's in person or online but the short of it is that please be respectful in harassment abuse in any form will not be tolerated as part of being our community and anything that you build is going to be owned by you and so you as the creators of that project so UNL IP and overall please be excellent to each other and then if you need any help if there's anything else that we can cover you can reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be happy to assist you with any of those questions [Music] all of that again is going to be on hackfest.com you can see the schedule all the specific deadlines who are speakers mentors judges everybody everyone else participating in this event is and all that is made available for you so now let's go into all the prices [Music] so first one I want to cover is fem so fifteen thousand

server templates will get fifteen hundred dollars so these were all of our prizes and this is officially a way for me to tell you that I just gave you a very high level overview what the prizes are of the amounts but there's a lot more specifics around documentation exactly how you can win or what does it doesn't qualify and link to their workshops a direct way to understand their code which is anywhere from sample repos to some of the boilerplate code they already have set up for you to just kind of copy and Branch off from all that is available to you on the prizes page which is on acapiss.com you can just click on any of these protocols and check out all the specifics around what qualifies how you can win the prizes what is a good submission look like and how you can get started on any of these so it was a massive rating number for all of these things for you but that is all of the logistics for the hackathon that you need to know and before we go on to the summit I want to just remind everybody to really pace yourself I really want this to be a fun and exciting experience for you the reason this event is a couple of weeks long is because we know it takes time to learn something that's happening that could change and have so much high potential so we really want you to take the time and really understand how things work before you jump right into building something and we don't want this to be exhausting for you we've done everything we can to make this thing as asynchronous and easy to catch up and follow so you get a chance to really learn with everybody else and get all of your questions answered before you jump right into building anything so this is very much about experimentation and we want to make sure that you get a chance to better yourself and learn something super cool so with that I want to wish all of you happy hacking we'll see all of you on Discord and we are ready to kick off with our Summit for today [Music] so this is the hackerfest 2023 Summit and what's on schedule today is as follows our first speaker is going to be Molly who's going to be talking about the pln ecosystem and all the things that are happening and you can build of course a big part of the next few weeks is going to be the on virtual machine so you'll get a high level overview from Sarah on what is it how it works and what's coming on at VM then ID and Matt are going to talk about all the other opportunities that you have for different tracks that are here for this event and all the things that you can do as the FM ecosystem evolves and because the FM has been around for a few months now uh we're going to do a panel with Nikki Sean Natalie and Kate to talk about how things have been over the past few months from people who are building projects and leveraging the  personal machine over uh what they're building for other companies then Reuben is going to talk about what the pln is and the builders funnel we really want to also give you an opportunity for people to take their projects to the next level whether it's from a hackathon or just anybody else interested in startups and James will be talking about the accelerator program after uh and what the PL extra program is how you can get involved what it means to be part of that and all the things that you get from being in that Network and then Gabriel from GPC will come and share anywhere from experiences to advice on how accelerators can help really get your projects to where you want to be and take something from an idea to something that everybody uses on a day-to-day basis so without further Ado I'm super excited to welcome our first speaker for today which is Molly Holly welcome and I'll let you uh get started with telling us about all the things happening in the pln ecosystems awesome thank you so much cartek I'm super excited for this um and always super super fun to um get to hang out with all of these amazing humans um hacking and so um let's just jump right into it I have a lot of things to to share with you today um and uh many ideas for things that you can build so hopefully get a little bit of inspiration if you ever want to follow up on any of these or want to pitch me your idea and get feedback um feel free to message me on Twitter I'm omak28 um and happy to keep chatting there um so here's here's quick agenda I want to welcome you all back to hackathfast we might have a couple of returning hackers in the room um but we've had hackaths the last four years which is gonna be great give you an overview of protocol Labs PL Network what kind of Unites us as a community um all of the amazing folks that we're seeing participate here many of them are part of the pl Network and helping contribute various different protocols and features to this wider Community there's some recent awesome new opportunities that are in the works that would love to seed some of your ideas with um and then give you a an overview of all of the different things you can build on kartik has already talked to you about the many many many different bounties here um but some ideas on how you could actually harness and build on top of some of these Technologies and then finally if you want to learn more um I'll highlight uh some of the onboarding programming we've created in the pl Network that might be useful so of course welcome back to the fourth hack FS we've been running this since 2020. um yes pandemic year and seen hundreds of teams come forward and a number of them actually turn into startups that have formed out of hack fs and are now coming back to sponsor full circle so it's just really amazing to see the growth that has happened in this ecosystem the amazing Founders that have been created out of hacks that started here um and very excited to see what you guys come up with this year um so that hopefully our next huddle next Lighthouse next secured Finance comes out of this group today which will be really fun um the protocol Labs Network really is Unified by this mission of driving breakthroughs in Computing technology to push Humanity forward um Juan gives a number of great talks about this um but really it's building upon the fact that we recognize the internet is a huge superpower for Humanity um so many of our tools communication friendships um you know work has been massively Changed by the Advent of the internet and it's critical for our functioning today as a species um and we see these huge phase transitions uh coming in the next couple of decades and we want them to be building upon an internet Foundation that is robust that is secure that doesn't have Central intermediaries that control our connections between each other um and that is enables efficient kind of like individual peer-to-peer interactions ownership of data and that is a good robust foundation for all the work that we're doing um and we think think that we need to be making improvements here there's some really big breakthroughs that are coming in the next couple of years machine learning AGI brain computer interfaces and we want those to build on top of um like a much stronger more robust foundation and so Juan's given some some great talks about how this really critical Century we need to be getting things right we need to be upgrading some of our core internet protocols with web3 to make sure that we can trust the data and the connections and um the transactions that are happening in our networks and that we can secure digital human rights that we can all build on top of uh and so that's kind of why protocol Labs was created as this Innovation networks that has many different companies many different protocols um and and kind of this amazing swarm of improvements that can then empower the next set of computing breakthroughs to come with a better foundation for their information for their peer-to-peer connections um and for their kind of like you know trusted uh relationships with each other um and so particle Labs spans the r d pipeline there's a number of research Labs across the protocol Labs Network many groups deep in the development phases of building um new products and new protocols a number of those are productionizing and scaling to New Markets uh and and even scaling significantly in production and things that differentiate this community are a highly collaborative Network oriented approach to many different protocols building on top of each other layering as a stack to help uh you know make it easier for others to grab modular components that they can then build on top of um and just a very collaborative and supportive ecosystem so we're excited to have you as a part of it um and feel free to ask for help because everyone here very much wants to see you succeed and to jump into this ecosystem and start building something amazing um there are a ton of different groups across the pl Network many folks who are building on top of ips fast La PDP and Falcon but also many many other programs and and projects that kartik was mentioning um folks from Mona and D Rand and Buckley and many other amazing components and most of these projects are actually um having bounties today at hackaths and so if you want to go check out the pln portal which talks about many of these different projects um there's also links from the directory for how you can actually go and have office hours with some of these amazing collaborators so that you can you know get a deep dive on the work that they're doing or get feedback on one of your hacks and so um recommend that's a super useful tool that you can grab a screenshot to all right diving into some of the breakthroughs um here's a quick list that we keep in our PL Andres group on some of the amazing iqbs and Falcon breakthroughs that that we've been helping uh with and collaborating with folks on um fvm is definitely a big one in that list but there's a number of other uh really exciting ones is super exciting I would love to talk more about that one today um Saturn and Lassie which is a component um that's being used by Saturn as well is really important for uh retrieving data very quickly from the filecoin network um and also from you know it's a CDN for any data that's stored across ipfs file Corner elsewhere and there's some really amazing new components um for ipfs boxo is a library for building new ipfs implementations Helia is a new uh JavaScript implementation of ipfs and so there's lots of exciting components to build on there um I'm going to give you a quick overview of maybe a couple areas that I think would be really exciting and then we'll go through kind of a whole list of of exciting things to build on um so a couple of very exciting areas in fvm you might have heard fvm's been around for just over two months now um so it's still uh early in its early days but we've already seen over a thousand unique contracts be deployed on fem there's hundreds of people who are building smart contract applications and some of my favorites that I think are filling really really important needs within the web 3 ecosystem first is Perpetual or automatic storage Lighthouse is offering a number of bounties here they have great sdks for building and a few dot storage and web3. storage are also doing really useful work here but making sure things that users want are being able to store their data and have another service or application handle the monitoring the repair the replication of that data on their behalf and this is now possible with fvm you can build all sorts of exciting services that can enable those use cases on top of the substrate a filecoin which you know is already doing kind of the automatic uh checking of hey is your storage deal being persisted over time you can make it much more user-friendly and really help increase the accessibility of Falcon services on other chains to different types of use cases um you know things like nft forever is absolutely you know endowed storage use cases makes a ton of sense um there's some really awesome work happening around retrieval cdns on top of fem um the Saturn team is now uh the the rewards for retrieval providers within Saturn is now being paid out by fem smart contracts there's a number of groups who are doing things like retrieval Insurance um or or contracts that ensure good retrievability of data super exciting area super critical for all sorts of users who want hot fast storage in Falcon um there's some really exciting stuff happening with compute and generative AI I literally was just playing around with water lily this moment um or this morning because uh we just crossed an exabyte of data stored in Falcon and I was looking for with my snazzy nft um that I'm going to uh mint to celebrate and commemorate that moment um and that's a great example that you can also emulate um if you're going to create a compute over Data Network for your own use case um utilizing baklio utilizing fvm um and uh you know really optimizing those compute networks for you know your heart's desire right there's a lot of really great building blocks that you can use to get started really quickly there and Sample contracts um like water lily that you could emulate to get started quickly and then finally there's some really amazing work that's happening around data Dows nfts anyone who's getting together to store data and persist data over time utilizing maybe some of the Perpetual storage contracts or retrieval Assurance contracts um to make sure that um you know say the Gutenberg library or other really critical DSi data sets are being kind of added to and governed over time and utilizing nfts within those communities um so I think I've hit on a couple of these but there's a you know active need within the fvm ecosystem for some awesome new services and tools building on top of those fbm building blocks um to and utilizing the fact that you know Falcon has an exabyte of data stored um and want to be persisting that data over time adding new data for those communities and so um thinking about the life cycle of of clients and storage providers and data and falcoin there's a lot of really valuable services and tools that can be created and launched here from monitoring a collection of data over time and creating kind of like alerts for different sorts of events to repairing data if a storage provider ever stops storing data automatically based on a set of client policies or requirements aggregating data across many different uh clients who all want to store you know tiny little nfts but bundling that all up into um kind of like a larger on-chain message which is something that Lighthouse and nft.storage have examples of how they're doing that right now um and some of the stuff around retrieval oracles or retrieval Assurance contracts are all really really useful and valuable tools that there's lots of demand for in the fvm ecosystem right now and from clients you know we have uh you know thousands of clients who are storing data in filecoin as well and want better tooling to ease that onboarding um data availability so with some new really exciting things like Lassie and Saturn um and the interplanetary networks indexer Network indexer ipni um uh there's there's now additional tools for making sure that your data is available and retrievable um and we've actually already been seeing smart contracts and um and chain data starting to be stored inside of filecoin itself so um you know it's now possible for you to use filecoin to build a data availability layer for other web 3 blockchains or Layer Two Chains um that don't want to be responsible for their own data availability so you know great example of where you could offer this is Solana is actually already backing up their entire entire chain State onto filecoin as an ipld um uh acyclic graph and so you could start with that to build a data availability layer for anyone who wants to interact with swanna or you could use the opportunity to build a web 3 chain transaction storage service that you know as blocks and transactions are created in another chain stores those in filecoin um using whatever storage service of your choice web3 storage um data tools uh Lighthouse Etc or one of your own creation um so that you have a really easy to use web3 chain storage tool which would be super valuable for the entire web3 space and even better you can layer on these new tooling around fast retrieval to make sure that you store with storage providers who are offering fast retrievals we have I think it's over 10 storage providers that have an over a hundred percent uh retrieval success rate which is pretty good uh well not over 100 at 100 um and a number of groups that are bringing additional um uh you know transports to storage as well and so that's something that you can do on behalf of those networks to make sure that they can also retrieve the chain data very quickly um so that they can then rely on it and use it as kind of like the default way of accessing chain State and data and you can augment this with all sorts of you know shiny data features like Erasure coding to make sure that you can get you know a small number of copies in order to to get the entire desired data set retrieval bounties to make sure that you can really rely on the retrievals ETC and this is a really really hot and important area right now for the entire web3 community and Falcon has all the things you need to be the the team going and plugging that Gap um we'd mentioned compute it's a really exciting time to be building compute in the Falcon ecosystem you have buckleya which is giving you all of these um you know critical reusable modules for building compute networks think of it as the ipfs for compute networks open source you can use it in whatever way you want um and you know you can use the lily pad Bridge or clone it in order to send jobs from fvm into your own Buckle out powered compute over Data Network and then you can optimize it for your own domain there's definitely this uh critical Insight from Juan that um in compute over data we're going to see many many different networks optimizing for privacy or performance or verifiability and so identifying your own use case in your own community that you're going to optimize your compute Network for whether that's DSi generative AI ZK proves fully homomorphic encryption will allow you to really optimize your compute Network and get it up and running quickly you can also harness slide well maybe not um you can also harness the early stages of interplanetary consensus to um you know have your network very quickly get up and running building on top of filecoin so you can either utilize fem itself or you can start building directly on IPC to have your own layer 2 Network on top of falcoin getting started quickly all right so highlighting all the things that you can build on um and then I will give you some fast learning tips and um see you all on Twitter um so as we mentioned Falcon Virtual Machine is launched it's all evm compatible um there's a huge huge opportunity to be building within this new data economy um there's already an excavative data stored on Falcon a lot of that is open Public Access Data from um you know video recordings um to the open music library internet archive many open public data sets from various different you know government parties newer public data um things along those lines and so it's a great opportunity to build the tools that these communities are going to need to interact with and continue onboarding their data more usefully out and lilypad are perfect things to build on if you're excited about compute and the whole massive AI wave that is taking off where you can actually run compute Networks um triggered by smart contracts in fvm and harnessing bakuyao to run all of those compute nodes if you are an expert in thinking about how to incentivize computation and maybe do a useful proof of work around compute please come talk to me we definitely have ideas and would love to share um I mentioned interplanetary consensus this is the kind of L2 sharding um system that Falcon has been developing um it allows you to create a hierarchical chain of compute uh or sorry of Layer Two networks or subnets as we've been calling them and we actually already have a one second uh test net subnet of IPC that is running right now that you can build um you know your own subnet and get up and started um or you can start utilizing spacenet which is the net they have up and running um and the concept of these is that not only can you um kind of like create subnets on subnets hierarchically but you can actually also regionally Define these networks so you could end up with a North America versus Europe versus Asia subnet or west coast East Coast Texas or you know whatever um uh division of networks is going to enable you to have really really fast block times and fast performance Within These subnets and that team is actively working with folks that are building new subnets today um as we've mentioned ipfs has a ton of different implementations I think there's specifically a bounty for Helia which is the new um JavaScript ipfs implementation um which has enabled the deprecation of the old JS ipfs so huzzah but there's also a ton of other ones there's iro Kubo S3 boost and 20 plus other iqbs implementations that you can harness within your applications or um you know build upon or iterate upon in order to make them better for Lippy to pee I highly recommend checking out this great video from Max from the ipfs thing on connecting everything everywhere all at once and this new connectivity demo that they um created I think they'll be reprising it later in hackaths but it enables you to do browser to browser uh peer-to-peer collaboration browser to laptop laptop to mobile phone etc etc um all within the browser all utilizing lip P2P for that direct peer-to-peer networking communication so very exciting definitely seems like a very exciting opportunity for folks that maybe want to think about service worker gateways or um kind of like better offline peer-to-peer collaboration within a variety of devices and modalities um and this seems very exciting to for example grab some old ipfs demos that have existed long before Port them into this new area and then build on them things like you know using a browser tab to share content peer-to-peer over ipfs or things along those lines there's some cool things with peer pad that you might go in and look up from before and get running in these these new applications um I'd mentioned Saturn and ipni but these are really useful tools for indexing and retrieving data quickly from both ipfs and falcoin nodes uh and so there's a uh or both Kubo and Lotus and boost and other nodes um they're all ipfs nodes uh but there's a very uh you know easy getting started guide to to jump up and run with these networks if you want to enable fast retrievals um there's polybase which enables you to have this database layer that can understand wallets tokens and ZK proofs um you can absolutely utilize tooling like nft.storage web3. storage filecoin data tools and more um as a fast storage on-ramp for whatever your use case of choices and you can even utilize the Big Data exchange if you're working with big data and Big Data communities um to actually have a two-sided marketplace where you're both charging clients for the storage of their data and charging SPS for storage providers for access to those large valuable public data sets um of course huddle um also one of the sponsors of this event but um doing some awesome work with uh uh kind of like peer-to-peer media infrastructure um and making sure that you can have great video communication I think they also have some awesome Integrations with live peer if you want to do live streaming within peer-to-peer video calls um and so some really useful tools if you're excited about having a video Centric application um for Life peer really useful Focus around um you know social networks and decentralized social so thinking about live peer Integrations into things like blue sky or thinking about content moderation for um how you can do decentralized um video streaming or other decentralized social applications um and it's really awesome to see this like open social map continuing to get filled out so if you're excited about potentially building social applications on top of live peer huddle Falcon fvm um and maybe utilizing some of these retrieval tools like you know you're getting the the components that you need to start making faster and faster uh social applications that can also handle you know larger scale video storage potentially like the YouTubes and Twitches of the world would be really cool to see someone go and build in that direction and of course Lighthouse um definitely a go-to tool if you're looking for really quick and easy Perpetual file storage um and also a great uh you know Exemplar to look at um in terms of making sure that that is available across many different chains and bringing that you know ease of access to things like polygon and elsewhere so that they can all store their data on falcoin and last but not least check out fission's odd SDK um it's you know an amazing new uh SDK that you can utilize for local first Edge Computing they also have some really really useful combinations of things like ucams dids ipfs and um you know a great way with uh you know getting started building applications that are private and secure by default all right um so if that didn't spark your interest and you're still like uh I feel like there's 10 000 things I need to learn and I'm a little overwhelmed by the number of things being listed um I would love to recommend a couple of learning opportunities that might be relevant now but might be relevant in the future once you've hacked your way through hack fs and uh want to dive even deeper into all that the pl network has to offer um we run an onboarding program for all members of the pl Network um so anyone who's building amazing applications that push the space forward has received investment from PL Ventures or is an otherwise amazing proponent of this space we offer a four-week onboarding program to help train and develop and um you know connect all of the amazing talent in the space so that you have mentors you have uh you know access to critical stakeholders any of the knowledge you need to be really really successful within this community we actually have an open source curriculum of curriculum.pl l-launchpad dot IO I believe that you can go and and review even as you're getting started right now um if you find that useful um and uh definitely get in touch with me if you're excited to attend uh we have a I think it's 500 for attending the virtual program and then if you want to attend our quarterly launch pad Summit um we have those once every quarter in a different part of the world um which I'm getting ahead of myself you should definitely come to those as well um we have content within Launchpad for all sorts of different um you know contributors whether that's Builders who are wanting to make sure they have the Hands-On hacking experience product managers who want to understand how to get stuff done in an async remote distributed environment um folks who want to know the fundamentals of how all of the different protocols and Dev tools within this space work and how you know the web 3 landscape itself uh lines up um and then also how web threes evolve over time and how you can harness the basics of blockchain cryptography decentralization Etc um and so our next Launchpad Summit as I mentioned is coming up uh next month in July 17th through 21st in Paris over top of etcc um we just published a blog post on this so um if you are have attended Launchpad we would love to see you there um if you are excited to learn more about it you can kick off your Launchpad experience by attending Launchpad Summit and then um joining a future cohort later this year um and so um you can grab the QR code here if you want to learn more about it but I also hope to see many of the hackers there it's going to be an amazing Gathering point for the whole PL Network community and web crew community so that's it from me thank you so much happy building feel free to send me a DM with all of the cool things that you're building on and I'm very very excited to judge all of your amazing hacks in a couple of weeks I cannot wait awesome thanks Molly this was a great overview and uh I'm sure we'll be blown away in a couple of weeks with something incredible that'll come out because this has happened for three years in a row I'm sure it's laughing again in uh well thank you so much and with that we are ready for our next amazing Summit Chuck so without further Ado I'd like to bring on Sarah to talk about what the fem is and how it works and what's next and everything else you need to know about the falcoin virtual machine so please welcome Sarah thank you Karthik um hey everyone good to meet all of you um darling in over here from East Seoul um so if any of you are here in eastle and you are staying up uh to watch this you know welcome welcome hi um also hi to everyone from around the wall um I think we've seen each other probably a few times now if you've been following the eve Global hackathons uh my team uh is a is the developer Advocate team for fvm the Falcon Virtual Machine and we've been through multiple Eve Global um hackathons now um Denver was a really big one that just went by and we'll be in Paris as well so looking forward to meet all of you um I thought through today for hack fs and we're super excited for hack FS because it is the first hackathon that fbm is going into that combines like with all the other protocol Labs teams that you know have provided great environment products and putting it all together in a hackathon so we've been holding fbm specific hackathons for a while now and we've been doing a lot of these tutorials and documentations and presentations and I was thinking you know what kind of knew that we can share I think we've come to a point where we actually launched um two months two and a half months ago now and a lot of things have progressed since then there's a lot of new things that we well very quickly shipped um right after lunch when we realized like these are things that developers are asking for and we also have a lot more a lot more new things coming up as well so it kind of feels like we're going right into our next phase and you know super excited to be able to share that with everyone yeah so I'll cover today Falcon Virtual Machine what why and what next um I might be a little bit more summarized on the what and the why just because we've gone through that uh with a few presentations and we have resources to share that with you so I'm going to spend a little bit more time on what's coming up next and get everyone really excited on what they can build with us for the next month oh also a quick shout out um if you have not followed us yet do follow us on the fbm dev Twitter account we give updates like my teammate Matt has been amazing in building up our socials and he gives a lot of great updates about our product as we go along so stay tuned there um he's also doing interviews with hackers on site so really really fun stuff and we have a twitch stream which is the full Builder stream stream so just a shout out there every Thursday um except for doing like a large hackathon like that where everyone is in the middle of the hackathon workshops but every Thursday we do try to keep to a schedule where we live demo and break things um well mostly it's me breaking and net fixing but you can see us try out new things and bring on new partners and hackers as well and you know if you submit for the hackathon you could also be one of the guests for the session cool so I'm going to cover what the fbm is um I've also added a link over there I know it's a little bit uh summarized but let me run through it and I also have a QR code over there if you want to go deep dive and do a little bit more of an explanation um for a talk that I did at Eve Tokyo recently on what the fvm is so um I have been getting a lot of questions from developers like can you clarify what the fbm actually is um so I thought to put out some key points here that we have been answering to developers so far and I hope this really helps to clarify um it for everyone so the fbm is a runtime environment for smart contracts on Falcon um it sits on top of the Falcon Network it is a feature of the Falcon Network it is not a separate product on its own it is a layer one on top of Falcon which is a layer zero it is also fully evm compatible so we have of uh we have a fully feature complete ethereum Json RPC API and that is how the fvm is fully featured a fully evm compatible today so all the tools that you are super used and familiar uh familiar with using in as an evm developer can be used for the fbm as well so things like hard hat Foundry we actually just put out a Foundry starter starter kit so that's really cool for my teammates act um metamask yeah or using your Ox address you know you barely have to even think about what the conversion of the address will look like into filecoin for example so all these things are things that we've figured out on the back end so for you it should be super seamless to use all the tools that you are familiar with um fem as a whole is also intended to be VM agnostic so today the first runtime that we are the first foreign runtime for the fbm that we are focusing on is evm because clearly the ethereum community is just super robust and you know super exciting ideas and developers in the space and so we wanted to provision that first and so we have the evm today but you know tomorrow it could be something else and we're hoping to build up build out or build with Builders as well to help us build uh more VMS that can be more compact that can be compatible with other chains as well uh we are also live on minet um since March 14 2023 so if you took part in that event it was Pi Day it was super fun and exciting um great if you joined us on that day and super easy to remember to date as well so kind of looking back um a lot has happened a lot is on the slide I kind of want to go through it um I just want to take a moment to kind of think through it the last time I think I was on youth Global TV was back in November with fevm um that was like the first fvm specific hackathon that we had or the first hackathon that fbm was going into um and we it was super hacky we had like you know a lot of developers that gave us really good feedback we we were very aware that we're putting out a product that was almost fully compete but not really and there were features that we wanted to test with developers and we got really really good feedback then but we have come such a long way since then and since launch itself you know a lot also has happened um yeah since the pi day that we launched the mainnet so some things that have happened adoption has gone up we have about 2.9 mil fill today in total contract balance on Falcon mainnet and we have about 175k transactions that have taken place so far and we also have about 1.1 K unique contracts deployed to date coming from about close to 200 unique deployer addresses um you know that and that's like amazing right um and we really want to thank everyone that has been um deploying the mainnet working with us our early Builders like it's just super exciting um right now um if you want to check out these stats you know they are from our starboard um our partners starboard um the fbm Starbucks Explorer so you can actually head over to that Explorer and look at these contract analysis and kind of see how the fvm is doing if you are curious to see what people are what what how the statistics statistics are tracking uh week on week um things that we've shipped we have about 10 dap integration partners and we have many more Partners as well of course but during this hackathon I know this is of interest to everyone um these are also coming back around this you see them as sponsors during this hackathon uh We've integrated these Partners to come on board to mainnet and as well as to provide support for testnet so that it gives you a richer debt development experience with fvm we've shipped new features on our blog explorers including contract verification and smart contract analysis so again thank you to all upgrade Explorer Partners out there and many more that are in development right now we're hoping to really build a much richer ecosystem around in the smart contracts based on filecoin we have The fvm Foundry and data starter kit that we've pushed out since launch so that should really help developers with getting getting a template to start moving along um and we've also gotten um a Docker image for Lotus and booths making it super easy to set up storage and retrieval on a local net so that you can keep testing before you put it to test net and so on so that has made it much faster for people to adopt fvm and test out our client contract for storage so kudos to um to that that was shipped out as well we've also transitioned testnet from hyperspace to calibration so if you haven't seen the message on the slack channels or on Twitter just a heads up we have deprecated the previous test net with the good old trusty hyperspace test net that we've been using since uh back in November and now we are transitioning over to calibration test net which very much mimics the main net um yeah the falcoin main net as well the goal of this was really to allow developers to simulate what minute conditions would be like and be able to test all these what you would consider experimental features with fem on your adapt solutions to make sure it works in a production environment first and then once it deploys the mainnet it should work seamlessly be because we worked in calibration and that's why we are moved over so a lot more documentation and tutorials that will be coming up in the workshops but there are some slight differences between the two test Nets over there so a huge transition over there migration thanks to my team and we have Redfield that has shipped thanks to glyph and Alex read that has kind of put that helped that out and has been used by quite a few teams at this point we've also had staking pools that launch so that was super exciting and we also have a more cookbook resources that have come up over time for people to get ideas and get a better sense or maybe kind of see what what the fem thing team is thinking about how you could use fpm itself and I'll touch on that in a little bit um we've also had tremendous Builder movement uh building momentum we've had about three or so youth partner hackathons and even more hackathons outside of that since the launch itself which is just insane thinking about it because it's only been like 2.5 months um but we've had hundreds of fvm projects that have ship that have been submitted since then so it really seen really strong interest there um and we've also had an fbm mean that build a cohort that teams where teams have shipped MVP Solutions we have about 27 of them that have also deployed them in that um thanks so much to alcohol you know we like myself and my DX team were very very close to this cohort so um thank you for everyone for participating and building with us for six months and trying out all these new features and giving us feedback and building out different tools with us for fvm and now you can all use it in the hackathon so this will all be in the hackathon cheat sheet and some of these teams have also become Partners as well which is awesome um and then also from that amazing cohort 40 of their smart contract templates have actually been uploaded to cookbook.dev which is a smart contract Hub that we've been working very closely to so shout out to them as well so that makes it even easier for you in this hackathon to adopt those templates and kind of try it out for yourself and see and build upon what other teams have done so they walk so that we could run which I don't know which is just great um and we've also had about 20 teams that have transition progressed from uh being in in a builder cohort you know going from hackathon to build a cohort to them being accepted into fvm Focus accelerators so we have some accelerated Partners out there OV GPC long hash and a few other accelerator Partners as well that have not had fully focused fully fpm focused accelerator cohorts but have taken in quite a significant number of femes into their cohorts as well so a lot of like if you think about it as a whole building momentum we're really excited to see all these great ideas come up from hackathons and then progress onwards to become really sustainable uh products and solutions for themselves in the system so yeah just huge momentum since we launched 2.5 months ago which is honestly kind of insane so you have no excuse in a month to build something really cool all right okay so why fvm so now we're going to touch into why again if you're interested to read more of a deep dive um there's a QR code over there that you can watch the talk on and I can go a little bit deeper and do where fvm stands in the file coin master plan uh why it came in why the Falcon Network needs it and so on but to summarize um the fem is meant to bring on-chain programmability to the Falcon Network and Achieve step number three in the file coin master plan so for those of you who have been in the Falcon ecosystem this is a test for you what is the Falcon master plan um well very simply the first one was to set up a storage provider Network and a decentralized a centralized storage Network the second one is to onboard important data onto the network and the last one would be to compute that data um and that is where the fbm comes in so we are really here to achieve step three in the following master plan um it's a really exciting stuff because it's only up from here and then to kind of make to break that down a little bit because I do get questions around what does on-chain programmability mean to ask it means to enable custom logic to be written around storage and retrieval workflows again Falcon is fully focused on storage and retrieval and so what you can you know there's a ton that you can do with all this data right you could write um you could yeah you could decide how you want those workflows to be automated or to be event driven it's up to you so that's what the fbm is really meant to do and we think that because data is so important in today's world that can unlock a lot of opportunities for developers and different solutions out there and then also I always get the question around why use fvm that is evm compatible rather than just using evm Alone um well the the main point here is that it will enable custom logic and storage capabilities to be in a native environment right rather than you um writing your evm smart contract and then writing to a separate storage platform which you might not have much control over um you can actually be able to customize it as much as you want and have everything within within a native environment which makes a huge difference when you actually deploy or Implement your application because then it leads to like a significant Improvement in terms of performance in terms of cost and so on so that is really the key Point as to why moving on to fvm first especially for storage focused use cases would be super great to use with evm rather than just evm alone um and lastly to enable layer 2 storage Focus solutions to be developed at web skill um this is really the vision that we have if you think about web 2 and what for example AWS and allows today um that's what we hope to be able to do with a ton of data and being able to compute the data as well okay so that's kind of the tldr and why so now we've covered the what and the why and we're going to kind of talk about what next so today I was at ifso and I had a I had a hacker coming to me and um yeah a friend that came out and asked me like kind of want to know what else what actually does fbm solve um so I'm gonna go a little bit into that and touch on two areas that we are thinking about very deeply these two days so um for us um there are a few resources over here where you can figure you can see how we're thinking about it we have three key resources over here and these will be in the hackathon cheat sheet you can check them out for ideas I've shared some of them into the Discord so far um and I can keep sharing or answering questions we have a lot of mentors to help you out here but three key resources one would be data plus fbm over here as the first one so that will go deep into things like programmable storage markers data dials if you're really focused on the storage component of your solution what can you build with fvm today so that goes super deep into that and then we have a Solutions list which is uh kind of the current ideas that we have and the workflows that we're thinking around how we can use fvm these kind of go across across the board in many different ways so we're kind of it's not a dumping list but we have a lot of different ideas about how you can build with fvm and we write out detailed workflows that you can go expand on and build for your projects and then lastly we have an even broader and more high level um categories of what you what you could possibly possibly build with fvm so that would be our request for startups um resource which some of you might be familiar with it's been around for a while but these are really broad ideas on what we think people can grow in that space so do check all these resources out you know from super deep to super high level and see where you you and your team want to build in yeah okay so I'm gonna go a little bit uh take it take it double click a little bit into two areas one would be programmable storage markets and one would be data dials and the reason I why I want to double click into these is because I think that these are really areas that um is where fbm really shines right so if you're thinking about using fvm um storage compo having a storage focus is going to make your app have that unique value prop so I'm going to touch a little bit on this um on programmable storage markets there are a few basic building blocks over here this is within the data plus fvm resource that I just shared earlier on I'm gonna walk through them and then kind of get your eye your brain juices flowing around these right so around building blocks um you can think about fbm being able to enable storage deal creation on the Falcon Network so um before the fbm was introduced storage deal creation was something that um developers themselves wouldn't really interact with you wouldn't actually really interact with the fall Point protocol as well and if you wanted to run this process on your own it actually is it does require a lot of steps and it does require a lot of deep technical understanding the process is well tldr pretty long right so we started video Creation with fvm it allows a storage deal to be proposed maybe automatically or maybe you could gain your parameters and you know set it to be event driven and it can actually propose a storage deal do the storage providers using a smart contract and once that that whole process is completed with the smart contract doing it for you it can actually generate a deal ID and return it to your application or to the user to the client themselves so storage deal creation automating that process is is a big building block that we hope to see more of in projects um the other one that we're interested in is data replication so um yes you start your data once but again it's a it's a huge decentralized storage Network you might not just want to store one storage provider you might want to start with you might want to replicate your data across a few storage providers because if one drops in you at least you have a few backups right so the ability to replicate a piece of data X number of times depending on how many you need um across storage providers that you trust or whoever it is that you choose to select um it's going to be super important as well so we're interested to see how you could use fvm to interact with the protocol know that maybe a storage deal um has only been replicated like twice and you want it more and how can it automatically replicate that for you so that's another basic building block that we're interested in seeing um storage provider select selection being able to select storage providers that for example gdpr policies that you want to meet how can you be able to automatically select storage providers that are in a certain geography that you want to work with or maybe fulfill certain criteria that you have and allow you to make the storage deal even faster again these are all composable so it could be a solution that even includes the first three things that I talked about um yeah so think about how you could build like a maybe a huge dashboard that can do something like that or a platform that is you know really an enhanced programmable storage platform and then really quickly we have storage view renewal again knowing that your deal has it's almost close to expiry and how can you renew that automatically these are also things to think about aggregation thing thinking about how you could have like let's say so today on the Falcon Network there is um certain a certain capacity of storage that a certain data size that would be more attractive for storage providers to accept your deal proposal for so if you have a smaller piece of data it will need to be aggregated into a larger deal size first before you can propose and have storage providers to pick that up now what happens if you want to retrieve your one piece of data out of 100 pieces of data and then return it to your client or you want to just renew for that specific piece of data so these are things to think about when it comes to education and we see that as a huge huge opportunity in the programmable Market space because you know users come with all kinds of data sizes and we want to be able to have solutions for that yeah so think about filecoin being a file coin today with a storage provider Network being like this huge destruction you know being like a factory warehouse whereas like when we have aggregation it's like kind of like the reseller and the retailer in the middle that is able to provide that service so we kind of want to see a lot more in the aggregation space um and then I will go a little bit into Data dials in the next slides by one before that I want to show a quick example of what it can mean um to have a storage market so I'm just taking an example as like take it as one of your um alumni from a previous hackathon um this is the data house project um they actually built a really cool all-in-one solution um that incorporated different building blocks that I mentioned earlier of course then back then the tech was a little bit different so there were certain things they couldn't include but they built an all-in-one storage platform over here and that was actually a really powerful platform so you could think about examples like that and then moving on to data dials this is also in data plus fbm it has more of a write-up but I get a lot of questions around what what do you mean by data dials right so really quickly your data dial is a dial as we know it um that is focused on a very important data set so you have like a really large data set that you want to be able to manage renew persist be perpetually stored um control access to so you can do many different things with that dials so we've actually learned a lot of thinking our product team has done a great job of providing uh more of a guidance or framework to think about data allows um so if you think about it as a layer 2 which is the base a layer one which is the base which would be persistent and Perpetual storage kind of similar to what I spoke about for programmable storage Market earlier on so you could take those composable building blocks and put into a data dial to make sure that those that that important data set can be renewed and replicated and so on and then you have a layer two on top of that which you can think about governance and incentivization either through providing tokens that people can earn as I as it as incentives or just do fuel like a different action within the Dow or it could be tokens used for governance to then decide how the data is going to be managed or it could be an endowment fund that could continuously renew a fund the renewal of your data so a lot more thinking in that space and I I know this is something that people have asked for since previous hackathons and they want to see like it's a very New Concept right and so this is something that is very unique to fbm and I think if you build a product or solution here it's going to have um a huge like Market space and it's going to be very very different in the market so we're very interested to see data dials be built and then really quickly I want to show an example of a data dial um again from an early Builder that has been just fantastic um she's also now a mentor which is great um so this was actually SPN Dao formerly known as spindle and now it's called dellen it was from the hack FM hackathon way back and they actually had this really cool example of taking people's credit card data and putting it into contributing it into a data set as part of a dial and then access providing access control on top of the data set so that maybe companies and marketing companies that want to access your data could then pay the dials endowment fund to access the data and then the users could get um directly paid for their data as well so that's a really good example of a data dial in a real world scenario so these are things that you can think about for examples um of how you want to build like how you're going to solve real world problems with the data dial cool so kind of giving you a little bit of an idea there on things that are unique to fvm and of course you can build almost anything that you want with fvm especially anything to do with data um to have a rich depth environment with actually on onboarder integrated a lot of Partners over here so um again I realize this looks like a trivia board of you to guess what Partners these are um shout it on the chat if you know them so you can help shout them out because I didn't put their the titles in here but they are mostly sponsors and they all have integrated with fem and you can use them within your solution as well so it makes for a much richer depth ecosystem and many more of these partner Integrations are going to be coming up very soon okay and then lastly What's Next by fvm um a lot of things um but I think clearly from the product side things that we are super interested in right now is working on proof of data segment inclusion uh we call it Parts I what it actually refers to is remember how I talked about if you have a small data piece within a larger aggregated data deal how are you able to prove that your small piece of data has been stored and how do you know where your data is how are you able to pull it out to then renew in a separate deal and do whatever you want with it but know where it is within that larger segment so part size is one big thing we're thinking about decentralized aggregated Dev tools we're super interested to see developers and maybe even in this hackathon build your own decentralized aggregator we have a few centralized aggregators today that we that allow developers or clients to upload their small data but we would love to see people build their own and think about decentralized solutions for this as well and then we're also thinking of building more stars and more Dev tooling and maybe some platforms as well on our end for replication repair renewal of your data um fbm as a whole and not pertaining to the ebm compatible fvm but we're also planning on scoping out for Native wasm actors to be built so that would be a whole different type of fvm um and more to come on that uh we're also working on a lot more partner Integrations to come in we share your ass for gasless transactions and so on so looking to build some of those Partnerships and integrate more for richer depth experience um some of them might come in during the hackathon we don't know um we hope to bring those in and maybe help you along this month-long hack and then lastly more Dev tooling from DX team to help you with more docs tutorials and so on so a lot more is coming up for fvm super excited you remove as you can see in 2.5 months so many things have happened what can happen during the hackathon so definitely keep an eye out and keep talking to us in the Discord Channel um cool and then where should you begin this is a really simple QR code everything that I talked about should be in here um we have dogs a hackathon cheat sheet that is super easy to use more ideas and grants and hackathons coming up as well um for hack FS do look out for the storage and retrieval series that's coming up so my colleague Matt as well as Hong Hao and lungfei will be covering a three-part series on storage and retrieval they will go deeper into the tools and tutorials and demos on how you can build some of the programmable storage Market components that I talked about earlier on so that you can use it within your project so this should happen within next week and then applications to build with fvm we have Michael exact has built up quite a few starter kits that you could use as templates so he'll be covering that coming Monday as well so you can see how what what starter kit you want to Fork to then build your project from there okay and then um that's it for me um that was a lot I mean I tried to make it simple but still a lot of things because super exciting things are happening with fvm um but again thank you from the whole team as well as really close panels that we work with um again this is like and it's not just everyone on this page there's way more people but um again thank you so much for building with fvm foreign [Music] all right well appreciate this and with this we are ready for our next talk so without further Ado I'd like to bring up ADI and Matt um on stage here and both of them are going to be here talking about all the things that you can actually do in terms of how you can best leverage all the tracks that we have going on and all the Amazing Ideas that you can build from the repository of things that we've already set up here to uh really make the next two and a half weeks super amazing so uh Welcome Matt and I and I'll let you all get started fantastic uh thanks very much yeah so um my name's Matt Hamilton I'm a developer Advocate with protocol lab specifically working on falcoin and the fvm and here I've got Addie if you want to introduce yourself as well Eddie absolutely yeah um I'm Addy shadam I'm the product lead for fem um so you'll you'll see me a lot working with uh hangout Kevin and a bunch of the dxu including Matt oh so the point of this talk is to quickly talk about the various tracks some of the project ideas that we've got some of the bounties and also touch upon some of the bounties not just on regarding fem which is the the largest Bounty here but also some of the other related protocol Labs Technologies and bounties as well because one of the great things about hackathons is you can experiment right that's what's they're all about it's about experimentation it's about learning it's about building things and there's a whole bunch of different Technologies both from within protocol labs and within protocol Labs Network and wider fields that are a part of this hackathon so we'd love you to get involved and you know put together these uh Solutions these ideas these projects these hackathon entries using all these different Technologies and see where you end up so first of all starting with FM filecoin virtual machine we have 22 000 US Dollars um in prizes available specifically for fem so um Sarah has just talked about fem so hopefully you have a good idea about what fem is it allows programmability on top of the filecoin virtual machine and we have three uh grand prizes uh five thousand dollars uh paid in Phil for three teams for the grand prizes plus 14 runner-up project of 500 worth of fill each so the categories that we have set out here if you've been involved in some of our other hackathons you might recognize these we've slightly tweaked them a little bit as we've been going on um from feedback from the hackathons that we've had so far but breaking it down we have dated owls so uh you will have just heard Sarah talk a little bit about data dowels so the idea about having a decentralized autonomous organization that has some uh involvement with storing data right so um examples uh might be industry specific for things like decentralized science machine learning or things like you know a film um show or exhibition or uh you know film film festival or something like that that might want to store things I'm going to go through each of these and then we'll we'll switch over I've got a tab of some fem uh starter ideas and we can go into a bit more detail on them and then I'll come back and also talk about some of the other uh bounties we have available here so defy uh best D5 tools on fem so just like other blockchains other evm blockchains you can build D5 decentralized Finance on top what is unique about fem and unique about filecoin is you have the whole storage provider ecosystem underneath that so you have three and a half thousand storage provider systems on the network they're all providing storage capacity to the network right so something in the region about 12 13 exabytes of data on the network so this is all backed by physical storage systems hard drives ssds around the world storing data so you can build that you can use that capability as part of a defy system so it might be lending to storage providers it might be allowing storage providers to borrow based upon uh future Revenue that they can prove through the blockchain if they take on a storage deal they'll be paid over time for that storage deal they can actually use that a bit like invoice factoring within traditional Finance so that's kind of where D5 comes in the next is Tools in for and bridging uh so this is an opportunity to bridge with other networks and other systems as well and bring in some of their functionality so things like decentralized ID Access Control uh for example from some of the other blockchains and also allows you to export the functionality of filecoin out onto other networks so using Bridges and oracles and things like that as well so Bridges like uh axiller for example um oracles like teller on the network you can use those to export functionality out to other networks programmable storage markets um so this is regarding like we said storage uh we've got the storage providers storage deals generally have a finite Lifetime on the network so programmable storage is building things like Auto renewing storage uh auto replicating storage bounties for storage optimizing storage sectors right the way in which storage is is stored on the network there might be a way in which you could optimize the way in which deals are aggregated together for example so let's do that and then uh d-web it so uh basically looking at uh current web services and applications into more open uh secure and resilient sort of web3 based decentralized based systems uh using some of the other Technologies within vertical Labs as well hopefully that covers it did you want to say anything ADI at this point or shall I switch over to the starter ideas no that sounds great Okay so we've got a series of starter ideas here and they're linked to from the bottom of the prize if you go down here there's under inspiration you'll see list of starter ideas uh so that's what we've got here and we've got a number of ideas here that you can kind of go through so uh things like repair as a service like we mentioned for example you store data is stored in the in the way of storage deals on the network between a client and a storage provider and you might want to have that replicated multiple times for resilience uh using something like replication as a storage but you could use repair as a storage to potentially uh automatically detect that data might not be stored to the level of replication you need or might have some fault with it and that you can automatically repair or replicate that so that's those two kind of top ones there renewal as a service uh you can uh like I said storage deals run for a certain lifetime so you might want to have something that automatically renews the storage deal at the end of the lifetime as well uh building off-chain storage deals so the farcoin network is is built extremely flexibly and it leaves a lot of how the actual storage deal is negotiated up to the users right so it doesn't all happen on chain a lot of it is left to happen off chain and then you can once the deal is negotiated and agreed that then is published on chain and it's then the the blockchain's responsibility to uh query the the storage providers to ensure that the data is stored so uh there may be things that you want to do around how uh data is kind of you know aggregated and how those storage deals are actually built uh before they pass to storage providers uh calling as a service so um this might be using things like cron jobs uh to to regularly call uh you know uh functions on the uh fem on on the filecoin network uh so you might have something that needs to run periodically so something like this could be uh very useful uh endowment managers so again you might have something that takes in a pool of fill and invest and invests it on behalf of the users so it might use something like glyph that have a thing called infinity pool which is one of the staking Solutions and there's another uh fillet for example is another one that um does uh staking so you might have something that Aggregates funds together and invests that on behalf of the users and use this the return of that investment to then fund storage for example um uh things like renewable energy certificates so native renewable energy certificates storing those on the network um and that's that's part of like falcoin green as well um as part of that that's a service that we have so things that deal with that would certainly be of interest uh zero knowledge proofs so the fem is the largest production use I believe of zero knowledge proofs at the moment and uh there's a lot of other things you can build on top of that as well so and there's a link there to more information about that sustainability falcoin green have a project called CO2 storage and there are ideas that you might want to build upon that again there's links to some of those ideas around um energy validation for example uh certificates uh credits that kind of thing as well um retrieve.org this is a project that I believe is from Saturn I think it's it's ADI or related to Saturn um and so this allows uh retrieval like a retrieval Oracle and retrieval assurances on the network so this could be something that could check the network and ensure that stuff can be uh retrieved from the partners on there IPC is the interplanetary consensus so this is a project within protocol labs to work on the next generation of consensus mechanisms that will take filecoin scaling up to you know millions of transactions per second and is going to be looking at using horizontal scalability with subnets and you can have different subnets that allow you to um run specific functionality on on these subnets so there's a number of um ideas around how you could have a wallet that could run on different subnets for example how you can have um things like eigenlayer for subnets we've got multi wallet subnets in there twice I think um and there's a few in there and visualizers explorers all these kind of things that kind of fit in with how IPC IPC works there uh on chain storage deals we've mentioned that data dowels we've talked about that there's a bunch of ideas around data Downs incentivization um that kind of thing ipni disputer so ipni is the interplanetary networking index uh it is the system that allows you to register when you when when a system stores a Content idea CID can register it with ipni to allow uh people to find it and there's a some ideas around how you can ensure the Integrity of that index and what people are reporting so you know thing ideas a bit like uh oracles for example incentivization um for for valid response or penalization for invalid stuff and then finally uh ideas around uh Soul bound tokens again for sustainability claims uh for storage providers so a storage provider might say hey we have 100 renewable energy for our storage um system well how can you both prove that and how can you then allow people to access that information and maybe programmatically then build on top of that so I might have a system that says I it it's automatically only going to make storage deals against uh storage providers that can prove a certain level of sustainability for example so that might be something they they do there um how was that Ali was there anything else to kind of chime in on there yeah I would say one thing thanks for going through that Matt um one thing is uh that we have a couple of workshops next week around a couple of the programmable storage Market ideas that might be worthwhile going to and talking to people about um if you scroll to the right of this table there's folks inside PL and fvm that are happy to talk to you about these ideas and want to learn more about how you want to tackle them um we have resources that we've linked to so that you can attempt to brainstorm or learn more about these Concepts and what underpins them and keep your eyes peeled um the workshops are going to definitely drive more content more material your way um that'll help you um figure out how and what to build in those particular categories so June 8th as uh in parts of the next week are going to be critical for that so yeah is June 8th Monday I can't I can't remember if June 8th is is that uh uh Monday no it's a bit later than that I think um there's there's also some workshops if you go to the east Global site and look through the schedule there's also a series of workshops on Monday so I'll be doing a workshop on um you know on building there my colleague Zach will be doing a workshop I believe as well so there's a number of workshops as well so keep an eye on the um schedule there now just to quickly kind of cover as well uh there's a number of other projects as well within protocol Labs also have bounties so for example uh just quickly touching on a few of these bakio which is a computer of a data platform uh so they have a prize pool as well and uh some examples there of projects around decentralized compute filecoin Saturn is a decentralized Content delivery Network and they have a prize pool there as well regarding applications that build upon their decentralized um uh distribution Network interplanetary consensus I just mentioned that that is a scalability horizontal scalability uh for filecoin and they have some prizes there as well ipfs of course which is where all of this kind of started so ipfs have some prizes there as well so if you're using ipfs or you are um you know improving what's going on within ipfs there's that there lib P2P many people might not realize lib P2P is a library that underpins a lot of these decentralized systems and even other networks as well I believe I think of ethereum 2 and Salon I think both use lib p2b underneath for how their nodes actually communicate with each other um so they they actually have some prizes there as well um just looking here within here for other PL ones oh Falcon data tools uh farcoin data tools you might have heard of a project called Estuary which is an aggregator farcoin data tools is uh the next generation of the tooling behind what will become Estuary version two and uh I will be doing some examples of some of that on Monday as well for how you can do aggregate station from fvm nft storage and web3 storage are also aggregators also part of um or spun off from protocol Labs as well and uh they specifically work with what nft storage as the name might suggest also specifically works with um nfts but they have a bunch of prizes there as well uh oh D Rand D Rand uh so dran distributed Randomness one last one uh from William PL and so uh this is a Randomness uh beacon on the network that allows you to access uh random numbers in a verifiable manner as well uh on the network so um this is a functionality is often included or provided by tools um like uh chain link I believe or or one of them uh while drand is one that provides native um a verifiable Randomness on the Falcon Network so you can use that so there you go that's a a quick rundown to hopefully give you some ideas of what to build there is lots of prizes there there's lots of projects there you know please feel free to build stuff that uses multiple different Technologies both from within protocol labs and within all of our partners there if you go through there there's a whole series of prizes there a whole load of Partners there so please feel free to kind of uh join these together and I really look forward to seeing what you build um and I'm going to be hanging out in Discord as well as well as some of my uh some of my colleagues from the from the devrel team specifically um so Sarah who you heard from just now and also my colleague Zach like I said we'll be doing some workshops next week as well so keep in tune with that anything else to cover Eddie no I think I think uh just uh just have a lot of fun building we're really excited to see what you guys create um and uh and there's a lot of really cool things to build across PL and with an fvm yeah okay thanks a lot all I think that's uh I think that's us thanks man thanks Audi this was uh really cool and uh I kind of loved this being a work session and a talk and everything else because this really is effectively going through everything one by line and talking about all the opportunities so I really appreciate you taking the time and telling us about all the things people can do no problem all right well thank you and with that we are ready for our next panel so up next I want to invite four amazing people here uh we're gonna be talking about everything on fem from a builder's perspective so we have Xiao Natalie and Kate talking about all the things that they're doing and uh Nikki from protocol Labs will be moderating this conversation and we're going to cover all the things that all of you can look forward to as you're building with fbm so Nikki Sean and Natalie and Kate welcome all right I'll let you kick it off and uh take it from here Nikki I think your microphone is off okay yep oh yeah yeah I'm back on I'm back on sorry about that I'm really excited to be here uh listening to all the talk since the summit started and there's been a lot of talks about all the different Technologies people can build on so we're going to switch gears a little bit with this panel and uh I hope uh you know the standard depends an inspiring uh session for you guys to go and build our projects so hackathons are a great great place to learn um and try out different things and hack on ideas and build them out uh but then there are also places where you know bigger stories start and this panel is to share some of these success stories so I won't keep talking and I will let all of you introduce yourself maybe and briefly share what your projects are about and what they do what problems they solve so maybe let's start with Kate sure um hi I'm Kate wall I'm asked if your protocol so as the field is the first liquid sticking protocol on Appian where life now since 12th of April so what we're doing is to connect our coin token holder and storage for Water by offering a decentralized sticking experience and also leverage farming so if you're still sorry for butter you can onboard your note on our platform and I will provide higher profitability and if you're a token holder you do not have a login period but you can stack your money in our protocol so our apy is ranging from 10 to 12 20 now based on the market driven interest rate so the interest is compound that every second so it's solving the efficiency problem in power company so that um for within just six weeks we have more than 200 000 already and uh 160 for a drastic already and now we're joining the Ally Adventures ipfs base camp over and that's why we are here and also are really glad that we have this opportunity to talk with you guys and please try our protocol sdfile.io thank you awesome um yeah Natalie maybe you can go next absolutely yeah so um I would rather say actually that we we don't just have a one project or just a project yeah basically I would I would say we're Phil Fox team so I'm pretty sure since you guys are you know you guys are building on fem or you are protocol apps and stuff yeah you know what that Phil Fox Explorer itself yeah it's basically the most popular data service in the Falcon ecosystem right and even if you go to the to the actual website the first option would be fox actually which I'm very proud of um and yeah basically we provide the One Stop on-chain data display and aggregation services for the filecoin users uh the fixable uh fill Fox Explorer um now fully supports uh fevm which can analyze data for example like contracts and event logs right and also opens the contract verification functions to the community uh so foxworld has oh sorry foxworld oh my God Phil fox has just um announced a road map actually and uh we just sent it out to all our partners as well as uh on our Twitter so you're more than welcome to have a look at it um and stuff so we're going to be kind of like we'll try to actively work on Phil Fox because it's been I think almost four years of existence right but now we're going to be trying to kind of work very um much as well on the social side there you know kind of try to let our partners as well as falcoin understand what we are doing there as well yeah you know try to evolve as well in in a lot of always um and yeah um as you might know we also have other projects that we built as a filmfox team so one of them is FNS space or FNS dial which is basically a DOT fill domain name which is not only a domain name you know because you can actually control or I would say I like to say control though it's more like you know you can kind of register or give your dot fill domain name to your miners as well through the fill Fox so that's a pretty cool thing you know considering it's a domain name yeah the other domains that don't really have this kind of function so it's pretty cool and I believe it's a very good thing for the falcoin itself yeah ecosystem uh and also uh yeah so FNS has actually been integrated by um sft SD Phil Kate shout out there um as well as Phil far oh sorry Phil fox fox wallet and other partners as well and as you might know we also uh taken a big part in developing Fox wallet itself which has reached pretty good numbers uh as of now so yeah Phil Fox team here thank you so much nice um yeah maybe Channel you can go next yeah super excited so I'm uh co-founder and CTO at link and at link we are building GameFly infrastructure allowing game developers to build their web free games in just a couple of minutes uh integrating the web3 aspects inside the game so we are making blockchain gaming accessible for everyone allowing game developers to ship fast build fast and even fail faster as well without worrying about any blockchain complexities cool cool stuff and um yeah maybe let's uh segue into your Journeys on building out products using fcm or in the filecoin ecosystem because I'm sure it's been a journey where you've been curious maybe excited then you started building something then oh and then you were like stuck at some point and then there's like you know you're looking for support looking out everywhere maybe being part of hackathons or other Builder programs and then you know finally like you had the oh yes it's work it works moment right so maybe let's let's walk through your Journeys and um yeah any of you please yes um I guess the Builder journey is like super excited um so I think that few things that critical resources that can help us is like um the familiarity with the vocal ecosystem because some of our team members working around the faculty system for like two years and then that makes us familiar with the fem and support clicker system and the second thing is like a close communication with the product labs and also falcon or slack because uh slack is a good stuff that you can ask any question and you can get from reply easily and the last thing is the cohesive and experienced team that we bought together and then to work for something good and also well one thing to thank you is the online Ventures base camp that really helped a lot all right let me dive in then I I do uh I would like to just say like absolutely agree with everything Kate has just mentioned and probably I would add that for Phil Fox team it was a bit sort of easier at least recently yeah because we already had a big experience in in building on Falco India so we're kind of like when we were already very familiar and understood all the like technical details you know file coin very deep um but so for example building FNS was kind of like sort of easy in this way so once we for example we participated in the hackathon in I think it was December 2022 right so so it was kind of like probably easier in the way but at the same time um you know as a like I am not I'm personally a BD member right so I do business development so there is a certain part of my job you know that where I kind of like getting involved right but when it comes to building of course I don't know as much but what I do know and the feedback that I got from the team was basically is the most important thing is the obviously official documents you know there's always the white paper there is always the the docs there that you have to look at you know and as it was mentioned by Kate like slack you know so you have to always keep uh communicating as well as networking as well as understanding what's happening all the updates and stuff right and you know so this way you can understand basically all the you know compatibility differences of the fvm in the quickest way possible right um and stuff and you know and generally like like at least from our experience the fem team as well as the youth Global team that was super helpful as well throughout the whole like let's say building hackathon building period as well so it was pretty cool you know and and obviously the whole team has to like sink in together and when one person is freaking out the other one has got to be like okay I gotta put this in my hands and then the opposite so that's how it was yeah um I'll go next so uh we like I have been a game developer I'm a builder so I am a developer I love to build and I'm the uh like I I love building I love coding so what I do is I have been running a game studio for more than five years I'm a game developer and uh this entire Journey started because in 2020 uh like we have already built more than 60 plus games hybrid casual casual games and in 2020 when we created our first web3 game we uh we stuck upon a problem that uh infrastructure side of the web 3 stack is completely broken and that's when uh it all started because we created a game a web 2 game in just one week but just to convert that web 2 game to web3 it took us almost two months and that's when we figured our horses are not available in the uh in the space at the moment the complete infrastructure is completely broken there is nothing uh no information as such which is available in the market and we had zero dollars in our bank account and uh when we started link so uh that's when we figured out the problem we started working on the infrastructure side uh we started fixing the problem we started simplifying the blockchain stack for any game developer to create a web 3 game and we have also participated in multiple hackathons because I believe that hackathon is something that brings the best out of a a team a building team a developer or anything because you have a deadline you have uh only 48 hours you have only seven days to build a product and ship it out and I also created a product till the last two minutes uh before I have to push it and the deadline is about to end so it brings the best out of a developer it brings them out of a comfort zone and it increases that hunger to build out uh the stuff that you you wanted to build a since a very long time right and like the last hackathon that we participated was where on dapathon and we born in the mantle uh pool prize and we created the nft deployer working on top of until then we have also been leveraging fried coin ecosystem since a very long time I think since uh more than a year now because that stack is completely decentralized so every in-game asset that is stored on ipfs is spent with file going and when if evm came we have been leveraging fevm as well uh with all our capacity and how we can leverage uh the the power of every VM and file coin at all the possible ways and we have also created the dynamic nft standards in a file coin hackathon which happened I think six months back so like hackathon has been a great game changer for us as well and I believe that any uh Builder out there must participate in hackathons awesome cool maybe I can ask you the next question shanu so you continue along the same line so say when you go to hackathons uh and that and you see like these 20 different projects and all of them look like fun and exciting right and you are like which one do I pick now like how do I start like what's that process like and how what advice would you give to the hackers at hack FS on you know how how to find their way like what to pick also I've also seen multiple companies just built out of hackathon they have just created a poc in the hackathon and later on they have become a multi-billion dollar company because that POC was something that was solving the real issues of the people so I believe that once you are participating in hackathon you have the hunger to solve a problem now that if I have an option to choose among 20 other projects that which one I should build the first thing will be how many problems will I be able to solve with the product uh whichever I go with so if I'm going with one product that doesn't solve the problem but it is super exciting to just like show it off with other people then I would rather remove that out of my to-do list and choose something that actually solves the problem for multi-billion people not even multi-billion people even if I'm solving the problem of thousand members 1000 people I would be happy to do that because right now we have like for example when we started uh we don't had any game developers building on top of us because we were just trying to solve the entire Tech stack for everybody out there but now we have more than 100 plus game projects per building on top of link and when I look at those projects it feels like okay now we have done something uh grateful for them that they are able to leverage our Tech and they are able to integrate the web three elements that took us almost two months to do and they are able to do that in just two minutes so that's one thing that I would look for that if you are building something look out for the problem that you are solving for the people and hackathon is one of the best opportunity to do that out there nice um yeah maybe Kate and uh Natalie you can go next and just like what's the advice you would give to hackers to attack a Fest yeah um I'll say maybe two keywords that one is Pivot and nonetheless confidence um because from what at the beginning um we are planning the IPM open hack day that uh we're not using acid field as the product because we put a little bit at that time I still feels a large product but like you know hacker points like a super short period of time so that we just pivot and because um extra crucial part this is called wfo the raffle and then that part will be easier for us to do and we're more confident and do that and with that part um we like submitting deadline this approaching next Monday then our team confirmed the plan on Tuesday and interface on Wednesday document on Thursday and then video on Friday and then submit it over the weekend so it's super packed and then it's required a lot of um strong execution skills and lots of early planning and also all complete 10 so um for a little bit advice or maybe a little bit further floor I'll suggest that um hackers can go to visit fbm.thaucoin.io that a part called what does Appian unlock because um at the end is like a completely open playing field with unlimited opportunities there's so many things that can think about and also um at the workshop that we are having like today and that will be helped a lot cool um of course I would totally agree and totally sign up for with everything that shanu and Kate said yeah so first of all yeah you gotta bring the value second you gotta have the arrangement the right Arrangement you know how the team works and I guess it also proves a lot of like what kind of team you are and how I wouldn't say maybe reliable UI in general right because it's pretty important right so yeah in terms of value for example what what is important for us yeah because uh we built FNS which is a DOT film domain name right so we were thinking well domain name apart from like because first of all at that time which was December 2022 right it was the you know the the time when the domain names in general for like different chains and networks they were like thriving right it was crazy everybody's super like hyped up and stuff so it kind of like marketing wise and stuff like it made a lot of sense second generally domain names they give you this branding so this would give the file coin itself or fvm yeah the big big branding itself right because because the more projects integrate.fill domain name you know the more kind of visibility it brings to to to filecoin itself right so that's that's one of the uh values that we we saw and the second one obviously was the fact that we also created the minor domain Services well through the Phil Fox so it was like a whole kind of inter kind of connection there so that that's what you know we saw in that and so it was like a perfect combination there and of course the arrangement as I mentioned yeah like one person freaks out another one it goes like okay we gotta we gotta take over this and then and then because what happened for example to us I was I'm the BD right but I was also kind of like like I was taking care of the making video and the uh presentation and stuff you know and there was like 300 recordings and stuff you know and I just only took care of that and then when it came to actual presentation which was at 3am I mean for me and I remember Stephen who was a main developer he was like I think I think I cannot do it so I was like okay I'm gonna take care of this you know so it was like a whole you know you gotta take care of each other and that's that's what was the beauty of it but at the same time it's important for the teams to understand okay if so what we have each other's back yeah we know how to you know help each other in a certain situation because it you know somebody is very good at I don't know building somebody's good at speaking somebody is good at whatever you know because it could it's a difficult kind of thing to do right you can be you can have a fantastic project but a lot of things also depends on like depend on how you kind of present it as well you know it's all you know it's it's the world this is how Humanity works but anyway that's what I would say yeah super agree with everything Kate and Chan who has mentioned so I kind of sum it up sum it all up yeah no I think uh you touch upon like a couple of really important uh points that uh hackers often either don't think about or at least in my conversations that I've had every time I've gone to an in-person hackathon it's like even if you are an already existing big team you can still go to a hackathon and build something out from from scratch and then you never know like you know it becomes a part of your product later or it gives you ideas and you get to explore tools that you might end up using in in very different ways and I think the second part that I really like is that you know you you don't uh I mean yes hackathons are great for developers but then you also need a lot of other people to you know turn your projects into actual companies later uh so hackathons are also a great place to find such people so no matter whether you are not a developer you'll meet developers at a hackathon or if you are a developer you will meet other you know storytellers that you might need at some point uh as as you continue building out your project um so yeah this was awesome I loved hearing your stories I hope hackers sound inspiration uh in it too and yeah hope to see you guys again on some other panel someday likewise thank you for having us just say well okay Channel Natalie thank you so much for that amazing discussion and it was really good insights and I think the takeaway is that uh kind of do something that you enjoy doing and uh it's better to solve a problem for 100 people who really have something than a thousand people that may have probably a a problem so focus on that especially as you've limited time and Nikki thank you so much for facilitating that amazing conversation thank you everybody right up next I want to bring on Jacob from the global team he will be officially taking over uh for me for the rest of the summit and uh being the emcee for the remaining talks for the day so welcome Jacob and I'll let you take it from here awesome thanks Karthik um cool well thanks everybody I hope the Summer's been going so well so far uh I'm pretty excited for this next part of the summit it's a bit of a transition uh you kind of started with uh kind of learning about the hackathon and what's happening this week our next couple weeks then you kind of learned from from Sarah and Matt and Addie about you know how fem Works what's going on um you just had Nikki and crew kind of chat about what it's like to build on the fem and now we're kind of moving into uh what's after so I think one of the coolest things about hack FS is you get access to the amazing protocol Labs Network that exists to kind of help take your project that you build over the next couple weeks from here to really anywhere um that you can dream of so I wanted to kind of have these next three talks chat about what other availability uh what other options there are for you after the event and and just kind of give you an overview of that ecosystem so without further Ado of Reuben join us and Ruben's going to kind of do an intro to the protocol Labs Network and what looks like to be a builder in that Network so I'll leave it over to Reuben take away amazing thank you Jacob always great being here always great meeting the amazing hackers at hackerfs um yeah so as Jacob said I'm going to be talking about what's next what's after hackerfest and how can you scale and your idea with um the protocol Labs Founders program so uh we have been organizing these hackathons for quite a while now and you know some some with it Global and some with other partners and over the years we we have learned a little bit about you we have learned a little bit about you um the hackers that attend those programs and um one thing we've learned is that there are some in this audience today some of you that just want to play around with the technology you want to you know and test the boundaries of what's possible this is maybe a weekend or a couple of weeks heck for you um to you know create an interesting project and learn more about maybe a certain technology and then you might want to to step away but we have also learned that that there are some in this audience that are really keen on really shipping products they're really keen on on building something that that lasts and that many thousands or even millions of users use and find um useful um in their daily lives and what I'm presenting today is mainly delivered at that second group the um you know the Builders out there that want to bring real product um to Market so what we understand about you is that you know you want to ship a product to to millions of users you want to disrupt a 300 billion dollar data economy so you're really tackling a massive market right for a disruption and you do imagine a world where data and liquidity move freely that's um why you're at hackaths and um in the upcoming weeks you know the fem team and many other of the great people um in the protocol labs and each Global and ecosystem will support you but afterwards what's next right um and and we have um thought about this quite a lot at protocol labs and we stood up a program specifically are targeted at you that we call the founders program or the founders program by protocol Labs where we want to support builders that push Humanity forward now um structurally how do we do that right there are three elements to this program there is um a big piece that is obviously the capital so and if you want to build something you know you have to not just invest time but you and have to invest Capital to you know bring it to to version and we have expert programming and we are going to speak about this um quite a bit and then there's a really strong and really important um Community aspect and to this as well um in the upcoming couple of minutes and also in the talks that are going to come after me and we are going to go into all of this and how we execute this and how you apply Etc in quite some detail however for now I just want to like take a step back and you know relate myself to you um a little bit and kind of give you an idea of of who I am and where we as a team um are coming from um so first of all I feel you right like creating a startup is hard I I've been there myself I've um you know been creating startups since since 2013 I was dealside the VC um investing in delivery hero and you know went through this deal joined the the global management team and took that to IPO two rows also IPO and this year and I was part of the farming team um uh of proof which was acquired by tool for about 100 million dollars and then um most recently um I was part of the founding team of pumpkin which which surprised 100 million of annual recurring revenue and in 2021 however this is this is what it looks like right but this is not what it actually feels like um as an entrepreneur you go through do you go through some apps but you have to cross a really you have to cross really really deep valleys so if you look um you know these are pictures that actually um my longtime partner provided me of of her perspective of kind of like how how she sees me as an entrepreneur you know like big bags under my my eyes um you know just napping on the couch fast food while you know I'm I'm developing product and and so on and so forth right so I I really emphasize with you and the founders story is is an extremely tough story particularly now that we have you know and entered a pretty deep kind of trip the winter and you know the regulatory environment is Shifting around us so as a team we we thought really hard about how can we be best of health to you how can we best support you and the structure that we came up with in late 2020 is that of um the builders funnel and the builders funnel hopefully by the end of all of the presentations that are going to be given to you today is going to be intimately familiar to you and you will have a really good idea of how to interact with it and how to um apply for you know the individual pieces within this program so naturally the funnel kind of flows from left to right it features education and for those of you you know who are who are early and just discovering this the stack it features hackathons I mean we're all here to hack right so you probably know that for for many many years we have been organizing these hacks and this is kind of the the top of the funnel where we meet you right where you develop your early ideas but some of you you know as I explored earlier might want to progress you don't want to you know and kill the idea you don't want to drop the idea post hackathon but maybe you have you know built a strong relationship with um your teammates maybe you've won a prize or maybe you've just fallen in love with the idea and the friction that you're solving and now you want to proceed and there are a couple of of ways that you can do that one you know kind of like the first step is Grants they are not just micrograms micrograms are in the in the range of like three thousand to five thousand dollars but there are also death grants and these are targeted at you know let's say you participate in this hackathon and you you feel that there's something in our stack that's missing is a clear friction that you are addressing and you and your team want to tackle this as um as kind of like an um an open source contribution to the overall pln stack please feel free to reach out to us we would love to um Aid you with a grant and help you you know and bridge that that Financial need and so you can focus on delivering against it next is accelerators my um team member James is going to take quite a bit of time um following on this talk to speak about why the how and the when of accelerators and also um to how you best apply to it um after James was speaking Gabriel actually one of our amazing Partners we have been partnering with Gabriel for many many years graph paper capital and tachyon and it's going to speak and you can kind of get a Hands-On feel of what an accelerator feels like and then there's obviously the big big part which is um you know investment as protocol Labs we have a number of investment funds so so let's say you graduate from an accelerator or you know coming out of a grant your idea is is Crystal Clear there are a number of boxes that you tick and you now feel that um you're ready to take your and product to Market you have maybe um you know initial product Market fit then we stand ready you know to and invest into your seat around pre-seed round even and or support your series A so this is the builders fund now how are we doing how um is the Builder's fund has the builders fund progressed since its exception in 2020 um the family has created billions uh in dollars of value um as you can see kind of progressing from from left to right we have been steadily growing the ecosystem and if you look at these individual bars kind of vertically you will see that many of the startups that have started like you today in the audience as you know hacks maybe even weekend hacks you know have progressed to Serious a series PE seriously even series D and Beyond right and and what I'm you know particularly I guess excited about is that a number of the bounties that are announced today for this particular hackathon come from startups that you know have gone through the entire Builders funnel end-to-end and have once been just like you um you know hackers at a hackathon a number of you know examples that jump out are like you know the Monas declutters and huddle01 um and others now while we understand that the builders funnel is is extremely critical and we need to really meet you where you are in your entrepreneurial journey and you know whatever step you take we need to kind of have an answer and a support system to support you we also understood over time that it's not enough right so there are other things that we have layered and augmented the builders funnel with to kind of supercharge your entrepreneurial journey and number one is funding right so um we have a number of funds um that cater to yours particular situation you know and if you are more kind of um you know ecosystem Network growth SP focused you know there's a different team that can support you and can assess your um individual needs best and we do follow-on Investments of course so it's not just you know a one-time deal with us we want to you know follow on in your entire entrepreneurial journey and then there's also fundraising support as a first time founder especially when you come from you know a technical background never been to a business class the strategy and tactics on how to approach a fundraise to begin with is actually not very intuitive right and has to be taught and and we can help you with that a second piece is community right um when you are a Founder the most um dangerous thing you can be is alone and what you want is you want to have an amazing Network an amazing kind of augmentation of advisors and people that have similar uh challenges or even a little bit ahead in um in their journey and around you so you can consult them you can share um your frictions with them you can um you know consult them basically in your darkest hours because they will come and you will benefit greatly from their input um and and the access that we provide you through the amazing Founders in our ecosystem the main ways we do that is we have an invite only um telegram group and a couple of other forearms we have a Founders Day a couple times and the week which is truly invite only and they create like an intimate space where you can ask questions that you know you you might wouldn't want to ask a VC or a senior executive but they're easy to ask appear the third bucket is expertise talent and services we have the amazing team over at pln Andrew Wu Denny's Etc that um have put together a large bucket of of services they call it Mosaic and they call it pln Services marketing Council and that can help you supercharge your business but they're also you know um there's also legal advice uh recruiting help right we help you recruit at highly highly reduced fees for your initial hires and we have a superstar team that can help you you know think about and hiring thesis Etc which is obviously a very very key piece of and how to scale a startup um in the fourth bucket and we have visibility in marketing the protocol Labs brand um goes quite far so we have been around in the space and obviously over time naturally we have built legitimacy and Trust in the space um and this can be very very helpful for Founders and we want to be a platform for you to celebrate your wins with you right so what we do with Founders in the ecosystem and as part of the founders program is we listen and we track you and we have conversations with you and as you as an example you know announce a new product launch or um you know announce an um successful fundraise we want to amplify it right on our marketing channels on our twitters we might even release a press release and so on and the last piece I want to stress and for this one I'm you know going to double click a little bit in one specific event that we host and is is the networks that we curate right so there are two networks that we have um you know specific attention to as part of the founders team one is um you know the the the network of um of top Executives and Founders that we want to bring in to help consult you right to assist you in your go to market to maybe become advisors in your startups um Etc right the um one of the most um the most dangerous things you can do is fly blind right you want to especially in crypto where a lot of things where the level of uncertainty is already very high right you want to de-risk your um go to market your fundraise you the timing how you roll out product the sequence how you you know engage with your roadmap and you want to de-risk this as much as possible and the top Executives in our networks um can help you do this quite a bit because they have been there and then secondly we have an extensive investor Network um we have thousands of investors that you know frequently interact and and track our portfolio and um you know becoming part of that Founders ecosystem can really really help you you know get legitimacy for your countries but also you know get started and get a foot in the door with one of the some of the biggest names in the space um this connects very well with the next piece I want to talk about which um is Phil VC and Phil VC is a very particular event it's a investor focused invite-only event where we invite the best investors globally sometimes for an in-person event like in Singapore last year and sometimes for an online event to hear pictures from the best startups in web3 and this is truly this is truly a huge lift um in in Singapore alone we had more than three trillion of assets under management in the audience you can imagine what that means um for for your fundraise and how it can you know supercharge um your um your race and decapitalization and chances of success for your business here on the left you see a couple of names of you know the people that attended a16 crypto polychain y combinator blue yet Etc they were all um present and and in the audience um a number of names that you know successfully raised from Phil VC we have the table lands The Flicks and and the transcripts all of them you know kicked off their rounds um actual VC and generally you know the feedback that we get from teams that participate and are selected it's only about 20 to 25 uh teams every time um they they love the experience and kind of the white glove approach um we provide them and giving them the big stage I think one way to think about who we see as someone who has rest before is concentrating two to three months that you would normally have to spend at Silicon Valley Singapore maybe London um to you know a couple of minutes on a very big stage that um that that really count all right so um you've heard kind of the overview of the founders program from me um but this is obviously not Justin is a huge team that's kind of lifting this um you know please feel free to reach out um to us reach out to James Nikki Yaya Julia Dawn and Ange Carlin and yeah we will be happy to route your request and and help you as as best possible thank you awesome thank you so much for that intro to the funnel Reuben and and what that's like uh from a builder's Journey um I guess end to end almost and and then beyond so um really awesome as Reuben mentioned I think it makes sense just to jump right into the next talk um we're gonna invite up James uh James's uh on the accelerator side and Partnerships uh as part of that funnel as well um and uh as kind of Reuben mentioned you know there's sort of the zero to one moments of of creating ideas and and executing those ideas and building an MVP that's what the hackathon is for um and then once you're done with that thing and you start getting traction there's just a bunch of new things that pop up new problems to answer and it's the best thing that that's possible is to have people around you going through the same thing and we've gone through that before as well so uh inviting up James to the stage to kind of chat about how the accelerator program um that pl's been leading and uh to share more about that so James when you're ready foreign thank you very much Jacob and great to see everybody here today I'm going to talk a little bit about um how and why you should be applying for a protocol Labs accelerator program um we're going to touch a little bit on the what's and the whys of acceleration we're going to talk about the protocol Labs approach to accelerators we're going to touch upon how you become a protocol Labs founder and what that means uh it's not all one way we're going to hear a little bit about our expectations of Founders on our programs and then obviously the next steps for you guys on how to apply so first and foremost the what and why of acceleration as I'm sure many of you know accelerators our fixed term cohort based programs that ultimately help turn your idea into a business they'll give you education mentorship resources often financing and so much more and they are intense and they are immersive they often compress years of education and insights into usually a number of weeks they they focus best for projects that are early product but tend to also be pre-revenue and they culminate in a demo day where you get to Showcase your Amazing Project including all of the insights that you've gathered from the program to a wide variety of investors accelerated programs can really help you get the traction that you need for your idea as Ruben mentioned uh a number of graduates from our programs started exactly where you are now with hackers incredible teams like Power Loom 1001 secured finance and many more they sat where you are now as a hacker and at hackathons we obviously are encouraging all and any ideas and then they took that idea through an accelerator program to really cater up catalyzed the validation of the idea um for folks who haven't seen uh Juan gives a fantastic overview of how to build a web free startup all the way from when that is uh your idea is a very very nascent concept through to finding very strong product Market fit for your project and scaling and growing your business and obviously as John Lennon famously said about hackathons and hackers you may say I'm a hacker but I'm not the only one you are among peers in your journey so what is unique about our Approach at protocol labs to accelerators well you've seen this visual um just before from Reuben we want to help take you from your hackathon stage in your journey and working on your project or idea down the funnel towards acceleration and turn you from a builder into a fully fledged entrepreneur ready to hit escape velocity well our accelerator programs give you three things they give you the knowledge the networks and the capital to help you succeed we have two sorts of programs at protocol apps we don't run our own program in-house but we partner with the best tech Partners across the world to co-deliver amazing programs our co-branded programs with Incredible companies like techstars like long hat like outlier Ventures and graph paper capital and you'll hear from Gabriel from graph paper Capital straight after me we partner with them as protocol Labs or far Corner one of our other brands and co-deliver the programs together investing in every single team and taking a really Hands-On approach what's unique about these programs is all of the companies are building on our technology so you are among friends when you are trying to work out how to solve some of the frictions that you're facing we also have strategic Partnerships with Incredible Partners like a16c crypto TV Labs Alliance style and many more these programs are the flagship programs that these Partners run and we partner with them to provide the pl specific parts of the curriculum and also offer the suite of support services that Reuben outlined including access to our community our network of mentors our investors and so much more so these are not necessarily exclusive to teams building on our Technologies but you usually have a few other folks who are building on Falco and ipfs sem and more to talk shop with we take our partnership selection extremely careful seriously and our programs are really carefully designed um and around how to enable you to succeed so we look for the most experienced uh programs with extremely strong program management so the entities of the programs have you know are often multi-time Founders have exited several companies are the best people to help you on your journey we take seriously the partners from an investment perspective so ideally all of our partners have their own investment vehicles to give you capital or they have extensive Partnerships or networks with investors around the world they also tend to have extremely deep ventures of mentors and experts and so we cross fertilize our mentorship and and extensive investor network with Theirs to make sure we get you in front of every single person that could possibly help you and ultimately there's an ethos piece here our partners all believe in web 3 and they are committed to building decentralized networks one thing I want to touch on in particular is the importance of cohort based programs we intentionally run all of our programs as cohorts because we know intimately the power of peer-to-peer connection with your peers on these programs you don't just connect you build you grow and as y combinator as many of you I'm sure will be aware um espouse better than anybody else your peers often become your first partners and your customers on your entrepreneurial Journeys we've been doing this for quite a while now um and so we've we've got a very good idea of what it takes to succeed in this very difficult um uh building of a project or a business that scales through product Market fit and Beyond and so we've been able to repeatedly catalyze the founders almost 300 of them um across our Network and Beyond we've run over 36 cohorts with the best Partners in web 3 and Beyond and those companies have raised hundreds and hundreds of millions in external Capital so you know trust us to empower and best support you to catalyze your build so what is exciting about becoming a protocol Labs founder and why should you do it well all of you here today take a step back let's look at what a cohort in the life of a PL founder might might include day one you shot your program you meet some of your peers you Bond over the legal implications of dsns and smooth jazz Kenny G all the rest of it by week three you're Blown Away on a workshop about ZK Roll-Ups and you stay all night up to research and potentially integrate that into your product week seven you have a convict coffee with a mentor that you've requested to connect with who subsequently advises you to do something different you pivot a fortnight later you've three extra users and by week 12 you've got your first deal sheet from a pitch with an introduction to a top tier VC and you pop the bubbly on an alcoholic beverage of choice hopefully that gives you a nice flavor of what an accelerator experience might be like but don't worry if that's not your jam we have a number of different programs each of them bespoke so there's something for every single founder some of our programs are focused on technical Founders and turning you into fully fledged entrepreneurs some of our programs are for business Founders that and they're helping you find your technical co-founders or technical CTO and support functions and there are other programs that have very very unique approaches to acceleration Ally Adventures for example focuses on identifying your biggest friction and Promises to resolve it by the end of the program tachyon likes the color code Founders and then subject to how you react to both anticipated and unexpected consequences tailors your go-to-market from your color alliances a program for much much more mature team so you might have been on an earlier stage accelerator even a pre-accelerator I think oh I've done an accelerator program I don't need to do another one don't worry we've got some that are focused on series a at teams and Beyond the best way to think about our accelerator programs is as a gateway to a number of benefits from across the entire PL Network Reuben briefly touched upon some of these but I want to double click on a few in detail that are specific for accelerator programs so the first thing is we have devised and built out with all of our partners and programs a really resilient curricula that covers everything you need to know about building successful startups in web3 that's it includes amazing high quality programming workshops and privileged Technical and Engineering support to give you a sense of who some of the people that you'll hear from on your curriculums talk all about everything from web3 business models to tokenomics to how you tell the story of your product or brand to how you fundraise build communities and more you'll hear from some of the most leading Minds across web 3 who've been also exactly where you are now including our own family Juan who is on the Y combinator program in 2014 and we are here today as PL because he sees the opportunity of an accelerator program at that time secondly I think Ruben mentioned so I won't double click on too many of these in detail but you have funding you have access to early stage Capital as well as all of our support to help you fundraise again rumor mentioned this but I want to double click on the importance of networks not just of mentors and and you can have different mentors that support your course you can have ex or current Founders that teach you about how to become a better founder you can have invest their mentors they really tell teacher about how to fundraise and close deals once you've got your foot in the door you can have Executives who can give a very different perspective of how you might grow and scale your company or you have experts that can help you solve really technical or other issues that your business is trying to result these are really really important Network don't just extend to mentors investors or other they extend to your peers it's really crucial to build those strategic relationships and Partnerships with those on your cohort and across the communities you are fortunate enough to be part of because they will help you succeed I promise you that obviously the support that has been outlined earlier from The Amazing Giga brains at protocol labs and this extends across the entire network so whether or not you will have you want support on and one of our core protocols you want support on cryptography or zks you want ad support from our our talent function to help you find colleagues that you need to help build your company or as was outlined by Reuben earlier through the pln the Messiah cervix service provider Marketplace is amazing you want discounts on Legal Services on design you know whatever you can think of there is a service and a provider for you and always at a very strong discount for you as a PL founder visibility is really important in succeeding for your business especially as you get to the end of your program we give you the platforms we give you the events we feature you in newsletters we invite you to every opportunity and that we offer to enable you to to Showcase and demonstrate what you're building and the community there is a lot spoken about when it comes to community and web free um and I think it is one of the things that Alliance brings us all to even closer we are all part of the same Global Community we are all part of the same web 3 community and we like to think of our Founders Community as a microcosm of that it really will enable you to connect Build and Grow to nearly 300 other Founders and the rest of the network that is there ready to support you so a little bit about our expectations as I close out today firstly how do you maximize getting onto your pro onto one of our programs what is our expectation of the teams that are accelerator ready well think about it as three buckets plus community the first is around feasibility can what you're building actually be built not just as a as a prototype but as a fully fledged business can it become a scalable product and service that finds product Market fit and attracts investment and are you the right people to build it the best founder stories are the people that have lived in friction and then and then come up with a solution to solve it and bring other people on that Journey secondly the desirability does what you're building solve a real world problem or friction will people actually use it as you're building it and when you think you've built it although building never stops and then finally on viability can what you're building find that all important future growth and attract that into all important investment and then wrapped around this there's no point building any of this in a silo you have to Garner support from others who believe in what you're building and can support your course so the community aspect isn't often overlooked but really important part of any application onto our accelerator programs how do you maximize once you're on a program what are expectations of you well ultimately you craft your path active engagement will lead to active reward if you are engaged if you are active if you keep us updated you tell us about your investor updates your frictions your challenges and you use us how can we help solve them how can we make connections introductions help connect you with the right person to solve a small friction that might lead to a big improvement with your product you have to lean into us to reap those benefits and we really really encourage you to do so not just us the entire Founders ecosystem that is there ready to support you so I assume you are now fluffing at the mouth ready to apply to one of our accelerator programs and don't worry it is super super easy to have it in the back of your mind as you're building Heap the words of the John Lennon on hackers so all you need to do is scan the QR code on the left side of the screen that says scan me that will take you to our protocol Labs accelerator program homepage on notion on this document you will also find more information not just about how to apply and enroll but also more about what is in it for you as a Founder some of the requirements we have of our applications and then plenty of more information and that will answer all of your questions you will scroll down onto this page you will click apply here now and then there are two options here for you in applying for a program option number one is you join our wait list for all of our accelerator programs that are looking for teams on for their accelerators so you join a sourcing pool of all the teams to which all of our partners can look through your application and then actively reach out to you to say we are interested in your product or build we'd love to have a conversation and invite you to potentially apply or Join one of our programs or if you know what you want or you've had a conversation with somebody and you think you might be best fit for a specific accelerator you can choose option two where you can apply to the programs directly and all of our programs including those that are sourcing are listed by the second link good news there are two amazing accelerators that we've worked extremely closely with the leadership team for many many years currently sourcing the teams specifically fvm teams and they are graph paper capital and you'll hear from the amazing Gabriel very shortly and long hash Ventures so do check out those requirements and apply either throughout or following your hack really do use us I

before him I think if anything you should take away from this they are here for you and that they've spent a lot of time thinking about how they can support Builders uh and people like you who are starting in the funnel or further down the funnel or really any part of their Journey so um yeah thank you both again and and thank you James for for jumping through that um and awesome cool so um I'm excited to bring on uh somebody that I love talking to I feel like every time I talk to Gabriel I walk away with different ideas different ways of I think you love the world um and they're always very positive so I'm excited to welcome Gabriel from graph paper Capital to chat more about uh the work that they're doing there and just as James mentioned um the kind of fpm cohort that they're bringing through as well so Gabriel welcome to the stage and excited to have you good to see you Jacob uh how are you doing yeah life's great yeah it's great awesome cool cool um awesome well I always love being here always love speaking to the amazing teams that are building and hacking at the hack Fest events um so I've got 15 minutes to blow your faces off uh I can't believe I just said that out loud actually um but um so I want to try to give you as much value as possible over the next 15 minutes um super excited to be here um today's session title is how to take your hackathon project um and turn it into a sustainable startup um so a little bit about me I'm a previous free time founder two-time eir um I previously uh was the founder and managing director of a web 3 accelerator called tachyon of the last four and a half years I've backed over 90 Founders in Krypton what three they've collectively raised about 150 million almost a billion dollars in total valuations and um having been a three-time Founder myself I made a lot of mistakes along the way uh I've built Venture scale businesses and I built in of one businesses um so I've seen quite a bit um graph paper capital is it we're an early stage welcome accelerator we're a networked ecosystem and we really like to back the most ambitious Founders who are defining the future of web3 um really helping to accelerate pre-seed and Seed stage Founders within the space with giving them access to Capital Access and insights we've been working with the um protocol Labs team for a long time um and so I think one of the things that I I kind of want to um you know help set the context around you know I I've had to make the transition from like an early project uh into um a venture Scale Company lots of times uh seeing it you know from myself but I've also backed a number of really amazing companies and Founders that got their start at hackathon just like many of you who are here today um so I've seen firsthand tons of amazing teams that have had to struggle through making that transition and I've seen Founders really successfully make that that transition some of them I think are actually sponsors of hackathfast and it's really cool seeing that um and so over the years I've been able to spot the trends and what successful Founders do as they make this transition from a from a project maybe something that you've been hacking on over you know the span of a weekend or a couple of weeks um and I want to share with all of you some of the patterns I've seen and uh you know I'm the big believer that success leaves Clues so the the the big transition that you're going to have to make as you go from a hackathon project to whether or not this can be a sustainable startup um is going from building what you think is cool uh to validating with real users that there is real demand there do other people want what you're building the difference between a project and a company is a customer and as a Founder you're gonna have to get ruthless with finding what's called Product Market fit and the value that you're delivering to users and being able to prove it ASAP everything you do when you make that transition from your product to raising Capital to hiring it is all in service of your users and customers I I'd honor the three three codes that I've previously found it but I didn't tell you about the six to seven eight nine ten projects in between that were either lifestyle businesses or that just could never get escape velocity they just couldn't find product Market fit so I've gone through this you know a number of times myself so my advice uh for today's session is not theoretical I've Loved this um and so there's a series of questions that I think you want to start to ask yourselves as you're coming out of hack FS to start to answer um that will help assess if this is the thing that you should spend the next five to seven years of your life building um so let's jump right into it here are basically the five key areas that you should be analyzing as a founder or as a group as a a group um to analyze and determine if this is startup worthy or not uh so I'm gonna unpack these one by one just time check all right doing pretty good um so first team a perfect product in perfect Market can still still with an imperfect team and so like a lot of products come together in hackathons uh you know for the the hack um but you know a great team I've seen time and time again that a great team can overcome all the fits and starts uh to make it work so when you come out of hackathon you've got some ideas you've got what might be an early product or you have a feature or something like that um the version that you have today might not end up being the version that ends up being the one that has real product Market fit and so you're going to go through a lot of uncertainty there's this Valley of Death every founder has to has to uh Traverse and you know all those fits and starts and challenges the the question is does this does the founding team the group of you that are that are building and hacking together do you have all the critical skills that your business is going to need and if not how do you go about getting them so some of the questions you want to think about and asking yourselves as you're coming out of hack FS is one like do you have a history of shipping together or did the team just meet up at the hackathon there's nothing wrong with meeting up the hackathon um but before you decide to do something like take on a startup together maybe you want to get a couple of Cycles together maybe do a couple of hackathons together before you decide whether or not you're ready to make that leap um the great thing about hackathons is that you you're forced to ship fast and you're putting these really high pressure pressure situations so you can really vet potential co-founders um you know in terms of being able to keep your cool under stress and pressure you might want to ask yourselves you know does everyone actually want to continue on with this thing that you built uh and uh and potentially get Venture funding or go through an accelerator um do you as a team have complementary skills do you balance each other out do you have a unique insight into the market or this or a set of users in an industry um and if your team is is lacking in any key areas like domain expertise or maybe uh business operations or fundraising or something like that you know what's your plan to fill that Gap can you fill it with mentors can you fill it with you know getting access to some of the amazing resources that James was just talking about or in an accelerator and I'll talk about paper Capital at the end of this but these are some things you want to ask yourselves as you're thinking about you know the team Dynamic within your hack project um the single the reason and the reason why I wanted to spend a little bit of extra time on this one is the single biggest risk that we see at these early stages are founder disputes and founder breakups the early days are extremely high risk and high stress and early founding teams are subject to the same interpersonal problems um and require effective you know governance you know so can your relationship survive that tumult and I think that's that's the thing that you really want to ask yourselves as you're thinking about do we want to continue on with this coming out of um out of the hackathon um one question I do get um often is um you know solo Soul hackers uh versus you know forming a team do I need a co-founder et cetera um single Founders may not cover you may not cover all the the critical skills and uh really subjects um you to um being able to wear a lot of different hats and so um you know the question is that you want to ask yourself is do you really think that you can do it alone um if not um you know what's your plan to fill some of those skill gaps and I think that's where having access to networks having access to mentors um is a really valuable thing uh in terms of the the team most Founders that we back are highly technical so I'm gonna assume that anybody who's here at the hackathon hackath you can probably build a product um but technical skills alone are not sufficient the founders that I have seen succeed time and time again you know at this stage I've raised millions of dollars for some of my companies um I've done the bootstrap thing gotten to seven eight figures um you know 10 million Runway business uh bootstrap um the thing that I've seen time and time again is in addition to um you know having those strong technical skills uh do you have strong founder market fit in other words do you understand the industry the domain the vertical that you're building in even if it's kind of like a new frontier web3 thing um what's the web 2 uh what's the web 2 equivalent that you're disrupting and do you understand the pain points of that particular market so do you have strong for under Market fit um two startups are real really hard you you are going to have to hustle like crazy and depending on the type of Thunder you are hustling these different things you know can you sell can you build your product you know whatever it is um you've got to have that drive you got to have that hustle and then finally the best Founders are really good storytellers you know can you inspire others to come along on this journey with you you are a high risk proposition literally to everybody you speak with in those early days and so in order to overcome that you're gonna need an edge let's assume that you can build the thing that you're building that you're hacking on uh here over this week um during hackath um after that what's your Edge and you're going to need the the one if not all three of these okay so that's a team dynamic um let's talk about the market you you are all building a product that exists in a market with either direct or indirect competitors and so as you start to think about transitioning from a project to whether this is an actual sustainable startup in business you want to better understand your market and the users in that market what are their key pain points what assumptions are you making about these in that market and how can you quickly validate some of those assumptions how big is the market how fast is it growing um that's important to understanding whether this is going to be a project that you Tinker with um a nice nice lifestyle business and I've built a number of those there's nothing wrong with that um or is the market opportunity large enough that you you want to think seriously about raising money for your idea and and going through like an accelerator so I think there are two approaches to product Market fit in web3 um when it comes to Market sizing and I've seen both work so the first is can you capture a large percentage of a small but a really fast exponentially growing Market um so a lot of the times this will be like a web 3 native Market um but it's growing by two three four five to six hundred percent compounding annual growth um and so you know if you capture a large percentage or share of a small but fast way market then you're just gonna ride that growth curve um of that market and be a market leader and then you can start to peel off into ancillary markets um as you raise and we cover a lot of that during our accelerator um but the second approach is building what I might call a web 2.5 company and using the web3 stack as a key differentiator across one of the four critical attack vectors and being able to basically out compete web 2 companies using a better more efficient um so either way you're gonna need to build in a very large and going Market um and the way that you get I literally uh was was mentoring a Founder earlier today um the difference between building a vitamin versus an aspirin the the analogy basically is you know an aspirin is relieves pain like I'm in pain I need to alleviate that pain now um a multivitamin is like a nice to have it's like I know I should take vitamins then you should I know I should take care of my house but yeah I'll get to it when you're when you're trying to figure out is this a hackathon project or is this a potentially sustainable hybrid startup you need to find that high value pain point and be that aspirin in the market by offering a differentiated solution and you are going to need to ruthlessly assess if the market you're going after is large enough or that you're making a bet that it will be extremely large um it'll be in the extremely large market and that you can own it um and that's the web 2.5 versus web 3 native approach thing that's important here you know the world is full of smart motivated people who just can't execute and build and so depending on your audience your objective and the level of complexity of your idea or your MVP your minimum viable product your your product will range from some low Fidelity build maybe a no code solution or something like that to test some of your key assumptions all you know to like Dynamic ux designs on figma or something like that all the way up to full-blown High Fidelity products that require a lot more building and coding in half of should right code that's exactly what you should be doing um if you're you know if you're technical but once you start transitioning from Project to Startup and especially as a startup that has raised money you need to have a strong understanding of the users in your Market before you start writing a lot of code you might be incurring a lot of technical debt so like even D5 solutions that require like security audits they can be de-risked or validated with users before taking on the heavy cost and complexity and time commitment of like an audit for example so you really want to assess your riskiest assumptions in your technical roadmap and your product uh and the market and then validate those with users and then show that you can prioritize your product roadmap as you increase the believability of your product builds with real users in the market so every version of your product should be getting you closer to higher and higher Fidelity builds with real users okay traction Community Building startups do not fail because of a lack of technology I promise you they fail because of a lack of customers and users and so you need to understand your users intimately and in the early days you're really looking for the highest value pain point and you're trying to see if you can solve that pain point and build real demand so you're going to start with your hackathon community that's an obvious place for you to start that's usually where most hackathon projects get their first couple of users or customers and you know maybe some of you are going to win certain prizes and that'll be great um but I at some point you've got to finish her out of of that community in this community and venture out into the market and speak with people who don't know you and don't know what you're building and see if there's real signal there and the best Founders in Weaponry that I've seen um are really good about building in public and harnessing Community the great thing about building a community and building in public is that even if your project pivots and you end up changing you you have this asset this amazing asset that you can bring along with you that that can pivot along with wherever you go um the other big mistake uh that I see Founders um make especially coming out of hackathons especially those who end up winning the prizes is they mistake these vanity metrics for real demand things like Discord followers and Twitter followers or you know bunch of Judges told me that this is great um that that's that's good but that's not convincing of real user demand so if you're making this transition and thinking about do I have a real startup here in my hands you you need a clear set of early adopters that are ready to use your product not you know some of these vanity metrics and and or you want to be aligned with very clear industry Trends you are you're going with the the puck uh you're skating towards where the puck is going so you don't need a ton of growth in the early days especially coming out of the hackathon but what you want is and need is real signal of user demand so can you show that there are real users that love what you're building or chomping at the bit to actually use your product your your MVP and it doesn't matter like about like raising money or accelerators or anything like that you want to prove this for yourself so you'll end up spending unnecessary time um chasing a thing that doesn't have real demand um okay and then we get to funding um uh I'm gonna both use a little bit I think as a as a web 2 as a web three founder you have a lot of funding options to you that um even web 2 companies don't have and so you want to start thinking about does this project that I'm working on or building on does it fit the Venture profile is it in a large and growing Market can it be a billion dollar type company um and the great thing about building a web 3 is you have a lot of sources of of Capital that you can get access to along the way while you while you hit your next set of milestones um and so I think I have here we go yeah so you've got just a kind of like a additional Adventure versus what three Venture um you you all have access to wonderful uh ecosystem funds non-dilutive grants hackathons like this um maybe strategic Angels you've got seeds you've got accelerators traditional DC investment dials um you know you can raise by exiting to your community so you've got a lot of funding options available to you which gives you optionality and an unfair competitive Advantage as you're thinking about your uh your project so those are the five tiers that you really want to hone in on and think about um as you as you start to think you know is this a project that uh that I want to maybe take to the next level with the next uh set of investment or growth with like an accelerator so I'll show just a little bit about graph paper capital for those of you that are interested in something like an accelerator um we're extremely bullish on svm I've been uh in partnership with file coin critical labs and for years now um I think FTM is probably one of the most exciting spaces to be building and hacking in um right now so this is a little bit about graph paper Capital um I think the the thing that we really seem to do is is give our founders um we specialize in preseason seed stage Founders I think that's what we're really good just myself having been a three-time Founder I guess four time now um two-time eir um and and then uh our Network and our ecosystem uh is tremendous with with early stage Founders and so we give you seed Capital um we try to build infrastructure around your startup I don't want our Founders having to reinvent the wheel especially if you're a first time founder so we give you during the course of 12 weeks battle tested tools resources playbooks Frameworks the things that we've used to successfully build companies as you look for products Market fit within web3 and then this amazing network of fellow Founders and Builders um the great thing about having uh you know a strong Network um is uh is not only do you have sources of capital that could be potential Angels or seed investors um but typically Founders who are also early stage investors are some of the best early beta users they give you the absolute best feedback and our network is made up of a lot of Founders that we've previously backed um I think it's one of our unfair competitive advantages as an accelerator and ecosystem our emphasis is heavy heavy heavy on that zero to one stage finding product Market fit how do you take the web 2 Playbook and layer in the unfair competitive advantages that you have of finding product Market fit within web3 and then the other thing is fundraising preparation um teaching you as a Founder how do you actually go about launching and running a successful fundraising process the fundraising market right now is extremely difficult especially if you're in web3 and crypto and I see a lot of Founders that just don't actually know how to run a fundraising process uh this is different than a demo Day by the way which we do have as well um but yeah again again for those of you that are building the FTM ecosystem I think this is probably one of the most exciting ecosystems to be building in right now we're certainly excited about it GPC um I think for two reasons one fem um is anchored to real storage demand uh real demand and sticky uh Revenue so before I was telling you about the you know size of the market are you competing in the large and growing Market um The Tam or the total adjustable Market uh uh of something like fem is anchored to real world use cases and so I think not only do you have as this open data economy starts to expand within the Effingham landscape not only do you have this massive Market that will be uh growing and continue to grow but it's anchored to real demand so it's not like you're building a startup in you know in an ecosystem where you're trying to you know make it more efficient to float uh monkey jpegs for example and no disrespect to anybody uh for being monkey jpegs by the way uh it's a lot of fun but um but you want to be building in an ecosystem where there's real world demand and I think the other thing is is that I think we're going to see a lot of um first mover advantages in fem and that will give your startup a defensible moat and allow you to capture a mark a market and be a market leader in a large and growing ecosystem so we're very excited about it um I think graph paper capital is probably the I'm highly biased when I say this but we are probably the smartest highest leverage money on your cap table at the preseason seed stage if you're a web 3 crypto founder and Builder um so we'd love to see any and all of you apply to the spring 23 cohort you can just grab a snapshot of this QR code uh to head to our website which is graph papercapital.xyz if you're interested in applying um and it's just a little bit about our Network I think our network of founder investors is probably one of the most um uh unfair competitive advantages that we have um you know at any startup Founder's Journey you need access and you need insight and and uh and so um our 12-week program is really geared towards creating um rigor and surface areas to give you exactly that we've designed an accelerator to surface your biggest challenges as a as a Founder as a company and then we design these High Fidelity interactions and touch points with people within our Network and ecosystem to help unlock that access or the Insight that you need so we'll be working closely with uh 10 to 15 startups for our screen cohort um it will run uh June through September we will have a remote demo day we will have an IRL investor day where we invite vetted investors from our Network we know we've done deals with previously um all all in a uh um all in in a position to really try to help our founders uh accelerate extremely fast and then get them ready for that next stage of investment and growth um okay I think that's everything really appreciate being here um love the youth Global community and ecosystem uh love being uh here and being able to speak to amazing hackers and Builders um and you can come find us at graph papercapital.xyz if you have any questions Jacob I might have gone a little over and I apologize sir that's all right that's right I'll forgive you I forgive you I forgive you I mean I I took a lot from that we covered a lot of topics like I think the main thing I you covered so much valuable stuff but the main thing I covered was the difference between a project and a company as a customer and I think one of the cool things is this is a three-week hackathon too right so there's plenty of time to find those first customers even during the hackathon and get feedback as you're building early stage and then yeah as a Next Step go down the accelerator Pipeline and join graph paper capitals accelerator and there's just so much support out there so I think you know very excited to uh to have your happy chatting um and and for sharing the the work that you're doing there so thank you great thing again tonight with everybody to hacking uh have fun uh yeah I would love to see some amazing projects with black amazing thank you Gabriel cheers yep and uh before we wrap up a little bit of an addendum to the schedule but uh but exciting nonetheless so really excited to welcome eight at the stage so Juan Benet is the founder of protocol Labs uh so we're really excited to have a surprise guest at the end of the the summit um it just kind of everything kind of lined up so that one could be here so yeah welcome to stage one and excited to have you hey how's it going uh can you hear me fine yeah yeah everything's great yeah great awesome uh super excited to be here uh I love hack FS uh we've been doing uh this for a few years now and it's one of my favorite Parts uh times of the year uh to be able to uh work with all of you and hang out and have fun uh talking about new ideas new projects uh uh cool things to build um things that might turn into products things that might turn into like really good open source projects and and so on so I'm super stoked for hackathfest starting uh it's very near and dear to my heart and uh yeah one of the cool things to see this year is so many teams um and people from prior hack fs's are now participating again this year in some cases as sponsors which is super cool to see uh it was like looking through the uh the uh grid and and so that's like three or four teams that started as hack Fest teams like where you are right now uh you know turn into projects uh and then companies and um now are like have good products that tons of people are using and now are coming back to to pay it forward and work with you and build more more cool things so it's really really awesome to see just that entire cycle rebuilding so it's awesome to be here amazing um yeah maybe I I know you also have a last-minute slide as well so feel free to if you want to share your screen now it'll show up in the back end and I'll promote it when when you're ready but if you go back to the start of your Founders journey and starting your first you know project um you know Envision yourself back in the shoes of the people who are building for the next three weeks um you know you have three weeks to learn you have three weeks to build you have you know all these resources teams uh projects interesting things ahead of you where would you start yeah uh it's a great question so um and you know I kind of also got my start through hackathons uh initially like it's one of the things that I found super fun to do and I learned a ton from uh so I I built a lot of things early on uh that ended up turning into uh really useful projects uh through hackathons and where I would sort of start is you kind of want to find something at the intersection of a few few parts one is something that you're really interested in like follow your curiosity follow what you like um follow things that you kind of want to explore um the second is to find something that uh where there's gonna definitely challenge you and push you to learn new ideas new technologies new uh experiment uh it's gonna push you out of your comfort zone so that you can kind of use this as a great learning experience it's one of the best things you can have um uh through hackathons use it as a great learning experience and so but but you also don't want to pick something that's maybe too far away from from what you know already so kind of pick the challenge that carefully where like if you go too far away then it might be just be super super difficult um now you can also you know you're excited to do that go for it uh it's just kind of you may want to calibrate what you do based based on um how uh easy or hard you're finding it to be you want it to be kind of challenging and that you want it to be motivating and exciting and new and different um but you don't want it to be like so hard that it's hard to make progress um then I would kind of like explore a lot of ideas initially I would kind of there's a bunch of lists that we've generated over the years with lots of ideas many of which you know some people have tried building um but but certainly tons of open space um you would go to the you know brainstorming session and and think about a lot of things I mean just kind of figure out what you find yourself drawn to that you think would be like really cool um and the cool and attractiveness factor for you matters a lot because one of the things about building projects and products is that uh if you're really excited about building the thing and you really like it uh then you're gonna kind of um uh find it much more rewarding to work on that and build with it and learn from it and so on so it's this really great uh self-fulfilling um uh loop where if you are learning a ton and having fun with it and building something useful like that's a great like intersection where you battle you know uh help you power through um lots of challenges as you're building a thing right like you you have to kind of have the vision of like the full thing working and get really excited about that to kind of make it through the challenges of building your product um and so I would kind of like start there it's kind of like find that intersection between things that are going to push you to learn things that you're gonna like and find a lot of ideas out there that you think are think are interesting and maybe I would like go to a lot of the workshops um even things that you maybe don't know that much about um just to kind of see what ideas pop up there because you might find something super cool that there I'll give an example from one hackathon a very long time ago I went to hackathon it was like a week-long hackathon that um uh uh it sort of got together with a set of other people there that I met at that hackathon and we had the idea of like hey this is right around when like iPhones were first coming out and becoming popular we're like hey would it be great to have like uh you know Pokemon but like on a phone this is like way or like way before Pokemon go and we kind of like made a monster capture initially in that week and that ended up turning into like our first startup and we made a game called geomond um that came out of like that idea and we just kind of pursued what we thought was really cool and exciting and that you know was a turned out to be a super exciting fun project um and that wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been brainstorming a bunch of ideas and and if we had sort of like come in with like oh I'll only look at one set of things then we would never have had found that that set of ideas so uh just kind of explore a lot use it as a learning point meet use it as a vector to meet a lot of other people uh in the community that's one of the great things about these kinds of hackathons is they let you get to know a lot of other people in the community get to build relationships form teams um I was just thinking back that uh um from huddle met uh I think the new knew about each other before hacking fast but they like really met and started like getting to to know each other and work together through hack and Fest and that really became the moment that that team formed and now built uh built a really really awesome product and Company so um these are great uh also be open to the the ideas that your friends or the people that you're getting to know get really excited about and be willing to kind of like go along and try something try something new yeah I love that I love that idea of picking something that's challenging that is hard um but at the cusp where you can make incremental progress and kind of keep feeling that that motion moving and um and I think people will always be very surprised in how much work they can do how many things they can do in 20 days 20 days is a long time so awesome yeah that the length of time here is like really good because it gives you um enough time to build a solid prototype or sometimes a full product um and so it's not it's not so fast that like you can't actually have the thing working uh but it's also short enough that like you can try something new and if you ultimately choose to like not pursue that that's totally fine that you just learn a ton through a few weeks of hacking on this particular project and you and you learn learn through it so um yeah like one one big message is you know good luck and have fun like uh the the half fun part is a huge component of hackathon so uh really let your curiosity and whatever you enjoy drive drive a lot of it amazing um I don't know if you had any slides or any presentations oh yeah I was just gonna show like the the um the uh sponsors grid and like highlight a bunch of them that are that are uh got started through hack events but maybe I'll throw that out later on I can I can what I could do is I can go to the the page and I can just highlight them myself so I'll do that and actually then everybody can see which ones are our past Tech FS uh teams basically oh yeah that'd be cool that'd be a really cool thing for equivalent to do in the future it's like kind of like yeah like a little badge if you if your team started oh there you go awesome yeah Juan is another one of those people like I mentioned Gabriel where I talk to and I get immediately a bunch of really cool ideas that I immediately want to go and prevent so um awesome well uh thank you for popping in uh I'll leave the last word with you of anything else to add but uh it's been a pleasure always always great to see you and I love the beard I love it thank you yeah you inspired me oh thank you there you go thank you thanks take care happy hacking everybody awesome so just to wrap up the summit that's been the hack Fest Summit thank you so much to everybody for joining us today um and uh for being a part of this awesome event um applications are actually still open so if you have a friend that you think would be inspired by the conversations that we had today um send them an invite uh and get them hacking with you and building over the next couple of weeks um and of course like Juan said good luck have fun happy hacking this is what it's all about it's about having fun experimenting building something new uh playing around with new ideas and all around this kind of amazing ecosystem that protocolabs has built both in the technical side and on the sports side so uh thank you all for being here and really excited to uh hack with you over the next few weeks see you soon thank you
