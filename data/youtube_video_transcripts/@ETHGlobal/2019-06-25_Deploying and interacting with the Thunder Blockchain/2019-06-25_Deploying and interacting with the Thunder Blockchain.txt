alright thanks for coming guys so we're Thunder core I'm my name's Ashwin I'm a core engineer at under my name's Xuan turbot I'm a junior on the platform team yep and so we're gonna talk to you guys a little bit about building on thunder and how to eventually show you guys had a deployed application so get started here so a little bit about us first we're we're basically a EVM compatible blockchain we our main focus is high scalability and high throughput we were founded by two professors or two PhD students a professor and a PhD students sorry I apologize uh dr. Elaine she and she is a researcher at Cornell and she basically was the first academic white paper on Bitcoin and then Chris Wong is our other other co-founder he's currently the CEO and he is a very experienced player in the gaming space in the social gaming space founded a company called plate um I'm eventually sold it for sort of to Disney for half a billion dollars very familiar with gaming malanez very familiar with blockchain and they ended up starting the company together and here we are so a little bit about the problems with the existing block chains and what thunder sort of aims to solve here a lot of the existing public changed simply just don't provide privacy or permission options for sensitive data guarding another thing is that as most of you know aetherium is very slow it can only provide about 15 transactions per second it's very difficult to provide very robust user experiences at that low throughput there's also a relatively high transaction cost as their award transactions on the actual chain itself so it's it's very difficult to scale or build scalable applications on top of this protocol proof of work consensus also as most of you guys probably know quite a significant amount of energy it's much more efficient just to have proof of stake mechanisms to provide both higher scalability guarantees and waste less energy we also aim to provide a similar tool set to a theory of and be compatible with all the existing tools on a theory of to allow you guys to build applications at a much faster rate without having to learn new technologies so our approach to the solution is to provide high throughput we integrate directly with aetherium were even compatible we end to provide a very very highly scalar and modulized architecture for you guys to build on mandis proof of stake and I can dive more to the consensus algorithm if you guys would like but one of our co-founders will be giving a speech tomorrow to provide more in-depth details about that do you guys are interested so just a brief overview of our block chain fundamentally was built to optimize optimize our transactional throughput at scale implementation stay already been completed or maintenance been launched for both of our public block chains and if you guys wanted to build a private permission block chain that's also possible so we provide implementations of both it's designed completely from the ground up by a team of about 30 engineers and it's about currently we see transaction speeds on our main net of about a hundred times at one aetherium is so we can achieve about thousand transactions per second and we'll show that off to you guys a little bit later in this presentation so the existing tool set that you guys are used to truffle meta mask remix any of these tools might the wallet are completely compatible with us you can integrate with any of them directly it's as simple as just changing an RPC endpoint and we thought that that was maintaining compatibility at that at that bandwidth was really essential for providing developers within easy and flexible platform to build on top of so it's we'll show you guys as it'll show you guys it's very simple to build on us and we would like to keep it that way so the key benefits here are that we're secure we're very fast we're very low cost meaning that any computationally intensive tasks that you would perform on an ethereal based network would normally cost you quite a large amount of gas on our network our gas fees are very cheap because there's such high throughput so essentially any of those applications that you build on the etherium that would cost you there's a tremendous amount of money or now very cheap very efficient to build on top of us so we would highly encourage you guys to do so fo levy I'm compatible so you guys don't have to learn a new language solidity works just just fine and we use a variable committee size we have a committee election that we use that I can also go into more detail if you guys would actually like but currently it's a simple top cave voting algorithm okay so as far as what we enable any sort of microtransactions payments gaming forums any sort of market that you would like to build we can you can build on our blockchain with very little difficulty porting things like I said is very easy and we're highly scalable and we have many improvements in the future Elaine is one of the top researchers in the space if you guys have been keeping track of her latest research she's been coming out with many different improvements and and we're quite the team is planning to continue to make improvements to the chain moving forward so we won't continue just for you guys cool thanks so we're gonna show off a small demonstration so you guys would actually know how to interact the chain yeah awesome so the point today is Katie's smart contract as we mentioned before we aim to solve is adding a lot more throughput to to you know to your friendly EVM compatible blockchain so cryptic uses cryptic really stood out when when it first happened to us as a gaming or as a gaming focused company now because of how many uses it brought it brought a lot of mass adoption I brought a lot of adoption to block cam bringing people who weren't necessarily as technical into the block and space and so we hope to leverage that our experience as well as the general public's interest in gaming in order to bring a lot of people onto arcane so this contract right here it's essentially an IRC 721 contract you may have heard that before it's a non fungible token every every time they took a kid in aka a token is minted it's time to one user there's only one of that token that's what are we doing today is deploying this contract and I'm gonna be deployment using a service that we edited called Cheshire Cheshire was developed by endless nameless labs it's a people who were developing a lot and building a lot of crypto kitties solutions and so what they want to do was build a development environment where you can essentially run your own local chain and simulate cryptic kitties on the main net so what I did was I tweaked that to our I tweak that to point to our test net which are block explore right here is pointing to as well yeah that's actually the only difference we may we just change it to point to us and what I do here is I actually update the script as well to deploy bunch of cool kitties as opposed just the first view so when I do right now it's just we're gonna see it's compiling contracts then it's gonna be deploying the crypto kitties now this is the point where might take I in my experience I had it where was taking ten minutes to deploy one contract and right now hopefully the Wi-Fi isn't too jammed with everyone I would just deployed about four contracts so these are the private keys this account you more than welcome the steel these if you can't read it and so now that the contracts been deployed what happens is this API puts out all the kiddies that are on here and all the users that we have for this development environment you can also see right here on our thunder scan contract is right there it was just deployed a few seconds ago so we now have the contract on our test net and then of course only the one Genesis kitty so I'm gonna do because you want more kitties right I'm gonna run the script I have that just gets these numbers as well as the first or you know the second hundred of the kitties exist you can see that they're all being passed in this address which is my main address right now as I go back to this API you'll see I got another seven kitties I think if i refresh so just give me more eight nine let's now we have under kitties on here but I think something so that's interesting is that now we have this remix it's a develop and develop an environment from the theorem and what we can do is take this address and connect to this interface right here and make sure I'm pointing to the kitty core contract and so we'll see here the first contract the first Kitty is owned by 0xc be the second ones owned by 0x1 FCB but that I own both ones that I own and so find let's get the owners of these only the first one zr x cb CRX and over the second one 1x FCP so you have these I'm the owner both of these and what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna transfer one of these let's see so I'm gonna do is grab the other address your x cb take it to this transfer function I may have to reset my metamath account but it should be fine and token ID - which is what on transferring great confirm good see right there went through and I go to where is that owner of second one it's now CFC be the new one you'll notice it doesn't update in this API that's because this is storing a database but it is stored right there on this block and you can actually view that transaction as well so it sees the hash fresh the wrong one I just lost the hatch all right so let's pretend that I looked that up in our block east before and it was there yeah this is how to connect to a year see 71 contract on our network I saw I just transferred I deployed contracts in a matter of seconds and I used remix here to transfer one from one account to another account just a very simple demo of being able to employ if you'll notice if you have an experience developing on aetherium you'll notice that I pretty much did nothing different the other than changing this RPC right here to use test net RPC Thunder core comm and so if you're interested in developing on thunder if any if you want to get some test net tokens you're always welcome to do use our faucet right here and this will get you some tokens army net and I believe right yes I remain in this live I've just been doing test that so I can just deploy you want to know how many times I've killed and redeployed these kiddies but yeah does anyone have any questions or anything I know so this is only right now this is just stored on our box chain you could potentially take that data and then go back and he say you've resolved a bunch of executed a bunch of transactions quickly got Thunder and then maybe save that data back on ethereum it's totally possible but that would have to be something done by you yeah and we are in the process of building more bridges [Music] yeah totally and if you wanted to say let's say you wanted to maintain the exact history of everything that had happened on a theorem you don't want to ditch that you want to bring that over to Thunder what you could do is essentially since you're gonna be interacting you most likely interact with them through the same library or you can you could essentially pull that essentially run two connections to both block trains and then just essentially read all the data from each from the first contract then reinsert that back into the boxing at the create time of the creation and that's one solution in case you want to get the full history no their brushes we questions unrelated to this as well if anyone has any curiosity about deploying the Thunder [Music] how do you think about in tip to disappointed yeah so in terms of deployment you'll see no difference other than the RBC endpoint changing now in terms of consensus protocol is completely different yeah like work or on chain and we run our consensus algorithm but in terms of what you actually do for as it from a developer standpoint it's it's pretty much system yes I don't remember the exact it's something pretty high though it's about it's about ten ten to fifty exterior so if you have guests or me yeah a lot more thick and it's one cheaper as well yes the gas prices are built the target yes it's both under polite so we never owned the coin it's native to the watch itself you don't actually have accuracy so yes we have our own point is essentially used to the same way superior experience networks the base token that you may use to interoperate network you can also for example to point your twenty yes there's a bridge that already exists that some guy here actually yeah free butter yeah I haven't actually worked at this so I can't explain it in detail but I know it exists right now so you guys you sort of like do a project or someone else someone else yeah yeah so better exist oh I think I'm not sure check the books like I said but it's possible bridge you need to you might have mentioned already but are you guys 30 on you yeah does actually aren't made that buckets all right now I just switched over to that I had one of my story that she mess up our engineer on the platform dimension so we do what I'm supposed to be doing is a building apps on top and I don't can't obviously cast this here but I'll just show to you there's something we started releasing in its waiting to start release that go a little bit more in depth the architect promoting more in the US right here you see it's just a dashboard being machine for example going here is not that we've done kind of can to get people honest work to make it blocked an out we just want to get something to tie singer soon and people excited what's happening here is it's just you know flops here but in general you can get free tokens you sign up you see I'm I'm all their ascendency [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes another thing that we have just started over starting sir this weekend is the second program so you guys ended up building any applications we're gonna offer you guys one name help customer acquisition costs or any marketing cost you guys we've had we're developing costs so we would actually before you guys into our equally integrated with our launch services and you have yeah I'm an against great idea I don't think we're currently working on that yet form is creepy - boy something in the future we have some shirts here for those who have stopped buying them [Music] yeah we also have several prizes available available for example the best combination app that uses multiple different platforms or any of them if you decide to forego X for example and our five work yeah but she doesn't know what price of that maybe $2,000 your Canadian prize for this game with the entry centralized gaming applications both on our platform as well as a few more so actually yes so yeah come to office if you're interested Oh works so for the most part it's pretty easy I would say stick with solidity with as far as a compilation version you're gonna have to pass accomplish like if you want to use anything above 5.0 it's more in salinity compiler so if you can't stay with any Bowl acidity like 0.425 I think is the latest that we really support but you can use the latest ones as well but some of the updates are there those for watching my video any boletus one is five six but we would prefer that you get used 45 so we're already fully permissionless as far as mistake mechanisms go so we are from state blockchain which means they're not that happy where was distinct in order to participate in the network so what that means is apparently some people think that it's closed doors I mean still free open source of pain to have a lot of validators attached to the part of the chain as far as actual open source code we won't be fully open sources an exporter so you'll be expecting somebody 20 sounds like this is one of your commission that's gonna run oh yes okay what you ready for that it's a little bit more difficult right now so just know we we had a press release that went out during presenters on Tuesday or we might announce the backyard the public release of our main that launched and part of that will talk about the fact that we would have will enable full node over source and we're not talking about one so we're talking about over there - yeah how many ways speakers are there so there's thirty to thirty to thirty that's that's going to be open so the feeding guy it'll be a more variable number in the future so right now it's 32 just because it was easy for us to deploy that is a digital release as we make videos with its wispy loud [Music] yeah any of those are very interesting anything that I'd like for example homomorphic operations are very expensive where any employer requires operations are very expensive on material you can easily learn those or not which is important to make use of this is great when you try to think about things we should appreciate this material I think that what scientists actually put in a little gas side chain er so I think yep which trail chain and if that really kind of compasses over looking forward to service anything that had a plan wasn't necessary because if possible or I think magnet like that wasn't cool to just metaphor that's what we're really excited to see Oh
