all right welcome everybody I hope you're having a happy Saturday and this is hack money judging demos day seven or six it's actually six I'm Karthik one of the cofounders of eighth global and one welcome everybody to our continued judging day livestream where we're showing off all of our projects every day and this is our second last session for the week before we finished off all demos so I want to kick this off immediately for those of you who don't know a hack money was organized by Heath global and over the past four weeks we had over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones work to or it's making amazing apps in the FIFA ecosystem we had people from all these countries we had an amazing set of over 40 mentors who helped out our hackers on anything technical product and marketing and and all these amazing sponsors who took the time and dedicated their resources and their team to making it easy and possible for all of our hackers to use and integrate any of the rest eks if they wanted to extend the composability features of tea fly protocols that exist in in the world of aetherium so let me just say this one more time we have over 350 hackers that spent the last four weeks working on a project of their choice in defy and as of Sunday night when submissions finally finished and we got everybody's teams and projects in we had 118 projects that were submitted for this hackathon and that is absolutely incredible I mean I can comfortably say that as of Sunday night we've doubled the size of the defy space alone and this is super exciting so with that I want to just quickly walk through the logistics of how the next two hours are going going to work we have 15 teams today and each team will have four minutes to demo their project and what they built in three minutes for Q&A and feedbacks from our judges I give seven minutes in total per team and to save the troubleshooting years and minimize and keep everything on schedule we've asked the teams to pre-record their demo so this will be a team that'll just come on and start sharing their video submission so a quick overview of how hack money was set up the rules and criteria for this event were simple a team could have up to 5 members in total and it doesn't mean you can't do without a team a lot of people chose to hack on their projects individually and the only thing they had to ensure was that their hack had if I have a defy primitive it included him in what they did and just like every other hackathon all code that they wrote must have been written over the course of the hackathon itself so everything you see here was done over the course of four weeks and in terms of kind of how today is gonna go the way we're gonna go about judging these projects is going to be on these five categories every project will be looked at for being technical original and practical and on top of all that for the audience of designing the project for how easy it is to use whether it's a UI or UX thing or for a developer at the abstraction that goes into making it a really good dev tool and of course to make sure that we don't miss any categories we have this general catch-all that we call a lot of factor that lets us account for anything else we missed in our criteria and I want to remind everybody this one more time this is not a competition the hackers are here to learn and really show what they've done over the course of the past month they're here to share their excitement and get feedback and how to how to improve what they what they've been working on and take you to the next level and not everybody is trying to become a business we don't want them to necessarily make this a big thing we want them to just own the experiment and encourage them to keep working on it and that's sort of the ethos of havi global events work and hack money is no different so the schedule for today is as follows these are our 15 teams that will be going on one by one in this order and after the judging ends today I want to remind everybody that the top teams from each of the sessions in total of 118 teams will be presenting to to all our judges on the right side Andreas Thomas Bertoni ashley chef robert leshner metallic buddha and sunny coach have for our finale what we get to show off our top projects from the whole event and that is this coming Tuesday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern and if you already have not got an invite from us as a participant or a judge will be sending that again today for all the missing people but make sure to mark this on your calendar and of course doing the hard job today are our three judges who have considerably given us their time today on a weekend and I want to welcome single and apart from OST Laura Siri from open GSN and Fernando Martinelli from balancer Labs they will be our judges for today and they'll be giving feedback for all 15 projects and sharing their excitement with them so from here I'd like to officially kick off our first demo for the day and with that I want to welcome team suicide Kings to start with their demo I mellow except I'm way and looks we're having bandwidth issues so actually and start alright at FPS and compound protocol we came up with something called Alex my mind uh I'll just create a low-risk environment for users to play with non fungible government before Alex I think if you can take this up what I'll do is also played on my site we can minimize you want to share it instead yeah I'll do it right now so give me one second and I'll kick it off I'm Alex Fisher I'm Kevin bite Ali I'm Wade Kimbrough and we want to stay anonymous vote and fun quadratically and not worry about civil attacks we spent a lot of the hackathon I da ting how to do this by combining n FPS and compound protocol we came up with something called non fungible governance to test this idea we created a game called suicide Kings suicide Kings is no loss like pull together and it's fun and engaging this creates a low risk environment for users to play with non fungible governance before showing our build of suicide Kings we want to explain non fungible governance and how it might work in the real world in current use cases of quadratic voting and liberal radicalism participants aggregate their preferences with money they buy boats or donate to public goods however we know that people contribute in many other ways you might edit a Wikipedia page you might contribute to open source software you might canvas in a neighborhood for a political candidate or you might build a house for Habitat for Humanity we call this type of volunteerism effort and it's the key to non fungible governance instead of using money to aggregate preferences let's use this effort here's exactly how it works a participant in a community buys an N of T the cost of that NF T goes into a community pool where it earned interest by doing things for the community like taking on bounties voting volunteering etc the end of t can level up much like experience points in games when it comes time to vote on something it happens as follows one NFT always equals one vote or you can burn your NF t to get its level squared in votes if you try a civil attack by buying 100 level one n FPS across many accounts you're actually offsetting your voting preference by contributing greatly to the community pool so designating the actions and the amount of work that dictates how an NF T levels up allows a community to signify an individual without identifying that individual suicide Kings test non fungible governance game design is an iterative process during the hackathon we iterated over a dozen times and built four distinct versions of the game moving from rough prototypes to bot simulations to where we are now which is integrating all of this onto adapt on rink B the goal of the game is to win interest from the community pool you do this by voting on which king cards interest is distributed to there are 16 king card types in the game for suits in four colors and there is no limit to how many a player can buy players can also vote to level up their NFT types which allows them to vote quadratically in the future to vote quadratically they have to burn their King hence the name suicide Kings and they are returned the value of that King both what they paid in the interest that they won our first version of the game used a game engine to sandbox the rules then we moved to using Google Spreadsheets in Google Forms to simulate using wallets a ledger and voting all of the interest in XP was calculated in a third spreadsheet that acted as our back-end we used the formulas and logic from this to create a command line game where we could simulate hundreds of players with BOTS this version was tested many times to ensure that our game system was both fun and sound we are currently integrating our command line version of the game into adapt on ranked be our progress was slowed by the need to use ERC 1155 s 1155 s give us several affordances things like batch transfers save players on gas but we also needed to do things like split bits in our current implementation base token IDs are split at the 248 that position deleting bits represent the index of our starting colors and suits the rest of the bits track unique Kings this allows us to more easily track each Kings value and experience points at our current state we can mint Kings Mint c8 and burn C eath back for eighth check out our github for the current state of our DAP the command line version of the game more nuanced rules and a concept note that more thoroughly describes non fungible governance great thank you guys first question for me who would be who would use this was your target user who did you build it for yeah so there are a couple different examples of this actually being used so git coin grants for example uses liberal radicalism for doing the quadratic funding quadratic voting has been used I believe in Denver Colorado for voting as well and so it's basically kind of expanding on on some of these small use cases now for example get coin grants makes you connect your github account to reduce civil attacks and they're looking at using something with Twilio and SMS so this would be a way to allow people to remain more anonymous okay that makes sense and I know you said that you hit some some snags will you continue you know trying to to work through those and build it further after the after the hack money yep we've we've already got our next meeting scheduled next week excellent did you guys know each other beforehand we all well Kevin and I go back a few years but we met Wade at 8 Boston last year yeah maybe I have a question so you when you burn your entity you get a cryptic kind of strength in your vote how do you see like that that kind of choice depends on how many times you can use your NFT to vote with the normal power so if you have like a level 10 and you expect to vote 20 times with that then the total power you're gonna you expect to get from that entities is twenty so like the choice whether you want to burn it or not depends on how many times you're gonna use your your individual power without having to burn it how do you guys played around with that choice and how did you simulate it how many choices you expect people to have or votes using their entities without burning them and how people will make that choice how do we expect them to make that dress so in the real world that will be up to the the community right so it'll be up to to get coin if it were to be used there for our game we expect it to be around every 12 hours you're going to be able to vote and basically you're competing over the interest in in the compound pool so basically it's is however long you want to play the game right so some people will come in and and play for different periods when we tested it in the command-line game to actually kind of simulate it we found that it took around seventeen to twenty rounds before you had a chance to actually burn and steal more of the interest from the community pool so people are competing for this interest and you can get more by giving it to like your hearts or to your specific type of King so it takes you know it'll take a couple weeks of playing before you can level up to the chance where those 100 votes will really matter for you and it depends on the number of players playing as well so we also simulated a game where there were several hundred BOTS and basically the three of us tried to collude against the bots we formed a team and it still took us around I think you know twenty or thirty rounds so twenty or thirty votes before we could level up an NF T to aggregate our preferences quadratically nice thanks alors I think we don't have your mic working uh-oh so solo mic okay I think interestingly maybe we'll try this for five seconds if you can press the top arrow key under the mute button and see on zoom if you can change the source directly that could that could work otherwise we'll uh we'll sadly have to move on to our next scene man oh wait I think we heard something no I was just gonna yeah maybe ask like how you guys plan while wild lares tries to get his mic working how do you like other than get coin grants what do you expect what what other types of the use cases do you expect to use this idea I think one of the underlying ideas that we're really excited about was seeing what influences the players in the game could have as they vote on the rules while they're playing it so hopefully we can experiment with well what I'd like to see experiment with is other contexts other games that were pretty familiar with it could be anything from real time gaming to something a little slower like what we're demonstrating in our in our hack here but what one of the outstanding questions that we really were hoping to get better insight into was that can we can we formulate something interesting by providing governance while play is actually happening so in that regard we hope it can open be opened up to many more people I think a short answer is any type of any type of governance and specifically decentralized governance because it we're hoping to solve civil attacks so Posner and Weil who originally wrote on voting squared shows that this aggregates preferences in a much better way than the traditional you know one person one vote thanks very cool thank you guys and I look forward to seeing it progress thanks guys everyone thank you I think we're gonna maybe just loss skin could you quickly check if your ideas back on and fortunately it is not but I think we have to move on to our next one that should give us a few more minutes to fix and see this issue so with that thank you suicide kings and Congrats on actually with all these iterations I think it's super unique that you are able to actually improve and have these cycles in so Congrats again and looking forward to seeing how this improves over time and what that I'd like to call up our second team and that is team oh yeah market so I'll let them kick off with their video demo you we're demoing the high fidelity design protocol architecture and smart contract code for Oya a decentralized ecommerce protocol our team members are Evo vanna shut and John shut Deniz an es Lee is one of orange users she's a programmer and make jury that she sells online she sells on centralized marketplaces and has her own store using Shopify she has thousands of dollars of sales per month but after transaction fees referral fees credit card fees payment processor fees monthly membership listing fees mandatory advertising fees closing fees and Commission her cuts only half that amount she isn't too happy about these fees and this is where oriya protocol comes in Oya slashes fees by eliminating middlemen managing orders and payments through smart contract let's watch an order the buyer cements order details and payment through Oya this creates an order smart contract that holds some money and manages to order the seller receives a notification accepts the order and chips to item to the buyer the seller upload tracking information to the order smart contract this allows a smart contract to confirm delivery with the chain link Oracle later on if needed the buyer also get tracking information the item is received by the buyer who makes sure everything is okay and then accepts the item the smart contract instantly pays the seller and reports a successful transaction to the audio protocol both the buyer and seller earned Oya token which give them voting power over future changes to the protocol this way there is no middlemen taking a cut the buyers and sellers own the protocol directly thanks to oil denise has lower fees and more control she's very happy now to add oil to her own store Denise installs of oil a Shopify plugin she also installed the oil Chrome extension to make it easy to manage her orders Denise's customers see Oya as a payment option during checkout alongside more expensive centralized payment methods the buyer can use eat or any popular ERC 20 token and their wallet to pay or automatically converts to the sellers preferred token using uni swamp oil also uses open GSN to pay the buyers gas fees the costs are ultimately paid by the seller in most cases a total gas fees or less expensive than traditional e-commerce fees for higher priced items the savings are enormous since Denise install the oil plugin her products can be automatically imported into oil market along many other sellers using the oil protocol or an top market is a crypto native marketplace so we see products price and tokens and customers don't have to login they just use their aetherium wallet customers enter shipping information like any other e-commerce site the checkout experience is the same as choosing Oya as a payment option on Denise's site both sites use the oil protocol smart contracts on the backend the low fees and cool features are the same nice Denise can see a new order notification in her or browser extension she clicks a extension to open the seller dashboard where she can manage all her oil orders from any marketplace she can upload tracking information for new orders and see the status of her existing orders she can also claim thumb from orders that have been delivered after a waiting period where the buyer can initiate a return let's watch a demo of the first building blocks of the oil protocol buyers can create orders to the controller contract or your token holders can vote to update or replace a controller buyers and sellers interact directly with order contracts either party can cancel an order before it shifts the smart contracts automatically refunds a buyer sellers can upload shipping information and claim funds automatically if the delivery is confirmed and a wait period has passed and buyers can mark an item as accepted and the smart contract will automatically pay the seller the buyer and the seller are noia token rewards for successful orders if an order goes bad and the buyer and the seller can't work it out themselves they can call an arbitrator to decide who gets that money Oya tokens are earned by using the protocol not bought in a token saw token holders make the rules which evolved organically over time we have lots of ideas for the future including earning interest on money in escrow check us out at Oya dot market very cool thank you guys that was about the earning or token so I know like tell me a little bit more about that like how is it just like review on ebay for instance and it's tokens how does that work I think the idea is basically to be kind of decentralized co-op and so every time you interact with the protocol in some way that we want to reward like if you're a seller and you have a successful transaction you get some more tokens to give you more ownership over to go up and then if you're a buyer you also incentivize to say like yeah I got the item and pay the seller immediately rather than just waiting till the 30 days so you got tokens for that all the cases would really be set by the actual community so those are just like the first two that we thought of but anything more this is like very cool point you have to earn it yeah sorry right okay so it's that's that's what I was kind of thinking how would those would be decided make sense so this is a work token yeah basically it's like you get it for interacting for doing something that is good oh yeah as a whole do token holders get to vote in case there's a dispute or I saw that there's an arbitrator or yeah kind of a mediator how how our tokens kind of involved in deciding disputes how they're solved yeah I guess the smart contract local the token holders can decide how the controller works which determines how arbitrators are set kind of the model that we have in our head right now is that arbitrators are probably more like professionals like you're going to Amazon or Ebay or SC they have people that are really familiar with different like buyer seller fraud scenarios rather than having like random token will be society and then the arbitrators could basically get a few let's set by the arbitrator so if you had like Amazon rebuilt to have a as a back-end thing instead of taking a cut for every order it would be like you would have an arbitrator fee if there's a dispute which would be a smaller number of it I think initially the public just be like one arbitrator that  holders set and say like yes this arbitrator for now and there you have like a delegation scheme where where token holders choose the best arbitrators and yeah sometimes that type of reward if the arbitrator's aren't doing good yeah I'm delegating yeah yeah and also like letting buyers and sellers for each interaction if they want to use a particular arbitrator give them some other way to do that really cool and then you said the seller pays the gas fees right yeah so basically they would just be like a big pot of money sellers we need to kick money in there not just for gas feedings but also to pay for like returns things like that like giving vampire a return shipping label so all of that needs to be fleshed out a lot more but conceptually yeah very cool very very cool guys awesome and you're gonna continue working on this I hope yes yeah we can't stop during the awesome sounds great are you I mean we'll get access to to your details so awesome work thank you you be cool thank you so much that was an amazing demo and I really really fun videos so with that we will kick off to our next demo and that is project pirate ship so let them take it away it's you know I can't hear me yes yes a play video that works this is Tina Janelle Anja tell we created chip your special-purpose vessel for product shipping through continuous flash organization for surplus human capital formation hackathons are short and Swiss prints and little incentive to sustain continuity startups on the other hand are long games with great uncertainties that require upfront commitment however being encrypted in such a volatile emerging industry and a global pandemics long-term commitment prior to Prada market it may not be the optimal strategy for most so what if we can combine the best of both worlds introducing ship you strap your site project from zero to one in an iterative multi round game we break up started marathons and diss prints leverage product miles don't bounded face by face release output equity tokens to reward active contributors within each flash work which is set to dissolve upon deadline we build upon defy primitives for gaming for game warping within each flash work we build upon opens convexity protocol for issuance of put about equity tokens contributors by default opt into nonlinear payoff but kept the flexibility allowing a cash exit option a preset strike price price which lowers unter barrier for joining especially for those with well paid jobs looking for interesting side projects but what equity tokens are also cost-efficient for reducing startup burn good project strike price can be set well below market salary yet still remain competitive and only a fraction of contributors will exercise the options to cash out we further built on RB and compound to provide cost-effective slash org treasury management for the collaterals locked up during the project raishin so what we have built is a platform for bootstrap MVPs for our site projects there are four phases Genesis for project creation federal equity issuance and financing choices summoning face is when project creator and contributors headshake shipping face flash Oryx prints begin lastly settlement everyone guesses payoff and here is how the contract works with all three contracts the first one in d1 is open protocol they graze all to market needs are Oh nearly 20 tokens umberto readers are able to categorize I exchange of all tokens the second y integral is come hung the quarter readers are able to borrow them come on to assist of their product creation in the future would plan to have a permanent governance contract to assist our voting process towards our contract moving neighbor all members our platform vote on key factor changes such as to extend party deadlines and here's a canal to get started using ship you can sign up or log in with your email or your github account here I'm gonna choose github what's a logged in you can explore created projects or create your own project here I'm going to be a project manager and I'm directory at a flash or kahani level of market North version is alpha specification and target project milestones strike price is set as 0.1 the project duration of 90 days and the exercisable duration 90 days which means that at the end of 90 days a contributor can exercise their Auto tokens and exit with equity or cash I can add a contributor and you can issue equity tokens here I'm going to set it to 5% and then say a project once that saving you have to financing choices for a flash or you can borrow that compound or or an interest by depositing on object here I'm going to choose to borrow the compound and then you can issue portable equity to your contributors to do that the first step is to create an options contract and then you can go ahead and issue of each collateral and issue Oh tokens well that is confirming we can check out my where you can see the governance dashboard and propose to make any changes indirect state existing flash board you can also go to your portfolio page and view details on your flash or that expiration date in the options contract address and cash out to get equity or cash in your mathematical captain Preston for sure I already have a successful transaction created one brain can be tested and then you can view your tokens in your my master so that was sure Jason sir this was a little bit of longer we have just two and a half minutes for IQA so I just take it away so the chances are you've looked at at least one minute today do you not think the videos playing [Music] there's a little bit you know I think you're cheering your YouTube and I think it's playing a video in the background see me wanna what what kind of use cases do you see that's being used for the most compelling ones in your mind oh the most um actually my I would use myself for all my hackathon projects that I really want to finish I think they're really great ideas but I really want to be able to find key mates who are motivated to continue to build all these ideas and I shared this at us with a lot of my um have some buddies and I see this be on crypto there's so many surplus human capital I see because of work from home and a lot of people are working on passion projects and they are really interested in we're looking for good teammates who can they don't have to commit really really long guitar like long-term yep this is a micro Dow very much so you can actually see every single this every single face of the flash work that forms a continuity it's kind of like a micro Moloch except that it's fungible with this because it's the rich ragequit is actually the put option part because you get the Dowell membership share proportional if you do ragequit okay by opting out but instead we've we assume that you were opt in yeah very cool and and I do think it's definitely something that we see a lot with hackathon projects and you're absolutely right the fact that you would want to continue right that it isn't just a one and done situation which so many great projects are in that situation so yeah that's really really cool are you gonna continue yes that's building my project full-time from my East Singapore hackathon project from a year and a half ago actually practicing this this is not something I've thought about before this is something that I've learned through trial and error finding this I'm already on my third phase the project that we demonstrated like Hannah lemon that's actually on its third phase of flash organization right now very cool awesome Congrats I love that your really cool guides that's a May 2018 so my really excited to hear that you're told doing this thing in the spirit of building and improving it so thanks again and we'll move on to our next anyone yep team Isola flashed up shared their video and right from here all right so we have to introduce our platform yeah anyone can put the splash screen scripts on like if you water the flesh borrow from section and RV and then any user can come and use it like very simple for you you just like do have to pick a script all script and apply the contact and use it and for the river purse we have something like the this emitter of smart contract and whenever some new user uses the smart contact they get a fee from it so we try to make it as much user friendly as we could so for submitting a smart phone it's simple like put in a description put in there just you want to see the payment put in the smart contract and everything and then you simply add the smart contract and you enter the parameters and then it is done like you add just a smart contract for anyone to use the user can browse through all the differences other developers have created these can be for different use cases like for arbitrage for collateral for things for asset asset rate interest rate stopping all the user has to do is to deploy his contract and after that he needs to transfer any kind of ownership or assets that you want so these are accounts to this smart contract then any kind of parameters that I needed to execute this slash loan script has to be entered for example this one needs an address and and gamma and amount just a sample ship so once this is done the flash one would be executed so all the user has to do was to read through the description the developer has written and check out what the shifters and if it's meet his requirements and without even knowing what is already does and what is being done inside the contract [Music] so as you can see once the user has deployed the contract you can use it again no need to deploy it again and and yeah once everything is done for example arbitrage is done you can withdraw any kind of assets for example dieback whatever I said the contract has his own account what we thought was slash loans were a really powerful tool for deeper users they currently has two ingredients worth of USC long thin image protocols but what what is a problem is most of the users don't know how to write the script and contract so they kind of get stuck in that dilemma so they correctly take 0.09% from the splash zone and we also take 0.09 it's a really small fee but half of it goes to a developer who has created that particular shift and two key person goes to outside form and these are the few use cases of slash lon the latter swapping arbitrage do you see them here in there but they are not really that useful because of the lack of the lack of platforms that provide them also these are all scattered around a third form is going to is going to be like a centralized place where users can come and look through all of the all of the scripts yeah so basically that supposing thank you I'm sorry Loretta um who are the users the users of this project could be like I mean if I user like who don't have sufficient knowledge to like read their own smart contract executors flesh tone but they know like like they are using unit shop or some different protocol a compound or something okay one of the motivation was like when we start and when we found when I realize the flash shows you excited about it but we weren't confident enough in our own skillet like if we can do leave right the power on contract on the mean that we weren't really confident about it so we thought if for the people who are confident about it and you can put in the smart contact and then we can then other people can use it okay around what actually we actually we specify down like writing schema for the contract like a few things are predefined the Dennis mush so like the person is submitting the smart contact will have to include one function or two functions and then it will like work easily for any contract oh but my question is if you are improving the accessibility of flash flow you're adding more functionality to the existing system that you're using not exactly we're providing a platform to and making it easier for both the parties like for developers to make a few more bucks and for user to use the more sophisticated and maybe a question have you found during the time you you're like working on this have you found any opportunities of using a flash loan to make a profit that someone could have use your your project to do that oh yeah like on do there was like opportunity of arbitrage like which I would like even for it was over to the front of like $5 on Van Horn Banco and fiber and then they would like we on our YouTube videos they are like a few questions like people wanting to use Italy asking like where we can find responds I can use that very nice awesome thank you so much super cool we've consistently seen a theme of abstractions around generating smart contracts and now questions have been there in the center of it or the past few acts for this hackathon so there's another cool one because we've definitely found a few other arbitrage cases that have worked for a few of our demos so with that I'd like to call up our next team and that is ledger let's API so I'll I'll let that mahshar and kick off their video and they'll be talking over through real time so just make sure that you're not muted I think we see that you shared your screen but we have no audio or mic hey guys so I guess I can start right yep hi I'm Ross Iseman this was just a one-man project and I'd like to introduce you to legislates API the main problem that I wanted to solve is someone either person or an entity needs to create an indisputable evidence that they owned held or had access to a file at a specific point of time or in other words or they could sell timestamp proof of existence some examples of scenarios that this can be used may be assigned physical Trant contract between two or more entities are reporting collecting evidence for an investigative based story that they want to show in the future that they had access to those documents maybe a whistleblower collecting documents for purging problems in her corporation or maybe the framework for other death fight solutions we need some kind of way to show in evidence that they had some kind of information at a specific point in time think of Oracle's or based off our information outside of the network and they need to show that they actually took those decisions or had those observations based on specific data so there's actually some existing solutions today there's a service called proof of existence that does it on now Bitcoin from the Bitcoin blockchain however they have some issues our old problems they I want to stop on prove they do it is one transaction per file so if you want to prove or create a proof of your document you have to make a transaction we can which could call the congestion on the blockchain they're not free you have to pay some kind of fee for the transaction and it's on the Bitcoin blockchain I wanted to introduce something on the theorem network there's an extra motivation one wanted to solve this problem we see a lot of solutions that are talking about the ability of the blockchain to transfer money or tokens which has value between entities and I think there's a lot of value in the blockchain where it can store really important data as evidence for the future and indisputable evidence a few design goals and principles they had in mind I wanted to provide this as a service as an API that can be integrated by other platforms it has to be lightweight efficient and does not impose any high loads on the network it has to be able to scale up to millions of transactions in each block and most importantly I wanted to make it free so I'll explain how it works and run a really quick demo the consumer let's assume to the consumer on the left side has some kind of an artifact the document or an evidence they didn't want to create a proof that they had that in a specific point in time they'll create the run just on 256 on that file it creates a thumbprint which will be posted to the ledger so let's API on the service side to make it scale to make it free legislates would create a batch file of all of the transactions within that specific point in time I do batches every 15 minutes now but it can be shorter or longer depending on the network load in one dose 15 minutes have passed create an address thumbprint or signature of that batch file and use a one-way feed to create a production on the blockchain - is the confirmation the user gets back the bat-file itself so they can prove it in the future even if later let's calm breaks down it doesn't exist anymore they get the thumbprint of that file and they also get an eater scan data yo link that they can show someone that they actually had that specific file in the past when they are being challenged to show that evidence of proof and the validation again can be as simple as taking your signature or taking your evidence file creating the some print of that file making sure that it's in the batch file that you hold and creating that signature for that batch file and see that it's on the blockchain with a specific point in time so that's the basic concept let's do a quick demo so let's say I'm investigating some kind of corruption within core comm and I have some evidence and I want to capture that evidence or that file on the blockchain is proof that I had that file in the future so I have this file let's change this to 2020 for example save it and I'm doing everything through curl in API to show the API but this can be done through any other API call so let's see the thumbprint of that specific file I have this thumbprint let's now push it as a post to the legislates API it's a male I'll do the signage of the batch files right now at the background one second the demo has to break right in a second just to make sure they're betting those in terms of time you have got 60 seconds left so uh if we're not able to finish that we'll also go over in the Q&A here maybe a question while you try to get to get it working how do we plan on making money or how are you gonna pay for the costs of submitting those transactions suda2 watching even though they're matched you're gonna have to pay for that right somehow it's excellent question can you hold a few seconds for that to have a slide coming through if I'll get to it okay so the transaction or the batch file was created hopefully this will come okay so I got the response back it was submitted I can go to either scan for example and see that the transaction just happened or at least about to happen and have the exact specific timestamp and this will be my proof in the future that I had that document at that specific point in time so coming back real quick to the presentation and we're at time so we'll just quickly get the judge to ask questions because I think this one over about a few minutes sure so maybe I can answer the first question about monetization I can also the batch files today are public one aspect of one option is to provide private bad files with metadata field that will be specific for cooperation don't want their metadata fields or something bad files out in the open and this is an authorization service is there anything beyond a document preparation service that you see this being used for I could barely hear the question so my question is is there a use case beyond document notarization that you you see as potentially interesting this or is it just that yes my goal was to offer some of the data on the blockchain to just minimize it with some prints and some kind of a service that shows what those some prints mean so you'll have one thumbprint that would actually translate to a bunch of documents that can be serviced from any other service and not necessarily from the blockchain so that can be Oracles that can be data that's related to other contracts etc but that part is not decentralized that's that's the centralized service running on your servers right yes but again I did some tools that bring the flood alerts that comes down and you had a file you can still prove that that file existed that it's a report one time if you have that bad bar if you kept it I also have future plans to integrate it with ipfs so that the best files will actually be stored in ipfs awesome oh this is time so we're gonna have to move on to our next project and with that I'd like to kick off the demo for project adopt and I'll be playing the video and my onions the team will be here to answer your question recording okay so our project is called adopt and basically what our original idea was was to make a options trading platform that allowed people to buy and sell options on Bitcoin using aetherium smart contracts and using native Bitcoin and our initial implementation of this actually involved using the Quinn smart contracts and switch sharing scheme unfortunately at this implementation didn't work very well because what we found was with our Bitcoin scripts implementation it was possible for anybody who can see this transaction in the men pool to the front run this redeem transaction and send the funds to themselves and this is just one of the limitations of Bitcoin script itself either your funds are tied to a specific address and if they're not anyone can spend them so we decided to use P tokens and the P tokens we made a a front-end that served as a on-ramp and offer and allowing people to mint tea BTC using tests at Bitcoin and then it also worked the other way it allowed you to turn PV TC back into chestnut Bitcoin for our call options we implemented support for P BTC as collateral so these options we purchased with die and the collateral will be in EBT C format and when the option is exercised the exerciser would receive T BTC and while we were able to deploy these contracts on Rothstein we actually ran into some issues actually building out our dap some issues with web 3.5 so we didn't get to finish up actually but we wanted it to look something like this this is just a mock-up of what it would look like here you can see I've sold calls on bitcoins so if I if I buy calls this orders will get matched I can sell some more calls by look at the price of Bitcoin yeah I can trade cuts as well this different strike different maturity I mean nine thousand i calls cell calls and that's pretty much it you know this was a very interesting project and we had a lot of fun you know just kind of brainstorming and thinking about how we can you know build cross-chain defy and yeah that's it thanks for thanks for watching I'm ready for questions I have one so how do you ensure that the guy who's selling the co-option has the Bitcoin to cover that co-option if it's exercised in the future like do you have any collateral like TV TCL and 50% shanitha of the BTC value how does that work so at the moment we're only allowing for covered calls and because the you know these contracts were denominated in Bitcoin it's just you know the actual amount of like if you're selling calls on one Bitcoin then you would actually have to post one big point as collateral you don't really need to over collateralize because the contract is is didn't you know the underlying is actually Bitcoin right is that I've done on aetherium or on another Bitcoin network it's it's on aetherium and we're using PBGC to facilitate a trustless peg yeah got it cool thanks [Music] all wisdom I was gonna say what was the main thing that you learned out of this experience because I know you mentioned that the first did not really go according to plan take away the main take away you know just for hackathons in general was a prototype quickly and spend less time theorizing about know the perfect implementation I think we lost a lot of time just you know trying to be purist and trying to use Bitcoin script like the first few weeks and then we realize that you know wait a minute there's a front-running issue that that really can't be fixed and learning Bitcoin script was also just kind of a sidebar that we may spend too much time on it's very different from solidity it's like this 1960s stack based language but yeah so it like build a lean on VT and just iterate quickly but I think if I had to do it all over again I would make sure to have something you know functional but earlier on yeah makes makes a lot of sense so just to make sure I understand could I summarize what you've created as a way for betting on Bitcoin and died on aetherium but without needing is not as much capital so you don't have that I would say it's it's it's not exactly that it's a way to to trade options on Bitcoin on aetherium but actually have you know real Bitcoin right now a lot of the options that you can buy and sell are are settled in cash right there's no actual real Bitcoin on underlying that and this is useful because it unlocks different types of arbitrage and it actually allows people who are holding you know a lots of Bitcoin to participate in defy and given that Bitcoin is over 60% of all the market cap we thought it would be great to kind of unlock the value that comes with Bitcoin on a theory md5 they cool well awesome awesome - yes just gonna want to refrain myself any comments on Bitcoin script and move on to the next Boat this team bundle Phi so I'll weapon at my kickoff with their video thanks thanks we're going to fly this is a showcase for tech money great timing the team when we build a set of smart contract tools to simplify complex interactions with the fire protocol so we want to say we allow it allow to bundle fight to save time and gas by doing what you usually would do multiple transactions we did at the same it might click so we show you how the examples like swapping were you able to swap multiple tokens and one per section or you were able to swap or two more tokens and send them to another adversary in Cyprus as well so it works like you take ambassador of tokens you got back like you have in your wallet back just to see nWTC and you want to convert them all and one transaction tada so no fools leave it and the multiple approvals are needed it's just one click it brings serve like that the five wallet mobile UX to do your minimize and the ledgers and your all the normal laws that you have you can adjust the mouse for research token then you want his pick a spot by percentage you can transfer the specific target to and final wallet example you want to transfer 100 years thousand years dc-3 you only have 500 and you can complete the remaining amount missing from your back and I balance 12 we're all in one place so we have support for both men I'm asking for this banana mask here for demo and I want to send on the dime so let's say I'm I don't have the exact amount from just one token but I do have several tokens that I can fulfill that swap with and I'm picking a few so this is my token so what this every year I'm going to use 50 percent of the FCC 35% to USD and the rest from teacher to complete that amount you're able also to decide where you want to send this at the end to another address where that's me enhance address or or your normal thing matters for now and swap this one click no approvals no multiple is just one transaction and then this was basically three slots one to go to the target sell them so that's gotta suck we also started work on monologues which is as pretty similar concept only to load the savings or you can just migrate any outstanding loan you have into another platform or what is the same platform one that's an interest rate so that's a POC still we have the contracts in place but we just find our time translation so here's so what's happening here we have a smartphone two wallets because the Xbox II use playmaker now for world for for the bolts so it's secure it's as been widely used in a today we build smart country scripts that interact with this proxy that leverages games for me to liquidity to make all this happen and and like when one-click right so what is next funds to put it in maintenance get it out of it so it's useful and people can start using I'd support for more protocols but pretty like you said we want to finish Yossi a migrating in one click Ovid compound for different loans and different savings well yes we're going to fly this is a showpiece that was the video that's awesome I immediately think the amount of times like for instance you would want to contribute to let's say a grant or something like that then that specific project only accepts a certain token and you have to go and kind of exchange that to to get the token so this would be perfect to kind of do very cool very cool yeah I think that's very very useful Thanks what is what is the most important pain point that you think bundle yeah for us weird if I user so we have this except problem so we have a project that's grants to a grant does call state will pay that we won through another eve global hackathon and I need to distribute the funds that dies that we haven't compound to three different developers and just one click so things like that you could you could put your code your it's like a multiplex you can either go through multiple inputs and get one output or or the other way around one input and get multiple outputs and it's just putting more beef into unit swap and and that interface it's like a UX wrapper around those protocols and why do you need to have a mobile wallet to get that experience but I can I have it and meta mass or ledger all the wallets that I already have so that's sort of like our motivation to bring this connection and this set of smart contract tools so with this I just went to sorry go ahead nearest oh you know so I just wanted to make sure I understood that this would be a way of bundling together things that I would otherwise have to do it with separate operations right okay okay I was just gonna mention that if you guys continue develop this an option to to do that would also be using imbalance or pool where the the tokens that the user has in their wallets are not just sitting there so you already create a pool so that they're kind of earning trading fees when anyone trades across them and then when you want to use that you just withdraw the the you can either sell the balancer pool token that represents ownership of that pool or you can do and withdraw transaction and then swap it for for dye or whatever you want to to sell or to have so yeah maybe using a balance or pool there would be useful yeah yeah for sure there's a bunch of ideas that we want to basically do wrappers around this allows a much better UX around all the protocols like you said a lot of transactions needs to happen for people to use this so that's our main motivation for sure cool Congrats thank you awesome thanks guys I think um any ink stuck the mighty mug there's like a quick reminder a lot of the projects that we've seen are ready for others to check out anywhere from them being like one main net to just being available for anybody else to use as a team here it pushes and makes it ready for a main that we should be able to see a lot more of us checking it out ourselves so I hope the main necro successfully and what that we'll move on to our next demo and that is Julia from Medici you know oh I'll let her play our video and I believe she will be talking through the video instead of internal audio hi my name is Julia and I'm a software engineer kovin 19 has pushed the world into economic turmoil a lot of people are concerned about the depreciation of their local currencies and be looking for ways to diversify their portfolios but neither of these are easy for most people outside the US and this is where decentralized finance can make a difference met she is a simple wallet that allows users to convert their fiat money into stable digital assets and earn interest through the compound protocol by embedding a noncustodial wallet like Portis Medici users can interact with the blockchain without the intimidating details Medici also allows users to purchase digital assets through a debit card the same goes for cashing out users can pay out to their bank account or card in fiat currency so how does it work under the hood Medici is a web 3 app running on the ethereum blockchain a user creates a wallet in seconds with a username and password and funds it with some crypto such as the dice table coin and the user can purchase that crypto using a debit card to start earning interest the die is supplied to the compound protocol and converted into seed AI which increases in value with every etherium block and to cash out we simply redeem seed I for die from compound let's head over to the demo as a user of Medici I can create a wallet through Portus without leaving the app I can see my wallets balances and how much I've already supplied to compound for earning interest I don't have much die so let's buy some I select die and I can also see exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies next I can pay for my dying a regular debit card and those funds will go straight to my Medici wallet there you go 10 die in my wallet which can be tracked within the app now let's supply some die to compound so that we can earn interest I'll supply 5 die from my wallet thanks to the built-in wallet by Portus signing transactions also becomes much easier none of the intimidating gas fees are exposed and no additional plugins required now 5 die has been sent from my wallet to compound and the seed I will start earning interest if I want to redeem the diaphragm compound it's just as easy I put in how many seed I I want to redeem and now 24 died were just sent back to my wallet so what is unique about Medici simplicity and focus we're starting with USD stable coins such as died USD coin and USD T we also think that certain regions outside the US and Europe can use a lot more help which is why we've also prototype the service in Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese we've spoken to dozens of potential users who are extremely concerned about the rise in the price of imports worried about the depreciation of their domestic currency and are interested in holding assets like gold or the US dollar finally we take pride in the simplicity of our user experience what's next for us we want to nail down the Fiat on-ramp and pay outflows in order to support a range of cards and accounts we also want to offer more attractive api's to our users and remove some of the steps that can add complexity to the user experience Medici is also among the top projects on pioneer a fully remote accelerator funding ambitious projects around the world thank you so much for watching this demo and please reach out with any feedback hey thanks for watching that happy to take any questions maybe I can start congrats first of all how do you how do you plan on dealing with kyc and that kind of choice between reach like reaching more people in the developing countries and still using credit or debit cards to top-up those things kind of our conflicting yeah thanks for the questions ran and that's a very important one because it's kind of shared risk between whichever payment processor we use for the debit card so for example wire or a moon pay as well as Medici itself so we kind of expect that there's a little bit of qia to some extent involved but at the end of the day like during the credit card or debit card processing but at the end of the day there is also that that responsibility within Medici and the short answer is that a simple flow can be implemented but we have yet to find out how that might vary from country to country or region to region so that's definitely an area for research that I'll be begin to thank one question I have is what are your ideas on the business model for this yeah so for this there can be multiple ways one of them is to take it the to get the like Robin Hood approach regardless of what the actual behind-the-scenes business model is making it really easy and feel free for the user another approach is to have a maintenance fee based on how much is kept in the wallet and one one selling point for this would be if we have say some folks in in Brazil who feel like storing some assets in u.s. dollars is actually more valuable than trying to set up an overseas account in the US or something else then there might be an incentive incentive to be to say okay I would rather pay a small fee on a regular basis then have to go to the hassle of foreign exchange setting up an overseas bank account etc so one option that I'm looking at and have have yet to validate is a main is fee assign yeah go on sorry just one more question regarding recording down Rams is that something that the on-ramps you seem to have but what are your thoughts on on down ramps in the future yeah the the the quick answer is yes that's still part that I'm trying to figure out fortunately tools like moon pay and wire are getting easier for sending back to bank accounts or direct debit cards so that's a part that will be focused on for sure Thank You Julia yeah thank you yours thank you I think we're out of time uh yeah so uh thank you so much for that demo was an excellent presentation and with that we are going to be taking our uh five-minute break and we'll be resuming the second half of the presentation so we'll see you all in five minutes you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you hello it was one minute Pablo will be back on in a second no worries thank you you you all right we're going to resume our second half of the demos so with that I'd like to call up team licencia to share their video all right thank you if you can see it yes we can I the center is a decentralized application that allows and works as a South Bank system for the users truly sense here we aim to solve some diva issues like having a system that is easy to use by the masses as well as having a decentralized hub or a centralized up that works to connect other defy solutions out there in the market some applications out there are like D Bank Syrian and my D Phi that are currently in life that worked like that so in short our application would be a centralized application that actually just integrates with all the decentralized solutions already out there on the market so that a user has a one location where they can come and utilize their own ecosystem so they're essentially their their own Bank and all the services are provided by every other decentralized system out there here's the team and this is a brief demo of the application itself this is a live application that you can actually see right now and navigate to we a we were aiming on trying to get a lot of these items incorporate and right now we're only able to have mostly the UI and interaction with the made a mask so you will see our intern MO somebody interacting with the meta mask and showing their wallet balance eventually we will have all these other features like an area where people can come in and learn about the different different applications out there on the defy system they're more about blockchain and then exchange air where people can just exchange between different tokens are in the market as well as there's other areas like trade that people can use we'll use that as a hub for people to go to different areas like the ydx and actually be able to trade tokens lens systems be able to switch between Ave compound pay ensures assurance chopping borrow and donate and that's essentially the application hi so it was pretty quick pretty briefly so I'll pass it over to for questions very cool so is the idea with the full idea is that this is your one-stop shop for doing things with crypto right so essentially is everybody is already well at least in most countries do you have an application online that you go for Bank you manage your finances through their deposit if you got a credit card or what have you so essentially this was a decentralized hub that people can do the same thing but with all the other applications already out there on the market because I saw the shop that's why I was thinking you would go is that the idea that I would go to say the platform that I can pay in crypto right yeah we will have a curated list of items like a this is say I don't know the decentralized Mahama Sun or things like that very cool how would you how would you acquire users for something like this so first because we would want to really focus on the user experience and get real feedback I think it would be worth worm out and people that want to be you know separated from the centralized banking systems and want to have more power of their own finances and at the same time don't really know much about crypto mmm just focusing on making the user experience so that people come by themselves essentially first first Oh will be yes kind of like that have but it would be word of mouth for the poor right now until we are able to get our MVP worked out and all the tweaks working and then we can letter start doing some marketing campaigns here and there that's just a nice like which of like there's lots of different tabs there like different things the user can do on your platform you have to choose a focus here like kind of the the entrance door to that the user kind of wowed with your product and then they start like kind of roaming other other tabs there what would you focus on and and how would you my guess would be a wallet a simple wallet and what would make it different like what would differentiate your wallet compared to other products like argent or great products there are out there already right so I one of the things that we were thinking on is really be specific to the user and somebody that is just doesn't really know much about all the other krypton's for example would be a centralized like the dashboard that would display the graphical information about different Kryptos it would only be specific to the user of whatever it is that they have on their wallet and if they want to be able to buy something else and they can go over to the a swap or the trade area and they can actually get more from their current crypto but while it's is its integration the idea right here is to be just a hull so that we're just connecting to current e5 applications we don't want to be able to store any information or do anything like that you got it things actually I think your educational piece would be very valuable to potentially then lead people through the other options because of this hub situation where you could go okay now here's a very practical thing for you to do now that you have learned a little bit more about X Y Zed right so really potentially maximizing that and and kind of giving you're almost giving people an entry to a lot of stuff through just the one door that is your straight it stole very disorients one but people can kind of go in and try a lot of different rides right a little bit like an amusement park you go in and then you kind of make your way through so actually in the educational piece might be your that to begin with I appreciate the feedback thank you absolutely good work Thanks thank you and with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is $8 so I'll be playing the video on my end and Bernard is here from Singapore to answer any questions hello reading radish it's not slavery below my knees virtual I'm a failure on the engineering from Hindu Singapore despite to be force active ever I heck balloon to find out my ideas and then my inspiration came from vigorously the fresh grass liquidation the body can create account this global system so it all is born he fell attenuated open your unchanging price Li II thought it was I need my user to be temple so mean to each other assume that the price we conjure up data and use it well to pay up abuse by me for example using someone if anthem receive $200 back and for our joining these represent 200 each other and then the receive effect with the carbon price on changing money visually power able to always be mean high a bundle so it uses a diagram I usually use a backup if to be able to participate in me 10 point if user is able to make a profit on the the compressor position and we give the initial okapi however even users are not able to make for me and then we cannot steer to purchase or touches each other and pay back to load the death I mean so all the yeah all that will be defaulted and their initiative to decide to the top is no contract the car does not contract will be used in we see it's motive and proposals with anything the ecosystem and omission that I hope for the car smoking the benefit of music is problems is that the u.s. in 2014 Jesus I will appear in fun and there's no relation with mati crash so is go on with versioning would have been next react so for future division identity means our agent who on finish all Calistoga to implement pricing for some regulators turbines thank you is if father before the day without demonstrating the request English ending and me and so I mean I'm reading how do we be functioning assume that we're already in Mozilla if lockup and especially that's an awesome question Jean so say that again I didn't ever let the conventions traditions is really mine actually I think you're right this is a nonstick oh oh I'll see well what the quick fixes I'll be back in one second maybe the meantime you can just talk over it Bernard okay so how do we manage it Allah so it's always to mean hi I'm below so it is the user state diagram so initially you deserve to set the shaky block up into the contract and then after that they will be able to meet him but subsequently if they made a profit the portrait they can close their position and redeem the if initially however if they make a loss they have to default their initial evoke up and they are not able to continue to benefit from for the course so is being used as yes attorney token is being able to trade on the market is being beyond so for shielding opens having an X and a four-inch inner vision all that lyrical teammates as my country or the shop or uneven job governance token to implement pricing and most our regulators thank you so for the demo right I'm not able to show you because this on the phone you'll actually all just can't turn back to that would you mind closing your screen share okay sorry soon that we hurry the Mozilla is lock up and as potential crises also not be done so in question genie update for moment common conventions ok suggested ever transitions this really might so fresh oh no the projects to really mean development of us so as you can see our contract I mean house all water have 190 so this kind of mind for me to eat we'll get back 401 SC transaction shall be and our direction is money another game and you can see that we have 420 Ebola and we are still able to use the first a gene so now we try to tread burn and we receive some like come from the transactions which is in my and I see the balance necessary burn and the people that get my and there would be any difference because the price is the same Permian and one for example if you knee and higher price and else with run an overpriced you clear coffee that's all for my demo thank you this is too important progress project so I don't mind this article you any more features to argue for the users if they are not people to pay back meaning the time I saw from my presentation thank you thank you okay I have a question so this maker de without forced liquidation yes so without force liquidation you explain again the mechanism by which you incentivize people that I to participate in the mechanism of the system yes so you have to set the initial god if so that during the process do you have to they have a period where they have to pay back to do it before the loan default hmm so so let's say the price price of a this' is $200 yes and I get $200 could I actually get the same how what is the ratio is there a ratio between how much eight dollars I can get and how much eise well how does that work so it's a hundred percent so depend on depending on the price on the chain link if current price is 200 so you get back $250 and if you happen to default the $200 I mean the if will be sent to the governor small country for however for a governance marketer have been implement the logic now yet because I'm still thinking of do you manage the governance process more decentralized realized you mind turning on your video so happen okay yes okay yeah so essentially the difference between this and and maker Dow is that you don't have forced liquidations and that you don't have under collateralization yes so you'd be paying out one to one depending on the shipping price I see okay and have you documented the mechanism design and anywhere so we exactly be understood better it sounds like an interesting proposition but I need to take not you because I'm still thinking the time period for each loan and each position and I'm not so sure which matter would be the best move on thank you thank you thanks for 9 thanks for staying up late to I hands out what that we'll move on to our next demo and that is defy stacker so if you can turn your camera on and I knew yourself oh we can begin the screen chair hi everyone my name is Bell I'm a software engineer at pond5 where I work on Doust I'm here with my teammate Sean who works for melon protocol and I'm excited to share with you defy slacker it is the back end for composable beat by stats Scala share my screen we share with Audia you hi this is Sean I'm a protocol engineer for melon protocol I'm just gonna give you a quick rundown of the basic contracts in our system the main contracts the stacker contract the stacker contract receives a number of dphi actions bundled as a stack and executes each action in sequence so the primary function the users call here like the front-end calls here is an execute stack function the execute stack function receives the spend assets the assets that a user wants to spend in their their stack of transactions along with the actual stack of transactions which we call calls so we have these three arrays each of which have a matching length and each index in the arrays represents a order so each order has a adapter address a function signature and encoded call arguments which are all passed to the adapter via a delegate call so he's a system of adapters where delegate calls reach out to these plugins that we call adapters which perform the request and tell the stacker contract the tokens that it's received at the end and then passes the baton to the next action so yeah each call to execute stack validates the inputs custody is the assets runs through it and executes all the calls pays out the balances to the user and then emits in a bet at the end and currently we have a test suite that runs unit tests using truffle tests with open zeppelins test helpers and you can see we have adapters passing with our unit tests with flash loans from ahve lending and receiving via compound trading via khyber and uni swap and we have a an adapter in the and the works as well for maker CDP's which is not quite done yet all right so here we spun up ganache Co lie with docker and this is connected to a archive node using a service called moon net so we're actually running a fork right now of maintenance and so this is the fork getting set up however accounts there and here you can see the moon net URL and that's us running all the migrations to get our contract up and so that's going down over here is where we did our migrations to deploy so this stocker contract being the main one and then we have our adapters for the different providers that we use so abbott and the last piece of this is our user interface so we allow you to add funds to your pipeline and we allow you to create a pipeline with different actions attached to it and you can create a sequence of steps that you'd like to execute so yeah happy to take any questions so is this a like a visual programming tool for for defy yeah I think that's a really good way to think of it um so for the most part like we kind of create this interface that allows you to fill the API stack they're inspired by guru combi and how they did that but focused on creating this adapter system that made it really easy for developers to integrate this into their existing systems or into their own front-end so kind of focused on you know getting the adapter set up and then allowing you to quickly spin up those adapters with subgraph as well using your port note so is this something that you would see as being developed as a public good or or is their business model behind it that you think would make sense yeah I think both actually so we we talked about this to you especially in regards to front-running and kind of there's two options that we can go like one is we make this available to developers to sell toasts and they can kind of do what you know what they want with it and expand it the other is us actually being a host and the benefit of that is economies of scale so running an archive node is really expensive we're using new net which is $25 a month I believe but actually building that whole infrastructure yourself could be like a few hundred bucks a month so if we provide some hosting then we can scale this out and and make it easier for people to get on board with it very cool it's yeah oh sorry guy that you have a question go for it yeah maybe just what is the like the simplest thing you think would be quote abusing that like have you have you thought of any use cases of how people could use that tool yeah my teammate Sean is here you want to answer that Sean no I think yeah sure no worries so kind of like the like a number of actions like involving like maker CDP's was kind of like where we wanted to get we just didn't have time to finish the maker adapter unfortunately but yeah being like the kinds of things that you hear about a lot like in the newsletters these days like being able to swap out collateral types using Ave flash tones and swapping out your underlying collateral and CDP's without having to actually like close the CBP's and pay via the stability fees and such preventing liquidation like kind of like what like defy saver does yeah these interactions thanks guys awesome thank you so much and I think the coolest part of all this thing other than like the amazing sort of framework your design is that you mentioned using lunette and the team that made moon 8 is also one of the participants and they're working on something else for the second on tears of this just really cool to see Aletta composability in action for the hackathon so what that we'll move on to our next demo and that is entity to finance I'll let them kick off the screen share hey hello everyone I'll be presenting the project an empty finance I am Raj and I have been working on this on my own so what is it exactly well it's a peer-to-peer platform where users can do two main things they can borrow or rent an FTEs or they can use the NF tees that they own as collateral for loans and to get access to liquidity so now let's take a look at a short demo of how it works okay so first of all we can see all the NFT is that a user owns we can look at the NFT description we can check who made the NFT we can and we can go to open C to check the NFT is trading history and see how much it has previously sold for now let's say we choose the house as the NFT that we want to put up for lending and we specify the collateral amount in case the borrower does not return it we specified the price it cost to borrow the house or basically to rent the house and we specify the total period of renting it and we approve the transfer now that the transfer has been approved we can put the house on the market okay so now the house is on the market and we can see it in the list of pending offers the status at the moment as you can see is pending so no one started borrowing it and we change to a different address and this address as you can see doesn't have any NF TS they don't own any entities but they're interested in borrowing or renting the house and in order to do so they have to pay the collateral plus the lending price and they just did so and now we can see that the status is active they have started borrowing the house and they have it in their wallet before the renting period ends they can use the house as they wish as long as they return it in the 21 hours that were specified by the lender they have to do so because otherwise they would lose the collateral amount so they approved the return and they returned it to get their collateral back so now this user doesn't own any NF T's but if we go back to the lender address we can see that he received his house and he also received the price for lending out the house so he has earned some side income okay so how did I think this could work well there is a big secondary market for NF T's they can be sold and auctioned on platforms like open C for example and users can check the NF t is trading history and try to speculate on their market value but even so I think it's hard to price them individually and I think that any loans with any tweezers clatter would have higher interest rates than other kinds of loans because of the risk involved so to wrap up there are two main use cases users can use their desirable ERC 71 tokens such as ENS names for example to get loans in it this way they have access to liquidity without having to sell and and buy back their asset maybe in the future there will be tokenized real assets that are tokenized and tied to your C 71 tokens and the second use case that I presented is the ability to borrow NF T's on example uses would be if someone needs an in-game power up to maybe past a certain level and they need a short-term lease for that asset maybe for decentralized land or art at the same time lenders of those assets have a new source of passive income and they are incentivized to lend out their valuable and if T's thank you well thank you Josh so I think yeah the with house was that what you had envisaged with the real assets potentially in the future yes that was really for the real assets in the future but I think at the moment best use case for it would be for gaming in case someone needs a power up to a certain level that would be for a barring an empties and for using an FPS as collateral well any energy that has speculative market value can be used as collateral to get access to eat but I didn't demo that because it's not ready I just finished the smart contract okay very interesting what idea that became sorry before no I was just gonna say that one maybe other use case you haven't mentioned that I think would be cool is for people too short and if T's so and whenever you're landing in an empty and someone thinks that value is higher than what it should be they just borrow it sell it and then hoping for them to be able to buy it later on for a lower price so it helps also kind of regulate the price the market prices of NFT so I think that's a cool cool thing that you can enable with your project so really that's that's very interesting yeah the difference between just let's see one of the powerup and again just buying it temporarily for whatever it costs and then selling it back when you're done with it what would be the difference between that and between using something like this I think there's more risk involved in doing that you can't risk losing more money by selling it afterwards maybe maybe you're not even able to sell it I mean you can't auction it off but still I think it's much safer because you know exactly how much it's gonna cost you over that certain period of time to own that energy one also and one important thing is tax implications of selling something and rebinding it so if you just borrow something you're not in put some up something up for collateral you're not selling that collateral at any moment so it's not a taxable event so that's also very useful that's a good point to also interesting thank you so much and thank you - well done this is really cool well done reading - we'll move on to our next demo and that is team donor box I'll let them share their video yeah I guess oh the product we're going with his cold owner works and it's basically a decentralized crowdfunding platform which offers a few other features over its counterparts mainly another level of transparency my name is rishabh an amine Charles affronted and my name is luxury and I worked up on back end so now going about the workflow so our project consists of a single contact with consists of NGO donor and fundraiser account and in geo initiates a fundraiser he has to specify a target that a producer has to achieve so when a donor donates an amount to a fundraiser if no milestone is achieved so for a specific target these targets is divided into three milestones so when a milestone is achieved the amount collected by the fundraiser is transferred to the NGO otherwise no authority over the doors me so this is a demo of a product so we have already created NGO account a donor account and a fundraiser account so this entity was a fundraiser one named fun fundraiser so which are the current balance of zero has no donor has so knitted any money to it and it has a target of 120 to achieve so it is distributed in three milestone 40 80 and 120 so if a donor wishes to fund this fundraiser you can go here and type the amount of token you want to donate you click on donate button so as we can see 20 tokens have been transferred to this fundraiser and as no milestone has been achieved so the balance of the mg will be zero so now the target first milestone is 40 so will trigger the milestone let's in 30 so now the total amount that the fundraiser will have will be 50 so the Ortega will be made from the fundraiser to the NGO and 40 tokens will be sent to M 0 and fundraiser will be left with 10 tokens if 10 tokens the fundraising has it and this what will be transferred to thee and you so the technology uses basically if you run in a server which is a node.js over and we are using MongoDB as the back-end database and we are using each which is API which allows us to deploy our contracts and gives us an interface over over how to react to them interact with them basically and then we use the apps office to communicate with the callbacks that it was by the API so basically what we wanted to actually implement was a feature that would allow the donor to have control over how much is contributing so basically what we wanted to achieve is to give the donor the ability to withdraw money to any fundraiser that is funded until the milestone is met so we were trying to achieve that I'm I hope we can achieve that in the future so thanks a lot forgive me this oh thanks guys what so what donations and what tokens can I make because I know you said ERC 20 is that NERC 20 or is just die okay and then it's the idea that essentially this is just for general use for anybody wanting to contribute to a fundraiser created by a ninja yeah correct so we basically though anybody who signs up can donate and receive so what we wanted to I mean we haven't integrated that yet so currently you have to put in your wallet when you're signing up so we plan to change that to accommodate anybody wants to okay could you give an example of a real-world problem that you think this would be useful for um so basically I think that whenever you're contributing to one of these out finding sites you have very limited control over the amount of giving and you do not have too much transparency over how how this is getting use and in some cases where the where I recently actually myself on tribute to one of the funding campaign and my money but partly was because the campaign was unsuccessful so the idea is basically until the milestone is achieve you have some sort of control over your mind so you can withdraw your cash until you until the milestone is reached so so so the idea is for some things for some type of NGO goals you would need a critical mass of resources to get anything useful done and you don't want your resources to go to waste if you don't if the group doesn't reach that critical mass yeah so we divided and do you have quickies achieve some part of them got it got it okay quick question yeah sorry if you sure done there's one thing that kind of caught my attention is that there was no Madame s approval or anything kind of approving the the transactions how how does that work under the hood know so right now this is just using your simple you argued over 20 tokens so that's why no matter much like our own won't open where is it done using the theorem at all like are you saying I as I should see uh to a Rob's a norcold intestine actually won't do is empty no actually we are not implemented the we have not even together doesn't matter must believe it so we'll know here tokens are being sent so this is just our token so the RC token is not included in the contract that's just like the uix flow and okay okay thanks thanks guys to continue working on this thing and make it ready for so we have two more demos left and then we'll be able to finish off today's judging sessions so I'd like to invite our second last team and that is project telegram totality so let him take it away [Music] hello everyone this is my presentation about telegram totality a hacker maids i'm Averett course i'm back-end developer and I'm focusing about UX so what I've built I created a fork of the original term telegram client and integrated and non-custodial aetherium wallet so it works you store your private key it maps your telegram ID to your eternium address and this enables a protocol for both creators so this is the telegram client it's just like in the normal client you can send and receive messages so now I'll go to my key storage the key management this is my public hearing address and I already stored my private key and the application make sure make sure these match so you cannot store a different price key that from the word address so below my name you see my balance and I currently have 12 tie to my account so now go to the Rosco Rosco as a tip with the next to his name that's because he has his public address in his bio so when I press the tip button it transfers one die from my address to ace address and yeah currently the transaction is spending on the rough stone network yes so the transaction is done as you can see the tippet and appearance again I'm a perfuse balance was twelve died so it should be eleven now so I'm gonna go to the menu it will show eleven died so that's perfect and when you go to Rob's and you can also view the transaction that made it happen in this transaction so now I'm going to show the in s bolt I've created so DNS both work at my public address from this client so I press start and I yeah it automatically gets the domain names of record start these are even eat mmm not eat and expiry dates so this both will send me a push notification when they are about to expire but you also renew them actively so I want to renew a firt that eat and I want to renew it for one week so it were one at one week - expiry date well it receives intersection - so my client just signed their yeah the renewal for one week and yeah now I just get a confirmation oh there it is so yeah the renewal is successful and this is the transaction edge you can look it up now I'm going show the upper bottom eight the Alpha both monitors your health factor and sends a notification if it gets below at the set factor so minus 1.9 and I am sending it to two so a couple seconds later I receive a notification and it requires me to deposit 11 cents to get my health factor to at least two so I deposit 11 died as and died cents and you can verify its rejection truly robson link I'll show you yes so this is the deposits to the app protocol so to verify male factor is at least two I come to the risk comments and see my current health factor that's great it works fork of the official telegram app is designed a protocol for easy both integration and it's still compatible with normal telegram clients so a future work is to open a protocol for more use cases support more clients and generalize both library check out the source code and thanks yes thank you right thanks Everett yeah ready to take any questions that was really impressive how many was really good thanks how much of that functionality would be possible to implement without changing the telegram client yeah so now I've kind of hard-coded the alpha and the net use cases in telegram client but it's possible to make like a protocol for every use case every contract with aetherium so this like two example use cases but you can make it design it in a way that it's possible for every use case so both creators can have the creativity to create their own use case were you intending this to inspire telegram to add hearing support there yeah so it's indeed it's like more of an inspiration thing and I'm VP thing for inspiration because like chat is so intuitive interface a lot of people use just like four billion people on this planet like the current wallets like a lot of regular people like my dad for example he's not using a bullet but he can use chance but it will also be like a Kickstarter for adoption it's more inspirational you should have a trap to the guys doing collab 19 they basically built a bar and it's very much focused on this covert use case but they've built this thought that essentially does a lot of that kind of broad functionality and if you added the wallet piece that would be amazing because essentially they were fundraising for a lot of different initiatives so I can I can link you up with them and you can have a chat but it's really really good work this would be so so it would solve a lot of issues for a lot of people yeah telegram yeah yeah oh yeah these are two use cases I've created during the a Catan but the use case articles endlessly you can create every possible transaction so Simona mention that there there have been like other attempts to create like some BOTS what do you think would be the advantage of doing this inside the client as opposed to using you thing about you mean their section signing or yeah yeah yeah so I think I know some people that for example a cup of friends they they know each area me know crypto but they're not using defy because it like the meta mask the wallets or like it's it's built for developers not for users most of time so this is like the most intuitive way to for example communicate with the Alpha Protocol or DNS protocol so for example you can sign that rejection fear man Amash but I put like a lot of users would stop using it because it's just a little to use in 300% totally yeah awesome thank you so much and to telegram also that you so with that I could have to go to our very last demo for today and do you close everything when when I call up team and project event trip so let them kick off their demo hi my name is Dan and our company is called avenge rip avenge rip is a platform to launch and monetize your live events by offering premium experiences for fans willing to spend a little more for exclusivity it's difficult to organize launch and monetize your livestream so we wanted to offer creators a unique set of tools to handle any virtual event it's uncertain what the future of live events are and creators need a solution now I'm gonna pass it off to Lofton to show you what we've done with the website thanks Dan we've set up a website to help us showcase them promote event trips product to brand we've made it easy for creators to request an invite to offer some new examples of how an event might look for different use cases across many verticals whether you're an independent artist musician public speaker sports gamer or fashion bar and event earth lets you easily set up your event invite your fans enter crypto we've also tried to clearly communicate how adventure works and simple steps we want to make it as easy as possible for people both inside and outside the cripton community understand our product and the benefits it can provide to them now I'm gonna pass it off to Terrance who will walk us through a demo of the app things locked in so I'm gonna play a video for you guys of our harmonic so the first thing I'm gonna do is create an event and I'm gonna pick up clicking in your city cars your hand and just add some data click the image so basically what it's doing now is taking all of the event metadata and it's uploading it to ipfs as a JSON file and then the actual idea by plastic learning becomes really key to the event is going into the cereal box mode so here you can see that then since created first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and bite it to it we ticket is a an empty PRC 721 being spoken as you can see about the ticket and here I'm gonna go ahead and create a new merch your Tuesday our digital lovable that the creators can offer to their fans and same thing here is taking all your merge data and combining as a JSON and uploading type EFS and then the hash becomes the unique ID for the merch once the merge has been created then it's immediately available for sale the next thing I'm gonna do a star keep man and once I started then you can see the live streaming you can also have any sort of videos on there and once I'm done with a bang I can finalize the event to draw the funds running my battery and that's it back to you Dan thanks Terrence we're excited with how much we've built in such a short time if you guys are interested in working with us please email us at hello at event drip calm thank you guys all right so we guys think I'll let Fernando and liras take the first ones because I know like I've seen your evolution from the feedback round so is this a is a toque tokenized eventbrite [Music] and if you had like something non crypto but like what would be the what would be the template that you were thinking of yeah I can answer that yes it was definitely closer to Eventbrite basically the biggest difference is like if you go with the vamp right you're kind of locking into that platform but we're making it an ft base so that you have the full interoperability you can send it to your friends and without having to worry about the platform itself so what are called yeah if you think about it maybe Eventbrite ticketing plus the storefront building capability of Shopify with the fan contribution of patreon all in one stack with additional visibility to see what's actually working and monetizing for you as you're already live-streaming have you thought of maybe kind of connecting that to virtual reality like events happening in VR and that NFT is kind of your entrance let your ticket to enter the event something like that yeah definitely you know the beauty of this is even after the event is done or you purchase the collectible you can still be able to unlock additional experiences and hopefully this will give content creators the ability to create more of a guide for the user based on their products and services and eventually getting that and to you know something like decentraland or you know companies that want to show exclusive augmented reality presentations additional you know access to really behind-the-scenes and cutting-edge stuff so boy your thoughts on on business models or something like this because there's this protocol layer to it that allows you to transfer your tokens and makes it across platform potentially there's also a lot of UX work that what were you thinking of in terms of potentially making this business if you had thoughts in that direction yeah so we looked at it at two models so there's like a self-serve for some of these content creators who have the grit and ability to invest in still doing what they're doing but come in and create simple events and uploading their their tokens but we're also in addition to taking a small percentage of the minted ticket and merch we're looking at an enterprise model where we can license out a platform where they can monetize and then additionally offer other productized services around that to help businesses grow right guys thank you thank you thank you guys for your time and staying so late watch the last presentation it was a good one so thank you yeah Thanks so does that mean we present on Tuesday or a falling so uh with that I want to thank everybody who took out the time today to uh to sit with us and watch the live streams and also big special thanks to our judges for being here and giving us our weekend and feedback to the teams so I wanted to send a quick reminder to everybody that our finale will be this coming Tuesday from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. Eastern on June 2nd so please stay tuned and I check out all the best teams are going to be from this event and we get to showcase them and I want to thank our judges one more time for for being here and before we end this thing a quick reminder that in about 30 minutes we'll be launching TMS into outer space so be sure to watch the SpaceX livestream so thanks again and we'll always final judging tomorrow
