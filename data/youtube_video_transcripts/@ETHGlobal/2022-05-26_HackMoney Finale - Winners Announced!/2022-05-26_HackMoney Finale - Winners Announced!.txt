[Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the hack money finale so if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by primarily running hackathons and summits and this is the last day of hack money so we're gonna summarize how the last few weeks were for for all of you here and then go into all the good stuff which is the amazing demos and the prizes so we ran this event with hackathons and the summit so for the summits we actually had a kickoff summit and a summit on superfluid reactor program and kind of super happy that we got to see some brand new product announcements as well as some really insightful conversations on how we think uh future payments is going to be and then going over to the hackathon side uh this has been an amazing event we have over 1200 five hackers participating in this hackathon they came in from 76 different countries spanning 18 different time zones and we kind of put everybody on a map to see where they were from and it's just incredible to see so much representation from all different continents around the world in addition to that we also saw 47 ecosystem partners and 246 ecosystem mentors who were here this entire time helping all of the attendees get unblocked and get help on various technical projects and we're giving away 300 000 in prizes we're going to go into all of those details today and before we go into that i just want to take a quick second and really kind of congratulate and say that we had 1200 214 submissions come out of this hackathon this is absolutely incredible uh officially this makes it our biggest event ever uh we're super excited to see so many d5 focused hacks um everything that we're going to see today and that came out of this event was a defy hack and uh can't wait to show you all some of the incredible projects and in addition to all that we had so much support from all these amazing protocols that were here this entire time uh helping out people and offering amazing prizes so i want to quickly shout out superfluid world coin unit swap grants program wallet connect ipfs valcoin audi grand style dydx babylon finance polygon volts olympus ck sync swing unstoppable domains and coinbase wallet tempest gearbox lyra the graph ap wine badger uma compound epns transact covalent nervous gnosis safe oasis foundation arbitrary teller spiron connects fuel oils maker chain stack chain link urine finance baku redstone gamma capitalist secured finance blockchain space upstart and quantstamp all these 46 amazing partners are um just absolutely incredible to work with and we're going to talk about all the prices that everybody won so let's go into the hackathon so we have 214 submissions from this event they all submitted three days ago on sunday and the next two days were judging and going through everything that came out of it uh we saw some incredible obvious themes here and we're going to see a lot of that here in these demos there's a lot of amazing lending and options related hacks especially with integrating nfts we saw a lot of creativity around layer twos and zero knowledge proofs being integrated uh there's a lot of stuff around asset management integrations and analytics and also our the most common thing that we saw was yield hacking and optimization and being able to see that anywhere from multiple chains to um on l2s so we're going to see some of those highlights here and through all the judging process from those 200 projects we landed on 10 finalists so we're going to talk about who they are and in no particular order i want to congratulate whip white oh ok walt evics field index hash space polypest jpex and text these are our 10 finalists there are going to be coming on this live stream now and demoing what they've built and uh just want to give them a big round of applause here for um being some of the amazing projects that everybody got excited about so we're gonna bring them on but before we sort of go and kick off with the first demo here i want to take a quick second and just really thank all of these 200 plus teams just because you were not a finalist does not mean you were not good enough the goal for this live stream is to highlight some really interesting creative ideas that our judges uh saw as part of that event and for us to actually highlight some of the things that we think um are going to be anywhere from trends to important uh topics of uh for building in the future so to all of the 204 teams here please um don't take this uh as like a defeat we really want you to continue building if you need any help whether it's more feedback or you want to talk to some people or want to get more specific feedback from some of the judges please send us a note on discord or email we'll be happy to i can help you make this project that you worked on for the last few weeks of reality and we're here to help and make sure that you continue to stay excited about uh everything that you built in addition to that there's also going to be opportunities for different grant programs to continue getting funding for building and continuing to build uh what you're doing so there's also opportunities for that and we'll be reaching out to you all over email and for those of you who are interested you can now head over to showcase.eatglobal.com to see a list of every project that came out of it including the 10 finalists we're going to see today so with that we're going to bring on these 10 teams back to back to do demos of what they built um we're going to bring them on in this order so we'll start off with text and then jpegs and the btf dca white on evacs so without further ado let's bring on our very first demo for today please welcome enough from techs you know whenever you're ready feel free to get started [Music] hi uh can you hear me everything is great okay so hi i'm nina and i'm from team tex and today i'll be presenting text of various decks for traders [Music] just a second i'll share my screen perfect so um tex is a um we are building the fair steps for traders we have a team of five members and our passion is to create a fair trading environment so that's what led us to build tests tex is a mav resistant decks for swapping tokens without any hidden slippages mev is also known as the minor or maximum extractable value and is essentially the additional profit a miner can make by arbitrarily including excluding or reordering a transactions within a block so to prevent any beyond text we use timelock puzzles and zero knowledge proof now timelock puzzles require large computational resources and the computation itself is very challenging so this timelock solution itself wasn't very practical to use it priorites so we developed a new scheme called pvte by combining sigma protocol and ck snark to solve the timelock puzzles and prove the validity within five seconds next for our demo we'll show how the swap process works on text so swapping is the same as in any other dex but there is a slight difference of encrypting the tech uh transactions on these front end as you will see for this demo we forked uni swaps as front end and smart contract and pvde is the key feature that we've developed for tests so i'm going to try to swap one uni to matic it takes a delays for the price we'll click swap and confirm swap sorry there seems to be a delay i'll try that one more time so click swap and then confirm swap and then sign the transaction on meta mask now the transaction is being encrypted with a symmetric key be generated from time of puzzles so that miners are not able to see the contents of it before they determine the transaction order so this prevents them from manipulating the transactions and then the transactions are executed and while this is happening the user is generating the proof of timeline puzzles and encryption using pbte and once this transaction gets submitted the user can check their order number for the transaction in this case it's three next we'll see the test codes for this demo step by step so once text receives the transaction and the proof it needs to verify the proof and if this is true it determines the order of the transaction and saves it on the recorder contract just waiting for it to pop up and then uh text also needs to find the symmetric key by solving the time puzzle this takes around eight seconds then it decrypts the transaction now before the execution let's bring the encrypted transactions and see the orders on the recorder contract text sends the decrypted transaction to the router contract for our execution now that both contracts have received everything the recorder contract and the router contract will talk to each other and make sure that the order is correct just waiting for the batch to pop up the network can be unstable sometimes so um just waiting for it to pop up [Music] so in this case because the network is unstable we will show the transaction that we are tested right before this demo so uh we'll check that the uh transactions have been actually executed in the right order um here on the left screen the top shows the order of the transactions on the recorder contract and the bottom shows the transaction hash on the swap contract and i will search the block number on polygon scan and you can see all the transactions within the block and the order of this transaction goes from bottom up so if we compare the transaction hash with the order number and the address you can see on polygon scan that the transactions have been executed in the right order so for example order number zero uh with the transaction hash 0x9 have been executed first and order number one zero xd hash number uh has been executed next and order number two 0xe have been executed last so to end our next step is to continue building text and partner with layer 2 and to implement our pvde on zk grow ups to prevent mvd thank you so much for listening and if you have any questions you can contact us at the radius.xyz thank you amazing thanks so much nina this has been an awesome demo and uh you were uh able to really make this uh work live i know there were some difficulties but the fact that we got to see this thing and the fact that we were able to make this definitively not uh go through reordering is incredible so congrats and we hope to see this go live very soon all right next up we have our second team and that is project jpegs so whenever you're ready feel free to get started with your demo sure can you see my screen yes hello everyone i am aditya and i have created gpex finance for the hack money jpegs is the first on-chain nft options trading platform problem with today's nfts are it has less user base mostly because of the size of the collection blue chip nfts are expensive no passive income to be earned from nfts and there is a huge gap between nfts and d5 with the help of jpegs i'm trying to bridge the gap between nfts and d5 give me one second there are a lot of people sitting on the sideline who wants to speculate on nfcs but because of the high entry cost barrier they are not able to do so and also there are holders of blue chip nfts who wants to speculate on nfts but they don't want to sell their rare nfts introducing jpegs jpeg solves all this problem by creating a derivative market where instead of selling your precious nfts you can trade options jpegs provide mass exposure to blue chip nfts by reducing the entry cost barrier and the most important of all you can hedge your expensive nfts by purchasing put options here is the description for the same here is a little market overview we can see that the fading volume of nfts are going down that is mostly because the flow prices are going through the roof let's dive into the demo first and we'll get back to the ppt later so here is the ui of our application initially we will be supporting three walls let's explore the bode yard club so similar to any option trade there will be option buyer and there will be option seller so let's go with the option buyer first and let's say option wire wants to purchase one option the premium of it is 0.02 with this premium is being set by the optimistic oracle let's preview the deposit and let's click on deposit waiting for the transaction to pop up once we confirm the transaction let me explain you the architecture of the world so we have decided to have two expiries in a month each expiry corresponds to one epoch there will be statistically decided strike prices and the user can choose one of strike prices and can choose to buy or sell options on the same the settlement of this options will be done in a european style now the deposit is successful let's go to the option seller side let's say option seller choose 125 with strike prices and wants to lock this nft and sell call options we'll deposit nft preview then when we click deposit waiting for the transaction to pop up now upon confirming upon confirming this nft will be locked into the vault until the option expiry now let me explain you the settlement process for now we'll be going forward with manual settlement but once singling price speeds for nfts are ready we'll be integrating the same and the oracle will take care of all the settlement process now once this thing is confirmed i'll show you what the nft's lock will look like waiting for it to confirm now yeah now the deposit is successful and when you see here you can see this particular entity is being locked inside the world the strike price of 125 with expiry of 30th may and i am the owner so you can see the owner information if you go into the portfolio page you will see that all the transactions are being recorded and this since the option hasn't expired yet you cannot claim this time uh since we'll be going with forward to the manual settlement let's expire the epoch and settle this thing we'll be settling this with 124 each waiting for the transaction to pop up sometimes it takes time yeah now once we confirm this thing i'll explain to you what is happening here so we are settling it with 124 each which is less than the strike price that means the option has expired out of the money and in this case option seller can reclaim their nfts without depositing anything into the back to the vault on the other hand if we would have expired it above the strike price then the option would have expired in the money and in that in that case option bearer can exercise the option in that case option seller will have to deposit the difference of settlement price and strike price back into the vault and that will be distributed on a proportionate basis to all the option buyers now when the uh when we have expired the epoch now let's settle this thing clicking on settle and waiting for the transaction to pop up it takes time sometimes but yeah now upon clicking confirm we are waiting for it to confirm till then we can have a look at different transactions waiting for it to confirm okay till then we can come here and we'll look into this meanwhile that is happening will be integra we have integrated worldwide for the same so that the use early users can claim an nft and the holder of those nfts will get 20 off on trading fees for the same now we'll check whether the settlement has completed or not yes it has completed upon refreshing we will see that the user can claim the nft now upon clicking claim nfp a pop-up will happen yeah it has happened now sometimes it takes time for it to confirm [Music] one transaction is going through uh upon confirmation of this thing the nfts will be reclaimed back to the user waiting for the transaction to confirm uh yeah now it is confirmed upon refreshing we will see that the option transaction has been wiped off and if you go back to the option option seller side you can see that the nft has been reclaimed by the user so with the uh by this demo i'm trying to tell is this simple option reading will look like on nfts let's go back to the presentation this is what the timeline looks like we'll be going forward with three volts initially and the call options architecture we are parallely working on the put options time put options and we'll make it live soon we'll be integrating support for put option soon we'll be adding keep on adding more volts as per community proposers and once everything is happened we'll be collaborating with other nft cross d5 protocols for the same so this is what the expansion plan looks like and if you want to get in touch with us you can connect with us on this social profiles that's pretty much it from mine uh thank you for watching amazing thank you so much for uh for that demo i'm glad that you're able to make this work uh than any issues and this is uh this is awesome we'll hope to see that uh go live as well and with that we are ready for our next team and that is btf dca so uh whenever you're ready feel free to uh get started thanks hi let me just share my screen cool so uh hello everyone uh i'm an online i'm the creator of btfdca and uh what is btfdca it's a product that lets you buy crypto the smart way that is through dollar cost averaging uh we have a strictly point ui ux which you just ready set and you go and it's built leveraging the benefits of super fluid and polygon and for those that are not aware of what dollar cost averaging is it's an investment strategy where you periodically buy an asset in constant amounts and this is perfect for uh crypto and for huddlers so it lets you just navigate smoothly through the volatility that the markets have so uh let me show you how this works so we'll go into the demo okay so this is the ui uh this is the vtfdca products you know i'm just going to go and connect my wallet here cool i'm connected you know and i simply say that hey i want to buy a constant amount of my fake diax token let's say a five figure x token and i want to buy this asset which is the if global token and i want to do this every day so i simply set five and i click btf dci and metamask pop-up plot comes up and i'll just approve this transaction and i wait a bit and boom that's it congrats man you've just btfdca and so this means that tomorrow i'll be getting my if globalx token in my wallet and uh as i mentioned this is built on top of superfluid so i want to show you that what i just did actually happened so superfluid you have the console and you have a dashboard and we can see the money getting sent to this to to our smart contract so we can see here this is the balance that's going down and uh if i refresh because it takes a little bit we'll see here the flow rate so meaning that the money the five fake diax is getting streamed uh per day okay and then uh tomorrow coming here to the wallet i'll be able to to to get paid okay uh what else so going back here how does this all work as i mentioned it's powered by superfluid it uses the super fluid content flow agreements which allows you to stream money into a smart contract and the instant distribution agreements which are used to get to redistribute the money to the investors it's running on polygon which means that we have low cost transactions and we're doing the swaps through unit swap going a little bit more technical this is uh how it works and this here we also have some of the things that i would have liked to have time to build but didn't have unfortunately so uh the users with their wallets connected front end from the front end they simply click btfdca that starts the superfluid constant flow agreement which puts the money into our smart contract then every day we go into uni swap and we do the swap and then we return back the money to our investors so uh yeah what's next so uh this was a project built for the hackathon so there's quite a bit of things that need to be polished and make this production ready i want to find users for this so uh all of that and then in the future more assets maybe dca everything more integrations with the d5 protocols and reinvesting into vaults and so on and so if you're interested you know let me know and thanks for your time thanks for that demo this is such a simple and a cool utility that uh can be used in so many different ways so i'm glad that uh you might have made this through and and presented it to everybody um also for clarification we don't have a global token so it's just a demo but uh well thank you so much and with that we are ready for our next demo next up is rowan from wider router roman whenever you're ready hi everyone i'm roman and i'm super excited to present the wide lobe router with you today which is a cross chain liquidity migration protocol let me jump straight into the demo so here i am on the bv finance website and this is a flux usd clp vault i would like to deposit into this wall it lives on the pantone chain the problem is that i don't have anything inside my moment there are no tokens and only a little dust of ftm that is not enough to cover the deposit fee on the other hand i do have something on my avalanche wallet so what i could do is i could move or bridge my usdc from avalanche over to phantom i would buy ftm tokens somewhere and then deposit into this vault using this zap alternatively i can do all of that in a single step using wider router let me show you how that works so this is the page we've built for this hackathon it's live on this url as well as all our contracts are live on main nets so you can go and check it out yourself so my wallet is connected as from i'll select my usdc on avalanche and as they do i'll select i'll go to volts and i'll select frags usdclp vault by vv finance on punto let's say i want to root 5 i have approved already so i'll just click route i confirm while the transaction is being mined i'll move on with my demo and we'll get back here later on to further present the extensibility of this system we've also built a wider router widget that dabs can integrate into their website let me show you an example of how this looks on the year finance website i'm personally a huge fan of this team so here i am on year finance and when i switch to ethereum i have a deposit in the usdc vault on ethereum i have deposited into this vault in the past but the apy went down recently so i'd like to move it elsewhere and i have discovered this vault on phantom that i am particularly interested in at this moment and it's this divorce that is currently offering four percent so that what i out what i would like to do is i would like to move my usdc from ethereum all the way into this divold on phantom that requires withdrawing on ethereum bridging to fun tone exchanging from usdc into die and then depositing let me show you how you can do all of that in a single transaction and you won't need any ftm for that so first i'll install the widget into this site super simple just a few lines of code the buttons are green now so they are controlled by invited i can click deposit on this dial this little wider router pop-up comes up i can select my usdc my wi-fi usdc from the ethereum year usdc vault let's say i want to move 50 of it i have approved already so i'll just click deposit i need to switch my network to ethereum as that's where the source transaction happens and i hit prefer this transaction is going to be mined now so i'll just move on with my presentation i will get back here in a second to sum up wider router is a cross-chain liquidity migrations protocol it supports deposits withdrawals and migrations across any chain any protocol or any layer 2. as part of this hackathon we've added support for a few volts from year and b fee and we would like to do we would like to integrate more so if you are a protocol and you would like to receive deposits from different chains or different layer twos make sure to reach out and let's now check the state of the transaction so this is the first transaction usdc from avalanche into phantom i have successfully received the lp token on of beefy i can open up the transactions this is the one on avalanche and then there is one on pantone and i can also see this one this transaction from ethereum to phantom is still being mined the one on ethereum has finished successfully the other one is still being mined and i'm sure it's going to finish pretty quickly so that was why the router thank you very much for listening amazing well thank you so much for uh doing that demo and uh really kind of making that you know well actually being production ready you deployed on mainnet this is incredible so hopefully we all get to try this out after after this live stream ends and congrats thank you all right next up we have lee from evics so whenever you're ready feel free to get started great can you hear me yes awesome thank you cardik hi everyone this is evitz an on-chain volatility trading protocol my name is lee i'm from san francisco i'm a software engineer and a former volatility and equity trader and i worked on this solo so what is evicts and why is it needed currently there isn't an easy way to gain pure exposure to implied volatility levels in the d5 ecosystem this is a critical piece of a mature derivatives market allowing for traders and market makers to hedge option exposures and speculate on future changes in volatility in traditional equity markets there is the fix index which is calculated from a weighted average of listed option prices in the d5 world thanks to the existence of perpetual option like swaps we can more easily calculate an on-chain implied volatility level for example with open squeeze eth implied volatility is simply the square root of 365 times the daily funding rate so how does it work evicts is a single product to gain exposure to on-chain implied volatility without the need to dynamically change positions v0 of the index is calculated using squeak funding rates however in the future it will include other data sources such as uniswap v3 pools and other on-chain option markets traders deposit collateral on the protocol from there they can buy or sell the evic perpetual swap or can provide liquidity in the evict trading pool to earn fees on traded volume funding is then paid or received on open positions based on the difference between the current index level and current pool price to maintain a peg between the pool and the index and from there we'll go on to our demo swap over great so now we can see we are connected to the efix protocol and we are ready to deposit some collateral and start doing some trading so we want to deposit 250 000 usdc and while we wait for that to confirm we can go check out the provide liquidity screen uh we can see that the current pool price is 117 and the index is actually marked a little higher at 125 and the current pool fee rate is 0.5 percent and there's already a million usdc and eight and a half thousand units of eviks in the pool um but we're more interested in trading so let's go over to the trade window we can see our 250 000 collateral has flowed through uh with the current initial margin rate of 50 we have a maximum trade size of 500 000 and we think volatility is going to go up in the future but we're not quite sure how much so we'll do a smaller trade and buy 50 000 usdc worth of evicts so once that transaction flows through we should see ourselves with a long position and i'll give that a second also so we can see our transaction has flowed through we have a long position of around 400 units of evx with an opening price of 123 dollars and our collateral has gone down by half of that 50 000. uh next up i'm going to trigger a couple things manually that normally would be happening automatically and first i want to trigger an update to our index levels so what that's going to do is pull the funding outputs from the squeeze contract and do a new calculation of our index and update that index level in the protocol so let's trigger that and once that flows through i want to settle funding on our position and depending on whether the index is above or below great so we can see that the new index level is 146 and given that the pool price is below that we would expect to receive funding on our long position so let's settle the funding and if we go back to the trade window surely we should see our accrued funding flow through and also so we can see that we have made around 7000 usdc on funding on this position given that volatility has gone up as we expected it to and now we're ready to exit out of our position so let's close our long position and we can see that our collateral has come back plus the 7000 usdc that we made on our funding um awesome so now we'll go back to the presentation great so a couple details on the technical side there are three main contracts in use here first is the oracle contract which keeps track of the current events index level and calculates updates to the index via outputs from the squeeze contract second is the amm pool which is a constant product market maker and keeps track of current assets in the pool of the current price and last is the margin full contract handling all end user interactions with the protocol where users deposit collateral make trades and manage any lp positions they have and this contract also handles settling funding keeping track of collateral levels and liquidating user positions a couple quick things on our future work it will include automating and decentralizing the index calculation and funding settlement process incorporating other data feeds into the index such as unity 3 pools and other option markets expanding to different underliers and collateral types adding the ability to trade expiring contracts and implementing a retail focused fault strategy similar to today's popular decentralized option vaults uh with that i want to say a big thank you to e global the judges and sponsors for putting on a great hackathon the demo app is live on dropzin at edx-app.herokulapp.com with a mock usdc faucet up on the site and there's also a work in progress white paper up there as well if anyone has any questions or wants to chat volatility my dms are open on twitter at l mount underscore thank you amazing thankfully uh amazing demo perfect uh product in the current market that we need so i hope that this goes to maintenance soon for uh for all of us to benefit and uh glad to see this also on a desknet all right next up we have lewis from ok vault so who's whenever you're ready we'll just have uh you turn on the video and meet yourself and we should be good to go on the live stream perfect got it thanks here we go [Music] hey hack money my name is luis and i'm part of organic labs today we're going to be presenting to you our latest product ok vault the first reverse bidding auction generator we currently live in a world where big individuals are able to win auctions by pushing more money and outputting the regular individuals but don't worry we're here to change that regular actions have one thing in mind make money and this benefits the worlds individuals that can easily outbeat anyone else by pushing more money into the ocean to be clear becoming a whale is not rocket science do you know keep keep pushing money into your wallets but let's take a moment and one simple question what if what if we could imagine a new type of auction a new type of auction that brings powers to the smaller individuals an auction where everyone is invited an auction owned by the community and most importantly an auction that can make maximize the profits for the creators we present to you the reverse bidding auction it follows one simple premise the winner will be whoever beats the lowest unique amount between 1 cent and 100 everybody pays a small entropy defined by the creator and errors a fair chance to win the auction during this hackathon we created a mobile dev to interact with our small contracts we're now fully integrated with metamask and our sponsor coinbase one we're also using the new epns service to deliver push notifications to all of our participants and we have completed the migration of our smart contracts to the popular ckc 2.0 now let's take a look at ok volume action you can download overlap with one click by visiting this website once we have logged in we'll be able to browse deliver different of live auctions and review the details you can now place your bid by simply selecting between one cent and one hundred dollars that you want to place your bid you will only play the entry fee that was defined by the creator once the auction has been completed and everybody has placed their bids the owner of the auction will be able to withdraw the funds and select the winner to find out the winner of this auction we'll go bit by pip and cancel every duplicated bid in the auction for example one cent and 18 cents once we have completely burned all the repeated beats we're left with at least with a short list of unique numbers and it's very simple to find out the lower list out of the short list in the future months will allow you to add multiple standard talkers to your vault including erc20s 720 ones and of course 1155s winners will receive a pope for the auction and by the end of this year we'll complete the road in our ck roll-ups a new world is in the making don't let the world decide your future scan this code or visit this website to join our defined revolution get your magic of mumbai ready and join our alpha action this afternoon to win up to 111 matic the entry fee is only 10 cents automatic we hope this idea inspires you to build on top and create new products along the way we love to hear your thoughts and feedback whether you're an investor a creator or a charity organization reach out to us on twitter discord or github thank you for your time amazing thanks so much lewis that was a really good way to think about fairness and i'm glad that he were able to make that demo and uh can't wait to have this become a norm in uh how we do auctions from iran congrats thanks kartik sorry but i didn't uh turn on my video i just forgot oh good well we can see you now and uh we also saw an amazing demo so great well thank you and with that we are ready for our next demo and that is team space so ali and team whenever you're ready thank you so much karthik uh chris please go ahead and share your screen brilliant hi we are team hash space we have created a d5 product discovery game our team has found each other during hack money and eat amsterdam right now it's very hard for users to discover and trial the many d5 products available to them we have created a space exploration adventure game by combining game fi d5 and healthfi we reward users for discovering and trying new d5 products players travel the galaxy in a starship fueled by their footsteps each planet they visit is a different d5 protocol and they can win yield from it to get a first hand taste this is a completely new user acquisition opportunity for d5 products players start by choosing a galaxy we have deployed the game across three different chains polygon oasis and arbitrary the player registers and buys an nft starship the nft sales populate the game's treasury the treasury is deployed in the planets these planets are actually walls which are powered by partner d5 solutions they generate yield over time using their respective protocol the ships are powered by players footsteps synced from smart devices when players arrive at a planet they learn more about the protocol and the first player to arrive gets the yield as bounty when a new protocol is ready to be featured in the game we introduce them as a new planet this creates an ever-growing universe for players let's check out the demo now so here we are at face.quest and we have some information about the game and this is where new users can come and register by clicking this button here when a new user registers that mint an nft for them at the cost of 0.01 of the respective token and that nft can be seen also on openc when a new player joins the game a notification is sent to the epns channel as well as other mechanisms mechanics around the game so people can subscribe for updates if they want to i'm going to join by connecting my wallet and once i'm in i can see the number of steps that i have already synced and the amount that i've earned in the game if i wanted to sync more steps i can click here and this query is the google fit api and we'll update the number of steps i have in the top right i can now click through and go to the game and here i can see the galaxy and this is the polygon planetary system because we're on mumbai at the moment and i can see a number of different planets and i can see the starships for other players inside this game uh if i want to i can click on other planets and get more information about the games so here about about the protocols that are behind the planets so here i can see maker down is the uh the protocol generating yield for this planet um i can also then have a look at a few others so here for example we have uh uni swap generating the yield here um the red spaceship is is my starship and i'm currently on a yearn planet um and this one up here is rv and i can move to these different planets so here i can see i need 100 1720 steps and i have enough so therefore i can initiate a movement over to this new planet and here i can see my my starship moving and once i land it will initiate a transaction which does a few different things the first thing that it does is update the location of my starship nft on chain additionally it will also discount the number of steps that i have and depending on whether there is any yield available on this particular planet it may or may not increment the amount that i've earned so i'm just going to initiate that transaction now and while the transaction is going through we have this blue bar at the top to indicate that things are being processed and once the transaction completes we'll see the steps go down and we'll find out whether or not we earned any reward from the visiting this particular planet we can also keep up to date with game ongoings again via the epns channel so here we have uh the hash best hash space dot quest epsilon people can subscribe to and here we can see that i was lucky i earned um from business planet i've gone up 1.3 um so i was very happy to earn that yield uh and additionally one of the the plans for expansion is to add uh new planets and as you can see this universe is infinitely expandable it's all different planets and we can continue to add more um and these are the amazing chains d5 protocols and tools that we use during the hack our next steps are to port the game to main nets to also add ave and yeon as the initial view of planets and we're going to be deploying on optimism on notice next as well this is the live link for our demo hashbrowns.quest you can check it out and this is the source code on github thank you chris holley and the rest of the team congrats on this really fun amazing game this is definitely one uh creative way to get more people involved and uh hope to see this uh live and in everybody's hands amazing all right so uh next up we have alex from yields index alex whenever you're ready feel free to get started hey yes so today i want to present you an yield index a product where you can create the index of field opportunities while others can invest in one click so on this hackathon we worked as a team of three people me myself worked on a product pile worked on front end while jager worked on smart contracts so with no further ado let's dive into a product and let's create some indexes so we currently integrated with unc 20 stable coins uh our deposits and used uh sorry wiring walls so let's create like wire metal volt so we will add like all uh wireless stable coins volts uh and earn yields on them so uh here we can select the weights of our volts let's say we trust in diamonds and other stable coins and we'll allocate the funds accordingly so on the final step we can see the overview of our index we can name it let's name it better layer and we can see the total foi and let's deploy our index on chain so we currently deploy it on phantom in the future we will not want to deploy on like others ethereum's altos like arbitrarily or optimism so here's like our index uh we can see as a user of what's in this index we can see that index composition we can see the api for this index and we can invest in it so let's say we want to invest 0.1 uh ust in this index first of all we need to approve plugin spending now we are ready to buy this index so under the hood we are depositing uh usdt to use the t wiring vault then we're swapping a portion of usdt into a die and deposit it to the wire vault and the same for usdc and in exchange the smart contract sending a user is talking representing a share in index so here like we can see that we can we should we have like a portion of this index and now we can withdraw it when we earned enough uh and like as a like in this creator i can also rebalance it it currently run manually so i can change like the index composition for example i can like rebalance from die to usdc it's not working uh let me oppress the page it's not working yes uh in the future we want to like uh add support for other ethereum l2 networks uh add more yield instruments to our product uh and move to like cross chain add some cross chain support to allow like people uh compose indexes for crocheting products so if you want to get in touch you can find like our contacts on our team web page and like thanks everyone from ace global for this event and we are happy we are happy to get in touch thanks amazing thanks alex um i guess this wouldn't be a hackathon demo if murphy's law doesn't kick in but uh you kind of made it through at the end and only some minor issues you now see the rebounds but everything else was great congrats on making this an awesome protocol that kind of makes an index out of other yields and looking forward to using that someday all right two more demos to go and then we can go into all the prizes so next up we have our second last team and that is polypeps hey everyone so i'm josef we're a team of five and today we are proud to present you polypus an innovative protocol allowing the use of nfts as questions for alone indeed we believe that we're just at the beginning of nfts and that we need to propose today standards for nft use tomorrow in fact today this nfts are generally not used it is impossible to integrate them easily into defy to use leverage or simply to edge parts of the investment risk some protocol try to solve this problem by using two approach protocol based on a navi fork that works perfectly fine with liquid token but only comes to nfts you can borrow only up to 30 of the ltv the second approach are based on an inefficient p2p system when you need to find someone ready to land you for a certain amount certain duration and with certain interests for this reason we developed polyps a protocol that allows instant lending using nfts allowing a high rate of return for liquidity provider the protocol use an on-chain autobook to allow for ltv that reflect the risk appetite of the market and make matching between borrowers efficient the liquidity provider will for a given collection to the ltv for any nft and deposit liquidity in this way the market decides on the pricing of the nft the borrower can then borrow instantly up to a certain maximum amount depending on its collateral at repay at any time before the due date this predefined date correspond in this contract for this proof of concept to the date used by the vast majority of loans which is actually two weeks how does it work well it's quite simple for the user in this case the liquidity provider this is the liquidity provider side remember our system is based on the one side order book so the liquidity provider will have to determine for a given collection how much she wants to deposit and the maximum amount that can be borrowed for any nft in this collection those at the top of the order book will match first with the borrowers borrowed liquidity is no longer available during the time of borrowing unused liquidity is deposited on a lending platform to ensure minimum yield while waiting to be matched we'll see this a little bit further but this is the main innovation in in our product for the borough side it's even simple you choose for collection one or multiple nfts as collateral you can instantly borrow a certain amount of ease determined by the market you got an interest fixed and you have your long duration and at some point if someone forgot to repay is notable the nftc is to go to a dutch auction and through game theory we should be able to extract the fair value on the market so we deploy on polygon mumbai so testnet and arbitrom uh rinkaby as i said uh we implement also compounds on rinkaby and uh ibm on mumbai to put to work and use liquidity so let's go to the demo time so once that you have connected your wallet you end up on the market those are the collection that you can use today to supply and borrow you also have the auction i will come back to it later and the dashboard with all of your position let's try to borrow this is the simplest uh simplest action so you can use one of the nft in your collection and the market has determined that you can with this liquidity available you can borrow up to 100 ease in this case i will simply borrow 35 so here you go and you can see your position then on the dashboard with the condom the interest and you can repay at any time for the supply side so let's say we're going to supply with the same collection the main advantage here is that for example i can supply only 3.5 es i'm i'm ready to land up to 80 east for one nft of this collection so this is the main innovation part very good okay so like i said uh this is the way for us to determine um the ltv that can be land and borrow on the market yeah okay i think it should work anyway and uh so for example let's try to repay one of the the loan that we have made before so you pay not only the interest and the loan itself okay so and as i said the auction part is like the place when uh nfts that can be paid back or seized and through time the the price will decrease to zero so at some point it will meet the fair market price and we can repay the liquidity provider what with the fair market price of the nft so the next step today we are we plan to launch on may net of course to add some securities features some safety nets and we're looking not only uh for people to join us on on this adventure but also uh nfc's collection that want to be implemented first uh on a platform thank you very much joseph thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh just relaying stuff i'm seeing in the comments this is such a beautiful ui and i will see this on mainnet so congrats all right well with that we are ready for our 10th and the last demo for today so without further ado let's welcome with hello everybody uh i'm not your handle from team butter and this is whip so at butter we like to see ourselves as sitting in between dowels and their treasuries and one of the things that we notice is that dials have a lot of inherent risk and what we we do with whip is we try to expose that risk and that meant that whip felt we could focus on treasury risk metrics and strategy back testing i just want to give you a little bit of background um as we know we're in uh one hell of a downturn at the moment and i mean it sucks for us as investors and and uh people who live in web three but it really sucks for doubts they've uh some of them have gone from having massive treasuries could last them for decades to basically nothing and they're having to put in these incredible emergency measures like you know stopping hiring or stopping uh some of the work they plan to do and this is not a new phenomenon this is this this risk was baked in during the the bull market where most treasuries they they do a token sell they issue assets and they hold those assets they don't dump them and so that means that most of their treasury is denominated in a single token maybe two tokens and as i just said that could mean this is the uni treasury you go from 4.2 billion in november down to about 2 billion in february tough really tough and there's a lot of volatility inherent in in running a treasury um but also the treasuries are made up of crypto assets and turns out they're super super correlated so hard to actually offset some of that risk if one thing goes down most of it's going down so it's really really tough um just by the way the only thing that's uncorrelated there is doge for anyone who uh who wants to avoid risk uh hold dodge um but realistically there's a ton of great products out there in the market some of them are very new but they are there and the only problem is you kind of need a lot of expertise to be able to use them even find them and and now actually because of solidity and the environment in which these products are deployed you need a lot of technical expertise as well dallas can't just walk into these products and leverage them so what's our problem we've got treasury risk it's going unidentified we don't have enough expertise we don't have enough focus solutions do exist but we need special knowledge to evaluate and operate those solutions our solution at whip is real-time treasury risk analysis access to risk mitigation strategies and the ability to backtest those strategies before committing the product is what it looks like on the right as i said it has the kind of graph on the left you you basically on the right you will pick a strategy and then you back test it and gives you the overlay on the left fairly simple stuff i'm going to do is just switch over to the demo and give you a little walk through so this is the um bit dao treasury uh you can see it started at nothing and yeah this is the year switch to three it's probably a bit a bit more straightforward so this is the the value in that um over the past three months now we've got the total value here the volatility here and then the return versus f and then we have the actual allocations the volatility of each of those assets and then the risk contribution some of those are negatives there's some rounding errors in there um and what we have over here is the is the products available so you could imagine this basically being able to curate products and plug those treasuries straight into them um what i'll do actually is quickly switch over to another treasury which is the uni stock treasury and then this one uh again this is uni and this is the whole year and i said before uni's obviously experienced a significant uh loss in value um and um we only have one asset right so the risk contribution is 100 so there's a fair amount we could do here um one of the things that we worked on before was this um spread product which allowed you to to spread using superfluid um your tokens into a balance of calls and rebalance over time um so imagine you could plug that in you could click it and you could actually test that strategy right here so what we're going to do is we're going to we've got our asset here imagine this just says uni and then here we're going to we're going to put 20 and then when we hit review what we should see is uh what that would look like if we had uh actually did done this what three months ago if we had actually run this strategy what would the impact be you can see we basically are dampening the the kind of volatility by about 20 it's a fairly simple calculation this one but you can imagine how much more interesting this could be if you were to look at debt-based funding using the like boomers range token for instance so you're actually adding um assets to the treasury without selling them uh and then actually repaying them later on uh or using um other strategies using like the squeeze strategies you're actually hedging or you're actually um you're diversifying into f itself um and sometimes even one of the good metrics here is just return versus f lots of treasury's probably underperforming so they have a fairly clear metric of what would have happened if they'd literally just held out and obviously there's a ton more that we could do here in terms of surfacing some of the properties you could actually change um you know how much you're diversifying the time over which you're diversifying and so on and so forth and so we'd hope to in the future add a lot more strategies and allow you to stack some of these strategies up so last but not least um that was a demo uh if you want to find us we're at whip dot bus three dot money just put in a treasury address to see the uh the volatility in that in that treasury and you can find the the actual repo github.com and these are the handles of the of the team there's four of us and um yeah you can find us on github thank you very much amazing thank you so much and uh thank you for being a really amazing last demo for today this is uh such a cool utility to kind of manage treasury especially at scale and just being able to see literally what a 20 shock resetting would do is uh is not a small thing so i'm glad that uh we're able to make this thing work on for the hackathon and hope to see other dows uses too absolutely congrats all right so that concludes all 10 of our finalist demos so i want to quickly thank all these teams again tax jpegs ptf dca wider router eviks okay

worry too much about not being able to see if you want or not plus you can also rewind this video live stream and just check and pause again but just before we get to get there i want to make a quick note about the delivery rules so everything is tentative and not final which means that we have all the information that we need we just have to review everybody projects before we actually send any of these prizes so we'll be verifying everybody's code base to make sure that everything that was uh built well everything that we're going to give a price for was built for the hackathon and only then we get to uh distribute the prices for everybody that tentative date right now is june 1st so we should have all of these things just related by next week and also if you applied for a pool prize and you don't you see yourself on the list here you do have the ability to bring that up and dispute any kind of misinformation or miscategorization during your submission process but you have to do it in the next 24 hours we'll be sending another message on the discord clarifying that if you don't see yourself there please uh ping us now but after 24 hours from now we will not make any changes to that list so um congratulations to all of these amazing teams and we will send all that information for how to collect redeem and what the totals are to all of you very soon over multiple channels and while this is still in the build process you can head over to showcase.eatglobal.com in the next little while we'll be able to see all the projects listed and if you go on your own project page from there you can see which prices you've won on your own project so you don't have to remember you can just go on your own project submission and see on the right sidebar prices you have been awarded so congrats and we are now at the very end of concluding hack money so before we kind of wrap things up i want to say a few thank yous there's a lot of people that make all these events happen
