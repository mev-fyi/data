this is uh our next workshop in the east online hackathon um we have alan halpern from alchemy she's going to give a presentation entitled building scalable reliable and data consistent dapps on ethereum and l2 i'm going to ask everyone if we can um to you can keep yourselves muted um during during the presentation and at the end we're gonna field some questions in the chat so if you have questions in the zoom chat just put them here as we go along and when we get to the end we'll field the questions and at that um i will go off camera and let alone take over cool awesome thanks so much andrew um sweet so i am going to uh share my screen here you know one second cool it's going to full screen awesome um i just want to make sure andrew can everyone can you guys see this okay yep looks good awesome sweet um so what's up everyone i'm alan um i am from the alphabet team i work on developer experience at alchemy uh so talk a lot to our users in discord um kind of help out with a little bit of marketing and product as well um but overall really really excited to be sharing with you guys a little bit more about alchemy and how you can use it to sort of build your applications throughout this hackathon cool um so wanted to give a quick uh overview overview first of sort of like the blockchain revolution i know there are a lot of like new people who are just getting started with webtoon development who are at this conference uh wanted to kind of kick off with it with a quick overview um so to do that we have to take a look back in history right so over the course of the past 50 years there have been pretty much three major technological shifts that we've experienced that have been just absolutely game changing for um our lives today um the first of those is the computer so um computers basically came along and said okay humans can now provide instructions for machines right so now i can come in and say hey computer execute this thing for me and that allowed me to build sort of different applications and have this personal computer this was like revolutionary right before things had to be written by hand it was very archaic the computer said hey uh humans can give machine instructions and those machines can execute those instructions the second sort of major pillar was the internet and that was absolutely gaming trending because it allowed machines to exchange information right so now it's not just this individual personal computer uh human to computer now it's like machine can talk to another machine all the way across the other side of the world and the internet enabled that we can now exchange information across different types of machines the third sort of pillar which is sort of where we are today um is blockchain right and so this was absolutely game changing because it said okay machines internet allowed machines to exchange information now blockchain came along and said okay machines can exchange value and that opens up a whole host of different applications and use cases that were just absolutely unimaginable before so d5 nfts all these things that we know and use today um this is sort of where we are now um so why is this relevant to alchemy and where do we kind of fit in in this uh in this sort of wave right um so when we look at the personal computer there's sort of three layers um that come there's three layers in this stack the first is the protocol layer the protocol layer is sort of like the physical component of the computer the ram the cpu the hard drive those are the things that make up the computer um but it's really really hard to actually code on top of that protocol layer right you'd have to be coding in zeros and ones and it'd be extremely difficult to build uh in excel or word or google chrome in zeros and ones right so what happened was is that microsoft and apple came along and said hey uh we're going to enter in as a platform layer and build out what's called an operating system and what the operating system is is basically it's built on top of those protocol layer on top of those zeros and ones and it allows developers to actually go and build applications that we can actually use and know in a much much easier way so without the operating system it'd be extremely difficult to build that third layer which is you know the really important one that we all interface with today and that's the application layer so sort of this like three-level stack right we couldn't have the applications without actually having the protocol and we couldn't really have um you know the application to having the platform either right so we'll be able to get there straight from the protocol or be extremely difficult to do so we look at the internet we see the same exact structure here the protocol layer is now http ftp smtp so they're just kind of internet protocols the way we can communicate across the internet the platform layer that came in for the internet was actually amazon web services or sort of like cloud computing right um google and microsoft microsoft visitor and google cloud services also has that uh aws is kind of the dominant force here when it comes to the platform layer for the internet um so this abstracted away a lot of the kind of technical protocols that happens between the internet um and allowed us to build these applications that we're really familiar with like um netflix and uber and airbnb and so now as an application layer i don't have to worry about running my own servers because i can just use something like aws and that allows me to to take advantage of the protocol layer so you see a very similar stack here when it comes to the internet unsurprisingly um in the blockchain space and this third technological shift that we're in right now we also see a very very similar uh technological stack right so the protocol layer now becomes the actual change themselves so bitcoin ethereum any other chain that people are building on those are the actual protocols the way of exchanging value the way of communicating this is where alchemy comes in we are that platform layer um that makes it really really seamless and easy to build on top of those protocols so just like aws did for the internet protocol and just like operating systems did for personal computers we're doing the same thing for blockchain applications and making that process of actually building the application layer really really easy so what this enables is uh decentralized applications um on the blockchain uh you know decentralized changes nft marketplaces and platforms um this whole kind of era and new wave of applications and finance um all of that is enabled because we have this platform layer uh that makes it really easy for developers to build so sort of gives you a sense of where we fit in in the overarching like kind of technological stack cool so what is the challenge for blockchain developers right we talked about how it's like all hard and stuff for different for different sort of technological shifts but what is an actual challenge for blockchain developers and we think about these two major challenges i'll go ahead and talk to thousands and thousands of developers at this point and the two core issues when it comes to blockchain development is one lack of developer tools and then two node infrastructure i mean i'll talk a little bit about both of those things um in the preceding slides and break this down so first is locker developer tools um so right now building a blockchain is sort of like building a website and in the 90s um there's a lot of opportunity it's very hot there's a lot of excitement there's a lot going on but the tools surrounding and supporting building those applications are very very archaic and it can be really challenging to use so ultimately when you have these sort of archaic tools that sort of can get you somewhere right you can use these sort of slow moving maybe challenging to use tools and they can build you a home or they can build you a functioning app right this is an analogy we often use to kind of explain our product um but you know if you have our pit stones and tools you can get a home that is functional right it's a house you can live in can it scale very well can it fit a lot of house guests can you do a lot of things in it probably not but when you bring in actual sophisticated tools and real construction equipment to actually build that out you start to get things like skyscrapers applications uh that are much more sophisticated that can handle and scale a lot differently than they could have with those sort of stones and picks uh picks and shovels that you typically see um in the earlier stages um so this is sort of like what we're focusing on when it comes to developer tooling um so that's that's kind of the first part right is like we're trying to get you the tools to allow you to build skype skyscrapers allow you to build really big applications um that grow and scale with thousands of users millions of users cool so the second part of the challenge for developers is this thing called nodes um and i'm just going to assume that people are a little bit unfamiliar with nodes i know there's a lot of technical people here in the audience but um i'll just assume that people don't know what this is so a little bit of background on a node node is basically the entry point communication channel to the blockchain um so it's a really really crucial step uh in in kind of like the developer life cycle and and being able to build in web 3 is you need what's called a note and nodes are extremely important because one they they're what allow um blockchain to be decentralized right because nodes there's no single entry point into the chain there's like many nodes that communicate between each other but in order to read and write to the blockchain you need this entry point so it keeps track of the state of the blockchain so any given point in time a node in theory should know about all the current and previous transactions on the chain and to developers in order to build those like end applications need this communication channel to read and write to the blockchain say hey like what you know what's the what's the historical transaction for my users um and hey i want to send this transaction that all gets funneled through a node so you can see how this is a really really crucial part in um a web 3 application's infrastructure right the problem is nodes are really really really hard to manage and run and i'll talk a little bit about why um so one of the core challenges when it comes to running nodes is just pure downtime um so first off nodes can take up to weeks to sync if you're syncing a node to the current state of the blockchain today that's a lot a lot of blocks it has to catch up to and that can take a bunch of time to actually catch up and consume all that data um so just like pure uptime and the second is nodes can easily go down and when a node goes down that means all of your traffic goes down right so if i'm a user and i'm sending traffic to this dap that gap is relying on node to read and write to the blockchain that node goes down all of a sudden my users don't have a way to use my data um so you know when nodes experience downtime and theory you'd want to spin up another node but again that can can take a lot of time so it's sort of like a vicious cycle um when it comes to sort of just pure downtime notes number two is this idea of scalability uh so like i said nodes can take a a long time to spin up so let's say i wake up one day uh a viral tick tock was made about my application and all of a sudden i'm experiencing millions and millions of users on my dap right and beforehand maybe i had a couple hundred users i had this one node that was serving my couple hundred user just fine but now all of a sudden i need to serve traffic to millions of users what do i do in theory i'd like to go spin up another node but to spin up another node that would take a couple weeks right so all this traffic is flooded to one node when it gets that traffic spike it can just crash right just like if you overflow almost like ddosing someone um if you if you send too much traffic that node can crash and then you can experience downtime so all of a sudden this app you have this huge opportunity to go viral and now users can't even use your application because uh your node couldn't handle the traffic right so quickly scaling is super super important for any application that exists um and it's really challenging to do that when when you're running a node the third challenge which is sort of the most uh kind of kind of intricate one um and nitty gritty when it comes to blockchain stuff is just data consistency so like i mentioned before um every node should know about all the new blocks that happen on the chain right um but because that information has to propagate between nodes it can get a little bit tricky so let's say i'm one user um and i go to buy a cryptokitty for example cryptokitties is one of alchemy's first users so very partial to their team but let's say so like i i'm a user i go to buy a crypto kitty um i buy that cryptokitty and it spits back hey you have your crypto quick kitty in block 102 right um and so these are nodes behind a load balancer right so at this point i'm an application i have multiple nodes behind the scenes i've thought through i'm like hey i can scale i know i'm gonna have a lot of users i have multiple nodes so um i send my transaction it's in block 102 uh the application spits it back and says you're good you bought the scripter kitty in block 102. next thing you know someone else comes along and they see the same cryptokitty um and they go to buy that cryptokitty and all of a sudden they're seeing block 100 right so before i was on block 102 another user queries at the same time or maybe a little bit after and they're on block 100. how could this happen in the first place well that's because nodes take a little bit to propagate transactions so one node might be slightly ahead of another node because it saw later transactions before that other note did right and so you can imagine that this can be extremely problematic if two users are going to buy the same cryptokitty on different blocks one user isn't aware that it's already been purchased on a later block right so it's kind of a whole mess when it comes to actually providing correct data and this is this is a huge huge problem if you just throw a load balancer in front of a bunch of nodes you can cause data incorrectness and your users are not going to want to use your app if they're experiencing major data incorrectly um so those are the three key challenges when it comes to running nodes so what are we doing about it how are we actually helping to to solve these problems um and that's kind of where alchemy comes in right so when it comes to the node infrastructure issue optimus built out this sort of higher level of proprietary alchemy super node infrastructure um there's sort of a our simplified architecture diagram here i won't go into too much of the nitty gritty details about how supernode works but we were able to solve the node scalability issue able to solve the data incorrectness issue through this voting algorithm called voxody um and able to solve the reliability issue by already scaling up the infrastructure so that when you experience a huge influx of users you don't have to worry about uh going to spend more nodes our architecture can actually handle all the load in an instant so this has been absolutely pivotal to the success of many applications that are in the space today and i would say this is probably alchemy's like bread and butter product is the fact that we built out this super node that can tackle both of those really really core challenges when it comes to node infrastructure cool um obviously it doesn't just stop at node infrastructure uh developer tools what's the kind of other uh really core issue when it comes to blockchain development and that's where this whole suite of other tools comes in that alchemy is built out um the first of those tools is alchemy build um and so alchemy build is sort of a suite for debugging um and so allowing you to sort of dig into things that might be going on going on with your application so if i have a pending transaction that's taking too long we've built out this mempool visualizer within your dashboard so you can see a breakdown of your mind pending and drop transactions and debug them right then and there um we've also built out tools for you to search through historical requests so typically if you're running your nodes or using another kind of node provider um you you would have like maybe a log and you'd throw that in some data store of all of your historical requests we threw that in the front end and built a bunch of tools around it so you can actually see like a visual breakdown of what those requests look like and understand a little bit more why one might be failing um or or not failing um and there's also a tool to compose requests in the browser this one's super super cool um basically you can uh test out any lower level like blockchain request so for ethereum json rpc requests um you can test those directly from the browser and kind of play around with new methods and new parameters so you can quickly debug and figure out what's going on um alchemy build sister product is known as alchemy monitor uh so this is a whole other screen developer tools um basically built around the idea of developers should know about issues before their users do right it's a very an ideal world like there wouldn't be any user complaints we would get kind of notified about any issues that happen and then fix it before our users are even aware of it and that's sort of the impetus behind alchemy monitor um so these sort these uh these sort of tools um break down in a couple of things one is just kind of performance and user insight so we can show you kind of requests uh by area um this is all anonymized data um we can give you kind of loose usage analytics on different applications um and then obviously like health alert so let's say you're seeing like a huge increase in field requests will ping you and let you know like hey there's a big increase here and you can kind of see a filtered down view of what this failing request might be and why dig into it a little bit more um so it pairs really really well with ultimate build which allows you to actually go and fix those issues cool the third of our kind of core products earliest force um is alchemy notify um an academy notify uh was sort of revolutionary in that it and it kind of brought an experience that we know and love in the web 2 world to web 3. so notifications are something that i know we're all very very used to and very accustomed to when it comes to using applications um to be concrete like we're not over here like scroll like refreshing our emails every single day to see if an email is coming in right we get pinged we get a notification hey you got an email and then we go and check it that same experience doesn't really exist in web3 right now and that was why we built out alpha me notify so this is really to add notifications built into your product both for your developers so notifications for your edge team to say hey this this transaction got dropped like you should look into it or maybe something's uh with gas price you can understand it better and then also for your users notifications obviously drive engagement to your application um so letting your user know about their transaction status and pinging them instead of having them like kind of guess and check and wait until that transaction lands so this is a really important tool just to sort of bring web web 3 applications a lot closer to the state of web 2 applications cool um the second last product uh we have is our enhanced api suite and our enhanced api suite is basically a suite of apis that is um was built on top of the lower level json rpc to track away from those um like nitty gritty uh calls so i'll give you one concrete example probably our most popular enhanced api that we built out is the uh full transaction history it's called the transfers api um and basically what this allows you to do is with one request you can input a user address um and get their full transaction history i mean alchemy has free archive access those who don't know archive is like data since genesis so since block zero we offer all that data for free um and so with the transfers api you can get basically a full historical picture of what a user's transaction activity is is and how many kind of transactions they've made and what those are um and this if you would otherwise do it you would have to parse block by block and look for transactions within that match the user address and do that from like now until genesis so it would have been just like a huge engineering effort probably very very expensive probably very very time consuming and now you can get all that information in one call so there are a couple of other apis that fall into this enhance api suite that um also reduce obviously end work and time but in general enhanced apis are just built to like look like you don't need to just have these lower level json rpc methods you can actually abstract some of that away for very common things and avoid having to build in like custom in-house infrastructure um sweet the last of our products that we offer is alchemy amplify one of my personal favorites actually um co-founded this with my co-workers paul um and amplify is basically you're going to go to launch partner for web3 products so we found we talked to a lot of developers every day a lot of teams and what we found was um a lot of people building in the web3 space are just a handful of developers like hacking away and an awesome project but they might not have the time energy or resources to actually distribute their product to the wider world um and so that's what alchemy amplified was built for we're like hey a lot of people are building on us and um need help with their kind of like go to market strategy and so we're going to go in and help them with that so these are things like the certified infrastructure alliance program project spotlights social media amplification and in fact if you got people who end up building with alchemy for this hackathon if you just tag out me platform and twitter and tweet about your project we'd be more than happy to kind of go deeper with you we'll retweet your tweet um and even kind of do like uh some sort of spotlight um so yeah totally everything around just sort of like amplifying people who are building with alchemy and and making sure their products get visibility cool um one other thing to note uh we are multi chain so um ethereum obviously is one of the bigger ecosystems when it comes to developers we also offer a product on polygon arbitrarium crypto.org optimism and flow and there are more chains obviously that we're working on as well um so some quick stats about alchemy so in the ethereum space we power some of the top companies um these are in all different verticals from uh decentralized finance like yearn the ydx ave um to uh nfts nfcs like openc um dapper and then also infrastructure uh like the graph so a whole host of different verticals um powering a lot of a lot of big big names in the space um we do about 30 billion dollars in entrance i think it's over 30 billion now on train transaction volume annually tens of millions of end users and in majority of the countries worldwide we also power all major nft platforms um a lot of people using us use us for energy use cases um and so just a bunch of nft marketplaces as well um so real quick for you guys um next steps right so i just kind of went through all these tools i know kind of just brain dumped on you a bunch of stuff that acme can help you with what are some concrete next steps for you to kind of get started as a new developer one thing that's been really really popular recently is just creating an nft um so this is one of our most most popular tutorials on our site it's just the raw like how do you create an nft um i think it really gives you really really good fundamentals about how erc 721s work how smart contracts work how kind of the blockchain in general works um and this tutorial was specifically designed for beginners so like excuse me we have people doing it who just have absolutely no developer experience not even web 2 and they're able to complete this tutorial and deploy nft so if you're interested in nfcs we definitely recommend kind of starting here um if you want to take it up a level we also have a guide on how to create an nft mentor website um so if you want to create an actual website that users can engage with and users can mint uh their own nfts um or you can mint them for them whatever that might look like we have a tutorial for doing that or if you want to take a step back and get to like more like core fundamentals and sort of understand solidity in the most kind of simplest way we have a hello world smart contract that you can tackle um on our tutorial as well again all of these things are designed for beginners we want to make this as easy of an entry point into the web 3 space as possible and provide you with all the tools you need i would highly recommend visiting our box and checking out some of the tutorials if you want inspiration or to understand fundamentals a bit better um a couple more resources our website acme.com um discord for you at auckland.com just either in our docs at stocks.com um this should provide you with plenty of starting points uh to get going building monopoly um yeah and that's that's sort of all i have for you today uh we can jump into questions too yeah all right i had a question she's pretty curious um like as i as someone who's pretty new to the space i've also seen like inferior a lot of people use inferior and this might be a hard question to answer because i think you went over a lot of different products but if from a high level like why would someone start building on alchemy versus like something like confura is there any yeah yeah i know that's that's a really good question um so i would say there are a couple reasons so one um infuria is is does kind of like the node infrastructure part of things right so they're like also like an endpoint that you can send queries to there's a a lot of really important key distinctions between our infrastructure and furas one being um i'm just gonna go back a few slides so the if it'll let me um yeah so one one being sort of this uh kind of load balancing scalability thing so we've we've built out this sort of like higher level infrastructure on top of the nodes it's not just like a load balancer behind in front of a bunch of nodes right um and fura has experience like i'm not trying to like  talk or anything but like there has been like data consistency issues on other node providers before um because they can't really solve this sort of data consistency issue when it comes to nodes b not being aware of the same blocks at the same time so i said that's like a really really big distinction there um the second thing is is just the whole suite of developer tools um we've built out like you know i know i went through a bunch of them but just base a bunch of developer tools um to support you in that process um and providers like infire or maybe some others don't have the same sort of suite thank you i appreciate that yeah yeah hi ellen uh this is sean um i had a question regarding uh you mentioned that alchemy could get you all the historical transactions right yeah i just wanted to confirm is that the get asset transfers and yep okay yeah so that's that's the get asset transfer uh endpoint and actually it it pairs really well with um the alchemy notify address activity web hooks so they're the same payload um and so if you want to get like historical transactions and pair that with um the latest transactions uh using notify those go really well together as well right cool yeah and another question i had was does uh alchemy nodes support graphql because i know for uh the go implementation of of the ethereum node they do have a graphql endpoint so i was wondering if alchemy will support that yeah that's a good question so we we don't currently support uh graphql it's definitely something that's been on our roadmap in the past um and i would love to kind of like talk in here about your use case um if you're up for it feel free to dm me on discord um it's just it's just my name um but yeah we don't we don't currently support that but happy to chat with you offline about ways and we can like support you in other ways okay for sure yeah thank you very much cool all right any any other questions there's one in the in the in the chat here which i'll just read out um it's from thomas can you use some some of the tooling for instance the super apis but while hosting your own node good question um no not at the moment so all of these sort of dashboard tools that we've built out for debugging and monitoring only function if you're using an alchemy endpoint right now that's a good idea i we wouldn't we haven't like talked about that in past and wait for you to like kind of plug in your own endpoint and take advantage of the tools um so the short answer is no not at the moment but that is a cool idea and i'll definitely bring it up with the product too well cool all right that was a awesome presentation i'm glad everybody um had a chance to ask questions um obviously you can reach out directly to elon on their discord and alchemy there's also a discord for the purposes of the hackathon so you can go to the ethon line they have a channel there too um thanks everyone this this will be posted on the um the eath global youtube so if any if you missed the beginning of it or any parts of it you can get it there and at that i will thank you elon for a great presentation and see everyone uh later awesome thank you
