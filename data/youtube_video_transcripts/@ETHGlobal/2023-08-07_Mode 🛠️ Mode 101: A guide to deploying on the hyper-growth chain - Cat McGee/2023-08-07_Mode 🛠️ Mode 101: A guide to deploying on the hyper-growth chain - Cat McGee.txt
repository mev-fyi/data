foreign [Music] and welcome to the super hack mode Workshop mode 101 a guide to deploying on the hyper growth chain joining us today is Kat McGee who will be taking us through this session and with that I'll pass over to Kat to get the session started hey everybody very very excited to be here this is actually super special so I Adat Island developer relations engineer and today I'm going to miss talking to an introducing for the very first time love um I say first line but why I even still in South Road right now they were like in hot South um so listen Black Version like introduction to the world unbelievable pretty Global for a very long time and it just made sense versus jumble on the super hot and talk with all these amazing bathrooms and partners we are able to um op stack so just make a little sense for us and it's very very exciting so a little bit about the hyper growth Channel actually mean um we have noticed you know there are more years and blocked in that there's kind of one big issue with it and there's a ton of like belt race like building and fun projects but actually growing those projects with the pin it's difficult to do and you know turning really good code a really good type into businesses is something that we haven't quite built in Boston yet so the point offsets L2 it kind of Standards to a few different things we've got Technology based right into the protocol level that's going to really incentivize how growth mechanics and hot kpis about everything that you need to just develop like a working competition that's going to get users you guys focus on the code and then this kind of does all the business stuff for you and then also on the other side we're really focused on just growing in ecosystem Denver in the community you know this this was built by like people who've been actually building hundreds of blockchain projects for about seven years or something so we want to support developers into doing this and we have that side as well so it's both kind of the technology and then the ecosystem really good like people so why both so we're kind of trying to build this like whole big incentivized system that isn't just the idea of watching but actually it's like on the protocol layer unable to stand on a community so the way that we're doing that is through loads with different features but these are just some examples that we are working on for me and not at the moment so we have contracts the good Revenue so any developer who publishes a smart contract is gonna actually get some fees from the transactions that go through to the floor come try and this is something that we really feel that's just going to instead of Iceland you don't have to think about how you're going to make money your contracts tend to make money for you immediately without any sort of extra stuff out into it you just have to grow that energy then there's like referral revenues this is the Hulk one of the ecosystem the community working together so like anyone who repairs and developers new users new protocols is going to get a share of the transaction fee Revenue onto that as well so that's just like you know this group of ecosystem gonna simplifies people very exciting and then there's also this dashboard and tooling and this is honestly what I think is the most exciting part of my world in that developers can just like we can forget about all the marketing stuff because I'll bring it forward and like real stuff and kpis like you know what kind of stuff do you have to give to PCS to get money it's all it's all I'm gonna be any of that there's gonna be chills and stuff in there and you can just focus on building what you're building I understand like where I would become a better for you which is I say probably it doesn't say anything about it so today um okay there's one over three like a deployment guide It's just with even you have Jane so it's very very good to do just like any other EPF gin I think operator than just probably the workshop there and he explained hi this is gonna work and it's yeah extra stuff because we are like of Ron moochin still in stealth mode so first thing we gotta do is obviously super simple we're actually unless we are 10 ID 919 so just head on to channel list and go to mode we also just type in node instead of doing which like um and then you get that's mad mask if you wanted to manually if you want to do it for whatever reason you can find all the information you need for adding it to another inner docs doc stop mode.network there's some other resources and stuff there too for this like deployment guide then however it works and we'll point it and everything there too if you want to like some more information after that we can need to get to pull you don't have a closet yeah on Road so we only have a bridge so if you just get the pulley we also have some we can send it to you just met the stress on the Discord um or you can use this faucet if possible by alchemeads believeth.com after that fridge after that you bridge the pullia to mode so just sprayed that really.network super easy to use um plug in how much you want to you want to Bridge Over make sure you are connected with your Sequoia here I am metamath and then we got also send to some as well she didn't want to go through this process just send a message on choir mode on Discord and we'll DM you and figure that out and get you some mode so for deploying it's just the same with anything else all you have to do is put us into your config file so pretty much you know obviously super simple as long as you're connected to load onto the UMass you just record using using metamask and you can get your contact remote hard hat AdWords new heart vacuum big trouble add more to jump nothing big same as anything we also have a guide online for third web um we'll record kitty clothing with them and we think they are just rotten or getting stuff off and running so do you want to use third one or any sort of other tool just go onto your doctor and be able to see like a really easy guide for that um and yeah you just have to generate the hiking for them with that was reading the message yeah wake them mode Network logged in and then you're sorted so this is a pretty sore presentation I just kind of wanted to introduce both um so the world which is like we're starting but we are offering 10 fiberian USD at the soccer ball to some really cool Milwaukee projects you just want you to build like cool stuff so we're about 3K given the best overall that can be in any theme anything like this is gonna you know blow people away so that's that's 3K for that 2K basketball virtual super important because we want to be building up an amazing developerating system and user ecosystem 2K for Bad season they are AI I think it's going to be a pretty huge theme of this hackathon seeing some of the other prizes as well so this could be as well and anything your heart desires for AI and just want to see it integrated pretty well and then we have two kids because they love some weird idea I work Friday for this too so anything that you injury while I'm probably shouldn't be ill is build it we just want to see like weird stuff crazy stuff stuff that you you know maybe shouldn't look at this but we want to make it exist so possibly for that too just be crazy making beans like do whatever you want something that you've maybe thought of like that's because I did just build it we want to see that and then one came to press tool you can see how to write qualify for that online basically any project doesn't win any of the other projectors deploy under you're going to be eligible for the price book so some ideas um since we are a new Shin we're pretty much impressing with like anything we have not much so far like deployed onto though so we're looking for anything anything you want to build like it's gonna be super awesome but these are some of the ideas the US and the team are just like super into it so obviously introduction about the projects and we want to get crossed in it's an Oracles in there I get some like queries the graph maybe in a little sponsoring um the stomach some interesting things there like this other change we don't have a gallon vote so that would be so so awkward just to build the secret system identity system as well is going to be really important for modes um in that as well because we're doing this like reputation for thin um referral assistant and Hollywood weekend or like actually have like in several resistance that might have to date on that chin the soft day for that would be like super interesting and something really neat data initialization so obviously we are working on dashboard so we do have some like protocol level visualization but just more and more is obviously good instead of any sort of blockchain visualization chills it looks awesome what we wanted to just be attract users and stuff love that kind of stuff um do you simplifies exchanging you know user Focus kind of stuff like that Innovative D5 as well so step that's also crazy like there's so much you could do in D5 be creatively be weird and be wacky with it um get some weird D5 project I think that'd be really cool you also maybe integrate AI to that just some user-friendly D5 could be interesting um car distraction anything of course maybe like an AAA wallet or modes I mean it's like theme bathroom can be really really cool um that's like also probably a pretty huge theme of attack of them then just like we love games as well I know the team has like built a kind of blockchains and stuff and that's something I know we're sprinting that's something that actually utilizers blocked in and a game pretty well and it's just like weird and crazy you just thought of the game that nowhere we're gonna play that you think it's funny and like give it a go or there's like Instagram ads we always see they're just like weird games they're funny let's just spill that you know build whatever you want but we love games um it's honored ideas for the AI private party AI nfts like we've seen AI um integrated like really well into like previous Global hacks and people like crazy stuff with it like you can just talk very much in or you could use AI to do swap some stuff you'll see products like that they're awesome I haven't seen anything that actually like combines Ai and I'm getting cute I think that's like a really cool use case so something that goes like creatively would be really plural um AI for gas production as well you could maybe like combine this with a kind abstraction you know if you submit transaction with the chin it like that's the chin it's like okay everyone's gonna be cheapest if we do this one 20 minutes instead of nine so maybe you can like just load it and then it kind of starts over to the chin or something it's cool so tons of ideas we're also interested in ZK didn't want to put it here because I don't think there's anything protocols actually sponsoring super hot but having anything to do with privacy or demos groups on well it would be that's it um we suddenly wanted stress as well is that like because we're all about Admiral developers being entrepreneurs and really like build a secret system up and because we are still very early stages of mode we want to keep working with you we want to turn me into entrepreneurs we want to make your projects accessible I think that's just that we're going to be like offering Grouse to Austin products and built here you guys are going to be the first people to go through our grout systems that's really really exciting um so if you're interested in that when you're submitting a project into each Global you'll be able to like click pick a box that says we're interested in advance so just make sure you check that if you're interested in most reaching out to you um because we really want to get some like awesome developers building off some stuff long mode uh that is it so a lot of time here um most important is to enjoy the hackathon we are at apartment Road on Discord and the global Discord come and say hi we're always there even if you're not like hot in London where we just say hi everyone for you anyway um so yeah if anyone's got any questions soon chat is open feel free to send some stuff it's there otherwise I think this was pretty short awesome cheers thank you yeah if anybody has any questions feel free to top them in the chat or take yourself off mute oh and ask away and if there are no questions then yeah as CAD said definitely reach out to uh the team on the Discord Channel um they will be there and happy to assist as you all progress through the hackathon over the next couple of days um but yeah I I think that's it so yeah thanks thanks cat thanks for the great workshop and presentation um and uh yeah thank you all everybody else for attending have a great rest of your Friday and have a great weekend and happy hacking thanks darling cheers thank you we'll see you all on the Discord bye everyone
