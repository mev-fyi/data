add your name to the bottom of the list if you haven't already and your project um what else um hold your i guess bold your name if it's already there so we know you're here um looks like we don't have a ton of people so we're not super pressed for time but still we want to make sure that we get to everybody how does it look andrew we're good cool um let's see the only person i see here that's on this list is tyrone how's it going yeah team parcel yeah hey guys um uh can we go yeah sure oh yeah so as we got the previous feedback uh regarding integrating aragon and seeing what components of aragon we could integrate so uh we did have a look and and uh uh it's really it's really great that we could possibly integrate a lot of components from there because they're essentially making those and they had multicomponents as well but but the problem lies in the fact that uh it's it consumes a lot of gas because uh so i tried to deploy and and play with aragon and it costs seven million gas for uh deploying uh or an organization so i think that's that's a big concentration that we had to take apart from that i think what they're doing is they're essentially storing a lot of information on smart contracts and that's one thing that we want to avoid and store everything on ipfs uh and just uh make generic functions on on smart contracts that could possibly save a lot of gas for for the users and us yeah so for that particular reason uh we skipped aragon and tried to build our own contracts and we are we have made the initial set of smart contracts already so i think we're on the right path and so we finalized the architecture as well so the architectural flow would look like this where all the data is uh stored on ipfs and we are creating a mapping of of of the index and the corresponding uh hash that that we get from ipfs so we're just storing when when the user updates any kind of information on ipfs we just update the mapping and if you want to fetch the data we refresh the data through that index so we're creating like master files so let's suppose if there's a there's a file for payslips we don't store uh individual payslips of employees we just have a masterfly file of payslips and then uh fest have have the nested data over there and store the index of that master file uh and that and then save it to the smart contract so that it's easier to manage uh all the information in one go uh yeah so i i think uh we're good we're good with that and we'll be building uh that during the weekend and also for the next week uh we'll be integrating mass payouts so we're integrating the market logic very very soon and also uh money stream yeah money streaming will also be integrating money money streaming soon through chapter i just wanted to share the updates and get some feedback very cool sounds like a like a really good direction um do you have like a like a demo that you can show us that that's easy or i don't know so uh yeah we just we just you know planned to showcase the demo today but we just misunderstood like we thought the feedback is around 1am uh and and like night so we just got to know like in half an hour making our milestones uh on this feedback call so so we're up for feedbacks at the right times but i think we misunderstood the timings a little bit yeah no no no no worries at all um i'm just uh i was just curious if you if you happen because um do you have any questions that we can help with i mean all of what you said sounds really good uh all of that sounds like a good direction to me um any anything any questions that you that you have that we might be able to help with um i think like five one team already helped us a lot like deciding the architecture so we're pretty much like good cool sounds good good yeah it looks sounds really promising like looking forward to the to the to checking it out checking out the demo and playing around with it yeah i think next week uh we're definitely going to be shifting to if you have a demo please bring it um and hopefully we communicate the feedback time a little bit better um if that was on our end sorry um yeah we were just switching up the timing for people in different time zones i know there's at least one other team that's trying to get in so i'm just running around in the background trying to get them um brahma did you want to share something about your project maybe demo a little bit if you have a demo i have it no i i don't have it i mean we have something but uh i i can't demo that now okay i mean if you're just here to listen that's fine as well uh yeah don't i don't mean to put you on the spot that's okay it's all right uh looks like we had some new joiners josef and james yeah hey guys i'm yousef hey how's it going man i'm good thank you guys thank you so much for this opportunity and this amazing event and i love the hockey fest man and you did some good job man pretty neat yeah thank you thank you very much seeing you sorry i don't have a camera but i mean in this era it's very good to see people and talking with other people and thank you so much yeah all right we're glad to be hosting the event as well it's been amazing so far so good yeah do you do you want to share anything about what you're building so yeah i'm working with the two like two persons one on their project i joined their project and another one i can't join because i can only join one project so first one is like where like we're trying different bounties so text textile so yesterday we did textile we worked through all the creeds and buckets so we got a main mvp like insurance car insurance app which is a small car insurance app where you can all the evidences and all the stuff there and we just got from andrew access to power gauge and that's good that's a good change and next step we'll try to do the install public domains the the chat app which is a big bounty for the four thousand four thousand dollars that's a good one and there is a yeah i think there is the older ones like uh the three box which is a smaller smaller one and other one i just don't remember flick yeah so yeah so we're trying to like to do three or four bounces at least short time but yeah it's like crazy time but it's like the deadline is very close you can just like keep going but i'm logging next time chatting you um i'm going to move from firebase firestore and use text style because i think it's so good and it has the link with five coin and you have all that and like it's so smooth and i think that's the future like there is a good like a good uh good like uh future for this i love it so yeah and for the other chains i think so we are going to do the other ones ens for sure even its small one flick which is pretty good but i think they are going to split like 100 do you do you have any questions about trying to integrate all these things together um yeah heads down sure for sure i'm trying i have many questions for the podcast we just got access but we wanna leverage that and use it as much as we can using like making some good features even if we have a tight deadline but that's good for the the thing i think which is protocol lab bounties are pretty awesome but i just literally have some questions because the top track prices there is like eight categories the five data set the choose video and so on so is it like something we have to make a small app for this bounty or do we make and like are we like can we just make all the apps for all the bounces and we are partners well i mean um we're going to consider the we're going to consider the submissions um kind of against the categories and we're going to pick like the like the best that we see in that in each of those categories in terms of like you might be asking if you can submit multiple apps i don't know about that uh you can uh trent you it's gonna respond again so the way it's gonna work for those categories is that when you go to submit your app in two weeks you get to specify that you are eligible for one of these eight categories which means if you're working on an app that's about audio or large data sets or defy or you get to choose that and uh if you do then you'll be included as part of the list and the protocol labs team will kind of get a list of all those categories and they'll pick the best project out of that but it's not really a separate prize it's just another thing you can win for being the best app or best submission for a given category mostly sure yeah sure and uh for video do you mean like we can make something like a social video like i don't know social video app or something or audio you are using filecoin or something like that i mean it's it's uh it's very broadly defined so in the category is supposed to sort of imply that your your submission or your hack is going to be uh dealing with that specific topic so for video like you could have done like a video social network but or if you want to do a video streaming website that also counts if you wanted to do a a website that processes large videos and you have a video editor that's also like that part of a podcast podcast for example exactly so there's no i mean we can we can actually try to specify that and clarify that in the descriptions but if you think that what your project is doing it includes video processing or audio then you're eligible for that category awesome yeah and what's about the 30k storage you can so yeah what's about the 30k winter price i yeah so after judging uh happens for all the projects the top teams will be sharing that price so it's not a specific thing it's just the best of all these submissions awesome and what can we do too to be like one of the top chosen well the the quick answer on that is uh you uh make a really awesome video that explains what you're doing and how it works with fall coin or ethereum or both and tell everybody why uh you decided to build this thing and how awesome your demo is so artisable will determine that but it's really up to you to kind of make sure that the video you're going to submit for this really conveys the importance of this app and a really good demo that everybody can can look at and understand what you're trying to do awesome love it yeah yeah make it make the make the best project yeah personally i'm afraid to amaze you here so i'm just trying to get some tricks and tips here so yeah i think that's the best the best guidelines is make the best project and yeah that's it when you win everything that's uh very broad was quick like that's good yeah awesome yeah so i advise you to make something unique uploading do we need like to buy some file coin tokens or no it's in a test net so you should be able to just uh it's just the test net so you can get some pokemon from the faucet yeah awesome so i think we uh we got a few more people joining and uh teams that uh submitted the forum to feedback i i think we should yeah um morgan can you mute or just um it looks like the session might not go for the full time so if you were planning to like drop out and jump back in um it might be better if you go now um do you want to tell me what your limitations are yeah no i'm here i can speak um yeah we were gonna i was gonna have yoga next but if you have like some sort of time limitation we can we can have you go first oh no that's okay yeah i can go yeah okay take it away yeah okay okay anyone everyone can hear me right that's good so uh thank you guys first time on this call ever i don't know why i missed the first two one but uh really excited to be here with you guys and uh finally feel a little bit more connected with you guys now that i can see your face so um a little bit about our backgrounds and then i can talk about i will also talk about this month what we are focusing on specifically for this project so in the past six months we have a small team uh three person building a decentralized online community platform so basically it's a decentralized forms so um if any of you old enough to be in the 2000 or 1995 you remember the news groups the ntp portal codes that kind of stuff so um and uh we always think about why it doesn't it it doesn't last as long as the email protocol and there's a there's a lot of reason because of um for people actually hosting the content uh the isp actually responsible for hosting the pornographies from and the fbi called them and they finally they have to shut it down and then become no more providers hosting those content so um and and then we become a web 1.0 2.0 and now 3.0 i think that this is finally a moment for us to build something similar to uh 20 years ago which is a lot of freedom a lot of peer-to-peer spirit and and that's what we built so we built a very similar user interface as facebook groups however the the content uh restore is actually stored in ipfs so all the posts all the um community metadata are stored in ipfs in real time and um and then um so we launched that product uh last month and then we are thinking about what we can do a little bit more uh for the crypto communities in general so um and we and then we saw this um hackathon and we decided to build a and extensions not just for every photo but also an extensions for other traditional community system like uh we built 10 or php bb those kind of old-fashioned form system and empowering the community owners of those system and also for forms obviously to to create their own branded token to create their own yeah she's trying to bring up token easily so you emphasis a lot on ease of use a good interface um just like facebook groups that allow people who doesn't really have any crypto background to actually create their own brand token so not only for the creation but also we uh help the community owners to to define a lot of rules for them to to empower them to define rules to how they wanted to reward their members so basically we build a reward engines in a sense that commodity owners can define what uh the amount and also and when the user can receive that amount when they do something for example if the discussion has which 100 response then they can get some tokens from the committee owners so um so we figured that this is probably what we can do within one month and but in addition to that we also support allowing communities to actually import existing any erc training tokens to use for their communities so for example think about you you're actually a crypto team you you wanted to create on token but also you wanted to use existing token um that might be more appropriate for your community so that that's flexible as well so this is what we thinking we can do in in four weeks and and now i know that it's already on the third week um um i think we are getting pretty close and we are able to to have a demo by the end of the four weeks so we are pretty excited and um we wanted to be uh have ipfs to be the backend of a decentralized forms we wanted the token to be able to be what members and also um can be used as a governance purpose so people can you can select moderators by sticking your token that kind of thing so that that's what we wanted to build it's awesome that's really cool sounds great yeah i guess where are you now with the the progress you've made so far um we are we finally had all the back end script and the smart contract done for the yasi training token creations um obviously that are not a rocket science everyone with the cryptos background can do it but what you need for us is actually build the front end that can connect to it and make it easier for forum owners to understand and not only to to create it but also let them to define rules to to drop the token to their members so um i think that's the fun part and uh we did finish all the script all the airdrop scripts um or the um smart contract creation script um i know that we are paying 50 cents per token creations on behalf of the foreign owners for now but i guess that's okay and um i i think we are pretty good progress i guess the back end is pretty much done but more about perfecting the front end that is actually usable for phone owners okay and uh just so i understand will this kind of work with existing forum software like i mean php you talked about like are you playing and integrating that on just the the token part in the like the payment side of this or for the community members or is it an alternative also to uh a link here to uh to one of these toppers yes um initially obviously we're gonna be building extensions uh we would make it first to work with our own platform which is built on ipfs which makes sense because we are sort of uh focusing on the crypto communities um but what the way we build it the way we package it is it could become a plug-in for the third-party form systems so in a sense that you know there's a plug-in it's pretty pretty common on on a lot of form system so we we will build similar plug-ins for them and we can repack we package that but i know there's a lot of technical hurdles and as especially a lot of concerns from the phone owners about um whether they have to download our apps to to to receive our token and that kind of stuff so i don't think we have that kind of time within a month to handle all that stuff but we wanted to create a reference implementation that works in our platform and and it will be open source obviously we put it on the github already if you have access to it you can take a look and hopefully we can repackage it so that it will work on amount of different form system out there that's great i just looked at the link uh of your website and i see the demo it's pretty awesome great so yeah you said that you can integrate previously existing erc20s how do you what does that look like how do you connect in previously existing contract to your reward mechanisms um obviously if it already exists with like mint and burn mechanisms how do you actually handle that on your back end we don't actually handle that we just give it a way for for owners to to to transfer attribute amount of token into our platforms okay so so we become holding the tokens on behalf of the formulas so and then whenever users uh receive the token they they will get it in our platform as well so there's no gas or no fee until they decided to move the token away from our platform to their own wallet so that make it easier and low cost for people to transfer token within our platform so so there's some trust involved on that but it's also very flexible in a way that it doesn't really create any gas any fee and superfans um so yeah so that that's so so you're it so you're effectively custodial for just to avoid the headaches of these communities having to do key management and things like that yeah yeah so because we figured that they they would never really i mean at least initially um they they would hesitate to manage their private keys but we do have the option for them for us to transfer the the creation perfect key the ownerships back to them so you have a transfer feature that they can transfer it back to them basically create a new one and let me just bring another one um but the smart contract created by us will always have our ffo team signature to it so that we sort of can can promote what we're doing i guess um so yeah is this all on main chain or do you have any sort of uh off chain given that it's custodial it's it's off-chain actually right now it's just a simple database um not really safe to be honest with you um but um but we're getting there once we figure out the model that has a good balance between non-crypto phone owners and long term yeah in the next few months i i am pretty confident there will be uh layer two side chains and and roll ups that are coming online that can support this kind of high throughput social social platform type things gaming um should check out matic m-a-t-i-c if you've heard of it they could they're doing a lot of onboarding with games and different platforms like that that maybe would be a good fit um yeah yeah because right now if you're a custodial you're not hosting the content but you're in the same position as the reason that these uh forums in the 90s went down is because they're hosting illegal content do you see any parallel to you hosting uh like value from people who are doing illegal activities if this is all custodial okay um i i don't can you repeat your last question sorry my son just ended the room no worries i was just saying like um if it's custodial are you worried at all about like hosting the funds for um any forms or groups that are you're not holding the content necessarily but you're you're holding funds for groups that might be doing something illegal right right yeah i think i hope that the the the two the uth2 evm2 can solve some of that issues um i mean the reason that we hold it is just because we at this early stage we wanted to be as fast and as free as possible so that's the only way to do it within the communities and um i mean and however we also have ability for for people to transfer also um but i've i know i know that there's a limitation but with i mean as soon as there is a appropriate framework or technology can allow us to not to do it then we will definitely remove it i mean it's definitely definitely outside of the scope of this next few weeks thanks thanks for sharing um it's a great concept and your site looks really good so thank you i'll be curious to poke around all right all right i think we could move on to morgan if you're ready i'm ready to hear me a little quiet how about now a little better yeah should be fine okay uh so the project is called weflow can you still hear me yeah okay um the general the general concept is that uh looking at falcoin i'm really impressed with the fact that you know you have this global efficient data access where you can write and read in a very efficient way and i think it's an interesting concept to try to model cognition for agents acting in their environment whether they're moving around and need to access uh certain things whether it's a whether it's a car or a person or a robot or something like that so my main goal with this project was to focus on the learning outcomes that might come with thinking about how data is written to in sort of a hierarchical way so the pitch is that can you construct local environments to capture sort of mass forms of these data views that are kind of like a a more more like engagement with brain computer interfaces so for example um if you think about a person moving around in an environment a person in a very abstract form has sort of like an aura or a very simple waveform to them and that doesn't necessarily say who they are or what like what they look like or even the the words that they have uh as sort of uh parts of their their truth function um but it's sort of like a an interesting view into that person and and how they might interact with their environment and then you can kind of go down the resolution uh and dig deeper into okay well that person with this wave waveform has sort of attributes or tokens or descriptors to them that might represent who they are um then sort of adding another layer is like okay well that person has uh sort of like a journal or or words that describe them so it's like thinking about a hierarchy of of this type of data structure uh that might be put into file coin through let's say something like the powergate interface um so yeah that's that's sort of the the general concept and and then asking the question it's like well why would we want this well it could be an interesting social experiment as it relates to like how do we iteratively test whether or not brain computer interfaces should be something that should be used in the future um and working on models that are kind of like in between uh let's say physical environments versus digital environments because right now these two are very separate like we construct these video games that are completely virtual and people spend hours in them and then come back into the physical world and then you know they they might have let's say like issues socially or so or something like that so can we find this common ground between you know the the physical world and the digital world that might be a better uh i guess like ramping function for um possible brain computer interface uh modes um and i think that this type of data input could be an interesting aspect into aspects like ecological psychology or or things like the way that you know people move around in in certain environments and it might play into aspects like longevity and mental health um yeah so that's sort of the general concept i haven't actually implemented anything yet but the the the the focus was to think about the the data structure that's behind it possible is that then one might interact with let's say um you know thinking about a group of of people as a quote unquote state and then thinking about their their auras as like a network of interactions uh that you can view if you wanted to as an audience and then finally thinking about the crypto layer would be say okay well if i'm a person that wants to interact with this environment or this this sort of like network of um auras or or like hierarchy of data structure i can pay to see sort of more resolution so you know maybe i can if i'm looking at this this environment of of of these auras of of people quote-unquote um that might not give me a lot of context but i might start picking up on patterns and say oh well that's that's interesting like i i see this blue and this this green aura interacting with each other um i can pay a subscription to to see their sort of journal as a way to better interact with this social network and um yeah that's sort of a quick question sure yeah so maybe i missed it at the beginning but can you tell me uh how are you getting data into this um have you spec that out or written anything about how data gets into what you're describing uh so you mean like the actual uh a hardware device or something like that um sure yeah it could let's start there is it are you actually planning to experiment with uh an interface like that uh so i do i do have access to a simple interface that that is the brain computer interface to um it's not the focus but i do have access to one to uh to input that into just a sort of like web browser um and the next step would be to experiment with with like let's say more people in in this concept um but yeah the the it would be to use a uh a brain computer interface that uh i would source from somebody else okay um what would you say is your in when you're submitting this in a few weeks what would you say is your goal for the submission what do you want to have framed out yeah so the the main goal is to [Music] create a useful hierarchy for the interaction with the falcoin uh powergate project or just the powergate interface i think that would be useful not just in this context but in other contexts like by bio health and other things like that and then using that as sort of like a i guess i'd describe it as like what might a a neural economy look like in the future if we're starting with these like base data streams that are that are from brain computer interfaces into sort of more higher resolution uh social interactions that could be modeled in in let's say uh a market of people that are interested in these these uh in contributing to this globe global network um so i guess like to answer your question about base case it's like just sort of an input layer a view layer uh and then some sort of crypto subscription layer is that like your end goal or something that you hope to get done uh in the ideal case the uh hope to get done in the next couple weeks the ideal case would be uh using this as sort of like a you know how can we experiment with uh brain computer interfaces from what we have now which are just external to to the body um and thinking about uh yeah i guess okay i guess yeah i was just curious um juan or kartik do you wanna i'll pass it over to you because i know i've been talking quite a bit any questions or suggestions yeah i mean i think that's a super cool idea like i'm not sure what um you mean by like i guess men i don't know which specific pci you're talking about because there's a couple um i guess public ones that have a good apis like i used to have one called the muse but it's not really uh there yet for uh or at least the one i had was in there yet and in that version to uh to kind of let you do what you're trying to do so i guess my biggest question here is like how do you actually properly fingerprint a person um if if the goal is to kind of rely on those like data waves i assume is or beta waves here um because it seems like you're you're kind of biggest one will be tying that identity and then you can already acknowledge that because you want to if you want to get two people or multiple people up in there how do you know which party is the one behaving or kind of just acting but uh it'll be super cool to kind of have something like this thing i i like i just think that's a super interesting idea but i i'd be more interested in understanding like how would you think about the fingerprinting here yeah so uh the cup the concept i i would focus on is not necessarily about fingerprinting from uh let's say brain brain waves like the the device i have is purely just a uh a single source of just an individual porn for the brain that doesn't give you a unique um signature at all it's just more like you know what is what is the frequency of of your uh i see the blood flow in a certain part i think what this can turn more into is uh sort of a social network around mindfulness and uh people that are focused on being in these states uh that are not necessarily living together but also living across across the internet um it's sort of like a um yeah that's sort of a second aspect that i don't necessarily want to you know it's i think right now the focus is to kind of get a hello world out there that that integrates things together that can explore the concept and and then can build sort of like okay well what can this it solves the problem of of the input and processing and the output layer a simple action could be just group meditation and i think that's a could be a really powerful thing and sort of like new age religion movements but uh i don't think that this is yeah it's like who knows what could be used for oh it's super interesting so i i guess maybe are there any specific things like we can help you with to uh kind of get the initial demo up and running um i i haven't actually played around with with any of the code interfaces yet um to get a to get a demo up and running uh i don't know there's i was trying to reach out to us a person to see if they wanted to join the team but they wasn't responding i don't know if there's if there's people that still don't have teams i would be open to um working with other people uh that'd be one aspect and i think i just need to spend a little more time focusing on sort of base case because i have sort of like a general abstract concept in my mind um for sure right we can uh i think trent can uh we can just take a note and see if there's a anyone else that is also still looking for another team member but uh yeah would be great to kind of know uh what you uh end up with uh for the base case sure is is there a additional feedback or uh in the next couple days or so we'll be having a few more next week um and yeah we're planning to have at least two or three next week but they'll be at the end of the week okay yeah definitely um in between now and then ask for feedback and drop things into slack that's where most of the hackers are hanging out and i know that's where the global team and protocol labs are so okay if you're looking for feedback there that's that's where you want to put stuff yeah i put some writing out onto a github that uh i i could have shared for this but i just thought i would just speak to what was top of mind that i thought might be important but um yeah that might be useful thank you okay cool thanks for sharing um we're gonna move on to let's see who else uh we've got a couple other people here jen you want to tell us about what yeah you want to tell us what you're building um what you hope to have in a few weeks and anything you need specific feedback on uh yeah let me just kind of get my notes open so i'm doing d web vr [Music] and essentially i'm thinking about um how to make uh a social network more accessible for people to build in by providing templates and guides and um i'll just uh kind of screen share my notes here just kind of so i did experiments back then with ipfs and ens to make virtual worlds with um so i've got a good handle on the tech stack like i set up uh hackerlab.eth a while ago and this was my previous kind of experiment foray into building a decentralized virtual world in your browser um wait for this to load but i'm i'm kind of thinking about you know how to make this easier so people can fork it and so you get your kind of home space here and there's all sorts of gizmos and gadgets uh a start page so i'm thinking in terms of the onboarding it's gonna start off like this the 2d page that takes you then into the 3d page and then there's different 3d pages so instead of just this world it can also be a crypto voxels world showcasing other experiments and stuff and then that door or this garage door can take you out i'm trying to build kind of like a sandbox so you can just start building stuff in there and saving it and then commit it to um the branch and maybe you can join up with other people but i want to kind of limit the scope so what i was thinking of doing is uh starting off with onboarding like making a really cool title screen that takes you into a 2d front uh start page so i've got uh some inspiration of start pages one i really like is web desktops um these are desktops that look like uh sorry these are websites that look like desktops um so i thought that was a really cool idea especially because on ipfs roadmap 2020 goals there's like web os and that was an interesting idea like okay what if web and os kind of combined and but this was just like a simple front-end concept so i've got some ideas doing that with the css doc and all that just you know kind of building the atmosphere of the virtual world um but what is the virtual world and you know how do we get the web 3 people and the vr people kind of aligned together so how do i make this kind of modular so i was thinking maybe an expo and so i've looked been looking at uh shell scheme booths and maybe these boots can represent um one for every uh category and what i've been doing in the background is just kind of building a uh kind of a data vis of these categories that's really cool yeah and i want to kind of create a memory palace so you can just kind of walk through the ipfs ecosystem like a uh like a video game um that that's so cool and you can spawn these in all sorts of places and then start to rearrange them so those are wall nodes and i can make floor nodes over here and just keep kind of customizing them and they're fully functional like you can launch this uh in your web browser um it's the actual website just kind of you know seeing what is out there in terms of tech right and then um so i was kind of uh thinking maybe i'll start there maybe uh everyone can have you know because it's it can be easy to decorate this right you just throw up a couple of image posters and um or maybe you can give a presentation so at lab day they did this uh really nice way of um formatting the archives and by recording uh presentations this way you could cut the videos uh separately and then spatialize them so that was uh really easy to then make into a uh kind of a hologram presenter i've got a demo here [Music] actually here's one with one oh wow that's in the archive that's amazing that's amazing yeah i've been uh open sourcing the internet archive uh virtual world as well um that's super yeah so if i record presentations in this kind of template you see i can key out the background and put it behind a podium and boom you've got like speakers so that's a kind of a cool way of doing vr um spatializing kind of uh the talks but also um it opens up an environment for kind of more social gatherings and but we might not always have the same setup you know of like a good lighting and a clear background you know so how can i make that easier so i've been messing with youtuber virtual youtuber software for creating kind of a green screen so this is my youtuber over here this is i'll just show you my obs template so i can record that same kind of setup over here in obs so if you wanna protect your privacy or if you wanna you know you're lazy and don't wanna get the right lighting and you know green screen is tough you gotta worry about shadows and wrinkles this isn't an easy way using open source software for recording a presentation as uh you can use any character honestly i just chose this but you can import a avatar file through here and i'll just load that up here's my chef for teaching 3d scanning in the future so i was like okay maybe i'll make like a uh if i were to go with this idea there can be expos and then there can be speakers um so i'm thinking um and maybe the the the world is kind of modeled or inspired by harry potter worlds because like why do you want to make uh a virtual classroom look like classroom it's vr you know let's make it magical it's spatial um and i like it because uh in harry potter worlds they have small class sizes and big tall ceilings um it feels right so and it's also pretty hype you know um so i'm thinking uh for my project start page that takes you into a number of options you know uh you can go into the expo world you can check out a schedule of events i want to kind of um just have like basically a front end i i'm probably gonna change the navbar to look more like a you know um launcher like on linux or windows you have the start button or something the css dock looks nice i'm not sure about the background over here i'll probably do something hack fs related neon grid or something but these icons will launch you into different experiences and they'll be some of them like the vr experience one will be hosted on unstoppable domains one will be ens and ipfs and just kind of you know trying it all outs and then throwing that all on the internets for everybody else to dig in and um kind of part proposal parts uh project because it's like we can make something really epic together use it as like a gathering space online um do tours through the you know the expo or uh build classrooms like proto school can have you know hologram teachers or yeah you could do workshops together like you know like you know go take a workshop together and uh everybody being the feelings yeah exactly because i mean physical events are it's hard to see them coming back with virtual events you know you could get a lot of participation and you can archive them in this way and have white boards and just a way for us people outside of the d-web community to um explore what d-web is about and for these mines to just cross pollinate and come up with ideas together this is really cool a ton of like really awesome ideas i really love how all the different different modalities that you're exploring a lot of really awesome stuff a couple couple ideas that are that uh as you're going through it um having the the old arcade style um uh machines i think is really cool and something you could do is you could take you could take a library of a bunch of games like normal um there's a ton of games out in the uh on the web so you could you could take a bunch of them and import them give them each their own website um they could be their own ipfs hash or or you could actually give them a name with with uh ens or supple domains or something and then you could you could have like a whole arcade um arcade room and it'd be really awesome if you could do like uh either at least streaming single player where like it you know if i go up to it and i start playing then somehow you if you're next to me you can see what i'm seeing so you can see me playing the game and so that would be kind of like screaming streaming the canvas of the of my browser um yeah uh i don't know if you like there's probably a few different approaches to how to do that but like that would be kind of really awesome because then you can you can have people crowding around and seeing people play the same game or you could have people playing the same game their own instance next to each other and then you can see kind of like both screens and you know you can play single player games competitively um now the real picture would be you know can you do a multiplayer game that way and that would be really really awesome like you could start throwing arcade parties right now where you could get everyone into this room have a room full of different games and then people can start playing multiplayer games with each other so uh i don't know this is this is really awesome i really love all the concepts and really like the the expo gallery i think that's a really phenomenal way to explore an ecosystem and explore ideas um and uh yeah this is this is great that game within a game concept was the original inspiration for that hacker space where you could play like you can you and your friends can each have a full screen um of any web game i use crypto voxels in this example but it's a the game in a game you know where you can jump into this world and this can be completely decentralized you're playing in this uh so it's kind of you know i see the metaverse kind of in these layers you've got the local layer which is like your desktop and then you've got a social kind of peer-to-peer layer where it can be you and your friends in a neighborhood or something and there's this global layer where i think that's where the virtual economy is going to be so this one kind of ties it together and i in a comfort mode setting you know where vr is much more comfortable if you're looking at a screen versus if you're in there in that you know blocky world and you can listen to your favorite music and there's a little work area over here too so that this is the kind of visualization when the the garage door is closed and when the garage door is open it's kind of like that game elevator from gmod where it keeps opening up into different worlds yeah i want to make it very portable which is why i contained it all within that shipping container yeah i love the modularity aspect like this this whole idea that you can take that entire world and place it in different places and put a lot of them together that's that's awesome yeah you can stack them up together you know um build like a campus i've been looking at designs and maybe even using real shipping container models for it um how hard for somebody to make their own their own room uh it's getting a lot easier um in the latest version uh with the drag and drop is getting i'll just kind of show you a video real quick it's uh going to be drag and drop and i already open source a lot of these assets [Applause] including all basically a empty version of this world um so i've got gltf's and uh voxel models as well if you wanted to make something on crypto voxels but uh it's yeah this is a demonstration of how easy it'll be to customize and then um after drag and dropping the files all you need to do is uh export the code it's writing the markup underneath it so yeah this is basically building your own 3d website just even collaboratively so uh it's using janus web and so it's doing all these edits over the server as well so you and a friend can customize the world and talk to each other it's webrtc for voip and video sharing screen sharing can come too as well but yeah um just using drag and drop in your mouse wheel one two three four for changing the scale and then you export the code or just save it all as a model and then import it to a blender or something to optimize because things like this helmet might be pretty high poly so um yeah so i want to make it very easy so i want to start out with some templates like uh the environment and then the house so i'm thinking about well i don't know about the house uh maybe we'll start out with an expo booth um you know and then it can graduate to uh your own personal house just you know starting out with land building graduate from there just keeping it all modular this is super cool yeah this is awesome can't wait to play with it thanks yeah i'll uh have a virtual instructor probably telling you how to do everything so that's the goal is making this into a um a website in which you learn how to make a 3d website on ipfs awesome that's a really cool demo glad you were able to walk us through it yeah glad you'll like um is there anybody anybody else who wants to share what they've been working on or ask for feedback uh let's see we've got couples who haven't spoken yet um sabo and james fork if you'd like to share and jay but i'll james i know we haven't seen you in a few sessions so if you can you can't that's fine um anyways just put in the chat if you'd like stock jay um do you want to share what you're working on yeah i have a question for uh juan um one of the things we're running into is storage space what uh question is do you have any idea what 40 petabytes of storage might cost when filecoin is live uh not yet we'll see what happens with uh with uh the block reward and the incentives and all that kind of stuff so we're still still early days to to be able to tell something like that but um but it's worth noting like the um the blocker water falcon is going to subsidize a lot you know a significant portion of that storage cost so we'll see what happens um at the end of the day it'll be a market competition do you think that would be a problem like 40 petabytes a day or 80 petabytes i'm not 100 sure but my my thought is that for clients the the expensive part will just be getting the data to the miners 40 petabytes is a lot so you have to ship it um okay um okay that's good to know cool well we uh or i had a good chat with some of the protocol labs developers this morning about uh some dimensions of lib p2p running on raspberry pi as a constellation raspberry pi's and they gave me a relay correction to go in we're working to stand up a d app that carson farmer demoed in a series of lessons and we're looking at that as our front end and um yeah we're pretty pleased with how it's all coming together that's our update oh and uh we were extremely hardened by the conversation last night about the future of decentralized social media we saw a lot of common ground there so yeah thanks that's it cool um i think that might be everybody unless there are any final thoughts from kartik or juan um definitely next week we would love to see people breaking their demos come to the hack feedback session show us some code show us what you've got because before you know it it's going to be time to submit and we'd love to have at least two sessions where um you know there's time for you to get feedback on what you've actually built so uh we should have those times settled soon and then they'll be up on the calendar for the the next hack feedback sessions yeah awesome i have a small question for jen is still here can i ask him hi jin what's up man awesome demo man lovely thanks yeah i love it so you use the genius xr or what's yeah the software that i'm just amazed at this so i i have a background in blender i did some blender a little bit of 3d marks and yeah it just was amazing i was having this idea of making like a word like a 3d word because like the uh what's crypto voxel one is like just uh pixels but this one is like yeah something innovative man you did a good job it's like yeah love it so hit me up on the slack if you want to learn more about uh the stack sure i would love to know that more about that that's why i'm asking yeah that's awesome yeah unfortunately we've got a we've got a wrap here but definitely can i connect in the in the slack channel um sure i'm sure he'd love to share the specifics there um do i take the oh yeah thank you for reminding me i totally forgot um yeah so if everybody's still here could turn on their video and we're gonna get the this is we have one more day but this is the end of week three so what we do is every week we take a photo with just a week and um yeah that's the basic idea so let's see if we can give me a second i'm turning on my my mind if you if you can are you ready to see me um i mean if you can join the next few seconds yeah yes yes i'm joined one two three thanks john click zombie here yeah oh you are there you go yeah just throw on your video uh video yeah can you see me yeah yeah man uh it's been a while since i didn't see people all right hit us hit us with the three there you go yeah all right and that's everybody perfect thank you for the reminder juan thank you everybody you saved me so much uh thanks for coming everybody um uh i think i covered everything we'll see yeah
