welcome everybody we're just going to get started my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global uh and i'm super excited to be doing this thing today we have over 100 people watching on just to zoom alone and this is also being live stream directly on twitter and youtube so for those of you who don't know um this is part of hackifest hackerfest is a month-long event that's being run by each global in partnership with protocol labs and the goal for this event is to offer the developers out here on building on web3 the opportunity to play with what's possible in the the falcon in the theorem ecosystem in all these developers are using the amazing set of tools and technologies available from both falcon and the omega system and really experimenting with what's possible uh by combining storage and the features of smart contracts and programming languages so for this event in particular we have over 470 hackers that are working on 230 different projects that leverage our coin or ethereum we're both participating from 50 different countries spanning 19 different time zones and it's absolutely incredible that we're halfway through this event and we're finally seeing progress on what everybody's building on and the amount of creativity the amount of technical prowess and just the amount of amazing projects that we never thought would be possible nutritional stands are being built here and really excited show and share what they will be soon uh to everybody but today this uh talk in particular is about a topic that is very relevant to where we are now so we're at the midpoint for this event and we want to talk about something that is not only just relevant in mainstream media through to some recent events but also a pretty big theme for what our participants are working on for this hackathon so last week as you may all know a hacker was able to get in control of many important twitter accounts and use that opportunity to sort of run a scam and gaining access to someone's someone else's account has been a very common issue in in kind of the modern web and social media platforms in general along with things like being banned or uh for being de-platformed um combating fake news influencing other users behavior figuring out what a sustainable business model is for for social networks and of course uh the ever-growing problem uh that's our favorite angry people on the internet so for this talk in particular today in particular i wanted to talk about something that is very relevant to this topic and that is obviously what a future of a decentralized social media platform looks like for haccfs we have over 50 different projects that are building something um that tackle a decentralized version of the social media platform that's an amazing number of projects that are doing anything from alternates to medium twitter audio sharing platforms uh you name it we're seeing a lot of them being built right now and we'll see a lot of them about atv showcase everybody else in two more weeks but and not only that i guess the actually the ethereum foundation is also sponsoring the price for the best uh decentralized social network as part of the hackathon submission so we're really excited to see kind of what everybody builds here so we wanted to use this opportunity to call upon some of our favorite people in this space who've uh been thinking about what a feature of a social media platform is going to look like for quite some time and what we'll be doing today is we'll be asking them questions about what they think a good alternative is and what the current problems are and how should we think about solving them and and on top of all that like how do we actually think about designing something like this if somebody wants to take on uh this challenge so we'll also be doing the q a from all of our zoom and youtube audiences so if you have any questions that you want to ask our panelists as part of their uh their talk feel free to just write them as questions on the chat and we'll kind of be curating that list and asking them questions at the end and without further ado i'd like to call up uh vitalik buterin who's the co-founder of bitcoin magazine uh juan bennett who's the co-founder of vertical labs and badges who is a ghostwriter so with that uh please welcome all of our panelists on stage and uh i really want to thank all of you for being here so my first question to all three of you is it's a pretty loaded term when we say we need to be central social media platform so what i really want to do is just kind of have each of you uh tell us what you actually mean when when somebody says social media should be decentralized and how do you interpret that as a as a phrase and i'll kind of kick it off with uh apology oh you admit it all right hear me now good yes so you know when i talk about decentralized media it's not just decentralized social media but it's also decentralizing legacy media corporations those are tightly related especially these days um and i think that goes hand in hand uh you know for example when you talk about decentralizing social media you're talking about um you know a million hubs and a billion spokes right folks being able to set up you know federated networks and folks being able to log in uh people being able to sign their content with private keys using you know technologies like staking to help with decentralized moderation um using intent encryption of course to secure things you know maybe having the networks be pseudonymous to um reduce the impact of uh you know like like doxing and offline attacks and swatting of that kind um implementing positive some behavior like having economic interaction within those networks um and you know obviously censorship resistance uh with technologies like ens and hns these are all things that we think about when we talk about decentralized social media decentralized legacy media is stuff like decentralized hollywood for example you know ai video allows you to go and make hollywood quality videos on your laptop decentralized publication is sort of going back to blogs but with monetization so having paid newsletters and then thinking about ways to network them together for example there's a you know not just macedon and and things like secure scuttlebutt but also little features like quotebacks.net which allow you to do twitter style rts except on a blog which which are pretty cool nice little formatting um and you know decentralized media basically also means um if you give individuals the ability to monetize on their own potentially pseudonymously there is less pressure for them to be part of an intellectual orthodoxy where they have to repeat you know certain nostrums to retain their job in an uncertain environment um and you're seeing that on substance for example where folks uh not only can think independently but must think independently as they're in a competitive marketplace for subscribers and so it's a very different incentive structure than the typical sort of you know brooklyn like east coast incentive structure so um that's my kind of kickoff is decentralized social media and decentralized legacy media are very much hand in hand and in fact i expect that the successful platforms will actually break down you know that that barrier that content and code will be kind of thought of as similar and you're going to combine kind of the evangelism the values of the community with the technology of the community and that's going to be influential we already see that in crypto but i think we're going to see much more of that a lot of a lot of content to dig in and uh i'm glad that you already prefaced that so we'll go into a lot more but um we'll kind of maybe let one share his perspective here uh thank you uh so i think i agree with a ton of what apology has been been saying uh what i would add is um i tend to think about media as a think of the memetics of of our system right so we we have a whole bunch of uh humans spread out across a globe billions of different uh processes processing information we you can think of the brain itself as a different uh distributed system as well processing information in different ways we're talking about the main mechanism by which we broadcast information across billions of people um which as the internet wired us all up in the last few decades we've managed to get really really nice fast properties around um you know our expectations today are very different than they were 30 years ago alone right 30 years ago 50 years ago we had a completely different landscape around information flow in the world there are certain things that are possible now that weren't possible then um but part of what's happening now is that we didn't bother to put in any way of controlling for manipulation vectors and attack factors in the entire stack so we've created a set of systems that can balkanize not around access or or thought but rather balkanize on on manipulation targets so it's very easy for attackers to divide the network so to speak and start playing a subsystem of the network against each other and causing all kinds of um disinformation campaigns and explicit targeted efforts to to cause problems so i think that is a very serious problem where uh a number of the of the kind of first order suggestions for uh most uh decentralized media or central social media systems will make that problem or is mounted worse not better um and so i think in order to succeed here we have to look ahead of those problems and start tackling those larger issues of how do you get to systems that are that are attack resistant and that enable some distributed notion of getting to truth and getting to to um getting to to detangle what's intersubjective and what's objective um and this is this is likely going to get worse as the ml systems perfect in terms of um fabrication of information so there's a lot of conversations around what's going to happen when when uh things like um defects and so on get much orders 90 better and so on and so we have to think ahead of all those ranges of problems and and start building the systems now so that they're ready for when this becomes a much bigger issue we might transition from a period of massive convergence in the world of basically having very few versions of the stories um to a world where there's so many different possible different stories that the majority of humans don't know don't even know what to believe anymore and they don't have a good mechanism for for achieving truth and that that is a much worse state than one than where we are now and that could be precipitated by by the by centralized or decentralized media not taking these problems seriously so i think uh verifiability information um uh getting to to intersubjective and objective uh uh perspectives and um and having a way of preventing authoritarian control and uh and attackers uh putting pitting groups against each other i think those would be the the main things that i would focus on yeah and i think one of the grands and narratives uh kind of in this whole discussion is this idea that the internet started as this much more decentralized thing you know something where you had a lot of different forums you had a lot of different blogs and there were lots of different things happening in different corners and so that was how things were maybe 10 to 15 years ago and now like we've moved toward and first of all just technological centralization and political centralization that results from that with you know a very small number of entities and a very small number of countries uh governments being able to have outsized control over just the the ability to influence what people see and talk about um and then at the same time there's also this kind of other effect where we've moved from that kind of clustered blog-like structure to the thing that i call twitter which is the world water cooler right so you know a lot of a lot of people remember have the mindset that you know the old way of doing things led to kind of fragmentation and tribalism and polarization all these bad things and the thing we need more of is just for different sides to of of people to talk to each other and well guess what that's twitter right and twitter is this a wonderful battlefield where you know you've got tech people social justice people right-wing people you know us people russia china india people and all of all of these different tribes that often really disagree with each other and just yelling at each other and it's not at all clear that the result is better right so i guess the way i see this movement uh so one of the kind of words um that i like and this is uh jane james pitts and if you're in foundation person that came up with this is like instead of thinking about cypherpunk we think about system punk uh so kind of system punk ideology would basically say that like the goal isn't just to kind of create spaces where people can do things and assume that that's enough the goal is to kind of think about things like you know what you're incentivizing what you're showing what you're creating selective pressure for and and it's kind of understanding that you know different kinds of rules can have different consequences and what we need is first of all just more experimentation and experimentation can't happen if there's only like two or three places where anything is happening and we also just need people building these platforms to kind of have this more explicit understanding that you know that is what they're doing made and that there it is like sometimes actually kind of hard to figure out exactly what it is that we're trying to target um and a more decentralized approach there's a lot of different ways of doing it like we can think about you know taking existing social media approaches and then and pushing them in a more decentralized direction you can think about starting with kind of the starting point of everyone having their own blog and then adding a different decentralized you know blockchain based or other whatever components and just creating this playing field where you know if you want to kind of you know basically kind of unbundle it and think i got to think about you know storage of the contents user interfaces incentives kind of choosing what users see as separate problems and trying to just make it easier to tackle all of those issues individually well that's great i mean i think all three of you touch on some sort of similar themes here but maybe just to kind of ask it more directly is there in particular like a thing you disagree with on how existing social media platforms uh currently run and and like the problem that that all of them face so uh anabology you've spoken a lot about twitter in the past and what does it mean to exit it but um what exactly are some of these problems and kind of moreover just do you think the problems that we have right now with these social media platforms only kind of happen at a scale when they cross a threshold number of users or are they going to persist just because of how things are done when a single company is responsible for managing a network that huge well so one thing i want to say by the way is that you know building something like twitter or facebook was extremely difficult right so i i respect the folks involved as entrepreneurs because i i know how hard that was and you know it's easy for us to sort of sit back and and poke holes in it and and whatnot but you know if you just think about the the customer acquisition you know alone just if you're on a website and you're setting up a thousand people a day that's only 365 000 a year right if you're talking about the scale that they're at you know even signing up a million um a day is 365 million a year and it'll still take you ten years at a million a day to get to where facebook is right at three billion people roughly which is insane to think about that right like how how this the scale of these operations right so um is very technically non-trivial there's no way they could have done it decentralized they were the winners of a very challenging winner take all kind of thing and you know initially the valley proposition that they gave of you know basically free global calendaring and messaging and publication and groups and you know like 50 other functions right um photo albums all this type of stuff that was an amazing price relative to the status quo of the 90s you know when photo albums you know printing them and sharing them and sending them to a thousand friends was certainly not free um lol and long distance calls and calendars and party organization all the stuff um but now we've moved into a realm where uh people have kind of gotten over that initial huge consumer surplus of making all these expensive things free and they're focused now on you know the many of the downsides right which are include you know okay we put all these people online and they're all attacking each other um you know in many ways the laws of twitter the code of twitter is more like the laws of physics it just kind of governs how particles colliding to each other at high velocity on twitter as opposed to like you know the laws of a state where you know there's some expectation of positive behavior i know the twitter has you know some stuff in terms of moderation but you can't really like hit 9-1-1 and call the police in real time it's like you file a report and you know like two weeks later somebody might look at it or what have you they do not have you know great tools for real time policing beyond you know blocking and so on right so it's essentially the sort of thing where they've optimized for engagement as many people have observed and engagement could be a burning building or somebody getting you know beaten on on twitter right so i think one one major reason this happens is you have you know 300 million people on twitter who are not aligned with each other right the you know i mentioned this before sort of sarcasm not service requests sarcastically which is that um you know twitter is actually now the government of the united states right and and and of western civilization um no matter you know every every blue check every elite in in the us and the world may uh not have much in common but they get on twitter uh for likes and faves and followers and if their ethics are you know poor or if they're you know they're incentivized just the right way which many of them are they'll just attack somebody on twitter for the likes and they will use it as kind of a real-time poll you know people talked about you know online voting and the problems of online voting well there's an election happening every day every hour every minute on twitter right and you know it's it's like gladiator you know like thumbs up like or down right um and and this is literally how policy is happening right um it's it's actually kind of crazy right you know the uh there's many good things about twitter but it wasn't built to be a government however politicians absolutely do use it as a focus group they absolutely do use it to determine what is popular and unpopular uh they will shy away from positions where they're attacked on it and so on so you know twitter is not always real life but it but it will be and it becomes real life right so um you know when we start thinking about this stuff we're like okay we now have kind of past the age where we've got large assemblages of people online we need to start introducing a things for like explicit governance opt-in governance where you when you come into a social network you're not just clicking through some terms of service you might actually want to sign like a docusign or something like that or truly go through you know a a slower growth process where you're kind of shown the rules of this community and then b have that stuff enforced by you know not just digital kinds of things and moderators but also decentralized enforcement mechanisms like smart contracts um on a somewhat related note i want to talk about juan's point for a second and then give give the mic back to juan which was you know about lots and lots of different stories and narratives so i do think that you know and this other folks have said this certainly not a novel observation to me but you know we're going through multiple simultaneous revolutions right where we've got the printing press you know like thing we're also going through an industrial revolution because of you know robotics we're going through like uh you know a um like a dating revolution because of tinder and so on and so forth there's a bunch of these things happening at the same time and uh you know so i think it is going to be a fracturing of the world um you are going to have something where the internet is splintering you know nations it's unbundling nations and then we'll eventually rebundle them with a bunch of migrations i think towards city-states and i think we're just the beginning of a period of significant internet mediated chaos and you know like foundation i'm not sure if it's going to be 10 years of this or 100 years of this we might just be at the very beginning of this stuff um and so what one of the things that means is you know global truth where i think we end up with this is uh we factor things into oracles and advocates so that's a kind of a meme let me talk about that for a second and then hand it over oracles are cryptographically signed feeds um you know that are incentivized for the education of prediction markets right so all of everybody on this call knows what they are um but the thing about them is they're a generalization of what's already happening many articles are sports articles or wrappers around box scores financial articles are wrappers around ticker symbols many political articles or other articles or wrappers around tweets so in each of these cases you have um verbal content that is generated from the prompt of you know machine readable data right like a feed of data okay and so you could generalize that and talk about arbitrary feeds of data these you know cryptographically signed feeds and you know claros is actually um having a court case on one of them now which is the feat of coronavirus you know deaths right so that's that's oracles and then you also have advocates and advocates are just explicit advocates for a cause um you know i've got an article coming out where i talk about values.text like a robots.txt a values.txt file that declares exact causes in the sense of keywords that you are advocating for and um that's now machine readable that's what you're trying to boost the sentiment of over the long run over five years and then you may cite the facts that are available in various feeds but your unapologetic advocate you know for example you're just a technologically progressive activist um and you want to use fusion energy to stop climate change or something like that and and now you just factor it cleanly right there's there's machine readable oracles with the facts and then everything else is narrative and you don't like like try to say that oh it's it's a fact if it's not cryptographically stamped uh signed and and and hashed and stamped on chain all right so let me hand over the mic yeah i i like where a lot of that is headed um i think that there is a massive um problem in just establishing tourists uh so the entire scientific process for example uh takes a quite a long time to even validate uh certain very precise and specific claims about about certain kinds of things right and and even the the rigor level of of scientific process sometimes um even lets uh certain fake things through and like the reproducibility crisis and bio is like a huge thing and you're super familiar with that uh and and i think what we're entering is a period where the importance on of truth is getting massively magnified because of how decentralized things are things are way more decentralized today than they were 30 years ago or 50 years ago and they're going to get much more decentralized and so that puts a massive premium on truth and and what backs those articles is a really hard question um in that yeah i think that there can be incentive structure schemes uh to get there but even beyond that that that just produces an intersubjective truth i think we need to get into into into a much deeper like hooking into um all kinds of verifiable facts about reality right so so people make claims all the time that are factually verifiable and yet we don't have a very natural good process about establishing the validity of that stuff and yet we walk around with super super computers in our pockets and we could be having that right so there are um projects working on this kind of stuff of putting certain kinds of um hardware modules so you can you can stamp pictures and videos not being tampered with and actually being taken a specific point like things of that nature will help um but i think we need to we need to get to a uh uh we need to kind of vault ahead and like leap ahead using using tech like um uh like gpt3 is a good a great concrete example of something that we could be using to to start uh understanding the the web of claims and then trying to assess whether or not those claims are are actually true or not um so all kinds of all kinds of uh of nlp tag could be used to to detangle the kind of natural language uh web that we're forming and establish what what are we actually talking about what are the claims being made and how close are those two truths um and how much evidence there is for these things and i think moving media and away from a like um i often think that uh you know we program things with ascii or youtube but uh it's kind of like this crazy world where you're manipulating characters and that's and that's code and uh ideally you would want to be in a much more um structured environment and yet when we pull back and we think about how we do everything else in humanity we're still kind of talking about human language moving through through all of this computing medium and with no no structured representation yet right and i think we're we're vastly outpacing um our building of tools for for just the spread of of human word is um is is uh maybe misplaced maybe what we should be doing is structuring conversation massively uh and building systems and that allow kind of the incremental effort and work that people are uh are putting in to build to a really good scaffolds of claims um and really good scaffolds of narratives as you're describing of what might actually uh have happened or or might happen in the future or predictions and so on and turn those into testable and falsifiable um uh claims and and then stories right stories are really useful and really valuable in terms of motivating uh uh individuals and groups and so on um but being able to distinguish those from being able to distinguish a story from from an actual factual claim um is extremely important and we're losing that ability at the moment and i think it's just going to get worse over the next few years it's like you have anything to add on on from what belgian ones have said if not we can i feel like on that question they've covered it pretty well um great so kind of just from synthesizing what all three of you said i think um there's kind of clearly two categories that sort of um stand out uh the kind of the first one is like we'll have a decentralized alternative that sort of tackles some of these problems whether that's fact checking or or just prevents people from from being banned so to speak and uh you kind of have these two camps where like you have on one side a decent decentralized alternative that succeeds at sort of being feature parody with twitter or facebook and i can attract mass audiences and you just kind of have a massive network that has the skill in the audience to really compete against the incumbents here or you have a version of a social network that's uh alternative to this uh where the audience is actually a minority audience that kind of wants to remain there and they want to have sort of a monopoly on their own niche but uh just kind of have the ability to sort of say whatever they like without actually facing any problems that they may get from uh however moderation is done on the other platforms um kind of with these kind of two camps out there which one do you think is more likely do you think we'll have a world where uh we actually get a massive enough social network like twitter in terms of size that is actually decentralized and solves a bunch of problems that we have with with these platforms or only a certain amount of people will move there and they'll attract only their their followers and they just kind of remain in their small communities but we'll have many of these communities i'd say well we're probably going to see a kind of a lot of a couple of different things at the same time like i think social networks uh that are like highly decentralized them [Music] are going to be a kind of minority nation to rest at least for some time but you could easily see paradigms that at least kind of push things significantly in the direction of being more decentralized but you know make some compromises for practicality like even just you know moving from twitter to even things like sub stack or like some people moving to personal blogs or kind of anything in between like that's such trend that i could definitely see end up happening in the short term but at the same time it's definitely not a push all the way to um you know anything you what you could realistically call like a fully decentralized social network uh so we'll see a lot of those things that have hap happening at the same time um and i definitely also think that uh in general we are going to see the pendulum kind of swing back a bit from you know the world water cooler to something that's kind of a bit more fragmented with a bit more a kind of room for keeping sub communities to be more closely connect connected to each other and not be kind of put into co into collisions with with the outside world every day the way that twitter does but that could happen in a lot of ways it's funny that you call it the world water cooler because i think of uh i think twitter in a somewhat different way as kind of like the world war zone but you're right it's it's a mixture of both you know a library and a civil war you know um so like just it's actually kind of amazing how both those are tightly related yeah we had a we had a few of those scares this year alone right a number of uh world like world war scenario type scares directly on twitter while uh we also expect the kind of water cools cooler style conversation to happen in the exact same medium with exact same people and so on i was just so surprised that the twitter hacker didn't do anything more interesting like you know you could do so many fun things to the tesla stock price to like getting countries i mean that's a bitcoin it could well it could just have been misdirection we don't know actually what what what happened actually there were there were evidently eight accounts this is i i'm not sure if you saw this but there were a bunch of accounts whose um at least eight non-verified users whose dms were downloaded interesting yeah twitter itself was reported right you see that i did not that's interesting i mean i guess like what can the hacker do like the hacker can okay scan people for some bitcoin to do make some immediate tweets um quietly introduce some racist uh tweet from into a politician's history that pretends to be from 2014 um you know down the line yeah yeah and there's definitely a lot of things that are clandestine yeah i mean the thing is actually that part is something that's pretty interesting which is um you know something that we take for granted the reason that tweets are cited in in many news articles is people take for granted the fact that twitter.com did not edit them right and so you know you you basically are like okay uh who said what when and often where you get from twitter so long as you trust twitter.com as effectively digitally signing that content um now that we have you know gbt3 now that we have you know some serious possible hacking of twitter like serious like you know on a level that's actually kind of embarrassing for them as a service even again i'm i'm friends with some of the folks there but it kind of sucks for them um it becomes something where you start to go to a higher level of security especially for politicians and folks who have you know fingers on a nuclear trigger or a missile of some kind um you know one mechanism and again this is sort of monday morning quarterbacking but you know if you had private keys like a key base style thing on every phone and you had to have a digital signature with every post uh that would be something where you couldn't just hack it centrally like like what happened because you would need files that were locally on every on every uh device right so um i think that uh we we definitely do need to implement stuff like this you know what i'm still sad we don't have authenticated screenshots like it would be like the technology is totally there right like if you have if you want to screenshot parts of a web page why not just have the server figure out exactly what it would look like and just digitally sign it but instead you know you can do things like uh like if you uh just screen screenshot someone's tweets like i i did this as a joke about a year ago someone would i think someone that made a yet tweet a tweet quoting me and says saying something that i didn't actually say and i replied back with uh don't trust uh any uh screenshots that you see on the internet um tweeted by abraham lincoln in september 1861. um i think you need a verifiability chain there like you need to treat it like the entire provenance of the of the thing like just if it's a screenshot and you're just looking at pixels like there's an impossibility that result there but if you if you start thinking about uh grabbing dom elements and looking at the entire trace of the of the of all of the interactions then i think that is totally that'd be a great hack by the way and somebody in in the hackathon could actually build that uh in a week or two um one thing that i think is pretty critical to your return your question uh kartik um this question around will there be one or many systems i think we all agree with vitalik that there will be many different experiments and there we'll have some big ones and some small ones and so on uh my impression is that we're headed towards a much better future where the data structures are going to be decoupled from from the uis so today when you think of twitter and you think of facebook you think of completely vertically integrated things where the data the the mechanisms the identity all of that is bundled into one simple system and that's the result of the of the race that biology was describing they had to move so fast to get there that they had to um just beat each other to the to the market and had to build everything themselves we're now starting to have the the um data the mechanisms and the protocols for moving around all this data in a distributed way and so you can have things like the the all the data of something like twitter be presented with many different clients and many different uis that tune for different sorts of things um and then move information in a different way and i think that's what's gonna i see this kind of in middle of the road kind of thing where there will be many different systems built on top of the same information graph and so there'll be just one information graph that's massive that different applications are going to pull different bits about and different kinds of assertions right so you could think of interweaving all of these important verifiable claims alongside the media that you attach on posts and all that kind of stuff um but i think it's a bunch of tooling that needs to be built for the next year or so before before those can can good it can get good i think a concrete challenge for for folks in the hackathon and beyond is build a toy social media decentralized social media thing that has three or four completely different uis for it but uses the exact same data structures and the exact same identity uh and so you can now start playing around with what will that look like and how to how to start introducing different different kinds of verifiability by the way just on that topic i think something that is massively still under appreciated by folks outside our space is the extent to which something like that already exists in the sense that you know coinbase and binance and uh you know blockchain at info and btc.com and so on are all different layers over you know the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains right like these are data structures that are updated and then you have different views on them some are block explorer views some are exchange views some are wallet views and so on so forth and one way of thinking about the innovation of blockchains is you know they're not you know they're quote a database yes but they're a database with uh an unlimited number of simultaneous clients that have root privileges you know they can all write they can all read the entire thing and um your idea of having six different interfaces there's another great paper by the way from 10 years ago that i think is worth sort of dusting off and revisiting it's uh out of stanford it's called mr privacy and their proposal was essentially to use email as a transport layer but to build totally non-email looking interfaces on top of email so that you would use mbox files locally and you'd use smtp or imap or whatever as a transport layer between and but you could render it totally differently like every click of a mouse on you know for a like or something could initiate an email for example right now eventually you'd want to optimize that but as a v0 that's not a completely stupid thing to do because there's a thousand you know tools for working with you know email data and whatnot so that's kind of a way of talking about what you're talking about one absolutely i think uh yeah i mean kind of we've seen flat files as data structures emerge as well in a lot of other cases too but uh um not gonna spend too much time on this thing but actually twitter had an api that was open for everybody to use and we actually had multiple tour clients that uh have their own different features and view layers but kind of just the nature of the business prevents from from that sort of defragmentation so i know we already kind of talked about or we've actually wasn't asked is is user fragmentation or content fragmentation a bad thing and i think we found relative uh already have sort of answered that it's not really a bad thing because the sum is not positive here but maybe just to touch on the fact that uh assuming that those two games existed like really a lot of fragmented communities and then or the other uh sort of side which is a massive alternative that is in a way future complete to existing things that you already know um what exactly do you think is kind of the the reason or the incentive for somebody to um switch over to uh the alternative year like kind of the common sort of phrasing coming from is i'm going to take the other side side of this argument is why do i care about being uh being banned or or uh being de-platformed if chances are like i'm one out of 10 000 people who actually suffer from these things and i should not have any problems what's my incentive to actually look at these communities or alternatives and what do you think actually gets them gets people over the hump of trying something out that's that's not the common platform yeah i would say one simple dumb answer is just like there's a lot of things that you might want to say that kind of twitter the format doesn't let you say right like tweet storms are much more limited limiting than you know writing a blog post um potentially also you might not want your what whatever you write to be a kind of very easily i'm kind of quoted and kind of spread around spread around the echo chamber like obviously anyone can go and screenshot it but even like just the facts that it takes like an active screenshot and a cut and paste effort instead of just clicking a retweet button might be a improvement enough um and and also adjust the fact that if you control your own platform then like you have a lot more ability to customize and you even have a lot more ability to customize like what kind of discussion happens around your content um so like there's definitely a lot of people for whom none of those things that kind of really matter too much but like a new paradigm doesn't have to appeal to everyone immediately right so i think as long as it offers concrete benefits to some people at the start that'll be enough to get it started i think we're also in a in a period where building the right thing is more important than building than getting a bunch of users meaning it's not that hard to get a lot of people to try things out the internet is so big now that you can find a thousand to ten thousand users to try something um just you have to put an effort and so on and with the pathways are there and if you have the time you can you can make that happen um the bigger question from my perspective is what is the right thing to build and you have like all the layers we're talking about so many different things here and you know pretty significant tech team will have to work quite a while to to um to build out a lot of the things that we're talking about at least to work in the same really nice seamless um way that the we're used to from the current interfaces um and so i think you know a very high leverage position here might be think of how to decouple these systems and make the work of one group interact with the work of another group right so uh the unbundling that we've been talking about and in terms of separating the layers um think about the data structure separate from the ui separate from the mechanisms separate from the incentive structures like all of that kind of stuff um if you can if we can build good systems that decouple these so that one group might come along bundle the piece some set of pieces together turn that into a good product and then make get a lot of adoption around that one product that will enable us to reuse a bunch of the work that's happening the fact that if you want to go and build a social network right now you have to go and replicate everything all of the work that twitter has done is kind of crazy right like it's you and you can't even really compete with the level of of product quality that that that a team like that has simply because you know there's whole you know large groups of people working on optimizing every single aspect of that interface uh in mobile across a bunch of different platforms and on the web and and so on uh and so it's a huge ground turn task if we want to actually get something that to be broadly used and be really good i think we have to focus on building the right thing get make sure that he's the right thing and then put a bunch of effort on that and so i think it starts with separating the pieces getting layers right and then making it very easy for teams to come together try experiments make good products and once we find a really good one then put a lot of energy behind behind that so i think it's a lot of experimentation for now as opposed to saying hey i have my my one version i want to try and get as many people using it no it's great so um i think there's like two other main pieces i want to cover here before we move on to the questions kind of a big theme here is that kind of from what you just said one the this sort of sets us up right for the part where there's clearly two groups here uh from our former audience from hackathon and just in general like the the large participants here one is somebody who's thinking about solving this problem and the other party being somebody who wants to use a solution that solves this problem so one actually kind of just take a side here for like if i'm like a provider is making a service that solves a lot of these issues um what exactly should i be thinking about and kind of what are some of the solutions that i think need to be kind of worked on so i just have a handful of questions when i ask and i wanted to see like what you think are the right approaches or something like this thing uh the first one is um in in the world where i have to make a alternate decentralized version of my platform um our ai and ml algorithms still useful in terms of helping people discover content um um or rather checking twitter's discoverability is actually a useful feature so i think um to answer that name algorithms can definitely be valuable but i one kind of nuance that's really important is like who's running the ai and who's choosing the ai for who's benefit um so like the two natural paradigms are right like either i'm running an ai client side that can kind of filter content for me discover content for me to help me write things or whatever or the other alternative is that there's some ai that's run inside of some centralized platform like twitter and that kind of just makes someone decisions on whether prioritization moderation or whatever whatever else on our behalf right and the challenge with uh centralized ai is basically that like if it's not open source nobody's going to trust it but if it's open source then it's exploitable right like the problem is that like what we want out of content on the internet is just so subjective that like you can't easily just create a kind of tight formula and you definitely can't create you know a classifier like there's even an entire science of like adversarial ai that basically is dedicated to kind of taking existing classifiers and kind of coming up with ways of basically breaking them and make something that's just a dog with like 45 pixels change to look today like a cat um and so you know they're kind of stuck stuck in that trade-off right and the interesting thing is that no we have a science that's pretty much exactly about this question of can we create algorithms that are unexploitable and that science is called mechanism design right um and so if we look at a mechanism design where you're basically saying you know we have algorithms and these algorithms even provide incentives to participants and a lot of the time with the way that that approach ends up working is the central kind of logic ends up being relatively simple and ends up being kind of relatively static but then there's kind of all of these you know potentially people potentially bots potentially some of both are kind of swimming around at the edges and they're kind of contributing all of their information and inputs and you have um like basically this design where all of these kind of intelligent actors around the edges like i have some kind of incentive where like if they provide good feedback or good as an ideally hopefully kind of directly defines buying and providing value to the users then they get rewarded and if they don't then they might get penalized so like that kind of approach has even just blockchains themselves are kind of a good example of that paradigm right like you have a very simple mechanism at the core um you know if you create a block that's part of the chain you get two eth plus transaction fee is um if you create a block that's not part of the chain you don't get your teres and you burn a bunch of money building the block and so if we can make things look more like that then that would be one a kind of example of a kind of a way out of that kind of out of that conundrum that lets us you know have things like ais without having them be um you know either a kind of unaccountable secret police or or uh just get completely exploited to hell as soon as someone runs a an adversarial um ml thing on it but and this is still one of those areas where we need to think more about well that makes a lot of sense and maybe i'll just kind of what i'll do is i'll just ground up in these questions because i have a lot of soft parts for this theme as a somebody who wants to build a service like this so it's going to be for one um what would be an actual good sustainable business model for building something if i'm if i'm offering this as a service whether it's open source or hosted or preferably not hosted um what uh what can people do if they're offering this to somebody else yeah i mean i think uh i think we're seeing a lot of very good uh experimentation with business models like this i think subscribe is a great idea and we have seen that uh a number of folks are actually uh making that a viable business model so so there could be something something like that i think for the platform developers um you know you can go a bunch of different routes but uh um i think these days is not that expensive to develop things for the at the beginning so getting some funding to develop this stuff and get a team together to actually try a bunch of experiments and find the right thing um maybe decouple that from the from the business model meaning figure out what the figure out the structure first and and explore a bunch of different business models but if you kind of raise funding in kind of a startup style sense of hey here's our business model here's what we're going to go build and so on people will be very locked into that and so i think right now um i think we need to see a lot more experimentation with different business models to go to go after options some some ideas include um using using tokens to mediate the the the um the the me the processing right like mediate use a token native to the to the platform itself um and and the developers can can grab some of that token as part of throttle developing the platform it could also be um uh you know in the substance sounds taking some portion of the of the revenue uh uh that um that publishers end up end up making um uh i think that they're you know ads are not gonna go away uh ads are such a massively valuable part of the um massively valuable business and and ads solve this the discovery problem so ads aren't going to go away can we come up with a much better higher quality more humane way of doing ads that uh don't leak all of your information to a ton of parties that might be like a very interesting valuable thing to do if somebody figures out that out then that could be plugged into a bunch of different different systems so um so i think like uh like i think a lot of the business models are going to be similar to the existing ones just kind of translated into it into this new world um where you get to play with with incentive structures i think it's going to be i think something is very promising is tasks um where you know like there's more and more traction for bounty certainly you know we did this with earn and there's actually i think it's pretty successful with with earn um but also on uh you know with git coin those are getting traction on twitter bounties those are working um and one way of thinking about it is with an ad you have to pay the platform for a user's attention with a task you pay the user directly for their attention right and that's just a better model if you can make it work the thing that historically has made that difficult is doing small payouts to millions of people with different banking around the world and so on and so forth and uh crypto now makes that possible so i think that that's one potential thing that could scale to billions or even trillions in in you know payment volume over time no that's great uh that makes a little sense we're seeing that as a theme in general and this also scales really well to smaller communities so maybe a question for ubiology is um in as somebody's thinking about making a service that solves this problem how should they be thinking about sort of moderating and customer support and just in general like managing a community of users like what responsibilities should they take or actually what are the ways to think about handling those issues it's a great question you know one thing i tweeted a while back is uh maybe centralization is also under explored in the design space right so you know in the sense that uh you know we talk a lot about decentralization that's very important but you know elon for example has 40 million followers and what if he could ask them to do something what if he could tell them to do something or else they wouldn't be able to follow him anymore right um and or offer an incentive to do that thing right you know there's different levels of you know requests to you know and and and so on uh and i think you can imagine different communities that have a very digital communities are very different subcultures like you know for example a productivity cult where to log in each day you actually have to take a selfie of yourself working out or something like that right um so i think that you're going to see uh more more kinds of tools like this for kind of not just moderating speech but behavior you know whether it's staking whether it's um you know frequency of posting whether it's quality of posting whether it is type of content i think we're really under explored in terms of um mechanisms for both centralized and decentralized moderation uh and you know if we go to this model of a million hubs and a billion spokes um and give tools for folks you know ideally you have kind of some central server that's very easy to deploy and then and configure you know uh like like the linux of social networks basically and mastodon and others are kind of like this but they're not yet there you know you may need to integrate crypto with it i think then you start to get a lot of experimentation that's great and kind of just to put the site on on uh what this may look like for for any user who's using a platform like this um does this kind of flip the model of consuming content where i now need to know what i need to follow and who i need to follow like kind of going back to the way anywhere from like substance to like 20 years ago or even 10 years ago how rss were dominant i kind of knew i wanted to follow i want to just look out for the new content that they publish um is this kind of the world we default into or do we do you still think either of you still think that uh we'll just still kind of rely on the same distribution discovery mechanisms to uh to find new content that's interesting i mean i think curation is always going to be an important and valuable part of the picture and you don't not every i think curation will be both machine oriented and human oriented right so there will be curation that happens from people curating other other groups uh and there will be individual curation that you do on top of that and then there will be all these algorithms that drive content your way because it's a market problem at the end of the day there'll be a lot of different options and solutions and we'll get a good evolution to finding good um finding out the right thing meaning a successful platform has to solve this problem so so i'm not too worried about about content discovery that much in that there will be there will be some there'll be good mechanisms for it uh in a successful platform we'll have to figure it out um i guess maybe like biology do you think that uh i guess this type of alternative favors content creators more than consumers i think actually you know people have asked how does this you know how does decentralized media get going and you know sub stack and paid newsletters i think is how it starts we attract the power users the folks who crucially are migrating off of centralized social media for varying reasons but one that's kind of cross ideological is the lack of control over their brand and monetization you know um and so they're they're not making money on social media or or they have to invent baroque ways of doing it they don't know if their content is getting promoted and so on they lack the control so you get the migration and defection of the elites the power users and over time that will pull others because those elites are able to evaluate technologies they have an incentive to defect and to leave right um that's that's that's i think one one aspect of it um there's another thing in terms of curation something i've thought about is a feed where you know you have a few different things for example people can only comment or vote up links that are at least a week old you know um and that actually is a useful thing you know i it is relatively little news unless it's like you know a burning building or something like that you absolutely must consume today now right um and soon there's a lot of attention around it but it's often invalidated by reports a day or two later you know the truth gets its boots on uh so that's kind of one method another method would be to require multiple confirmations to upload it you know whether in a in a decentralized court system or something like that so i think curation also there's a lot that we can do in terms of innovation if we just go away from what is just new and popular to maybe what is a little bit older but true that's fair um and i guess a question of the talk so i mean if people are worried about being uh being sort of banned for what they say or if there are some beliefs or or just not being able to monetize or being able to say something without uh anonymously rather and having a solution that lets you do all these things um what if we actually end up with a world where uh the winning platform is 4chan if it's most of these criterias it's kind of like a network that is somewhat centralized but also has very intuitive moderation do you think uh how are we actually going to prevent these such systems from performing and these being the dominant well yeah so i feel like 4chan type things are like the great example of the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous right right 4chan is like much more on the anonymous side of the spectrum and i think the difference um is that like you can focus on um decentralization in the sense of like avoiding other people's negative incentives and that's definitely kind of part of what's going on but the other important thing is that kind of actively creating positive incentives right and if you don't have any notion of persistent identity then you know you can't have positive incentives because like there's no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto um and there's a lot of ways in which you can have you know persistent identity persistent reputation um even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving i mean you can have pseudonyms but then you could even do crazy things like for example you know you switch to a new pseudonym every two weeks but um you would have some zero knowledge proof that links your pseudonym to some older pseudonym and you don't really know which one but like some kind of reputation score carries over and you couldn't even have negative reputation scores carry over potentially of someone underneath the research came up with a way of doing that in a privacy preserving way so there is some like there there's a lot of uh kind of room in terms of designing incentives to encourage actively good behavior and like incentives can mean a lot of things you know it can mean like micro payments and monetary rewards it could mean just the reputation and like just having more people see your content um you know it could mean a lot of things but there's a lot of things that you can do that you can do there that i think are fully compatible with the idea that you know people should be able to kind of post under identities that are separate from you know the identities that they can use for you know like personal life and work and so forth that's great um and the last thing i want to cover before we move on to the the audience questions is uh i mean a lot of hackers are building decentralized social networks as part of accfs there's over 50 projects that are building um 80 central social network as part of their submission and uh what i wanted to do was kind of have each of you just list any popular services or frameworks or just in general like solutions you know for each of these things that people need to solve for and have an alternative to uh as like a list of ingredients that they can use right now to uh to build their project um so i'll name some high level categories and uh if i if any one of you without any kind of me picking on somebody um just kind of name the best solutions you know that can help with that um that'll be great and we can move on to the audience side so first off i'll start off with identity verification um what are currently really good alternatives that are decentralized and also help with identity verification present so and i think like when people talk about the identity problem and they talk about it as one big lump but really there's like there's a few separate problems that are locked together right so one of them is just the kind of persistent access to an account problem which is like have some identifier it could be a long random number or whatever um where if you set up that identifier you have the ability to maintain that identifier for a long period of time and like write posts some using it and so forth and the mean like you can obviously do that with a private key and like for example if you have metamaskuric and you is ethereum what kind of wallet in your browser then you can just use an ethereum address as an identity and that basically is like it is a cryptographic key ultimately but then the challenge with that is that you know people can easily forget their keys or lose their keys and i do need some kind of backup and like a lot of especially earlier decentralization people kind of don't take this problem seriously right and they say oh no no we should just require you know everyone including you know the grandma that's um only started using computers like five or seven years ago to like be able to understand like what a paper you know how to use paper wallets and all the security things um around them but the ch like i think we do need to kind of take take seriously this uh this problem and the problem of making basically coming up with ways for people to recover their account if their account gets lost and this is something that even twitter does badly right like even just or even google like all of these uh silicon valley tech companies somehow do badly right like if you lose your account you know you have to appeal to customer service and sometimes they just never respond to you and sometimes no like more privileged people can have a kind of private channels where they can yet listen to more and a lot of other people just don't have access to those kinds of channels at all um and it's just a problem where people think that you know oh you can just talk to them kindly human and they'll figure it out but often it just isn't true um and the thing that i'm always bullish on is uh social recovery right so this is your idea where you know you have like some group of friends like you could be you know somewhere between five and ten contacts and say any two-thirds of them can reset your account right and kind of the core of this um idea is basically that you know there there exists uh kind of real world links of uh kind of links of trust um between people like you know like no one kind of literally is a kind of a mounted man the um that literally trusts no one except for you know themselves and uh the past versions of themselves that created some uh some private key um but you know we do have people we can trust and like in reality like if uh if seven of your ten friends uh betray you then that just means you're really really bad at choosing friends um and you know the number the number of people with that problem i think is like smaller than the than the number of people that can't see you know trust centralized services and so yeah like if we can just make century uh even just social recovery easy to use in a smart contract while it's pickier and of recovery contact you can even make it privacy preserving for ethereum there's an eip for that i think it might be two five two nine or something like i forget the exact number uh then you have an ethereum smart contract account that represents your persistent identity but it's kind of more robust to failures on the human side than not a cryptographic year so that's like long digression but i'm a huge fan of that social recovery so i think we just it needs to be relentlessly pumped until like lots of people are using it um then so the other half of the identity problem is well there's two other halves right one half is like proving real world properties about yourself um that are attested to by authorities right so like proving you're a citizen of some country proving that you graduated from some university and all of those things and ultimately you can't decentralize those because they just fundamentally depend on the centralized authority but what you can do is create a kind of common standard and common platform for these attestations to happen and then the third identity problem is this unique human problem right like basically proving that you know your account represents a unique human and is this an account with this kind of tag is an account such that like one human can only realistically create one or maybe a couple of them and you can't just like create an unlimited amount of them and even if you have a lot of money to burn and like i've written a lot about why the this problem is really important for governance for example um why you know plutocracy is bad as i've said on my blog many times um and there's an interesting combination of kind of centralized and decentralized approaches and others all of the traditional kind of centralized you know phone number id kyc whatever verifications and then there's things like bright id um that are basic kind of basically trying to do like social network verification and random interpersonal verification and all of these things so we're definitely seeing a lot more experimentation in some of those areas and like even bitcoin grants uh quadratic funding is kind of really doing a lot of just kind of pushing experimentation in that so looking forward to kind of seeing what works and what sticks comprehensive i'll suggest some some uh some like rapid fire technologies to go with that um i think without did a great job covering the a lot of the space of identity problems and and yeah this is like a huge huge nest of interrelated issues that are difficult to self um i think uh people should check out uport that project did a ton of work entangling a lot of the a lot of the issues around identity uh you should check out um uh ion which is uh an implementation using using dids which are decentralized identifiers uh did is quickly becoming the way to to think about verifiable claims about identity there's a lot of different pieces of tools and so on that use them um you should check out uh of course you should use ens and uh adoptable domains and handshake and blocksec and all these other kind of domain name mappings to like keys to names to to content things those can be extremely useful um things like civic things like uh just all the wallet providers metamask and so on you can you can use those to to store keys and to to uh to to have pieces of identity um i think we need a return to uh the idea of of persona which was like this this mozilla effort to create identity directly taken to the browser um i think if the the operating systems that we had um coupled uh identities for data closer to kind of the identities for logging into the device i think that would be a good win the browser might be the right place to put it or the os might be the right place to put it this i haven't seen that much in terms of experimentation key base is probably the closest thing uh so people should check out that and how that works um unfortunately key bases is now uh going into zoom so um maybe maybe they'll keep running but potentially it could be uh thinking about a decentralized key base type of type of thing and then thinking of making that into the browser on the os that could be a really useful uh really useful thing um and so then on top of that i would say three box uh in terms of coupling identity to content um and there's a few other a few other tools but um yeah there's a ton of these different pieces spend some time exploring the space figure out what you need and then just use what you need for now most things are going to end up with the ids it looks like that that the dd is like a pretty good uh good a good convergence point um and then just think of a way to hook it into the browser either through a wallet or something like it no it's a great list and and uh maybe for balji i know you recently published uh a post on how to set up your own uh sub stack uh through ghost and uh i guess the question i have for you is through that process did you think about what the tradeoffs were particularly alternatives outside of ghost and also if you were to make a list of what was missing and what you would need probably solutions for like what are some of those like features yeah i mean the biggest thing i wanted to do was um have people set something up to give them immediate benefit um and you know a lot of a lot of crypto things are cool technologically but you know uh they they aren't like uh you know immediately world-class the obviously best thing to do it's like you're doing decentralization for the sake of it right i think we're starting to come out of that now where crypto is actually being used for some really interesting projects you know handshake and the prediction mark and stuff and so on um what what i would like to see is somebody maybe you know maybe a viewer who's looking at this uh modify ghost to accept ethereum subscriptions um in particular uh you know v1 would just be to do that and v2 would be to make it possible to do dynamic newspapers where you can do bundles of individual ghost websites um and you have like a like a paid rss feed for example uh where you you know let's say pay some ethereum to it you get a custom url which is a custom rss link that maybe just works for you um or it could be global also you know whatever and you just don't share it without you know like uh like honor code or something like that i just like you know you you wouldn't you could forward the emails you get from sub stack you know you could repost them um but people don't usually do that right it's just kind of honor code so you you do something like that and then you've got something very powerful which is um you have crypto being used for something novel uh where it's not stripe um that's your only payments mechanism for these these kind of paid newsletters nothing against stripe but it lacks a flexibility nope that makes a lot of sense and kind of with that just kind of also keeping time in mind i want to move on to the the audience uh questions here we have a lot of lists of questions that people submit so i'll pick a handful of them and also want to be respectful of the time of our panelists but kind of jumping in with like a really interesting question we got um the question is the last wave of uh centralized social media just gave us a lot of new verbs and how we communicate whether it's retweets tagging your friends likes and faves um as like a speculation what do you think will be the new verbs for the decentralized social media landscape depends on the name of the product do you think any are there any fundamentally new concepts that come in when when you have a system that is more distributed so to speak i think signal boosting is uh is like a good term that i think we'll start appearing more in either through tokens or through the behavior stuff that biology's talking about giving giving weight to something um and boosting it i think will be a will be a term that will secure that's great yeah i think also like hosting you know like everything associated with operating a hub you know from hosting to forking a community to banning all the moderation kind of verbs i think come to the fore you know these are things that already exist on reddit and what have you but i think those become you know more important um and uh you know you start to see just just more folks doing that kind of thing um sorry guys i'm just going to say some verb for like let's check what let's check what aggro or omen say about this question you know by the way one thing i want to just point out this is maybe very obvious but i think it's actually pretty interesting for us um done right you could turn uh so one of the advantages of sub stack is there's a hundred thousand people on there who have credit cards and so a new publication has a built-in network effect or what have you right um done right if you had an ethereum id with crypto in there um you start to get a network effect among things where all ethereum users or all bitcoin users can go and sign up for a site and you have a similar kind of network effect where you would prefer it to be log in with ethereum or log in with bitcoin and then you can pay and you've got identity and so on and so forth um in some ways that's an obvious use case but i think it rotates it a little bit where you know you just need a community of those folks who will all go and just click to sign up at a site and you start to get a network effect and then you start getting more products built around that core and the critical thing there of course is that the account and the money are both quote decentralized so they're not associated with amazon.com or substack or what have you but with a decentralized community um and then you can also have something where you have an ethereum wallet for example or bitcoin wallet where uh you are pushing um effectively notifications and you get paid so so you know you have your um let's say now you get to a future where there's enough apps that they want to go and attract ethereum holders right then they pay a task to that wallet which is a known purchaser of subscriptions and now boom a little offer or task appears and you can click to go and purchase it right so so that's you know sketch of um of something where you can start building uh you know a two-sided marketplace around holders and account holders on one hand and services on the other now it's really cool i think one of the other sort of uh benefits of a system like this is that you actually also know who the audience is that already subscribed to a set of ideas that you already have and you can even use their existing subscriptions as a acquisition mechanism to offer them anywhere from discounts to repackaged container or just given access because you already know their identity and uh if you know that they can check for these other two subscriptions they may have access to more content from you because that becomes your actual uh way to understand or really cater something to them uh another couple companies working on this thing as well so it's a really interesting concept um you touched on this thing in in one of your earlier answers but how do you think like these central social media platforms can handle hate speech and managing fake news like what is kind of a more practical way of doing fact checking well so you know so let me take the second one first so in terms of fake news that can come from centralized sources as well as you know random blogs like there was a lot of incorrect news reports that were published by you know the washington post new york times buzzfeed recode wired et cetera during corona that mostly have not been retracted right um to their to their discredit because if if if they were honest you know like like about searching the truth they would they have done that of their own accord so it's actually a much more complicated problem it means that you can't trust any single authority necessarily other than um you know like a like a blockchain or something along those lines that has a proof of work or a similar mechanism which makes it computationally difficult to falsify something with that said i think that um you know tools like gpt3 show how far nlp has advanced and i think we could start applying something like that for epistemology where you put in a fact or an assertion rather and what you get back are essentially knowledge bases that state whether or not that fact is true according to that knowledge base um so for example you parcel of wikipedia and you put in an assertion like you know i don't know uh ronald reagan's birthday was so and so date and you get back a true false right um according to a knowledge base and uh that could be wrong someone typed evidence true false is like very difficult yeah yeah yeah exactly that's right so so it is um however you want to call it you can say this knowledge base says that's true right um and uh you know that's that's useful because it could differ you know on the topic of hate speech i think that's extremely difficult because um you know trying to give the most neutral possible answer i can on that uh let's say you know israel and the palestinians might differ on what is hate speech right and you know like that's something where it's probably going to be community moderation ultimately that's going to determine that and what gets really tricky is that some community will not want the other community to exist or vice versa right and uh and so then you just you you basically have information war you know between those communities um at least however the internal logic of a community is going to be something that i think will be prime um namely you know is it uh a functional enough community to maintain um an internal moderation policy and if so then then everybody there has opted in so there's kind of a consent aspect to it basically like the old reddit used to be um and i think a new reddit will arise where um rather than being locked into a reddit account and you know having a bunch of subreddits banned or what have you and by the way i respect you know steve and the folks at reddit i understand why they're doing what they're doing but rather than something like that you have this portable ethereum account where you can go and log into a a you know ethereum reddit equivalent and the moderation is something which is you know obvious to you when you enter and if you don't like it you can exit um can't respond to that i know the timing is sorted by that but i think this topic is super super valuable and and really useful i totally agree with um without just talking about um i think that the you can you can there are a number of projects already aiming to do this um you you should look at things like the underlay the underlay is an effort to so there's a thing called meta web in in the in the past that ended up becoming the google knowledge graph um and that had built the megawatt t meta web team built out built freebase as a freebase was this kind of database oriented kind of thing and it tried to do like the true false uh version of facts and so that you could connect it to applications um one really important thing is to kind of build the bayesian network of inference behind a claim uh so that you can you so that you can get that binary true false but you know precisely what facts you've collected along the way so when you falsify something you backprop you backdrop the uh the change in in in in belief through the network to to understand whether something needs to be reverted or not uh to as bad was saying like we need to understand that that our perception about things changes and or our understanding of things changes and when that changes those changes happen things need to be retracted or need to be adjusted and we need to to actually move move to a higher knowledge content uh place and i think you know things like so that group created a new project called the underlay that is trying to solve it precisely that is trying to create a a network of of evidence linked together with with um with a belief map so you understand how what the facts might be and and so on and so using those tools could be done right now to plug them in uh uh you know two two various different kinds of claims uh made in in in in social media and i think there's the pieces are there just they need to be put together um a question for vitalik uh given that with incentive design and just in general kind of how these potential decentralized systems may operate um how could you kind of prevent some large corporation from spending enough money to compromise any truth signaling around a fact that they might want to verify or or in general kind of sway the decision about what people think is actually true or not or just kind of push their agenda you know i'd say stopping this is a is a hard problem and it's definitely not a problem that the existing centralized platforms have succeeded at um and can we improv i kind of improve much on the status quo like it's you know there's things that we can do like we can create you know better reputation systems try to kind of better distinguish between um you know real like kind of accounts representing real people and civil accounts like uh at least um when uh like even just catch uh those cases where like on twitter for example when um you know you you know who makes a poll and then suddenly five thousand likes appear um and so if uh like there's things that you can we can kind of do on the um on the margin in terms of uh just reducing the um ability to kind of fake the love the level of support or the level of popularity or something um and it definitely does kind of will have to involve a kind of moving away from essentially treating every account as though it's the same um but then kind of moving beyond that like there's a real there's real challenges and it's harder and a lot of it will just involve a kind of some kind of active defense uh so you know if someone pushes uh some position then it's kind of on the responsibility of someone else to kind of actively figure out a kind of points to what exactly is wrong with it and for that to get signal boosted and so forth uh so i don't think there's one silver bullet i think there's kind of a bunch of things that can help we'll see that makes a lot of sense and uh and something both uh juan and belgium touched on earlier in their answers but um there's a lot of questions on that we're getting on kind of what are actually really good business models for these decentralized networks i mean tokens are one one you kind accept that ads are not going to die um likely but do you think that fundamentally the way the uh the onus on the payments and the cost of like subsidizing the system being in a way positioned towards the users who are consuming the platform kind of will prevent people to connect positively and interact like do you think that actually becomes a problem in the network itself growing or are there alternatives to sustaining a network like that i mean i think i think what the current social media world got extremely good at was reducing the friction coefficients around sharing material and sharing content and signing up for the platforms those were the gating those were the main gating factors and so they built their entire kind of growth teams and so on oriented around getting more content and causing more content to appear and more people to sign up and all that kind of stuff and i think what's gonna shift now is that we now care a lot more about other other friction coefficients we now care about making making it high friction to cause the battles that uh that biology is pointing out that those kinds of like you know kind of harassment and attacks and so on um become more thoughtful and more um as opposed to just kind of like the these devolved arguments that just are basically useless and just uh just a dissipate time um and so i think uh thinking modeling the system and the friction coefficients everywhere might help somebody uh build a much better better system that tunes the incentives the right way um and gets and that includes the the when you think about a business model um that will power this thing whatever it might it might be um think of the person coefficients associated with a business model and what parties might be trying to benefit from the business model so for example right now um the the spread of information and the the the utility to to something like facebook of having a very imp incendiary article is so high because it brings so many people to the platform um that they let slide all kinds of stuff that that uh that another platform might totally uh put the brakes on um and that's because that's where the business model is and so um modeling the the the behaviors that you want to see and what you want to have happen and the friction coefficients around those and then modeling the the behaviors that the business model might engender and the friction conversations around that might yield it might help you understand what what you're trying what you should really be building and making then making sure that what the thing you're building actually fits that model is a whole other whole other problem yeah i agree with one a lot actually here in the sense of um you know when there are like like like a like a fight on um you know a social media platform um is a pin the ass and is a negative sum in you know arguably for the world um but it is uh even though it's negative for the world of the various actors that are getting something out of it twitter is getting something out of it selling ads right you millions of views you know and you know like it's basically like a boxing match or whatever right both both parties have you know some cuts but you know the promoter sold some seats right and um i think that that term in the equation if you actually go and write out you know the game theory of the payoff matrix you have something where uh yeah i mean it's it's almost like stealing money in the sense of you know you're making these two parties poorer but twitter itself is gaining i'm not saying it's like intentionally like that but when you are just optimizing for engagement overall else and you've got page views without any kind of moral dimension to it um you know that there's there's an issue there right and so i think that where it gets interesting is you start including those missing terms in the equation and asking can we quantify what is happening offline uh can we quantify what is happening in the world and potentially add some future time orientation to it right so i'll give one example that i've been thinking a great deal about which is um you know can we have folks declare their values right uh so you know let's say you're funding a new media site how do you know that it doesn't you know just descend into cake memes and and click bait right um because that's what the news cycle is right and you know er every everybody who sets up a media site you have some high-floating you know idea of what it's going to be but if you're if you're actually chasing profit you have to pay the bills you need page views and so you kind of get pulled into the slowest common denominator thing so and that's the same as a social media site right so what do you do well one possibility is you define that like a this is one one sketch of an idea feel free to you know critique it or whatever but you define a values.text file which has the keywords that you are trying to drive positive sentiment for over five years for example uh let's say you're trying to solve you know climate change with technology so the the keywords you'd be trying to boost would be like uh fusion energy smart grid solar panels electric cars you know carbon scrubbing whatever stuff like that right and um crucially what you could then do is you could take in your values.text with these 10 or 15 keywords or 100 whatever and then you score it against every piece of content on the site you take your rss feed and you pull every post every uh every tweet every video etc and you pull the captions and you score it and you get a table of uh keywords by posts and each entry is either gray because you didn't mention that keyword or it's green because you set it with a positive sentiment or it's red whereas negative sentiment and the idea is that you know you also track in the population at large sentiment over time and you see if it's rising from 1 to 5 to 20 of the population what's the point here the point here is that um you would now have values constrained page views where if you cranked out listicles and q a and so on it would be on fusion energy right so your content would be constrained to basically fit within the self-declared values and it wouldn't just be sort of the amoral search of clicks but it'd be a cause that you had self-defined in advance you're going to stick to for a period of time right and the the thesis is that actually creates more value for society over time because it's not just the head snapping memoryless you know look over here look over there aspect of twitter you're actually declaring a long-term objective that you're going to work towards over years or even even longer than that right and i think something along those lines of restoring long-term value orientation and value creation so values.txt kind of has a dual meaning here right um will hopefully create more wealth in the long run so you know like a burning building or a fight gains engagement but it also destroys value creating value should create more short-term value as well if you can figure out how to how to make the maturity functions match up you know so that's that's something i've thought a lot about that's a really interesting concept oh um i'd love to learn more about that after um just to kind of ask the last question here and we can uh kind of conclude this panel uh for each of you um what's going to be your first post on on the new decentralized social media platform of your choice or your dreams with all the features that you want and what would be the first thing you're going to publish there and i will we'll start that with the vitalik what would you uh like to talk about when that happens what would i like to talk about on the decent on the decentralized social media what would what would be your first post on that new decentralized platform of your dreams i see a comment i'm saying oh flame softball question see the problem is that like the vague questions are always the hardest like you know you get into this mode where like you're always afraid of not coming up with an answer that's clever enough and then it just becomes so extremely terrible um okay rick ashley no you broke me um i don't know i mean really realistically it'll just be like a blog post about math or whatever so i'm gonna uh i'm gonna um use the question to to give some advice for for folks and so i'll claim that probably not going to do this but they claim that the post that i would write would be a post about uh giving advice to people trying to build this stuff so um i would say that uh that uh i would be a post talking about how media both kind of like their traditional media structures and social media which are kind of like intertwined um we really need to think of them as like as universal public utilities so not international not national utilities not international utilities not even transnational really think bigger think of something that's kind of humanity-oriented um and think of the incentive structures behind that um and think of building mechanisms and systems that are that don't put too much uh stock in any one nation's perspective but enables those nations in those local jurisdictions to build their own subnets with their own rules and then people should be able to opt in or opt out of those and exit and move between those um and so i think systems right now are way too overfitting of specific nations that happen to have a lot of power and that's giving that's creating really bad structures that other nations are exploiting and so the nationalism problem that we're seeing play out in in media and disinformation campaigns and like you know uh side note uh go and watch like the amazing interviews with xkgb spies about the disinformation campaigns they're amazing and you can see what's going on right now and related to that that's uh just straight up uh but we really think about systems that are resistant to that kind of stuff and um and and think of the role of of of journalism and of uh journalists and and the people and publishers and so on as as uh as vectors for good information that needs to be moved around where good is kind of defined by those subnets or defined globally and in kind of the global version it's kind of an objective truth perspective versus in those subnets it's kind of an intersubjective truth to those groups and think of think of the role of of those folks in those um networks uh and how to how to promote really good good high quality uh things to appear because it's not about like we've shown that quantity can happen and we've shown the problems that happen because of quantity it's a really really focus on on on quality um and then also remember that uh that uh um privacy of information is a really critical thing and we sort of lost that right now and and these systems are accumulating a huge amount of information that uh will probably come back and haunt a lot of people meaning um the 21st century is long uh we're at the beginning of it and the 20th century uh also looked really nice at the beginning but turned really bad and it could be that the 21st century turns really bad as well and there's a lot of information online that is easily accessible by a lot of people that could make that could cause a lot of problems and so pay attention to that and be careful with that and move the world into much more synonymous kind of behavior where digital identities actually decoupled from from physical human identity as much as we can um we kind of the pendulum swung too far into into making pseudonymc disappear um and then i would probably give give uh give a a uh you know just a call for for just doing this with there's a ton of people that went into journalism too because they really care about the truth and they really care about about um protecting um uh they disadvantaged communities and protecting and and getting getting much better um quality outcomes for for their groups uh for their nation and so on and and you know the entire history of journalism is filled with incredible important advances and improvements that came simply because there was a series of articles that that caused some important change to happen and so just recall that that's the point and that even though right now the the entire media incentive structure is kind of messed up both in in traditional media and in social media and let's figure out how we can return to to build a system that promotes that and and where and acknowledges that now anybody can be anybody can be one of those uh one of these publishers and journalists as long as you as you build a good audience and you and you are good at what you do um and so that's building a system that can that can promote high quality outcomes through that uh i think will be will be one of the better uses of time that you could have for the next five years so if you really care about this like stick with it and help build like a much better public utility and maybe just to conclude with libology any advice or your first post on a new centralized decentralized platform what would that be my first post on a decentralized platform i'm sorry uh like can you like what would i post would be my first post on on like the decentralized facebook yes of your dreams yeah i hacked the question to like pontificate for a while so feel free to do the same oh um sorry yeah i didn't have the context um but my first post be uh probably um a task of some kind to get people to start doing productive work um you know so that like they would actually create something i think you know just to riff on this for a second um you know wikipedia is an example of collaborative work on the internet and you know you in a google doc you can have multiple people editing at the same time um and you know there's um operational transformation has been an algorithm for a while uh in terms of uh something that you can do to to take a bunch of different contributions and link them together but there's now new things called conflict-free replicated data types which actually make it you know a little bit easier from a programming standpoint to build something like a google docs um my point is that i think taking that stuff and merging it with um crypto and with social networks you might have something where the fundamental unit of action is not just oh let me tweet something or let me put up an instagram post or something like that but oh let me give a unit of work that's a remunerated unit of work that can be merged into a larger hole for example writing a book in a decentralized way documenting a code base um annotating something etc right so that would be something i'd like to see you know first post in a decentralized social network that um doesn't just give us these benefits of you know like like self-sovereignty but actually starts using the internet as a way for us to to build useful things online together awesome it was a i was really hoping you would say uh keywords from gpthree they'll just make the post itself and just post it but i'll take that answer too um but uh with that i want to thank all three of you so much for being with us and going a little bit over time to answer everybody's questions and and i'll be part of this panel so uh italic biology one thanks so much and uh really appreciate all your time thank you thanks thank you this is a really fun conversation
