[Applause] [Music] check attention ladies and gentlemen ethos an opening ceremony is beginning in five minutes in the revolution main stage please proceed to the revolution main stage for the opening ceremonies [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music] [Music] [Applause] are you ready for phase one [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I believe it's ladies and gentlemen the opening ceremony is beginning in one minute and the revolution main stage please come into the revolution main stage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah I think so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ever [Music] [Music] people I'll give you my yeah Oh [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay we are ready to rock and roll so let's do it like this clap once if you can hear me clap three times if you can hear me clap five times if you can hear me I was gonna do prime numbers but I forgot to was a prime and one is not a prime I messed up in any case welcome to East Boston thank you all for being here we are very excited to be here so my name is Reese landmark we are in Harvard right now but I work for MIT and therefore yeah exactly um and this is Karthik from youth global yeah and we are going to be here to kind of give you an overview in these opening ceremonies over the weekend you're gonna do a lot of hacking and workshops and there's gonna be food and sleep and all kinds of good things and right now we just want to give you an overview I'm like what Etha Liz and Karthik we'll talk about that a second we're gonna dive into some of the sponsors and kind of what they're up to and then do a couple of key notes about aetherium in the future of eath 2.0 and scaling and things like that so let's kick things off with Kartik thanks Rhys so I want to do a quick survey by show of hands who has been to any global event before that's almost half the room and the best thing about this survey is that we actually like seeing not a lot of hands up because the goal for hit global is to get a lot more developers into this ecosystem so a lot of you already know what the global is we actually run events like these all over the world and our goal is to get more developers kind of testing and experimenting and playing with the etherium and usually we do this in the form of hackathons all over the world or if this is our first time in Boston this is also our 13th event and the best thing about these events is that they're based on sort of these values that we kind of put on all of all these events a lot of these events kind of want you to explore an inner creativity and they make you focus on building what you want we don't want you to solve particular problems it's not focused on specific tracks it's what you want to feel like doing we want to be able to support that from a technical standpoint as well as a UX and any sort of other mentorship we believe in showing is more important than telling this is a hackathon you will be sort of presenting your projects to a lot of judges on Sunday but the key thing is that it's about showing the progress so even if something doesn't work you still get to talk to them about hey this is what we wanted to do this is what we got it's not the perfect condition but this is what we have so it's a lot more about making the actual demo and in the code versus a PowerPoint this is a place for all of us to learn and mentor each other and learn from each other and sort of grow as developers a lot of these events have a good mix of Tech Talks workshops people who are super experienced as well super new to the city ecosystem and this becomes an opportunity for you to learn from each other most importantly this is a hackathon not a conference we try to minimize the number of talks that happen over the course of the weekend we kind of reserved certain sections for talks and in workshops so you get to actually focus on building and this is what we think is a lot more important and the best part of it is that all these things we do that to increase sort of creativity as well as decrease the feedback loop in this developer ecosystem this is about making this ecosystem better and we do that by actually telling others what is and isn't working so Pete Boston this is our 13th event and I'm super excited we used to to tell you oh my god it's a lobster corn lobsters are from Massachusetts I did not sign up for this nice you can play with them as a sword say hi to the lobster corn and buy one oh hi mr. lobster mrs. Orr it's whatever you are okay it did - can you high-five me can you see me yes you can enjoy your goodies that you've received there's a special gift inside of there's not anything inside of it - I have no idea what is inside yeah well thank you mister ever mrs. lobster corn and goodbye and maybe see you later this week and cool there are 400 so here a teeth Boston there is there are 400 attendees one lobster corn if that did not make it on the slide there are of the attendees that are here 21% of you said that you're advanced that you've done a lot of coding with aetherium before 46% of you almost half of you said that you're intermediate and then a lot of you 21% are beginners and 13 are just totally new to aetherium so that's kind of what you all look like here and we really have attendees from all corners of the world so of course we are in the United States of America so a lot of us are from the US a 66% but 15% are here from Asia the Middle East Africa 8% from Europe 6% from Canada 4% from Latin America let me just get a a cheer if you drop if you were came here from more than an hour away so if cheer if you're more than our way cool thank you for coming I biked here and I will bike home tonight and with that I think that we have Kartik to chat a little bit more on the attendees in the hackers but we also have over 20 companies here as sponsors and mentors and they're offering over $65,000 in prizes so that's going to be amazing and you can see all of that on deaf post and kind of go on the bus and website to check out we also have over 23 workshops where you get to actually learn a handful of how to use a handful of ApS in protocols and SDKs and and a lot more kind of workshops for people who are needy aetherium and then 22 tech saw tech talks that are mostly going to be happening tomorrow afternoon covering a lot of research and implementation and just topics in the space and and with that we have mentors who are experts in defy privacy UX scaling and gaming so if you're building anything in any of these categories there's a lot of people that you can talk to and learn from and get help from so we also have a handful of sponsors that would like to come invite up onstage and they're gonna just come on and talk about what they've done who they are kind of why they're here and sort of anything that help you out with so I'm gonna start calling a handful of you up on stage if you are a sponsor a piece you just kind of line up here on my left and we'll kind of get started so the first step I would like to call up Tia from Metaxa [Applause] hello hackers I'm the co-founder of Tex and network we are building a lair to smart contracts platform so I will start to describe as a problem we are solving using one question suppose one day block the public ball chains have 1 million transaction per second scalability is this net does this necessarily mean we can build a more meaningful applications on it well not necessarily there are a lot of other factors other than scalability affecting the usability of plantains for example time and space resources as long as smart contracts on layer 1 are very simple programs very simple logics the time and space are strictly limited due to the contents of the Magnusson you know your guests will swim between the if you try to delay more time and also 35 35 kilobytes per block and also the response latencies and so that's all because of consistent mechanism and also the functionalities are limited to basic scripting and crypto set it's mostly because of the consistency requirement and also the nature of applications on public blockchain today are more about information transparency stuff like a token economy or client games I know this is not a very fair comparison between your centralized and centralized but the Appel shows the cost of a trust and you know even even the most popular games in the work they are not information transparency like a Texas Hold'em or Starcraft they are information asymmetric and what I would like to say that the applications be purely otherwise kind of entire applications that means some features are just not very suitable to be implemented on layer 1 so that we propose a layered architecture for the future the apps that is we put the high performance and privacy-preserving business logics of chain well we only put the immutable values layer one blow chains to put the immutable and the persistent states just like when you are building a centralized service you will not implement everything using C code language and database you will have a back-end and you detaches a business logic and the final States and that's also our philosophy only when you need to put of some something final we're they we need to generate a bow chain transaction okay let me begin with a very simple hello world application called a millionaire problem you may already heard heard of it that is to millionaires so I want to compare who is richer without revealing their actual wealth and it's a very abstract problem for classic computing and secure multi-party accommodation and is the solution Texan ever uses is trusted icy ocean environment te we'll discuss later in our workshops and so basically both all the layers of smart contract entrance is from a UI l which is multi head multi hash and compatible with ipfs and both party will submit a request including encrypted data and even the computation provider will not be able to see your privacy and also we migrate a the entire pricing interpreter environment inside the trusted excluding environments you can see a there is a there there is a mac UI or maybe you can handle each route passives in different functions and you can take a request and output your output your result using response it's basically very looks like is look it's looks very similar to a traditional back-end service but it's only difference we are also trustless you can always guarantee so server is executing the code you desired and you know you can always guarantee the service provider will not be able to see your privacy and you can always guarantee we are giving the correct result okay and you know if you can make a millionaire problem you can basically make some interesting games such as blackjack or even Texas Hold'em and you can even pet many ways it how do we generate eleven transactions from layer two so we supposed support something called transactional syndication token which allows you to sign to sign to make to melt to authorize a transaction in Larry to and you know it's more like a commit reveal protocol will introduce later in the workshop and you can build a lot of interesting things with privacy confidentiality and we also support a lot of third-party libraries from - and for today's hackathon we suggest you to make something like games especially those with information asymmetry and also you can build something interesting like exchange your contact list to find your mutual friends without revealing each other's exactly contact so a lot of lots of applications with performance and privacy issues that you'll be able to solve on text and network and yeah at last I want to say that web submission webs ray will not be real as if we only have static storage and the very simple information transparent smart contracts there's another cornerstone which is dynamic service applications on Web Store it's very needed for the vision of web story and that is what we envision and that is the goal of text and network and you are welcome to heck with us today and you are also very welcome to heck with us in the future and please join our discord for more informations thank you Thank You Chuck sir next up we have Jack from scale please welcome jack hello all right so who's hacking this weekend all right awesome so scale is happy to be here and and to provide support let's get right to bounties okay so with two lines of two lines of code you can deploy tasks ale run sub second block times use decentralized storage and more which I'll get to in a minute but we have to 1,000 dinars will be awarding this weekend and for 500 dinars okay we've had a great time this year there's already been 31 submissions at Eve hackathons this year I would recommend going to dev posts and sort by scale you can see some of the cool things built a lot of awesome things where we're seeing smart contracts execute quickly and seeing high throughput so please check it out so how do you win okay so first off who here is familiar with scale okay some people all right well we make it really easy for you to run your smart contracts and do transactions connected to aetherium in a scale chain so one way we do this is with smart contracts with site it's essentially a side chain it's an elastic side chain and in two lines of code you can deploy your smart contract to the scale chain the second way is through entertained messaging you can design your side chain to work back and forth with a main net and run ithi RC 2721 and die so we'll be talking about that later tonight you can run storage so without using IP FS you can use a scale chain to do decentralized storage and lastly and sorry the slides a little messed up I think as it got ported to Google Docs but you can run machine learning in a scale smart contract so this is new we just rolled this out you can take pre trained tensor flow models and move them in to e VM and do price price prediction fraud detection image recognition we'll be talking about this later so lastly let's go here I don't have time to go through the scale network but what I want to do is welcome all of you to come to our booth and learn about how we use randomness rotation and incentives to let you deploy securely to a scale chain it's very different than a traditional sidechain we can also talk about how microservices and containers are leveraged within each skill node but lastly and we could talk about how there's enterprise configuration components built into the scale architecture so you can deploy resources to your liking but the best way to learn about how scale works is well first let me ask you has anyone ever seen a workshop play probably a few people okay so chadwick and christine at 10 p.m. they're going to be putting on in a workshop but in a play format so it'll be fun we're gonna build some digital cakes and you'll see how you can deploy a scale okay thanks everybody next up we have a check from binding sex please welcome to check on stage thank you carding how many of you have heard of binding sex oh wow impressive this was just launched last week so okay either you're lying or you're actually know about it so let me give you a quick overview what what is fine is act so we're a new initiative that is formed to foster innovation on the finest platform and general ecosystem in large so we're not just funding stuff on a you know but things that are built on the finest platform where we're happy to you know fun stuff outside that ecosystem where exchange by 400 something pairs so we like to see stuff happen outside our ecosystem as well so what is the bi'ness platform so we've grown over time over the past two two-plus years to have all these products all these development facing products so we acquired trust last year we launched the finance decks we of course have the central exchange comm with the api's and then we also launched a binding charity which has most people don't know that we have a way to track last mile donations using the blockchain so when we launch at if we thought about how we want to engage developer and we thought about from the developers perspective what they want to do when it come to a platform so they want to learn how to build and plan they want to interact and collaborate with their fellow developers and then they want to get the support from finance the platform provider so we kind of organize our stuff or activities around those three things you know the first ones learned where we organized occupation agreed on occupation a finance stuff into one place and we participate you know offline stuff like boot camps and hackathons like this and we want to expand the community of finance and blockchain developers in general and then we want to kind of enable you guys to collaborate and and and you know kind of work together so on a website we have you know forums and job boards and RFPs we are J BP's finance evolution proposal which is like the EIP equivalent on for the binding chain which is community proposals for how to improve the binding chain where they have some of these working groups we have RFP on the website so this will be very relevant for for this hackathon we have some skunk works projects which I couldn't talk about yet and and we have a Vangelis program which is just launched to kind of have people you know at universities mostly to kind of help us reach out to developers in those communities so the last part is how we support developers so we have a bunch of programs some of which you might have heard of by net sex has the file share program I know some fellows are here how many fellows are here I know I just - one okay the rest of fellows are in the salon it's but is an open source grants program where we support we give out a grant free money to support open source department in blockchain space the idea there is - we want to see more building blocks in the in the ecosystem that people can use to put together more blockchain service or apps we have our forty fellows for the forty fellowship project and about 50 to 60 fellows in this program already since we launched about April this year you can check them out on a website people like you know Austin Griffith this part is a finance fella there's Hamad over there who is the - fella a few other people you might know of course Launchpad is RI yo platform which you might already be familiar with and then bi'ness lapses our investment arm where we invest do direct investments in new projects and then of course internally we have partnership groups and then strategic investment and M&A teams that look at things that are very G to us or things that are mutually beneficial to both the project and finance itself and will come up with other preferred Deval programs over time and so we have a new slider we're gonna put out every two weeks and this is the URL the telegram group actually we also have a mailing list that you can sign up for on the website just T dot me slash minus X underscore newsletter if you want to take a photo of it or visit the booth you know and then we'll tell you the URL so if Boston prizes we're gonna basically give out fellowship grants for basically just generic best apps or services the average to buy this platform is very very open we don't you don't necessarily have to build stuff on an RFP RFP there are two RFPs we have on a website one is Rp for the binding chain and then there's RP for the Africa initially we have a Uganda exchange and there's a bunch of our projects we're trying to trying to build stuff with a for Africa continent for African use cases so there's a bunch of stuff they're small but we're open to any idea especially ideas that you think it's useful for other developers are useful for that could get traction with the user community yeah this is the RFP you can easily find finding on our website which is by NSX not deaf and I'm doing workshop tomorrow morning right after breakfast in this room be 108 I'll talk more about in detail more about what we're building other decks and and.com API is and trust wallet you know Intel so come by if you're interested thank you next time next up we have Dan from idea thanks okay hi I'm Dan I'm with I do for this view aren't aware the I do is a 40 year old design firm I'm from the IDO collab team which is a small team with an I do that just largely focused on crypto so idea is all about having these multiple multidisciplinary teams we got known for designing the original Apple Mouse there's like a shopping cart video of idea Raymond in the shopping cart that's really popular but really what I do is known for is developing this field of human centered design so one of our founders David Kelly also started the Stanford d.school and we think that really it's important to start with thinking about the desirability of anything you're building for any venture to be successful you need to have this intersection of desirability viability and feasibility and I think often in this community we we focus very heavily on like is this technically feasible and we kind of leave the other two circles it's a little bit later we're really pushing to get more people to start thinking about users early on so I do today works with a wide range of very large global companies but our team is focused again very specifically on crypto on decentralized web and blockchain applications so we have recently launched a startup studio for blockchain entrepreneurs and let's see we've been investing and building in this space since 2015 but this startup studio that we recently launched you can think of it like an accelerator program but unbundled so rather than having a cohort or class of companies that comes in we have this series of half day and day-long events that are focused on very specific things such as how to do proper user testing how to work through product validation how to do hiring for designers how to scale an organization and we have a long list of partners that we work with in various ways bunch of VC mentors from some top firms in the in the industry and there is no cost for startups to participate in this program we're pretty selective in terms of how we go through and select people to participate but we don't ask for any equity there's no charge this is our way of helping to push the community forward and so we're hopeful that some of the projects that get built here this weekend should you decide to go forward and pursue turning them into ventures that you will come and talk to us about ways that we can help you do that and move forward together so check out a little bit more about the program at IDO Kolob comm slash startup studio we've got a table I'll be giving a talk tomorrow morning about how you can try to get more users into your application and retain them by getting them to that magic moment a little faster also for those of you who may be students or kind of freelancers in between things we're gonna be having a maketh on which is kind of ideas version of a hackathon there's an application that's out there right now applications are due by September 15th come to the table there's some information about there it's a chance to come for if you come to the makeup on and you get selected you're invited to a two-week paid fellowship in January and then there's also a longer summer fellowship that you've been hired to go for as well so thanks and combine me makes you understand that's super cool actually next up we have Alex from square link please welcome Alex hey guys who wants me to skip all of my slides and go straight to the Bounty's you idiots I was an empty promise so what is squirreling square link is an end-to-end onboarding solution for DAPs to attract mainstream users into your applications so basically we provide a standard web 3 provider you can integrate it into your application as easily as if as if you're integrating madam asked at the end of the day once you integrate square link into your application all of your users will be able to register login signed transactions signed messages recover even recover their account just using an email and password and we still keep everything completely non-custodial so just decided to keep it short and sweet we'll go straight to the bounties so for the team who has the most innovative use case for square-link we're offering 2500 in ES for the best user experience 500 in eath and for the team that has the most complete integration another 500 and ES and for that last one be sure to check out our documentation there's like a lot more functionality outside of our standard web 3 providers so sums of stuff you can do a square link so check it out now the main events so if you look if you look at the top left hand corner you'll see we actually only have one engineer and he's actually like kind of attractive so I guess on that note we're we're hiring like crazy DevOps full-stack front end support QA so if you're interested at all just will be will be hosting interviews throughout the event so just schedule an interview on my Kalin plea come say hi to us we'll be at our booth 24/7 yeah cool thanks Alex and our last sponsor on stage please welcome Sam from Thunder core thank you now I have no slides so I'm not even gonna have to say hey if we want to skip all the slides it's just that it's just thunder quark so I'm Sam from thunder core clap if you've heard of thunder core oh I was a little worried that that was not gonna turn out well so the Thunder core is a blockchain we focus ideally on two main improvements over a lot of other block trains out there number one our transactions we have your clock regularly at 1200 transactions per second which is great and the second thing is is our confirmation finality time sub-second so that means that if you are using our platform if you're using our stuff you could actually have an experiment an experience much like venmo I actually ran an experiment up at truffle con about a month ago where I was giving out titi dye our equivalent stable coin to dye to people and would do a garage sale experience it was pretty awesome so that's who we are now we have a booth out there you can come by say hi get some t-shirts get some hats I see a hat in the audience so thank you for wearing that and then if you have any questions about us what we do don't hesitate to let me know thank you very much that's thunder core okay thank you so much so in addition to those sponsors we have and really I just want to emphasize just like these sponsors they make the event happen you're gonna get free food all over the weekend they're the venue all of the bounties and prizes lost stuff so I'm going to say all the sponsors and but there are a lot as Karthik mentions so hold your applause until the end and then we'll give them a big round of applause okay so the sponsors are so we have scale and new cypher and thunder core and square-link and I do collab in taxa and off chain labs in um a we have Algar and Oasis labs my ether wallet aka Moo enigma consensus coinbase Taurus ans seller we got quorum which is the one that doesn't have any words accomplice I I did that beforehand quorum accomplice provable Aztec by Nance X rivet abridged foam and we have our partners which are like people that do this for all of the eath global events kind of not just Boston and that's aetherium Foundation Matic provable UNICEF scale Thunder core E&S torus 0x consensus off gene labs new cipher in the Bounty's Network I think that's all yeah let's go back okay so give them all around the block we just want to press next so this is fine Albert's gonna come up in a second so so aetherium actually is one of these sort of innovations that's kind of come up in a long time that actually excited a lot of people and and the potential for like what it can be is is kind of super vast which kind of gets us into this situation we're like we don't really know what the best use case is or what the best thing you can do with this and just and generally measure what the potential or the possible sort of things that we can leverage this this technology is so to kind of share some of the thoughts on like what the to live here IAM itself it could be i want to call out albert me from the third foundation to do stage please welcome albert cool alright one second awesome thanks everyone for coming so you know we're in a college town decided to do a bit of a tribute to my college experience we're gonna do a bit of like a fire hose survey we're gonna go really really fast through a bunch of different ways to look at it today i'm not gonna be able to spend as much time as I'd like to on most of these topics but hopefully give you some interesting food for thought and would love to talk more about each of these things later so first one quick not super important but just brief intro of myself studied math and CS pretty close to here at MIT back in the day I live in San Francisco I have fun experience real early at a company called Dropbox learned a lot there did some other stuff afterward and been helping eutherian foundation for the past couple of years so like I said with today's talk we're going to go through a bunch of different perspectives but before even diving into the specific perspectives like why is this important I think one of the reasons it's important is when you have a complex topic it's valuable to take different perspectives to try to better understand it and if you think it's like oh no it's not gonna be that hard to understand this well I decided to dig up some fun quotes from you know about 27 years ago first we have ironically the inventor of Ethernet has nothing to do with aetherium but it did have a lot to do with the Internet so it's kind of an interesting to see a quote from the inventor of Ethernet about the Internet here's something about yeah you know retraining 250 million people who's ever gonna do that for the Internet this was a bit longer but it's basically like my local mall is doing more business than like the entire internet like blah blah blah and I almost felt bad including this he's gotten a lot of crap for this but you know Paul Krugman's infamous quote I do want to be clear I'm not trying to compare blockchain or aetherium to the Internet like that alone would be the exact opposite of I think what like we should be doing actually what I'm trying to get at is you know a lot of you probably heard of the parable of the blind man and the elephant right the idea is like in these different blind men touch different parts of an elephant they all get they all have incomplete and incorrect views on what they're touching and and if you think about like trying to predict the future or see where things are going it's kind of analogous to this so that's why I decided to try to take this like multi-perspective angle and the first one is just history as saying often goes history doesn't repeat but it does rhyme and started with a quote from just a couple of weeks all right maybe it's like two months ago now from Balaji on Twitter but yeah I think looking at the past is often just as fascinating as trying to think about what the future can be and so one thing I thought about recently was imagine being there for typing on a keyboard and like seeing like letters appear on the screen like for the first time like obviously this is natural to us today but imagine being there for like that first moment well when I thought about I was like actually probably a lot of people didn't care a lot of people were like yeah we can already do this with a typewriter you know what's the big deal if you think through like even just moving data around right like many people in this room are probably too young to have used many if any of the the first few things here but there's been quite an evolution through the years for the way people move things around I remember you know my family was not well off the one thing that we would invest very heavily in was technology and my parents talked about how when I was two they spent six hundred dollars to buy a 20 megabyte hard drive for the first computer that I had as a kid I was really fortunate that they cared enough to do that but you just think about that for him I mean still better than storing stuff on a theory right now it's a lot of money or not very much so another thing I think it's interesting when you look to take a historical perspective is you have this like imitation thing that goes on and as they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it gets even more interesting when the imitation doesn't make any sense so one of my favorite throwback examples is how JavaScript was originally named mocha and it was renamed to JavaScript because Java totally separate language works very differently was extremely popular at the time they're like alright yeah we're javascript now it's the most used programming language in the world so kind of like an interesting parallel here you have solidity which is many of you may know it's used to write it's one of the ways you can write contracts and aetherium it's use the interface with the athenian virtual machine syntax was like motivated a lot by javascript because of javascript popularity even though I think coding and solidity is probably better thought of as like writing well you know bash scripts it you probably don't want to take a front-end developer kind of mindset when building stuff and etherium not that it stops a lot of people but hey that's that's where we're at I'm just like it's a fun fact even like the creator of JavaScript where it's on the brave browser it's actually a great browser if you haven't tried it you don't need a blockchain to be using the browser but it was funded by a token issued on a theory and it's like I said history doesn't repeat but it rhymes all those lines there's this like performance optimization ryan throughout history I'm just gonna go a little bit more quickly here but in 2005 when I started MIT I remember there was this kind of like contrarian narrative that performance optimization was going to matter anymore it kind of made sense at the time like computers just kept getting faster and faster and it's like yeah you could performance optimized but you could also make things more readable or more accessible in other ways are you even going to need to like optimize things that much in another 10 years of course then the smartphone revolution came along and all of a sudden everyone had this like slow computer with even slower internet and performance optimization started to matter again and now we've got you know blockchain computing just like basically going all the way back to the beginning it's pretty much punch card computing or mainframe computing so now the second respect I'm gonna take is is an engineer's perspective right and one thing that found really fascinating over the last 15 years is how much software engineering has changed I remember talking somebody about building stuff on a theory and a really bright kid a wonderful person but I was like how could you possibly write code and then like you know put us on this blockchain and you're not gonna be able to change it afterwards it just seemed impossible and I was like oh yeah yes you probably have never used a cd-rom right like how do you think when people issued software on CD ROMs like how are they going to update it back back then and it's because like the software engineering companies today have become much more safe environments which is great it's made software engineering a lot more accessible on the other hand blocking engineering it's kind of like going from the city to the jungle it's an unsafe coding environment and one of the reasons for this is because computing on blockchain is you're sort of imposing some laws of physical reality on to the virtual world it's like why you can have scarcity for instance and so I I often note that I'm not sure thinking about writing software on aetherium is like should be thought of as software engineering it's kind of more like building Hardware than software and along those lines you know I am confident I am optimistic about the future of blockchain based systems because you know we can build cars you can build bridges skyscrapers space shuttles and I think we can build systems that are complex yet reliable on blockchain as well but we're gonna have to you know use very different best practices than the ones that we're using today the third perspective is the research perspective so block chains are often considered inefficient but they're actually very efficient at what they fundamentally do they allow like a lot of distinct just like nodes or entities to come to probabilistic consensus about something you don't need to know everyone else in the network you don't need to be connected to everyone you know when I was taking distributed algorithms at MIT you're like working with 50 nodes and you were assuming they're all on the same network and all this other stuff and now you can have you know 10,000 and more nodes coming to consensus with with very high probability using like a lot of the principles that power block chains it's just that when you try to then do more stuff on top of this there's these other factors that make them a lot less efficient and what another thing that I think is interesting is from a research perspective well cryptography as many of you know it uses computational hardness as its fundamental building block like the fact that it's hard to do certain things is actually good because that's what allows us to have cryptography and building on top of it and crypto economics which is like kind of what block chains bring into the equation they bring in this like economic component which essentially gives you more like knobs and dials to work with it uses this like economic or incentive based or game theoretical hardness as like it's fundamental building block in addition to using cryptography and and other things like that and so just overall I found it fascinating that in an aetherium a blockchain context I've run into some of the things that I really never thought I'd see again after college after I decided I wasn't going to you know and it'll be like on math PhD or whatever quick examples be like four months little theorem or just like any abstract algebra never thought I'd see any of that again zero knowledge proves I would bring them up his party at party so they thought it made me sound cool but actually probably have the opposite effect is like hey you know you can like there's this thing called a zero knowledge proof and if I like you know put this like ball behind my back and do this over like what are you talking about and then even just a professor Ron Rivest who I saw last May at this vdf Day event that I can talk more about if you grab me later on so it's been cool that you know watching aetherium has brought some of these things back into my life and overall etherium and other blockchain systems have just done a lot to stimulate cryptography and zero knowledge proof research and development as well as just a distributed systems and and consensus and and stuff like that and so moving along we've got the computing stack perspective right when I think about the most interesting technical environments I've been in the seminole like experience for me was when I was 12 I built a computer well I mean I didn't really build it I just bought a bunch of parts there's an excuse as a school project get my parents to pay for you know all this stuff but I bought a bunch of parts to plug them together you know you have to like make sure everything fit you like a tower and all that and it always left me with this memory like yeah computers a thing you can take apart a computer is a thing that has pieces and each of those pieces themselves can then be taken apart and then always stuck with me you know even when I worked at Dropbox what I thought was interesting was I never really had to go that deep into the stack and Dropbox is already a fairly complex like software engineering system by modern standards like there's a desktop app which very few products have nowadays it had extremely high correctness requirements and even then we were really barely moving outside of this like fairly narrow slice of the computing stack now when I look at blockchain based computing it's really cool to see this opportunity and need to reinvent the entire computing stack I mean it's one thing to be like I'm gonna write a programming language and like no one's gonna use your new programming language nowadays unless it comes with a new context in which it might be like especially useful and so just like smartphones were a new context and a lot of new programming languages and paradigms emerge out of that you might see something like that in in blockchain and similarly the entire developer experience and I mentioned cars and bridges and skyscrapers I like to tell people I would not want to drive across a bridge that was built in JavaScript and so like we're probably gonna have to do a lot more work on that front as well and overall I just see this is the first time in literally decades that so many parts of the computing stack are simultaneously accessible to be worked on in a practical context and I've like thought a lot about hey what would like to be part of the early days of the Internet or operating systems or even just computer computers themselves and I feel really fortunate because in some ways it's like being present for all of those at the same time just in this new context so moving in a different direction for a moment this like legal or game theoretical perspective one thing that the like blockchain and work just being in a blockchain environment has really helped me understand better is so like what is the purpose for instance of the legal system I used to think like oh you know the legal system exists to enforce laws but but now I realize it's actually exists in part to create society-wide confidence that laws will be enforced and we're having a society-wide confidence shifts the equilibrium of how people behave at scale this is what's interesting when you have a big group of people that think differently about something it then has these other macro effects on how they're likely to act and so one things I think is still underrated about blockchains is I'm not sure it's it's totally possibly a removing direction where you can have these anonymous credible commitments for meaningful things that would have been an oxymoron even ten years ago you would have achieved it by using some sort of mutually trusted third-party but overall we're seeing this like new primitive and when you have new primitives that creates new equilibria for new behavior what kind of behavior like you know it's still really really early but it's an exciting prospect a lot of you probably wherever the prisoner's dilemma you don't know what it is I don't have time for to go into it here but I definitely recommend googling and just reading about it it's one of the most fascinating things and one thing that I always try to remind people is the prisoner's dilemma actually is solvable it's just not directly solved in particular you either have to change the payout matrix which involves some sort of communication or maybe even deeper commitment or you have to turn the prisoner's limit into an iterated game in which case it becomes a lot more favorable even if the one-shot game is unfavorable and so again by having this like new type of language that can be built around guarantees instead of promises I don't know if this is actually gonna come through but I've heard people talk about this don't be evil versus can't be evil thing and hopefully we'll be able to see innovations that that can lead to that so the last major perspective is that of talent this is a pretty bold statement but I really think the amount of technical talent blockchain is going to go up a lot and the reason for this is because of a few concepts first top technical talent always wants to work with other top technical talent I mean this one I think is a pretty easy one to understand but another thing to keep in mind is that top technical talent rarely looks for new opportunities they're happy where they are they usually like you know working on interesting stuff and well appreciated where they are and things like that and so if you really want understand what might be coming along you don't want to ask people what they're doing or look at what they're doing you want to say like if you were looking for a change which I know you're not like what would you consider and so counter-intuitively top talent is actually a lagging indicator not a leading indicator it's something that's really important to keep in mind and with that when you see one respected peer become interested in a topic that's worth more than a thousand days of like hype and new cycle so you know I think back to when I joined Dropbox back in 2008 it's like pretty motley crue right and people were like well it's a startup thing that's weird you should be going to grad school she would go into finance you can work at Microsoft whatever and not too many years later you know founders like on the cover of Forbes and people were like oh this startup thing is actually kind of interesting and you know by 2016 it's like it's almost weird if you're not interested in startups so came along pretty quickly so since I think the blockchain based computing is just the most interesting environment that not just software engineers but you know economists cryptographers lawyers probably even multi-level marketers have encountered in a long time it's just a gravity well for different types of people and when more of these people come to like who knows what's going to come out of it so it's my closing thoughts like I said who knows what's going to come out of it right it's not that clear that aetherium is only going to be a part of like solutions to problems I think it's quite possible it's also going to cause a lot of problems whether it's aetherium or other just like programmable blockchain systems so that's something that we just like constantly have to keep in mind again trying to look into the future this blind men and the elephant thing all over again it's important I think for all of us to stay humble and just continue to think about what it is that we're missing what is it that we're not seeing as we like kind of move into this new frontier so it's my final quick perspective remember I said about how like a lot of people don't care probably didn't care the first time like it's like so uh there's this computer terminal thing but what you can do with this computer thing like who even cares about that and I think that that's something important also for everyone here to keep in mind which is almost everyone who's interested in etherium or blockchain stuff today they've crossed essentially this intellectual chasm but the mainstream doesn't care like for the mainstream to actually you know interface with law change we're gonna have to cross a usefulness chasm and so in this sense like blockchain is very different than like Facebook or the internet or whatever where you can be like oh look at the look at the growth numbers well the first 10,000 people on Facebook I know because I was one of them we're doing the base of the same things at the ten millionth person on Facebook was doing they were just like you know looking at each other's photos and posting on each other's walls or whatever and now but the first 10,000 blotching people essentially had some sort of like acid trip if Tiffany type thing about the world and the ten millionth blockchain user is probably not even gonna know that they're using a blockchain so we're gonna have to cross this usefulness chasm that's why it's awesome to be at a hackathon yeah and hopefully you know as we look at it there iam in 2019 as we keep building and growing together we'll see a very different aetherium five years from now so thank you whoo-hoo Thank You Albert uh and I guess I just want to note as well for Albert I mean he does a lot of just behind-the-scenes work within the etherium foundation and it's a lot of work to operate a decentralized network of people and I think he's done a good job so with that we that's kind of a very wide take on kind of the future of a theory and how it connects to the Internet and those kinds of things and what we want to do now is kind of dive more deeply into aetherium specifically in some of the technical like scalability challenges that theorems dealing with and how we're gonna go through them and so to do that I want to welcome Raoul Jordan to the stage Raul is from prismatic labs he's a protocol developer and he is building the future of etherium 2.0 and he went to Harvard in 2017 so let's welcome her all to the stage awesome so I know we said the numbers or maybe like 25% or 21% of people or new to etherium or a kind of relatively beginner but can we get a quick show of hands just curious who is pretty new to aetherium did you say don't be shy awesome great awesome great to have you all here and it's a pleasure being here fantastic talk over those really awesome points I would love to just go into a little bit more in depth as to kind of where we've come you know how crypto can win and if Scripture wins why did it win if it loses why did it lose and where we're headed how we're gonna get there concretely and efficiently so yeah so I'm gonna theorem protocol developer co-founder prismatic laughs we're working on in a theorem 2.0 implementation that basically is gonna be a radical upgrade that's going to increase the scalability of the platform make it more massively you know accessible to the public have it you know have a better more robust security model code proof of stake as well so this is our team so most of us are here and please come find us after and we'd love to chat love to tell you about some of the challenges we've encountered and where we're headed so yeah when I actually first started learning and had that magic moment with computers was actually the first week of September around six years ago just across the street at a little place called Sanders Theatre in the class called cs50 here at Harvard where they showed us this really cool diagram of what the internet is gonna look like in the future you know they had this they had this really really awesome kind of perspective of having all these different packets of data coming all across the world and it just really felt like something that you know was just truly decentralized truly accessible to people who wanted to interface with this network you know coming to the conclusion that over the next few years I would encounter the internet is very far off from that initial promise that was given to us and have been since trying to find something that could get us closer to that goal as such I discovered aetherium and why should we care about a theorem today why is this something that we should build on at the moment you know to give a little bit quick back and I want to talk a little bit about kind of where we are today I would respect to surveillance States and kind of how this comes into relevance I remember in high school checking our 1984 from the library you know having it recommended having it been like this cool little sci-fi thing it felt really really you know really far off from reality I'm originally from Honduras in the country that has very little access to technology and imagining this sort of you know Big Brother is always watching you sort of thing imagining the concept of doublethink having the own citizens really you know questioned the nature of the reality and kind of accept the doctrine and the dogma of this of this world felt super alien to me in a sense main question is going through my head are how can the people that live in this society ever have allowed this to happen how did these governments even you know coalesce into this shape and form and what led them to be in this current state and really the answer to me was extremely unclear you know humans are super multifaceted you know organisms we have so many different incentives and oftentimes irrational perspectives on life and really I think one of the oldest and most important human emotions is fear and really fear of safety and maintaining people safe you know perhaps sacrificing something in the name of the common good and why that matters so you know we've all been familiar with the concept of like things like Amazon go I mean it's you know we've all used venmo to some extent and it's funny to browse through and see what some of the funny things our friends are spending on but really you know what cost does it come but is this really just a small gesture you know is it is it just something that we should trivially care about or does this have a deeper perhaps a more sinister tone than it seems you know say you know the most common argument is hey I'm a law-abiding citizen why should I care or why does it really even matter to me it's you know is is is kind of like the serious tone of it more like a slippery slope well you know today we see so many stores completely going cashless in fact people say that if cash were invented today it would probably be illegal right in the future we're actually going to go cardless and in the future you might have your transaction being rejected because you are not really authorized to purchase a book and you know this is the sort of reality that kind of gets us closer to that sci-fi perspective right and the thing is that you know at the end of the day the people in charge are really doing this to fit some sort of narrative of protecting the common good protecting the daily you know the daily average life of a law-abiding citizen you know why should they matter this is fitting into a common narrative problem with this is when institutions decide to sacrifice individual freedoms for a common common narrative and for the common good their definition of this is what truly makes a difference and can be extremely extremely dangerous for the first time and I want to really echo this is we have the capability of creating how Albert said these anonymous yet credible systems that don't depend on human trust as a primitive in reality every piece of technology that you know we built we build with assumptions assumptions technical assumptions societal assumptions philosophical assumptions one of the biggest ones that we create every time we write a piece of software is that there is some sort of aspect of trust some sort of anchor that prevents this technology from being kind of misused and has some sort of built-in protections that protects both the end users and the party that created such technology right by default this sort of property and this assumption is something we can throw out when we build something like aetherium and you know so actually this this this slogan was actually not coming by block stack it was actually originally from an old post on a Chris Dixon twitter twitter thread where he's essentially echoing the same point you know like instead of just reinforcing the assumption that we should not just push forward that that's that narrative that you know that we should just not abuse our power we want to build systems that just cannot have participants abusing their power by default and I think that's a very powerful concept so if the areum's early experiments you know when etherium was first conceived it really had no plans of what you can build on it if some of you recall the old website for a theorem it had some really cool examples like hey you know make a dowel or like hey like you know like make an escrow contract like settle a sports bet with your friend right but at the end of the day like one of the things that really resounded upon me from reading the old etherion website as well is that they mentioned hey we have no features you know like aetherium is an open network like we don't care what you built even if it is a literal pyramid scheme like form or 3d right and you know I think that's that's powerful right so of course technology is a tool it will be used for good and for evil but one of the most important things is that it gives us option an option is something that you know is being seen as more of a luxury as time goes on and as society becomes more and more devolved into the surveillance sci-fi nation-state so you know we've come a pretty long way to say the least the oldest aetherium wallets would completely sacrifice a lot of UX in the sense of having a very strong sense of security you would basically be running of a fully validating node just to be able to like access your accounts we go to transact with each other this is super cool but in reality not really what most users needed you know essentially now we have applications where you don't even know that you're using a blockchain so if you look at things like godson chain which is a fully collectible card game kind of like hearthstone it's you know these these cars or your SD 20 tokens on aetherium we now have things like meta mass mobile where you can actually open a CDP just from your phone and you know I want to give a shout out also to Portus which isn't also also really cool platform where you can go on a website you know without even knowing you know without even having to access or download an extension and immediately log in and be able to start using it additionally today is probably the most interesting times because we've had so much progress and things like tornado Mixer so these are tools that allow you to actually mix your coins with other participants and further decouple your financial sovereignty from your identity aside from that we have a stick protocol which is doing some really awesome stuff on zero knowledge proof so you can essentially send fully private transactions just further you know pushing this notion that like hey you're in control here of your funds and you know this is what aetherium allows you to do and these things are actually live on maintenance so yeah please go check them out we actually now have an incredible set of financial building blocks that we couldn't even have dreamed of a few years ago right we have things like you know like the Iowa spin like so so incredible throughout this whole journey we have things like Dharma that allow you to just like lever instead app is a single - where there lies you to control and see access to all the things that you control in this and this financial link ecosystem aside from that you know we do have the tools to arm for the next hundred thousand developers like they're right there you know and the technical challenges are real and the and there are awesome peers to work with and learn from on this journey however you know let's take a look about how we can tip the scales a little bit further right so if crypto wins like how do we get there and likewise if it goes the wrong way then what happened what led it to be that way truly believe that for a theorem to succeed we must build applications that really enrich and improve the daily users life through ways that abstract away the blockchain itself we must provide an essential product and I really want to highlight essential that you know provide something that cannot be done by centralized services and we want to write a paradigm that this is an unstoppable borderless trustless technology that is a public good for the world when we say public good you know it's it's it's open to everyone right whether you what do you want to use it for good and evil that's what matters like there are options out there and it is you know I think it's one of the most critical aspects that we must retain in this society so it's it is pretty easy to imagine in which aetherium wins if that world is crypto native and that's extremely not the case today a lot of the things that you can immediately come up with as use cases for blockchain depend on kind of this assumption that everyone is kind of participating in this open Network right how do you get them all this network how do you even bootstrap and kickstart this on-ramp still has a massive roadblock in a massive way to go for adoption and a massive privacy hurdle to overcome as well on the flip side you know if we lose then what happened right it's a few things so if we consider the hypothetical scenario in which surveillance states a kind of draconian laws kind of rapidly outpace the rate of innovation and privacy technologies that we see in blossom such as etherium we can see that as a massive detrimental factor towards a lot of new developers or people coming into the space right an interesting thought experiment is to think like you know can total criminalization of ownership go crypto although this might be going a little bit too far at that point you're basically forbidding citizens from owning a bunch of numbers which are your private keys you know can this really you know basically destroys kind of this this this grassroots community right and I would argue not it might have actually the counter the counterintuitive effect but another thing is if tribalism overtakes crypto you know as in any community there are disagreements there are own agendas there are different ideas that people push forward if we fail to acknowledge our similarities and focus more on our differences I think this is one thing that can hamper collaboration and prevents us from getting up to speed and kind of going past that hockey stick curve that we see on the previous slides so where is a theorem itself headed and what is a theorem 2.0 what does that look like and you know this winding road is very much on purpose right I mean we're navigating this idea a maze of what's to come it's you know there's a lot more questions that come up as you ask a question ten more pop up right so you have obviously big challenges ahead right you know a lot of great folks here have solved a lot of different scalability challenges around the theorem using things like later too but you know that the other day layer one still has a fundamental problem of capacity we burn a lot of extremely unnecessary energy just to power these networks that could be done in other ways and additionally like you know we still do not have very satisfactory solutions that make the proper compromises at the layer1 scale so to quote my co-founder scale or Die so it basically idea behind this quote is that you know we want to get to the point where aetherium wins but in reality if we're not true to ourselves if this technology is not scale to where it needs to be then it dies and I think we have a very strong responsibility to get it there you know we have a few ideas here for those a little bit unfamiliar with kind of like the scaling strategies towards eath and eath one the basic idea of the most naive solution I guess is just to imagine oh let's just like increase the block cast limit you know let's pack more transactions into blocks right this means that each node will require a lot more computational power and obviously we just make it's like it's one of those things where you're just pushing the problem a little bit further down you're not really addressing the root cause makes it obviously less decentralized another one is you can reduce the time between blocks all right I mean that sounds great you know a faster confirmation times you have all this all these cool benefits that come along with that the very big problem is obviously this makes a block seem more vulnerable to forks and attacks blocks have to propagate across the network and when you have a network like a theorem that is permissionless so anyone across the world you know there could be somebody in Australia running a node there can be somebody from here from this room running a node you have to understand that these things have to propagate you know in real time through the network understand how that's gonna affect the system and the integrity if you do such a strategy so that's obviously a less secure strategy the thing we're pursuing in the theorem is actually this idea called sharding which is idea when you take when you take a kind of a data set and you partition it into different pieces and you can achieve a higher computational throughput by paralyzing this so you know in a theorem today we maintain the state every single node kind of as a fully validating node so they maintain the entire state of the chain from Genesis and basically validate every transaction to make sure that they're caught up with the rest of the network and participate in a consensus protocol in a theorem 2.0 in particular nodes are not going to be fully validating nodes instead we're going to be partitioning the state across the network and making it so that the consensus algorithm is clever enough that it's able to reconcile this and be able to securely and efficiently determine the state of the world with a new capacity typically we call you know this this gives you some special type of scaling and there's a different type of you know even crazier scaling called super quadratic sharding which which is a little bit far off kind of sci-fi stuff so you know scalability really like what does it mean at the end of the day it's the ability for software to kind of respond in the way it's intended to no matter at what scale and without fail and I think that's something that we really need to really need to keep in mind next generation blockchains as you may have heard of you've probably heard about things like Definity eos and there are a few other ideas out there kind of that you know fundamentally redefine a lot of the key aspects of what layer 1 it does and what its responsibilities are in a blockchain ecosystem in particular you know a lot of these sacrifice things such as decentralization for higher throughput they provide kind of a you know a stronger kind of cryptographic assumption towards consensus and you know I think what aetherium is trying to do and what a theorem 2.0 really is doing is it's trying to find really the most sensible and the most honest approach to solving this problem at theorem 2.0 is trying to maintain a high degree of decentralization a high degree of security and also a high degree of speed by being able to just find the compromises between those things take the best of all different worlds and really learn from each other put aside the differences between the different chains and really understand how we can push this forward so and a theorem 2.0 we have this thing called proof of sake and that's gonna be a radical change it's actually going to change the consensus algorithm instead of having to run these really expensive machines that kind of burn a lot of electricity and power just to be able to verify transactions across the network you're going to be you're going to be able to just lock up some of your money some of your ether or an interest on that and essentially you know basically get penalized if he does something that's provably malicious against the network this is a fundamentally different security model that's based around penalties rather than rewards and makes the system a lot more robust against a lot of scenarios so a theorem has actually always been you know keeping Peru stick and it's mine since the beginning and an attempt to point oh we're actually making us a reality aside from that one of the major things that gets talked about a lot is webassembly so many of you have been coding in the solidity programming language which is you know particular to aetherium and how it started and let's do some really cool stuff it's a very nice kind of domain-specific language that's evolved over the years with web assembly you know we're taking a lot of cool technologies that allow us to use a lot of different programming languages that we're more familiar with such as things like rust and C++ and be able to use them and watch in programming environments you know granted you know not everyone might want to be programming smart contract in C++ but this gives us a very strong kind of primitive in which we can bring different you know different different kind of development communities to really build on this technology and a transformational way so from that one thing in theorem 2.0 it's going to bring is we're gonna have actually the ability to create unbiased able distributed randomness for those of you that are quite unfamiliar creating randomness in a blocking environment is near impossible it's extremely difficult to do so today you can do things like you know you use the block hashes as like the randomness as a random seed in your application but really that's not that's not random you know for something to be random you want it to be unbiased able you want it to kind of exist independently of manipulation of actors in the system so you know just we do some really cool stuff around verifiable delay functions and you know using using this information to create an unbiased able blockchain so if you're curious about this please come talk to me afterwards yeah so with my team we're building an aetherium client called prism just like today when you're running the theorem know if you run a go aetherium node or a parity know to sync up with the chain when you run the next iteration of aetherium we imagine people will be using prism as their go-to client this is the way you can actually doubt you know sync up to the chain verify blocks participate as a validator and kind of do everything you would need to do to interact with the environment of the blockchain there are currently eight teams or more implementing a theorem 2.0 related features or clients and you know this arguably one of the best times for each 2.0 and kind of its future next week the teams are gathering in Toronto for an interoperability meeting that means that they're actually no getting the clients together communicating via via network and putting together a multi-client test net and that's a major milestone akin to some of the first eath 1.0 test nets that came out there since the beginning in next month we're all going to Osaka Japan to go to the DEFCON 5 conference which is fun the biggest at the earlier conferences in the world and really just really crank out more multi client interoperability features there and maenette early 2020 so we're gonna be pretty busy out there but I believe the work will be really worth it so you know if there's any words of advice for those of you that are kind of new to have it on it's like you know just really pay little attention to the hype I think you know coming through so many if global events like seeing just how much depth of information and how many motivated people are to build on these things is what's really exciting and at the end of the day like all of you here are tinkerers you know and like when we look at new technologies what we should do is that we should always find those people that are tinkering on the fringes that are always working on things keeping their heads down independently thinking about why this matters over you know following something like a hype train and I think we're at a fantastic moment in aetherium where you know everyone kind of lets in this room truly cares about what this can bring for the world and I think it's our responsibility to get it there so yeah so please check us out prismatic labs and thank you so much Thank You Raoul and before one note on this by the way is that it's really cool that you can build as we saw from all the sponsors earlier you can build at the application layer and try to build all these applications or you can talk with folks like Raoul and start to understand the protocol layer here and start to tinker with and experiment with that this weekend so before you leave I'm gonna do five quick minutes of logistics for this weekend so let's start it the first note is where's the Wi-Fi so it's on your badge so if you look on your badge and you look at the back it's on the back of your badge and just note that there is the unique code there and you should use that that's how you get on the Wi-Fi and once you're on the Wi-Fi by the way please you know spread the event either mention at eath boston on twitter or use the hashtag 'if boston take pictures of people hang out do whatever we have a question in the back what's up thank you for that help to repeat that to the audience your username should be eight digits minus eight digits but if it's seven digits put a zero in the front and then it will work so that's how you get on the Wi-Fi the other note here is to join the discord and so if you go to eath boston dot chat you can do this and this is where all of the information will happen so announcements about talks announcements about closing ceremonies all the mentors are there too so we're gonna have a bunch of the like eath boston mentors who know a lot about solidity programming and things like that they're gonna be on there all the time and in fact there's even a mentor there like scheduled even in like the deep hours of the night so all the time you should be able to ask like the mentor channel on there hey I need some help um and all the sponsors are there too so if you're building on top of a bounty or something like that get on the discord so this say you really being on the discord like a very crucial piece of this so go to eath Boston ethought Boston slash chat join the discard cord and everybody will be there and so food there are food trucks upstairs I think they close tonight at 1:00 am is what I heard and then they'll open up tomorrow and the food is all free and it's cool food trucks and so go upstairs eat that all weekend today tomorrow and Sunday the to understand all the things that are happening there's a schedule on East Boston and just note that there are a lot there's this room and there are two other rooms there's also in their sponsor talks or you don't think I'm gonna sponsor talks they are sponsors that come and other people that come and just help you code and help you code and help you build on top of their protocols so that's all weekend and I also want to note that there are other kind of fun things happening like there's a in that section of this building there's this thing called nicks corner which is like a place to play video games and hang out and eat snacks and stuff so like weird kind of fun things like that are happening I think there might be like a massage thing set up so just be on the lookout for these things and really check the schedule to understand what's happening let me say one of the note there's like at right after this talk there will be someone speaking in this room and someone maybe I think speaking in one of those other rooms so check the schedule II thought Boston if you want to make money this is where you find it this is where all the sponsor prizes and bounties are so this is eath Boston dot dev post calm in dev post is gonna be this is gonna be your place you're gonna submit everything this with the place where you can see all the bounties all the prizes so go here it also has a note if you don't want to make money that's fine too you can like go and code your own thing or whatever but this is where you can see all those bounties and prizes also if you're brand new to aetherium so one of the big tracks of the content that's happening there's like a big content thing if you go to the website you can see like the - Edie thing it's all tomorrow from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. there's a whole track of just a full intro to solidity and how to program and the integrated development environment that you mean all those kinds of things tomorrow from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. one other note here is you know we really do where we appreciate being able to use the space so please keep it beautiful don't try I mean it's a hackathon scope like definitely stay up late and drink coffee and try to do all your fun coding hanging out with people going to workshops but trying to keep it nice you know clean up after yourself and if you have any issues with anything any questions any comments whatever there's the help desk at the front near the stairs so just go there and let us know if you have any feedback or thoughts or questions visit us at the help desk there another note here is I guess the key point here is we have a code of conduct you can see it at global.com slash rules but the key thing is just to be respectful to each other we're all here to have a good time people have different perspectives and really I mean harassment abuse are not tolerated if we feel like someone we don't expect this to happen I don't think this has really happened before at an equal event but if someone is being bad we'll kick him out I will personally do so so with that is there any other notes come on one last thing if you are still looking for a team as a hacker there is a team-building session just right after this in 60 seconds in the minutemen room which is the room right across this so if you're still looking for a teammate or an idea to work on you can meet in the minuteman room when you say across from this it's like going that way five steps outside the door nice yeah okay good so with that thank you all for being here and let's get hacking [Applause]
