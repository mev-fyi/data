good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of the global and welcome to the youth online nftn creator summit so all of you are watching this thing on each global.tv um just a quick note for all of all of the listeners here this is a live platform so if you have any questions for any of our speakers you can just sign in and log in and ask your questions away and we'll be able to relate those questions to our speakers directly and also for everybody who signs in we'll be giving out a nft poe app for your participation so be sure to say hi and claim that nft so this event is organized by eth global and for those of you who don't know what if global is ethel was an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this thing primarily by running hackathons and summits and econoline is no different so heath online is our biggest event of the year and it is a combination of hackathon which is a four week long event and seven or six different summits so for the hackathon we have over 1100 people from 77 different countries spending 19 different times those working on incredible projects ranging from developer tools to nfts to to d5 and on top of that we are also doing these summits every friday in addition to two other summits highlighting the compound in the abbe ecosystem so today is our first summit of this event which is the nft and creator summit next friday we'll be talking about governance in daos then we have our developer tools summit on friday the 8th and we're going to end off this event with our merchant scalability summit on october the 15th so let's jump right into today's summit so we have six incredible talks that we're excited to share today we're gonna start off with will who's going to talk about the loot economy and how do you create a thriving energy community then we have gabby and linda we're going to be talking about future player then we have alex from openc covering what nft metadata world looks like right now and how what the opportunities are in that space then we're going to have an amazing panel on amts and metaverse joined by dylan from figma rohan from dapper labs coin artist from neon district and drew austin from retro adventures and then makota will be talking about the grand vision of ens and how the ens nft and 721 standard can help own identity in this space i'm going to close the day off with gov sheet was going to talk about the lessons learned from building dark forests um the the most crypto native game and the most incredible game i've seen so without further ado let's get started i'd like to welcome will on to the stage here and will is going to take it from here and talk about the loot economy well welcome yeah great to be here thanks so much for the intro um i'm will i'm a co-founder of syndicate and creator of adventure gold um adventure gold is a token that is available for the loot community and uh was made for use uh within the in-game loot ecosystem um lute as many of you may have seen on twitter over the past couple of weeks um really took the nft community by storm and i'm going to talk about the history a quick oral history of loot and then the key lessons that nft projects can learn from loot about creating a thriving nft community um so the uh so what is loot loot was released by um dom who uh has uh who was the co-founder of vine and also made a number of uh nfts including blitmaps um and he's working on sub drive right now and loot was an experiment and it was an experiment that was a totally free uh fair launch he tweeted out a link to etherscan and said anyone can uh mint this just pay gas put in the id number you want and you can claim your loot and the loot itself was a text that is stored on chain that represents a adventure adventuring gear in an rpg um or similar fantasy game so it's these items that you could potentially use in a future game um and the thing that uh swept the whole community up uh was um just how uh how how how how much the community could do with it um because uh loot was a novel for its simplicity and that simplicity allowed a lot of people to envision what they wanted to build on top of it so i saw loot i actually missed the original mint um for loot i was uh hiking in uh oregon with no cell service no ability to to to take part in the mint um but i saw loot and it was immediately inspired by it and i thought it'd be really cool to build a effectively um like in-game currency on top of loot because i knew that a bunch of projects were would pop up on top of it i thought that the on-chain aspect was very interesting and i thought okay let's build a um let's build a uh i'll build a i'll build an in-game currency so i created adventure gold an adventure gold [Music] i wrote mostly in four hours in an airport in oregon um and then launched it live on a clubhouse chat on the good times show and adventure gold um was is 10 000 tokens that any loot bag holder can claim um in those tokens uh the idea they were immediately used to vote on lore um they were also used to swap within the community for nfts they were used to permission nft mints in a way that really expands the loot ecosystem and adventure gold is one of many derivatives on lube and this is what i find really exciting is that there's so many other projects that have popped up two of the most interesting ones are loot mart and loot wars flute mart allows anyone to unbundle their loot items so you can you can you can turn your loot into specific items i'll quickly screen share what that looks like [Music] so here is loot itself here it is it is these these text files anyone can work with adventure gold was launched from a tweet on a clubhouse chat um and then loot mart lets you i already unbundled my items so you can see that they are unbundled but loot mart lets you generate these items based on your loot bags which is incredibly cool and this is how they're leveraging the loot activity on chain um and uh likewise loot wars is another project where you can battle your loot sony loot holder can claim a weapon and these weapons can then be used in in-game battles which is a very very cool aspect because now your loot items are going beyond nfps that are in your wallet you can start to use them in this whole ecosystem so why did these uh appear what made them so successful i think there's three key insights around loop for all of the subsequent projects that built on top of it um one the first lesson is that less is more loot simplicity of the text gave the community room for inspiration the items the nfts were uh were were the nfts left a lot for the community to build like you couldn't break the bags up into items that was made by the loot mart team and that allowed the mart team to make incredibly interesting art and by giving the community less the community was able to take that forward on their own in a way that allowed so many people to contribute and that was i think the beauty of dom's experiment is that it allowed anyone to build on top of it and gave them so many ideas what they could do next the second lesson about loot is this is one that's very important for any nft creator is to think carefully about the tokenomics up front um tokenomics are the single most difficult thing to change later on um so for example with loot there's eight thousand uh loot uh there's eight thousand loot bags and then there's also more loot which uh which which is much more accessible than anyone can knit and um uh uh with the tokenomics um there's a there's there's there's a debate in the community right now about whether loot should be a thousand bags and whether that should be the version that everyone adopts or whether more loot should make a really really broad community and um really uh really spread loot to so many people um in a way in a way that makes it very accessible and um if you define the tokenomics up front of is will there be more tokens issued later on will there be a treasury um will there be scarcity will there be abundance think through these things before you launch your nfp project because afterwards um it's extremely difficult to change and extremely hard um to to to change for example from scarcity to abundance or from deflationary tokens to inflationary tokens nouns is a excellent example of how to do this um nouns is some of the best tokenomics i've seen in the entire space um with nouns uh if you look up nouns announced now on twitter you can you can you you can find them and they uh they essentially release one now in a day for auction the proceeds in the auction go into a treasury governed by nouns holders and one noun every 10 days for the next five years is reserved for the nouns team so they've created a token that is scarce right now abundant later on with a treasury that is continuously funded to invest in the noun's ecosystem um and uh define your tokenomics uh carefully that's probably one of the most important things for an nft project currently 10 000 or so generative projects are the norm nouns show that there's a lot of creativity that the community can do that that that that will that will benefit the whole space um and but loot and more loot show that there's creativity in how tokenomics can work and uh adventure gold on top of it um also uh uh has many lessons for tokenomics design um the third thing that i think is really interesting is that engine composability is the future most nfts they store their data on a separate uh network whether that's a centralized web server or ipfs or another platform and most nfts are not stored on the ethereum blockchain directly loot was really unique because it was one of the few projects that does store data on the blockchain directly and having that data be accessible to other smart contracts is what allowed derivatives like loot mart and loot wars and adventure gold to exist putting all art on chain is the holy grail but even just having on-chain attributes helps a lot so if you can make some of your nfts accessible to the to other smart contracts you can get a thriving community like loot and that on-chain data is extremely important um if you want a derivative ecosystem because um the on-chain data allows the community to um to to build on top of it in a in a in a in a crypto native way um those are my three most important lessons from loot in adventure gold one less is more um give the community room for inspiration two think carefully about tokenomics upfront look at examples beyond ten thousand profile picture drops look at more look at nouns look at other projects that have played with tokenomics models because that creates a very different type of community that can often be uh very inclusive and fund an ecosystem in the long term and then three on chain composability is the secret that made loot work and if you make some of your nft data available on chain you will see the possibility for derivatives to spring up just like luke just like the loot ecosystem um i want to make sure to leave some time for questions so if there are any questions i can answer them um hey well this is an awesome talk so i think uh we're just getting questions from the chat and as uh people hear this sentence uh we'll with the latency and everything we'll start pushing more in but uh uh maybe just to kind of start off with a few things you've already mentioned uh it'd be great if you can give a slightly uh more uh detailed info on how nouns work so we got a couple questions around that so just walk us through what that looks like and then maybe to back up a little bit it'd be also great for those of us who don't know what lewd is to just kind of go into how loot started and sort of what it is now and sort of what people have done so you talked about the the side of how you got into this um ecosystem from the loot side but what else has happened in the loot ecosystem from other efforts yep that sounds great i'll start with the questions about the loot ecosystem um so the loot ecosystem uh you can uh i'll screen share again um so as i mentioned before let's see i'll pull this up quickly great um yeah so so every single loop bag has these items and these items that you see are all available on chain so anyone can query any any other project can query these items on chain so this is how loot mart was able to operate because if you have a katana it can act loot mart can access the data inside of loot and this is what i'm referring to when i talk about on chain composibility and this is what's incredibly interesting um uh loot mart and loot wars are just two of many derivatives you can find all derivatives at lootproject.com and this should give you a good sense of the types of development in the ecosystem it's really really incredible here is every single derivative of loop so we have everything from ability scores to abstract loot which made generative art based on loot to characters for loot companions for loot um you name it the list goes on and on and on of people who are inspired by loot and every single part of this is leveraging the on-chain composability um there's also different guilds which is really interesting um guilds of loot holders came together um to to uh for like katanas or four divine robes um uh to uh to allow uh like uh the katana and divine robe the vine robes holders for example um to be able to uh collaborate together um and and form their own sub-communities within the larger nft community there's tons of developer tools as well um and of course the loot discord loot talk and then uh loot uh builders um and uh bloot all got started from dom's tweet um i'm gonna see if i can find it on twitter um quickly um it all started from this tweet um and that's what it was uh this was this was the origin of luke everything else afterwards came from the community um just this one tweet likewise adventure gold came from just this one tweet and the experimentation that the community can put forward um is is is incredibly important um uh that's a quick overview of loot i could talk a little bit about nouns tokenomics i am not an expert in known tokenomics by any means um i'm not involved with the nouns team officially i've just been following them since they're on uh rink b i like i i i put some tokens in the shark dao which buys nouns but which buys nouns uh for the community um so i'm not an expert in this but i will i will uh i will give my best summary of what i find very interesting about it which is that um nft projects uh in the long term um uh should think carefully about how they cultivate their communities um uh if you have a really rich ecosystem of builders and contributors um you can get really really interesting outcomes um one way to do that is to have a treasury um there's a few ways to build a treasury one is a treasury that where the payments from secondary sales such as openc royalties go to the project that's what some projects do um there's a discussion there were votes in the loot community about whether that should occur for loot um another way also is to reserve some nfts for the for the community where the nfts are put in a treasury and the nfts can be can be used by the whole ecosystem the really clever part about nouns is that most nft projects it's just a mint and the team gets some eth from the mint um or sometimes nothing uh like uh dom gave away loot for free and i gave away adventure gold for free um and then that's it whereas with nouns they do an auction every single day and that auction allows um them to build up a treasury that they can go use to fund builders inside the noun's ecosystem spread the word about nouns um and uh nouns is able to accomplish this because they're releasing one noun every day they didn't release all nouns at once they instead release them they're releasing them in small batches and uh these these batches drive community these batches scale the community in a deliberate way um and it allows them it allows them to uh to to to scale the community up um from there so i think that um the 10 000 profile picture drops where everyone claims for gas and the or or a small amount of beef and the craters make money off secondary sales is a model that can use a lot of innovation and i'm really excited for everyone listening here to think about ways to innovate on that nouns is one example one noun a day well ten nouns uh one one noun out of every ten is reserved for the team the proceeds go to a treasury there's so many other options and i hope that we as a community can move towards um something that helps build sustainable nfd projects in the long term and rewards people for contributions rather than gas wars i think that we'll get to that uh position as a community um and innovation like nouns and loot is just the start absolutely um one other kind of question i always have two more and then we'll uh we'll wrap it up and let you get back to your day um what are some kind of lessons learned from launching adventure gold and what was the community reaction like and sort of uh just what happened there post post that tweet and uh if you could do something differently what would you have done yeah that's a great question um so um i had no idea how big adventure gold would get i wrote it in four hours in an airport i launched it live on a clubhouse call i i i the day i launched it i ended up running support for 24 hours straight i'd woken up at 5am that day and i went to sleep at 5am that day i was uh not expecting the way adventure built played out by any means um i think that the thing that was really good about adventure gold was that it was a fair launch um it was something where i didn't reserve any adventure gold for myself i owned some loot and owning that lou gave me some adventure gold but i didn't reserve any adventure gold for myself and i think that allowed it to be adopted by the community um because it wasn't about anyone making money it was about doing something good for the community and i think that fair launches especially for nft derivatives is very important um because it shows that these are not cash grabs these are instead ways to ways to further the whole ecosystem that everyone cares about um the interesting part is i expected adventure gold holders and loot holders to have a lot of overlap and initially every loot holder could claim adventure gold but the groups diverged so much where after a few days only 55 of loot holders held adventure gold um and there was a vote on whether adventure gold should govern loot and that was split 50 50. so the split was extremely similar to the split of the number of loot holders who held adventure gold and i think that the divergent the diverging interests between adventure gold loot and more loot means that stakeholder management is more more more difficult and if i could do it all over again i probably would add vesting or streaming to adventure gold instead of getting all your adventure gold up front you maybe get some adventure gold every single day for holding loot and then loot holders would be more aligned with adventure gold holders that actually coded seasons into the contract so you could start a new claim season and have a new batch of adventure gold available to claim and i thought those seasons would be used pretty frequently the the i didn't design the tokenomics to force those seasons to happen so it's up for a boat by the dow it's not on any regular schedule if i designed the tokenomics to offer the seasons on a regular schedule i think that would have created more alignment with uh loot holders and adventure build holders so this is why i think the nft tokenomics and the uh anti-derivative tokenomics are really important to get right because a lot of your nfps will change hands your projects will be held by a really wide variety of people some will be short-term minded some would be long-term i did and if you want a really thriving community in the long term with lots of builders and not just something that like is popular and then and then disappears um you should like do what luke did and what i think more than an adventure gold surf to do which is make a very expensive expansive ecosystem for builders in a way that brings a lot of people to fold there's lots of ways to do it but the scarcity versus abundance mindsets are very different and if i'd coded in a four seasons where a season would take place every three months let's say that would create an abundance mindset by default about adventure gold i'd say adventure gold has more of a scarcity mindset right now because the the seasons are by vote instead of uh part of the tokenomics design up front no incredible um i think you already sort of helped me transition to the last question here from our audience which is if you had any uh predictions for uh what the loot ecosystem would look like a couple years from now or would you uh sort of say what happened yeah yeah um so uh there's currently a loot hackathon with like 50 different projects submitted um you saw the derivatives page or screen sharing there's like thousands of loop derivatives um and uh just because not a lot of people are talking about it on twitter that doesn't mean that there's not builders the builders i know are more excited than ever and i think that um i think the loot community um is uh has really strong builders working on tons of different ideas um and i'm so excited to see those develop these ideas are hard to execute loot mark loot mart was started pretty close to day one and it took a while to launch um because it was incredibly complex they had machine learning to generate the images each image like took like like a like it took a like a long time it was very computationally intensive to generate that's not something you could launch overnight the loot ecosystem takes time because really good building and really good projects take time um i think my call to action for the loot community and the nft community as a whole is to uh think about the long term think about what your nfps look like in three years and five years because people move on from profile photos people will move on from all but a few assets just like in the 2017 ico bubble most icos are now valueless i think that in three to five years honestly most nfts will be valueless and the ones that will survive will be the ones that cultivate these thriving communities where it's more than just an image it's an entire community and ecosystem around these nfts so nfts are unique they can be integrated into the ecosystem in all these different ways loot has an example of how to do that nouns as an example of how to do that and um yeah think about how to go beyond images and into something that builders want to build on and communities want to create lore around and um something that goes goes goes beyond a profile photo awesome well thank you so much for that and uh i hope this is insightful for everybody else to sing into already getting a lot of claps and uh thank you for kind of clarifying a lot of these things so really appreciate this and uh thanks again thanks so much yeah anyone who wants to email me you can email me at will syndicate.io or or contact me on twitter at willpaper um i'm happy to answer any questions thanks so much that's great thanks well and with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and that is going to be a far side chat between gabby and linda linda is going to be interviewing gabby earl and is from scalar capital gabby is the co-founder of the old-field games uh they're going to talk about what the future of plato earned looks like and how nfts and just gaming is taking over the world so i'll let them do most of most of this intro and talking and without further ado let's welcome gabby and linda on screen [Music] hello all right there you can wait awesome thanks for having us um so uh gabby can you just give a brief background on what yield game guild guild games is sure so ygg is what we call a play-to-earn gaming guild that means that we are a dow that invests into nft assets of different plate to earn games meaning games where you have nfd assets that earn some form of tokenized yield these assets are then lent out to our player base the members of the guild and then they play the games and uh earn uh basically earn some form of money that can be ultimately uh swapped out for ether or uh to fiat so uh we we started doing this in axe infinity where we were lending out taxes in what is called a scholarship or a lending program uh so that people can uh can earn money in the form of slp tokens and convert it to fiat most notably in the philippines this blew up last year during the early kind of covid uh lockdowns where people were stuck at home and uh couldn't find uh any work um while while they were home and they found axi as a way to earn income that was actually multiples better than their local opportunities at that time that's awesome um i i am curious though um you mentioned axi uh there's just been a lot of blockchain games in the past what really appealed to you and your community uh for axi and um why do you think that that's become so popular sure so axia's been around since 2018 and what really changed was when they introduced the form of yield in the form of the slp token so slp is generated when you win matches inside axe infinity and what gives it value is that there is in-game utility for the token you actually have to use it or burn it as an ingredient when you have to breed two axes to create a new one now you can't buy any axes from the team itself all the axes that are generated are bred or created by community members who are known as the breeders in the game so for people who are breeding they buy the slp so that they can create a lot of axes and then sell these axes in the marketplace to new players so this is a very interesting kind of crypto economy that you see inside a game where it uses a blockchain either in the form of nfts for assets or fungible tokens for yield as a way to kind of create an economy around it um and then where have you seen like what regions have taken off with uh this kind of work that you're doing it's we've seen it off uh take off all over the world but most notably it's taken off in regions like southeast asia and latin america so in in southeast asia you have countries like philippines thailand indonesia doing really well and in latin america you see countries like venezuela argentina argentina colombia brazil where is the income that people are earning here can be at times like much much higher than the local jobs that are available and then um i guess in terms of um i guess what what do you think are like the um future of play to earn gaming like is it just going to be these like scholarship rentals or do you like what other use cases do you see here right so i think that the future of work is increasingly increasingly going to be in these virtual worlds and online games that are connected uh in their economies to the blockchain somehow so right now we're earning a living online by going to different websites doing some knowledge work but i think um increasingly there will be plenty of different jobs that will be available for people in basically video games online worlds and what we call the metaverse economy so at the very basic you may be a scholar or someone who is borrowing assets to play games and then earning some kind of income for that um there are people who are more i would say entrepreneurs like the breeders in axe infinity or land owners in a game like sandbox or league of kingdoms where yeah i basically own land and maybe you're leasing them out to people who are playing the game there's also a a lot of people who are doing content creation around these games so um streamers the youtubers who have their own followings and what's interesting about this is that play to earn is bringing an additional business model to content creation where you don't necessarily have to be a top creator to be earning money it's really hard to earn money as a top creator unless you really have a lot of viewers but because of the business model play to earn if you're good at the game you can be creating good content and actually making decent amount of money at the same time the other things i'm really excited about are really just the creative jobs that are going to be available in this game so for example you can be a digital fashion designer creating clothing for your avatars you can be the one creating avatars or maybe buildings you may even be a blacksmith inside an rpg creating weapons for other people so i think that the future of work is increasingly tied to the creator economy and really giving people um like access to jobs that are interesting to them and leverage their unique skills that's really cool um and and i know that the play to earn space is growing really quickly um what has been the challenging aspects of kind of growing ygg okay so i guess there's many challenges but interestingly the biggest one has not been technical it's actually been cultural we've been i would say accustomed for the last 30 years to think that playing games are a waste of time and then they don't contribute anything to us and you know i've been joking that moms have been yelling at their kids for so long about like to stop playing games and now these same moms are yelling at their kids to finish the daily quest in axe infinity so that they can get their daily income so having that mind shift we were actually learning really uh important skills when we were gaming we were doing mastery we're doing pattern recognition when we're playing mmos we're doing things like coordination except that players weren't getting paid for it because there wasn't a business model for it so now in uh player owned economies now that people can invest in the assets and earn yield you can actually get paid for this it becomes a legitimate form of job of an income and i think we have a long way to go in kind of convincing people that this is indeed real um and then uh talking about that when i guess whenever you turn something you like to do into a job and you kind of have to earn an income from it it can kind of make it less fun so how do you strike a balance with these games and making it fun while you're still earning an income does that like potentially ruin the experience i know people talk about that potential learning experience for me i think people have kind of thought of fun as something they do outside of work and work is something they do for money that may not be fun if you actually have the opportunity to combine these where you're doing something that you enjoy have it be meaningful work and get paid for it i think it actually aligns person's interest better i think when people think of like playing games for work as not being fun is when maybe they think of their fun as separate from what they do from work got it and then can you also um talk about for those that are really interested in play to earn how they can get started like i know there's a lot of different discords um and there's just a lot of overwhelming information so like what are the some of the resources you recommend yeah sure so uh there is a play to earn documentary that is that was produced by yield guild and axi infinity so you can definitely head out to youtube and uh look for the play to end documentary we have our discord discord.gigi ygg and when you go into a discord you see a very vibrant community where a little over 60 000 people now that take a look at these different games and then form sub guilds inside our community to play these games together so apart from the players that are playing axe infinity there's also discussion of many other games and then people can gather and play games like league of kingdoms for example or games like splinterland so there's a lot of different sub-communities that that are forming inside ygg and uh if you want just uh get uh info there's twitter.com yieldguild or you'll give that io for our website where you can mint a free badge you just have to pay gas and that makes you a guild member um and then you mentioned league of kingdoms and splinter lands uh could you describe a little bit about what those games are like and kind of how people play them sure so for league of kingdoms it's a strategy game similar to clash of clans for example the big difference is that players on the land that is that the game is being played on so in the guilds instance we own an estate of 286 pieces of land and the guild builds on top of it and whenever money is spent on top of that land when when players uh basically spend on in-app purchases um a portion of that uh of the money spent goes to the land holders so splinterlands itself is a card game that's been around on the hive blockchain and we actually see a lot of activity and there's also a scholarship model where you can lend out cards to other people and they also have a land sale um this game has been around for a couple of years and we're seeing really good um retention and engagement activity so i think that the game is actually doing pretty well and then i know that a common criticism of play to earn uh is that like how is this sustainable activity um and and i i personally know that like just uh playing video games growing up there's always like gold farmers and all kinds of things that's right i'm curious to hear your perspective on how this is sustainable activity okay so the the way i see it is that people are increasingly going to invest in assets that are online and on chain in these virtual worlds and economies so when i take a look at a game like axi infinity for example um i start comparing it to like a digital nation and it's uh it's daily volumes it's gdp so now what is in the game that will make people invest in it there must be something that can give them um either enjoyment in the game or maybe their assets can increase or maybe they're looking for some form of yield so it's no different basically than a regular economy except you're controlling these inputs and outputs via the game and then these assets are being transferred to the blockchain basically in the form of nfds for assets or tokens for currency maybe and yeah that means that you have actually like self-contained economies inside these games and as long as there's reason for people to put money inside these economies then it will bring about sustainability um and then i guess what has been the most surprising part for you when starting ygg uh the most surprising part is just the diversity of people who have found plato earn work like we're not just seeing kids who are basically creating guilds and then going on raids inside these games people are yeah using them either as an income supplement or in some cases either as complete income replacements or even as their own businesses from uh people who are trying to get to college for example to grandparents who are retired and are using this to supplement their pension um it's been great to see that there's a lot of people around the world who are now exposed to the crypto economy without one needing to know crypto in the first place and second they actually don't need to have any money in the first place all they need is a skill that billions of people around the world have it's like they need to have gaming skill and yeah there's uh so it's incredibly inclusive and we've seen that it has really um included and onboarded people to the crypto economy who might have never never was been done so um and then like how are people finding out about um like ygg or just play to earn in general like is it just um like word of mouth or how is that happening it's super community based so the way that play to earn has been spreading has not been through traditional you paid user acquisition channels like maybe a facebook or a google it's really been what by what we call a community uh community acquisition so we identify community leaders around the world that are basically good at cultivating communities and we give them access in the form of nfd assets content and our tech platform so that they can create their own play to earn communities or sub guilds around the world and when these communities do well with these games when they earn some money other communities get interested as well and it's proven to be a really really good uh way for user acquisition without having to pay any like third party entity um and then also curious about um do you see more traditional gaming companies coming into the space for play to earn um and then if they do so do you think that that's going to change the landscape much or are they going to kind of have to be more crypto native like how do you see that playing out i think it's actually incredibly difficult for the kind of giants of today's worlds in games to successfully adapt to play to earn a big reason for that is that their current model is doing really well and they may be for example giant companies with that are publicly listed in their uh that have their own shareholders there's a lot of i would say uh regulatory uncertainty and in the world of crypto and nfts um and it's very hard for these companies to embrace play to earn because there is the risk involved of adding a token to their game and how their shareholders their lawyers feel about that what we've been seeing instead is that there's a lot of talent coming from the traditional gaming space in free to play in mmos who are now heading to play to earn and they have uh they have the skills in creating virtual economies and they have to orient them more towards player owned economies where their people are players are basically creating value and selling to each other instead of the publisher or the developer selling items directly to the players but yeah we're seeing a lot of really good talent start new studios right now um and then one thing that i've noticed and you're definitely more of an expert here so curious your thoughts is um the traditional gaming community can be a little bit toxic sometimes but i've noticed that a lot of the play to earn community they're really like welcoming and helpful towards each other um kind of what have you noticed about the differences between the culture and why do you think that's the case yeah well i think personally part of that has been the unique culture of axi infinity community um the greatest thing about axi is that the the game had always been attached with a very welcoming community people who didn't know anything about crypto or didn't know anything about the game had always been welcome and there's been a core set of kind of really strong community believers that have uh kind of tried to stay true to this culture even as it had scaled up to more than a million users but in the greater nft community there's this you know a whole i would say positivity and ethos of helping each other and it's really my favorite thing about play to earn where people are really happy that they're able to invest whatever money they have into excess axes that are they're providing out to people in like countries like the philippines or venezuela where people there might not have a lot of good choices for uh for local jobs and they it makes them happy to be able to provide these uh kind of uh i guess new form of gig work to people around the world so there's a really strong undercurrent of that and i think it's really crucial to to play to earn even as we scale it up yeah i was actually going to ask that like do you think this is going to be sustainable as more people come into this space and then how do you how are you planning on like helping to maintain that culture yeah so i think that it's going to be a real work in progress there is no guarantee that this uh kind of culture will uh will really persist as we grow bigger and i think that's actually where guild communities come in um guilds are a collection of people who are bound together and to do something um as a group and that's basically what dao's are and we kind of use the guild in it now kind of interchangeably in in ygg context and i think it's up to us at uh the founder level of ydg to kind of express our value so that we can attract like-minded people who want to stay in our guild and uh basically build together with the same set of common values and hopefully that kind of radiates down to the sub guilds communities we have in different countries around the world even as they tweak and localize uh basically their culture for each for their own unique communities um and then regarding the guild structure can you talk more about how that looks like internally and um how do you keep up with all those communities it seems like there's so many different sub guilds and different languages and countries like how do you manage that yeah definitely not easy but we call yield guild a a guild of guilds or a doubt so we're not actually one guild we are an umbrella or a federation of lots of different player communities and the reason that we set it up this way when we started is that no one really wants to be in a guild of a million people right like it's too big it doesn't feel personal so you want to be in a group of maybe your five friends going on a raid or like maybe even 100 people who are in your immediate vicinity so yale guild itself is set up into a lot of different sub guilds that are either organized by region by community or around the assets of a particular game and it that makes it feel smaller because you care more about your immediate community and people that you're playing with on a day-to-day basis than anyone else but on top of that yield get provides the nft assets the capital the tech infrastructure so that we can empower these guilds especially these community leaders who are great at building community cultivating it recruiting players and they don't have to worry about the technology side the capital side and we just help them do what they do best um and then related to that like how do you hire people um as a doubt like how do you go about finding community managers so the great thing about community managers is that they're not employees they're basically their own entrepreneurs who are good at building community and are able to monetize it by working with yield guild so um at first we work with community managers that are already have their own kind of personal access scholarship maybe they uh they have a few dozen or a few hundred axis colors but it's hard for them to scale because uh it takes a lot of capital to uh to create a lot of these axes and we partner with them we basically give them access to our axis and the platform that manages it and we do a revenue split so how the revenue split works is it's 70 20 10. 70 of the slp earned goes to the scholar or the player 20 to the community manager and 10 to ydg the guild and as a community manager as some of some of our managers have maybe over 500 scholars of their own it actually adds up quite a bit if you're able to scale how you are leading your community and then i know that 70 2010 structure might vary across like outside of ygg and across different um scholarship managers i guess how did that um break down kind of um like why is that breakdown the case and what else have you seen and i know you have thoughts on on some of the different structures we'd love to hear them yeah so it's really important for us that the player or the scholars actually receive a majority of what they earn i think it's really uh important for the future of this space that we are kind of changing the structure of how people are earning from a fixed wage for example to where they're being rewarded for for their own upside so that's very important for us and that's why we give the majority to the players and as they go online it means if they're not just having a job anymore they're being compensated for something that matches their ability which which if you do that you're able in uh you're enabling a lot of people around the world to make money basically based on their talents um and then i also had a question around like barriers to entry so i mean it can be really confusing sometimes for people when they're first starting out with a wallet and um kind of learning about how to use anything in crypto so um how are you kind of helping to navigate that space and have you seen yeah what are you what are you seeing is like the biggest bearish entry for people yeah that's that's actually a really great question because i mean crypto can be really confusing um and i get i think we aren't there yet in crypto in terms of just really seamless onboarding and this is really where the magic of community comes in so at yield guild for example when if you come in as an axis scholar you don't have to know anything about crypto to start with you don't have to know anything and you don't even have to have any money to start with you're given an account you log into that account you start playing games and you uh you start earning slp and during that time you're interacting with the community you're being given content that will tell you like what a crypto wallet is how to play the game and after two weeks when you receive your first payout from slp uh from your revenue share in the game uh you can bet that these players are very motivated to learn how crypto works when it's time to pay out and then do you have any numbers that you can share on um kind of how large play to earn or some numbers from ygg that can put this into perspective for the audience so we are paying out somewhere between 1 to two million dollars every month right now to our community members so this is the 70 uh share of slp that they have so we have um around 5000 scholars which is just a little under 10 of our uh community member base um in in the discord but i think just if you think about how many people around the world would want to earn money by playing video games i think we just like super early we're just getting started um i think that number will ultimately be in the billions of people so while you'll get us under a hundred thousand members and axi itself the best performing game has a little over one million um daily active users i think yeah we we're just barely getting started yeah that's so tiny compared to traditional games um so uh also curious on the investment side uh because you invest in nft land like what does that process look like for you and the community of how you're deciding to invest in something is there someone managing that process or is it just community driven like how does that process look yeah so we do have an internal team that really looks at these games as similar to an early stage vc but instead of investing in equity we actually take a look at assets first so we look at acquiring the nfts that give yield we take a look at how the economy works where is the money coming in how are people getting paid is this sustainable long term uh we like to invest in the nfts and their associated governance tokens um and while uh it is not community driven in the decision making we do have what we call a play to earn counsel where we get signals from the community on what games interest them so we use the community as kind of scouts to see like what's out there what's interesting and um yeah it's happened several times in that the interest from the community has ended up with us making an investment as well that's really cool and then like i guess what um what really excites you right now um like as you're seeing uh others building and played or like is there anything any trends or anything people should be paying attention to beyond what we've already discussed um there's just an incredible diversity of new games that are coming out from like racing games virtual worlds um there are like full mmos being built there are kind of a strategy game so yeah that's the exciting part in that once all of these worlds get built out there's really like no shortage of choice for you to choose like what kind of adventure you want to be in what part of group you want to take part of and earn an income at the same time um and then so what have you noticed beyond like the earning income piece really resonates with people about joining ygg or kind of the play to earn movement so i think actually a lot of people aren't motivated by the income alone they they like the um the concept of i'm coming in investing my time and probably some money forming a group with like-minded people and going on these adventures and then getting rewarded for these adventures so it's like going on dnd with your group but the money that you earn is actually real so it's that rather than like a pure like financial transaction it said the community aspect is actually stronger and i think that's what makes it sustainable for any game or a community where if you see people having fun with these games before they start earning serious money i think that game will be more sustainable and then um we saw will talk about uh loot prior to this talk um curious what you think about um how loot and kind of similar gaming primitives uh are going to impact platon yeah i really love the experimentation around loot i think that the community is trying to figure out like what kind of game experience is really going to be built around that and it's not at the stage yet where ygg can see a game that earns heal that we could invest in but yeah i really love the experimentation behind it and then so uh what comes next for ygg like what are you focused on right now so uh we're doing a lot of uh international scaling we call it the kind of like uber for digital asset strategy where we are going out region per region and creating regional subdials with local community managers who are uh basically know the communities on the ground and while they're like smaller versions of ygg in southeast asia in latin america in india in china and they're kind of configuring um ygg towards the particular tastes of each market so they may be playing different games for example it's like different assets different kind of nuances in the community and language and that's how we'll be onboarding millions of people to play to earn very cool um so i wanted to leave time for audience q a uh kartik are you going to be reading those offer yes um linda gave us an awesome chat um we have a lot of questions we have a whole spectrum of things coming in from the chat so there's a whole mix of people who are trying to understand what ygg and fedor earn is and and sort of how nft and gaming sort of makes and then most people already understand the ygg ecosystem and they have more questions about that so i'll try to do a whole spectrum of a lot of these questions maybe just to start off you kind of touched on this a little bit but could you give a slightly bigger overview on sort of uh what your communities right now like who are your users are they students or adults or people with jobs as well as doing this thing for fun like just a little bit more detail around who they are and how they can act the demographic base is extremely broad and i would say it's worldwide and um from i would say like college age to uh like adults and even like we see people 60 plus like for example my my dad is actually playing axe infinity and using it as kind of supplement to uh to expansion so it's very broad i think 40 to 50 percent are around southeast asia right now particularly the philippines where it started going viral but um yeah we're seeing a lot of communities go up even in latin america across africa and even in places in us or europe where the community base is smaller but a lot of them tend to be more like the asset investor type meaning they're the ones investing in these nft assets and then lend them thing out to uh to people from around the world well i wanted to ask on related to that i know you've talked about your son and how he's playing uh so can you talk a little bit more about like how he got into it like how old is he and kind of what was his experience yeah right so my son is 12 years old and he started off playing axe infinity two years ago i actually lent him some axes and he was just playing the game and earning slp um and yeah that's actually how we he started having a crypto portfolio and he used the slp um to buy uh the governance token of uh axe xs when it came out last november and also to buy ygg tokens and the guild when uh when it went public in in july and then does he like what does he think of all of this um like does he understand kind of the broader movement or is it kind of just more um like kids playing games like i'm curious so interestingly for kids like him who have never grown up in a world without internet or even without cryptocurrency like it feels completely normal for them to have digital currency that has value i don't think a lot of kids his age own crypto and but at the same time it's completely normal for them like there's no concept of you know what is a real currency on what is not for him it's just another maybe digital points he's keeping track of but this one is something that he converted to the fiat or to offline money [Music] well um another sort of set of questions are just around understanding how the the now of dao sort of uh is structured here so you obviously are a big focus there is on axi but i can cause you walk us through sort of how you think about adding or supporting more dows or more games and just kind of what that process is like and sort of how you decide what to prioritize well this process is still very much uh i would say underway but if there are regions being formed or if there's a lot of activity for one particular game we basically create a sub dao under it and we did this for one game league of kingdoms where uh it has actually has its own token yglo yglok that is owned by the members of that sub-dial and there is governance so we set up a snapshot page for governance and they've passed several proposals for example where the yield that was earned by the land which is uh in dai uh was converted into uh sea dye so that it would earn more yield on top of that and then there was also another proposal passed by um the the sub-dial so that the yield that they that they earned in the last few months were actually they bought ygg tokens in uh when it went live so it's pretty interesting to see how this collective action in these sub-dials have their own little kind of sub-communities there's like a whole thing i'm trying to you know stop myself from uh from digging into but but uh we'll see how much we can do and so so one big question that i have for for you is obviously you have a community of thousands of people um and not just like members who are on discord or something just active uh contributors to this um let's talk about tooling um you're managing this at scale uh there's so many different pieces here so many different sub communities could you talk to us about how do you think about dow tooling or it's tooling to make your own um ecosystem better and sort of what some of the common things are just everything around that we'll kind of dig into a lot of things from there right so our approach is we want to start simple and then figure out like the mayor minimum that we need and kind of just evolve as we go along we don't want to start with a very complicated piece of dow tooling and then kind of have to be stuck with it so that's why we started with snapshot which is super lightweight um and actually we just hired a full-time dow manager who who's already done the concept of subdials in um in another protocol and we are trying to see like what does the if uh how does that evolve so all of the all of the assets are run by uh gnosis multisig which is like very important part of what we're doing so if you have your gnosis you have the ability to create a token and then you can do snapshot you can basically get started with a sub down and what we're building internally is a way to kind of create a gamer profile for the people who are part of our guild which means we are rewarding nfts that are not transferable to people who are doing certain actions within the guild and the nf the non-transferable nft is a very important primitive in our end because it allows people to kind of prove that they did certain actions and like you can't buy that or trade that off anybody so now you're creating a rich profile of basically achievements that someone has done inside the guild uh related to that um there's i think a lot of builders in the audience and what uh feature requests do you have for some of the dow tools or things that you think are missing in the tooling space that you'd love to see built uh yeah that's a very good question i think there's really like no concept yet of like nested dials which is what we're doing um and yeah just the ability to do that and then the asset management is also a very important thing so for example um for guilds to be able to really invest in millions of dollars of assets within games um the the landing part is actually really important i have to be able to delegate an asset to another user whether by at the wallet level or at the application level and just trustlessly like prove that they're able to use it they have access to it without having being able to run away with that asset so this is actually still i would say the the key missing piece that will allow nft based economies to really grow to potentially trillions of dollars at scale i have to be able to buy a land or then and lease it out to someone and then have rights over that um to be able to lend someone my sword and not be afraid that that person disappears forever so this is one of the key components that is really not been solved yet and does like is the way that you solve it through a new standard or um can you build on the existing standard and kind of um like like iterate from there like how does that work i think the long-term solution is to uh create a new standard that wraps the nft erc 2721 standard and this adds delegation and permission rights to it um i have to be able to for example if someone lends me an nfd i still have to be able to use it in an application context i have to be able to uh do smart contract calls with it but maybe there will be restrictions on what i could do with it for example i can't sell it i can't transfer it to another address it can only go back to the center and maybe i'm streaming a payment to whoever owns it and when i run out of money then the the nft goes back to the original owner so it's still very complex and i think the hard part of creating a new standard would be actually getting everyone to adopt it but it absolutely needs to happen long term got it and then kartik let's just say maybe last question um before we went to the next talk um you obviously started this a couple years ago when there's so much that's happened in the past few months alone um if you could do something differently uh what would you have done if you were to start ygz oh wow so so we actually started ygg less than a year ago it's it's been 10 months only and like just so much happened um in the last 10 months we didn't foresee even as one of the biggest fans of ygg that everything would just begin to take off shortly after we uh we founded it i think uh shots i don't have really anything that i wish i do differently but we had like we've been very fortunate that we actually set up a way to scale this before nfd's absolutely exploded and yeah like i have zero regrets there amazing well uh gabby linda thank you so much for that amazing conversation and i hope uh everybody's questions got answered if you have something else that comes up we'll be able to read those questions to you but really appreciate your time and uh thanks again thank you again linda thanks for having us bye bye with that now we are ready to move on to our next talk so i want to introduce alex atala from openc to as our next speaker alex here we'll be talking about nft metadata and off chain and how all that works out here and there's so much to cover here so what i'll do is i'll just let alex jump in directly and without further ado please welcome alex alex um hey guys thanks for having me on uh apologies about the background noise i'm gonna train station in dc everything is quietest place i could get great again um let's start with the screen share it's still just loading you know yeah yeah it still says loading for me too um let me try to again or can everybody see my screen here without me all right i'll just do this so i wanted to do a talk about uh nft metadata starting from the beginning and go into decentralized versus centralized meta data and where we see it going down the road so to start with let's talk a little bit about nfts and how metadata fits into the big picture there nfts we can break down into a couple different components or a couple different themes that go into them there's property data property data is who owns what and how many of each thing does someone own some some of these tokens are not truly non-fundable they're also semi-fungible tokens that people colloquially call nfps when really one user can own multiple copies of them um all of that is considered property data but for the purposes of this talk i'm just going to be referring to all of these media attached tokens as nfcs we have property rights which is abilities that a certain token owner can access by owning the token so these could be things like oh owners of this token can can access another asset that's on chain um owners of this token can participate in a game that's being run by another smart contract uh owners of are partial owners of some semi-fungible token can uh interact with each other in a special method to play like an on-chain uh you know engagement and there's like a lot of creativity that hasn't really been explored for property rights there's also on-chain history what's happened to the nfc and and when that happened and all the events that involved in msca on the blockchain going back till it was minted or created and then there's metadata which is basically everything else what what what the content of the nft is um what information there is about it like like what what media is really being attached to it that is what we consider metadata it's a bit of a vague topic but we'll go into a couple specific examples really soon so metadata itself we can break down into a couple different components that we've seen so far there's images there's videos there's animations all these can be attached to nfts using metadata there's 3d models which are typically glb and gltf format there's name description properties information about which address or who created it and also links to other resources like links to an external site it could be links to other nfts links to the actual contracts that you can use to interact with the nft or at least other like environments that make the nxt special so an important website to check out to understand this a bit better and really go into details your developer is docs.openc.io there are but there is a metadata standard attached to the nft standards that you might have heard of erc 721 and 155 but it's pretty simple so what openc has done is expand the metadata standard and add rich properties and new things that developed what we've just watched developers adopt over the last three and a half years openc started in december of 2018 and back then there was absolutely no metadata standard and most nfts were just kind of guessing and throwing out random data inside of it from their smart contracts over time more and more developers have adopted similar looking json formatted metadata and all the site is is a way of collecting like the most common most and our suggestion for what your metadata could look like and if your metadata looks like something that represents the files described in this uh in this thought it'll automatically work out so here's an example you can create rich traits here's the herbie star belly this is the name um openc creature this represents the metadata around the smart contract which i'll get to later um there's no like creator data on this item but there could be and then it would display in the description pane right uh right in the middle of the screen we have properties these are fixed strings um that you can just attach to a single nft and you can give these strings trait type names so like this is a trait type of base and a trade value of jellyfish and openc will automatically compute the rarity of each of your properties so that users can figure out pretty quickly how rare something is and what makes it rare users can also click on these attributes in the openc ui and it will show them all the nfts in your collection or contract that have that property on them so you can easily visualize and explore your selection there's stats these are just numbers that don't only generally fit in any other category and they're sorry there's also levels which are numbers that are out of something like that have some kind of maximum value that you want to configure yourself so these could be things like generation stamina um anything that has some kind of mass value associated with it metadata can also apply to entire smart contracts not just nfvs smart contracts are often represented as collections on openc and collection is just a bunch of nfcs that belong to some uh common theme typically just one smart contract powers of collection so we have name and description we have the image or logo for the collection we have the royalty this is the percentage of each seller fee that goes to whatever the royalty recipient is and whoever deploys a smart contract can instantly go to openc and configure their all these attributes about their collection even if they forgot to do it in the metadata itself um as long as they own the smart contract launching here's the url for going a little bit more detail about setting up contract level metadata notice that for both for contract level metadata we have a little code snippet here but i didn't and i didn't show the equivalent in uh nft metadata it looks like this these code snippets are really important in your contracts there's a that for for erc 721 there's a method called token uri token uri accepts one argument token id and returns a string and this is how openc will pick up your smart contracts the url or the resource for your metadata given a single nfc's token id in this example we take the base token uri for the whole collection and we append the token id to the end of it so if you had centralized metadata something like this url here this is a heroku app url um you create your own api that just takes in a token id at the end and returns nft y and json json that looks like this name description image attributes if your api returns an object that looks like this it'll automatically show up on openc and after indexing happens which sometimes takes a few minutes to an hour um everybody will be able to discover it and search by these attributes on opc2 so it's a very like programmable web and you don't have to get overseas permission do that per se as long as you're you actually own all the work and you know it complies with the terms of service you will have an nft up on openc immediately that's kind of the beauty of the whole concept permissionless innovation on top of philippine blockchains so back to contract uri this is the equivalent of token uri but for the whole contract so here's an example we have open c creatures description an image an external link seller fee basis points this is this represents the percentage seller fee that you want to take for all successful sales so 100 would be a one percent seller fee and fee recipient this can be a smart contract address or a wallet address if it's a smart contract address you can use it to split the royalty between multiple recipients you just have to call the smart contract to receive it next wanted to cover a little bit about debugging metadata so a lot of developers get their metadata in a a lot of different way when we rephrase that a lot of developers want to work on their metadata in real time especially in test nets and need some way to see if openc is picking it up properly or if they've been following the metadata standards properly so we have a validate endpoint this is kind of a nice little bit to know in our docs that not too many developers uh know how easy or how simple this makes metadata development but you can use the validate endpoint to take your smart contract address and your and the specific token id and see what errors show up when open seed parses your metadata this is especially useful if you're doing something unusual like having both an image and a video attached to your nfp or both an image and a 3d model and wanting you want to make sure that the image will show up in the grid view on opencv but the 3d model or animation shows up when you click into an nft and see it large in a single item page next topic i wanted to cover is decentralizing metadata so metadata you can break down into both into two buckets there's centralized data which just get stored on some google cloud or some server somewhere um and there's decentralized metadata which can either be on a file storage a decentralized file storage network like ipfs a block chain like system for storing files like are we or directly on chain meaning the image name etc all the metadata is actually in ethereum itself or in polygon itself whatever blockchain the nft is on the latter is expensive to do because you pay to store all those bytes on the blockchain and blockchains are typically not made for things like that and that's why we have ipfs and are we which are lower much lower cost ways of storing large amounts of data so centralized metadata has had two major downsides there's impermanence server can go down and then you can't find the metadata you had and this is particularly important for nfts that are cultural you want you want them to last like decades or hundreds of years or more um so it really matters that they never go down and that they and that there's some kind of guarantee to the creator and collector that they'll always stay up and then there's mutability um collectors want to make sure that they're that the metadata the nft that they're buying is always going to look the same and the that the creator or any anyone else is not going to be able to change it we have a bit about decentralized metadata in our docs if you use ipfs to host your metadata or are we it'll automatically work on opc um you should omit the part that specifies which um [Music] which gateway you're using for ipfs and arleigh that way if the gateway goes down at some point in the future it doesn't really matter gateways are just a a way for like miners or relayers on file networks to relay files to any consumer and you don't really want to be dependent on the gateway um we will automatically ignore your gateway at openc but it's usually best practice it's usually pretty interesting or something that hardcore collectors will look at to see if your decentralized metadata is truly gateway free so here's an example of a gateway free ipfs url and the gateway free rweeb url another interesting thing about metadata on openc is that we've added a couple like additional elements to the erc721 and the 1155 standards so you can improve the way your metadata shows up one is emitting a new type of event called permanent uri so if you have the ability if you let users change metadata for tokens they're creating on your contract you can omit this event and then openc will automatically see that oh this developer think that according to this contract this token uri has metadata that is no longer changeable so we will consider it frozen meaning collectors will see that no one can ever change this metadata and if you want your entire smoke you want to tell us that your whole smart contract is frozen and you don't want to admit permanent uri events for every single token id you can contact us on our help center and we can help you a couple different types of metadata storage um backing up to what i was saying a few minutes ago we have centralized and decentralized metadata and and even if you want to go with centralized metadata you can make it verifiable on chain so a really good example of this is crypto box crypto punks doesn't have the images on chain itself like on ethereum but they do have a hash that's stored in the smart contract a hash of the combination of all 10 000 images so you can check that hash to see if at some point in the future someone who stores cryptopunx images has changed one because then the hash of all 10 000 will be different from what you see on the theory likewise in the decentralized camp um you can have both decentralized metadata that is stored somewhere in rov or ipfs or directly on chain but isn't necessarily immutable someone can change it later it's important to like if you're a collector and doing due diligence on nfts to go into the smart contract and look that up yourself um openc will try to do that diligence for you you should always do it on your own and when we detect that something is not only decentralized but also unchangeable by the creator we mark it as frozen and it shows up like this you can hover over it and you get a tooltip this item's metadata was permanently locked and stored in decentralized file storage i there's a bit more i can cover about these four types they're covered in our blog though encourage people to check it out if they're interested um if you want more details about like centralized and verifiable nfts and different examples um examples of decentralized versus decentralized and frozen nfts and the differences between our weave and ipfs uh we'll gloss over those details but feel free to ask me about them in q a in terms of the future of metadata i'm not going to go into lots of details here but i have a couple guesses of what's to come seeing new kinds of 3d models that are showing up as animations models that aren't necessarily glb and gltf uh one example see if i can just navigate to it right now um there's a cool collection called bonsai and these nfts they're loading kind of slowly so i'm just going to wait for a bit they actually have usdz [Music] um 3d models attached to that usdz is apple's 3d file format and it lets you your tree get it through your ios devices camera you can use it for modeling and ipad apps um this is what they look like looks like some fonts but um you can take a look at it and experiment with new 3d models and we're very excited to work with projects that want to do something different in the 3d space there's also nft hyperlinks i really haven't seen much of this it's very surprising i think that um we haven't seen a lot of good examples and that she's trying to link to each other a really early example was cryptokitties every cryptokitty had parents that read it this is considered an nfc hyperlink but it wasn't directly in the metadata in a way that was easily parcel um with the look on chain and figure it out uh there's also interesting metadata around multi-chain items so an item that's created on another blockchain and then bridge to ethereum or vice versa we'll often have information in the metadata about like wallets that exist in non-evm chains and which wallets created it um which wallet currently owns it and opens he's very excited to work with developers building bridge metadata standards there's also richer unlockable content right now if you don't want if you want to give owners the ability to unlock content on openc yeah you can only use text right now um we've like there aren't a lot of standards around unlockable content because something is being hidden and can't be revealed on chain but they're i think would be really exciting to figure out how to enforce secrecy with some parts of the content and support that in secondary marketplaces like opc lastly there's legal attachments and licenses licenses are an incredibly undertapped area of nfps imagine font licenses for example every time you buy a font it's important for fonts to be scarce otherwise you just see it on too many websites and it's not special anymore so imagine buying fonts and be being able to you know trade them on the secondary market to find the true market value but also provably uh like show that you own the license to a box and not have to like jump through these really strange centralized and obscure or opaque marketplaces that currently power flat licenses and uh and cheesy quote but the point is that metadata standards are not supposed to constrain creativity around nfps so this is really the beginning of them and it's likely going to change dramatically in just a year's time so if you're working on something new sorry about the background noise yeah don't let these standards constrain you awesome alex uh thank you so much for that amazing talk um interestingly uh so many of our listeners are developers i think that q a turned into uh customer support for the dev tooling side so i'll try to filter some of those questions out but uh uh two two kind of obvious questions that i have from from our chat is um so people are very curious to hear about um how the split or or just sort of the the developer experience has been like uh on our rov versus ipfs and if you've noticed anything that's either easier or not easier compared to uh as people are maintaining enfts and adding metadata there yeah good question are we we've seen a lot of adoptions recently for and uh there are parts of it i think they're really exciting it's a bit more like a blockchain with ipfs it's important to know how many nodes have copies of your member data and i think they're working on making the redundancy more transparent and easier to check out from a collector's point of view but to answer your question directly we we see a lot more nfts using ipfs than our weave on ethereum on other blockchains the dominance is a lot less um and i think that's where we're seeing the most are we growth awesome another sort of question on that same topic is uh what happens or how often do you run into scenarios where the uh anywhere from the metadata to handling asset just uh isn't available uh if if the permalink kind of disappears like did you run into invalidation of content or is everything actually permanent and you haven't these types of scenarios openc caches metadata in our own cloud and if we see that we can't access the metadata because the centralized server is down now we keep whatever copy we had before in our cloud so it's a way of giving collectors a little bit more peace of mind in case something disappears we have seen like we have seen this happen a few times and sometimes the metadata just goes back up on the on the original server like a few weeks later or sometimes the game or the the server really does go down forever um but we've we've just kept our our copies and maintained redundancy in those places awesome and the last question is a lot of people have asked if they can go through the slides uh in more detail on their own pace so um if you can send us a link to the slides we'll be able to share that either on the chat or post post this summit to everybody online [Music] will do perfect thank you so much alex and uh hope you enjoy the rest of your trip sounds good thanks for having me great next up we have our amazing panel we're going to be talking about nfts and metaverse for this panel we'll have four amazing people join us um we have dylan from figma we have pro um from diaper labs we have marguerite from neon district and moderating this panel will be drew austin from bradbee adventures and um i'll uh welcome all of them here and uh have uh drew sort of go into introducing all of our panelists and having them talk about who they are so without further ado let's welcome our amazing panel [Music] [Music] hello how are we doing everybody good how are you doing i'm doing good are we jumping right in ready to go yes you are lead the way let's go let's do it all right hi everybody i'm drew austin uh i'm a managing partner over at red beer adventures uh and just a real brief uh i'll do we'll do a quick round of intros because um i think everyone here has just got such an awesome story and then we will uh we'll jump in and start talking metaverse nfts and and see where it goes um so my background i've been a founder 15 years uh in different frontier technology companies and over the last 12 months started up a venture capital syndicate called red beer adventures have been very active in the blockchain metaverse nft space uh investors investing in two of the companies up here with dapper and marguerite's company as well from so um i we've invested in a variety of different metaverses from you know wilder world to super world to uh sandbox and uh art marketplaces like super rare and uh gaming companies like zed runs so we're you know we're really active in the space we're really excited about um investing in these in ecosystems like the flow ecosystem and some of the companies that are building on top of flow and um and i'm a personally i'm an active investor in nfts themselves and the top 50 portfolio holder on top shot and big stable on zed run and i um and a lot of sandbox land that we developed and then recently we just released our own nft project called uh knights of d-gen which is a really cool project i did with a great team of people and we're having a blast man just learning and building and creating and investing and just meeting great people so that's been my my story uh marguerite you want to uh introduce yourself real quick absolutely thanks drew um so margaret d corcell i'm ceo of blockade games we're building neon district which is a cyberpunk rpg we have uh dynamic nfts that evolve through the gameplay i've been in this space the blockade has been around for about four years now i've been in creative technology and in the crypto space specifically since 2014 um was one of the first artists in this space i've gotten to be here and see the entire space evolve as we've been exploring what's possible for creatives with blockchain technology so um of course i'm having a blast watching all the possibilities and iterations on nfts and where we are today um everything from like loot you know and seeing like people explore the different gamification um tactics plus just fine art in general watching sotheby's and christie's take off and get around behind nfts this year it's been a blast so anyways um i'm very passionate about the intersection of the metaverse gaming fine art um and yeah awesome dylan you want to go sure hi everybody um good to see y'all my name is dylan uh i'm the ceo and co-founder of figma and we are a design platform so trying to make it so you can do everything from whiteboard and brainstorm all the way to design ui and ux to get that code into production uh and my interest in nfts started really with the crypto punk's launch uh started to track it then um i was really lucky to kind of be earlier on the earlier side there and then uh with openc was thankful to me being a seed investor and have tried to be supportive and active in ecosystem sense uh and it's been amazing to watch this past six months eight months nine months whatever i don't know what time is uh and to see what's happening in the world of nfts um i i think it's just an absolutely fascinating primitive that we're going to see be explored in so many different ways and i think even on this call you know we've got you know a few different ways that it's being explored that we can talk about i remember actually at east denver when neon district launched uh from the hackathon project and i was like that's cool you know and so it's just awesome to think about like at this event what will be the projects that'll be like the next neon district uh or or actually i remember um when uh my wife then girlfriend was at eid waterloo and she's like man i just saw this really cool thing it's called cryptokitties so there's been so many amazing projects that have come out of the youth global ecosystem and i can't wait to see you what's going to come out of this one it's awesome ro yeah thanks drew um my name is ron garrett goes-luff co-founder and ceo of that labs um we've been big believers in the nfc space for for a while uh authored the original erc 721 standard on on ethereum built cryptokitties most recently focused on nba top shot and taking the nfts to the sports world and you might have seen we now the la liga partnership a couple days ago another big one uh coming next week and we're also the original developers behind the flow blockchain uh which at this point has several thousand developers uh and and fortune 500 companies building on top of it um but you know i have a very soft spot in in my heart for global events exactly because of what dylan mentioned uh i don't think cryptokitties would have happened if it wasn't for heath global and just bringing the community together giving you know we we put little pictures of cats on pokemon cards and it was sort of the first time you know it's like hey cats can be collectible too uh and uh and sort of getting getting that kind of energy uh to kick off the project was was super critical so i'm really excited to be here and to talk nfts i think we're absolutely at the start of this journey and so everyone here is right place right time you know four years ago maybe we were a little bit a little early we had to grind a little bit but um i think the next quarter is gonna be gonna be super fast all right awesome so let's start a little bit let's like i think it's really interesting we have so many different approaches i think there are some things like it was kind of you know it's obvious when you think of blockchain and nft is that like gaming has a place for it sports cards have a place for it like you can get or has a place for it does anyone find it interesting what are your thoughts on this pfp movement the profile picture like i think that is it's like it is fascinating to me that of of all the things that like really would have struck a chord with people that these pfp concepts and communities really took off and i'm curious your thoughts like i mean marguerite what do you i mean you've been in this space for so long and you've been involved in some of the like i i would say some of the more like complex but also powerful concepts behind nfts this is kind of simple in a way but but powerful in itself so you know what are your thoughts on it you know what i think is really interesting about that is it is like the most tangible like i feel like when we think about the beginning of nfts and how people can understand what they are like the fact you can have these generative experiences of creating these images there's really no like in most in a lot of cases there's not a real formula that's like a gamified formula to them they're just like here's this drop and then we've generated all these and then there's just rarities assigned to the different versions that are created which i think back to cryptokitties and how much more cryptokitties was like way more sophisticated and conceptually with like how they had dna and just the components so i find it interesting that people eat the complexity and what was interesting with as far as smart contract development around cryptokitties as well is not being utilized in most cases with these pfp projects it's really just the art like it's it's like this visual understanding of the transfer like this you can we can transfer the the images and people are just excited about that like it's just like they're really excited about the most simple part of the entire like world of what we're developing around nfts and actually dylan with ethe moji like i have an emoji moji was one of the first pfp sort of like projects where you have an avatar and actually i believe you worked alongside the openc founding team prior to openc uh on emoji and so like you know you had this composable it's a composable avatar essentially and how come like and it's user driven so you can build them how and like when are we going to get from people from this phase of being given these generative pieces to where they get more excited about having hands-on like building as far as the outcome um i think i think like the whole everyone's learning that a limited distribution of 10 000 assets only for the function of like this idea of creating rarity but then we're like pay walling out any continued distribution of that model it doesn't really work and i think everyone that's building games like rohm knows i know you know this the the real um trick is to have super wide distribution and then introduce rarity in a way that's protected by a game design that can build the ecosystem so anyways i think that it's great that people are exploring art and they're experimenting with crossover of community and intersections and interests but i do think everyone's learning very gradually that um like you see people in real time asking like oh there's we like this is a problem and how do we solve it and so people are walking through this path together and they're all walking towards gaming they just haven't realized it yet so we're all like so we've all been here what four years building this and so we're just waiting and so like the funny thing is for me so i bought my my first collectibles my first nft ever was i well maybe it was a crypto kitty but the one i really remember was super rare's art for some reason don't i that's what really like completely transformed my perspective i think it was the end of 18 2018 and i bought some art on super air and i was just like that was it for me i was hooked because the concept made so much sense now i preached art i preached and at crypto to a lot of my non-crypto friends and no one came near crypto until top shot because that's that that was what got my social circle to finally have text groups that they actually were active in where we were talking about crypto and nfts every day so like rome what are your thoughts on this like on how on top shots roll in it's bringing these new people into nft community and then seeing them migrate to pfps and how that's going to translate into further you know the further evolution of this space you know tell me what your thoughts are look i mean i i think the profile picture uh boom i you know i have a board ape you know i i think i'm a supporter of all of these projects but i think they're still pretty small they're much more status games for the ultra wealthy than they are um you know anything that that can sort of directly translate to to millions or hundreds millions of people and then you if you look at even you know art like art blocks has about twenty thousand nineteen thousand total owners um uh the the only projects that sort of get close to breaking double digits triple digits um are you know zxc and topshop and it's because they they have that funnel that that marguerite's talking about where you can kind of get started with you know without a huge investment and and you can do stuff you can you can kind of you can get into habits in a sense and i think that you know the profile pictures um are are today kind of a um an amazing sort of um you know a an experience for for the wealthy and i think that that's that's been you know i in particular the board apiacal has pulled it off really well where they're creating so much community value out of out of the assets uh but they're also a hint towards what's going to be coming i'm sure some of the folks here heard that twitter is putting in authentication for for an entrepreneurship you know you can kind of say hey this is you know my avatar and to marguerite's point i think what the masters will want is more customization is more um you know just interactivity with their with their product maybe earning things for their avatar as as things grow and that's a big reason why we've been really big fans of genies and leaned in with the genius team because we think they're they're taking kind of a gen z first approach to saying well if we're all going to live in digital worlds and we need digital identities how do most people want those digital identities to work now ultra wealthy for sure they want like you know what you want the picasso on your wall right but not that many people can afford that um and so um and so there's sort of how do we how do we bridge from from here to there um is is going to be really um an interesting an interesting exercise totally totally unless i'm telling like the you know i think it's always funny and you're like you know you're very much involved in creative and art and this stuff is like in your world like i sometimes find it funny how like my friends now talk about art and it's kind of like like it's almost like to the point where like we're at a bus stop they see an app oh look at the art on that bus stop like it's like you know anything is now art art has become the card it's really getting spec it's really interesting now people's definition of art like oh did you see the art on that camel it's like oh god but um so what is you know what is your thoughts on on how this is like what this is doing for the art world as well and the creative world and is it creating is it's a good thing is it a bad thing what are your thoughts there oh it's a great thing i mean i think and obviously i'm highly biased in the answer i mean i'm i'm really you know a significant portion of my net worth is in nfts but i i think um the question of what is art usually drives art forward and regardless of whether we see uh nft art markets crash when a cryptocycle comes i wouldn't be surprised right uh you know sometime the next two years maybe sooner uh quite a bit sooner we'll we'll probably see a crypto crash crypto is a cyclic asset it's not going to be up it up forever despite the mania that we're all in right now um and that doesn't mean that it doesn't have significance uh i think there's great significance here and i think that you have to basically separate the significance of sort of the conceptual from the actual monetary volume value that's changing hands and that's kind of why i think that the term collector is sometimes overused because you know there's a lot of speculators in the space that's okay uh speculators are sort of like creating liquidity pools for people to be able to buy this artwork and be able to invest in artists but i think if you zoom out to just um some of the macro trends that are going on you know we're going from a physical economy to a digital economy in a digital economy people want digital goods because they're living online right and i think that as we are navigating the digital economy um you know whether it's a profile picture you know i i've thought that several times oh man profile picture projects are dead and then i'm always reminded of sort of like the was it the patent office you know in the early 1900s 1800s whatever it was and they're like oh yeah i'm not sure any more patents will be exist will uh will exist after some time we should probably shut it down uh you know and it's like you know then you see projects like boarded up four-day api club where you see projects like the noun project where you've got actually uh this incredible group of people coming together to be able to buy a noun every single day contribute the funds to a dow and have that dow then be able to vote on what they should do their first act actually being charitable contribution which i thought was incredible um and so i think that uh every time we think that we see the limits of some type of the medium we're going to see further innovation because we've taken somehow we've created this honeypot for the world's creatives and they've come to it and they've realized that there's actually some money there as well and that for some of them they can actually subsist off that and from there that unblocks their creativity and i think that uh you know loot is another great example of that i'm obsessed with it i haven't obsessed since it launched you know it's such an exciting project to me because here's an example of rather than having a franchise like sports or a created universe like neon district which are both amazing right um but instead it's like let's go world build together let's go figure out how as a community we can create a new world which i think really gets the definition of metaverse um you know no one really knows what metaverse means it's this collection of loose terms right now i'm pretty sure it's something to do with decentralization i'm pretty sure it has something to do with like yes and principle of improv i'm pretty sure it has to do with like building on each other's works and derivative projects and loot to me is right the center of all those things and so i get very excited about that project and just see what comes from it so that's awesome so like let's so next driver of growth you know like so i guess my theory if i think about the thesis here it's like i saw you know we were in the speculation phase with crypto from like 2013 to 18 then there was the ico bubble that crashed the winter hit companies died good companies built and out came d5 and i think d5 brought utility and an entirely new wave of value to the tokens that were able to sustain that winter we're well-funded with great teams and be able to then rise above and now have a phenomenal utility of kind of rebuilding the financial infrastructure from the ground up i you know in my perspective and you know margaret you might even say this was farther back but like i feel like we've been the two in the nft space since 2018. that's just my view maybe it's like 2017 or even 16. um and it's been a speculation phase as well like people speculating buying selling it's the the the the foundational principles are we like to buy dope and we want to make money while we do it and like that's kind of a lot of the i actually kind of disagree with that i i think that there are uh i think it's important that their people know there's a corner of the internet that's like long-term collectors that believe uh that there's a canon being created of nft art and that art like for example i'm a member of fingerprints dao which takes the thesis of you know they're the sort of on-chain art that is going to be the sort of native art form uh for nfts in blockchain and their entire philosophy sorry which one was that you said uh fingerprints now and their philosophy is to this is what i started to get really involved i asked the creator he had bought an autoglyph that i wanted and i said hey you know can i buy that off of you guys and said sorry our entire point of view and philosophy and i was like sign me up i want to be as involved in this doubt as possible because that was exactly what i was looking for yeah um and and so i want i do want to just correct that because i think that not everyone is a speculator in the space sure okay so i think that's totally fair i would say i guess from my perspective the broad audience and if you think about see most of the buzz in conversation has a lot to do with speculation there are people that are deeply absolutely but i think the most driver of use around us nfts in the short term in the near term at least from what i've seen with my networks of people that weren't even crypto people that are now entering the space is speculation of price and speculation of value it's speculation of long-term or short-term value but then like i guess my point being here is that then they're like we go through the speculation phase just like we did with crypto there will be a winter eventually at some point and out of that i think you can come to the networks which is the true native whereas the native home for these assets okay but in between that i think the metaverse is still a ways away true ways away what do you think are the nearest term next innovative drivers of adoption of nfts uh marguerite it looks like yeah so i actually i'm gonna throw this at dylan um i really believe that there's two spectrum like this when we think about the spectrum of innovation and what you're seeing why we might experience winters because there's a lot to be built still and on one end we're gonna be exploring interactive nfts and uh what what infrastructure and framework will want for that across across all the different applications you know what we're going to need from our marketplaces to support that across the different applications to the other side is a no code remixing platforms which i think dylan is completely positioned to just knock it out of the park everything from his proof of concept with emoji to like now his platform with figma like so i want to know when is a when are we going to have a no code remixing platform dylan well i don't know what that but the uh in terms of when that will be but i'm certainly not building it right now uh but i love the idea of remixing uh and i love the i think actually uh some examples of that recently just to call out some projects i think are really cool here one that i saw was deaf beef and death beef has a series of projects and they're basically audio visual experiments in the blockchain they have a c code to render the projects in the smart contract and then they have a series of different artwork one of them series three is called entropy and for entropy whenever it's transferred the artwork changes and degrades kind of like if you have a record vinyl the more you play it uh the more scratchy it gets it's a similar sort of fashion that's cool another one that i thought was really interesting um was uh but knots and but maps and so but maps basically you had uh this entire process they used to basically mint on chain uh the artwork itself uh you could do things like compose and translate the color palettes as well as to draw and then from there you could buy the bookmaps if you had missed that phase and actually mint what's called a but not which is for the next character in their created universe um also partially unchained um and i think that that was also really interesting as a derivative work um the third that i'll point out is kind of similar to both ideas which is this project that not many people have seen yet called animal coloring book which is an example of basically you discover the properties of the nft as you are then minting it and then transferring it so every time it transfers it's an additive thing sort of the opposite of the series three uh you know deaf beef example it's you know you likes have a ft called uh cat and i have some outline of a cat and i transfer it over to you marguerite and you get you know the outline of the face and then i trans you transfer it to rohan and he's got the eyes and he transfers the drew the eyes are kind of like googly eyes you know and and it's just really neat because you kind of discovered the nft as its transfer and i think um one thing that is going to also be really important for an ft's is zero knowledge proofs um i think if you think about remix ability composability uh and also just gameplay you know if you are playing world of warcraft and you have your bag of items it's really important that people don't know exactly like what's in your bag and zero knowledge proofs i think you could actually use them in the future not saying that that we all have figured out exactly ideas today but one day we're going to have a world where people can play these games and have items that others do not know they have and i think that'll be just as important as the status games that people are playing on twitter today with profile pictures ron what do you think what do you think are you going to be that's awesome what do you think are going to be the next like major near-term drivers of unique adoption um well i think you're seeing it kind of across the board and i just want to say you know it's true that crypto is cyclical and will go through up and down markets and especially um nfts that rely on a lot of speculative energy would be affected um gaming historically does really well in sort of recessions of all kinds entertainment is something people need through thick and thin and and you know i mean we launched top shot during a time and nobody cared what nfts were um and people came to it i mean admittedly there was an excitement about trading cards you know game basketball games weren't happening and so you know there were it just kind of tapped into a zeitgeist in a in a particular way even even back then but but it wasn't related to sort of crypto in particul specifically nor kind of the markets more generally and so i think especially if if we go when we go through sort of that cycle you'll see nft projects that are much more about the communities they're serving and much less about tapping into a sort of stream of you know a speculative energy in a way to kind of market make and and get into uh as dylan's saying sort of and i think that that will be good that'll be good it'll be a good chance for people to get in at the ground floor um i think that gaming is is the the sort of driver of you know adoption for millions of people um other than you know what i think what we're doing in sports is um is something that you know top shot itself can go from a million users to a billion users you know we're nba fans we're going to uh we're expanding to three four billion sports fans with soccer et cetera um but kind of seeing what let's say projects like chain monsters are doing where they're taking simplified gameplay from things like pokemon but giving true ownership giving trading creating meta economies around it that's going to do that that's going to be exciting for people through through thick and thin um and then the on the flip side is sort of music um i think it was chris dixon that said music is the industry or the biggest gap between sort of what the customer wants and even sort of what the artist is able to do or are able to monetize because there's so many kind of middlemen there's so many established interests there's so many kind of red tape in between and whether it's through the projects like sort of record shop or audience or others i think there's there's um that there's so much opportunity and kind of bringing fans closer to the people that care about um and so those are sort of three spaces so sports um gaming music are kind of what i get really excited about totally and i think it's interesting that like i mean i i think most people i speak to are incredibly excited about play to earn and the play to earn concept and and great gaming and i still think we're so early in that area like i you know i look at actually infinity and it's like a it's kind of an odd game to be the game that's like the face of a play to earn in my in my opinion but like i actually think there's a step before that which is owned so there's like own turn and then i think that we get to plato and i think the own to earn is kind of what we're seeing where defy is kind of shedding is kind of leaning into the nft space and by having certain types of assets you can like i think music could be the perfect home for the own to earn economy which is you know a lot of people are now talking about are you going to get royalties by owning a piece of a piece of an nft that when music is played you get a percentage of those royalties what are you guys thoughts on that before we move into plato exactly i think it's super exciting i mean the idea of nfts is a productive asset which is also part of marguerite's reference to eath mochi sorry i said it creates freedom for people to have to have those passive income streams is so important exactly and that was also partially the idea of emoji was the base layers you could have or even just uh things you put on top of that if you made a derivative work then you would get some income off of the new mint um uh the uh but yeah i think that um yeah that's that's an exciting very exciting idea and also just the idea of having some way to have the rights to an artist that you really like it actually will bootstrap new artists and ecosystem because basically you're betting on uh then you're saying okay let me go discover indie artists find the ones i think i'm going to take that are going to take off get rights to some of their music or fractionalize rights to some of their music of course and then from there that will actually create income for me if i'm right and so it when enables this sort of uh class of people that are these super fans of uh what's next in the music music world to actually monetize their passion um and i think that could become really really big really fast uh i also think that just as long as we're talking about other categories of what could come with nfts it's just um i think we're all still trying to imagine what this metaverse concept can be and how this patchwork of decentralized systems will come together and no one knows yet but um i think that there will be a world one day that more people are spending time in online we're already seeing that we're already spending time online we're just not doing it in a very interesting way and so um you know i think that you know when i grew up i played neopets right and that was like a huge part of my childhood um i think that you know if you think about the fast forward of that to world of warcraft to uh other mmos uh to then okay games like dark forest which i think are are way more interesting than axio infinity to me because that's an example of a complex strategy game that basically incorporates nfts as game items is built in webgl on a layer two years into your knowledge proofs in order to mine uh portions of the map that you can't see otherwise like you know there's so much uh exploration that can happen here it's only a matter of time before the first chipotle game comes out with nmts but it's also just a matter of time before someone builds a virtual world that actual goods and services will be represented and and uh property will present as more nfts we're seeing some of that but i think we're going to see a different level soon and i can't wait i'm really excited for what that will be so it's like making me want to go in a couple different directions but i'm gonna go i'm gonna start here first um well one let's talk play to earn for a quick second because i think there's before i get into the metaverse part of this which i really want to get to what are your thoughts on the future of work when we think about plato like how does it impact the future of works i like have some like weird philosophical thoughts on like you know what could happen to society if this like takes off the way it could margarite what are your what are your thoughts on on how played like how played i can also come from an hr text i just sold an hr tech company so like i think of when they think of play to work they think of like digital transformation i'm sitting here thinking like dude we're all gonna be working in the metaverse like that's the future of work but like what is your thoughts on the play to earn and future of work kind of uh situation yeah so i think that the challenge we've um the challenge that we're facing right now with building out these experiences is plato iron is really boughtable unless it has protected by a very strong game design and so even in d5 and even dark force dark force like it's really a game of who can build the best spot which is a game sure but is that fun for the person that's just trying to participate and walk in as a normal casual uh player no that's not fun right so um how do we build out experiences online that can engage an abstract human puzzle solving part of our um capacity that is different and is not audible and that actually is pretty complicated uh to build those kinds of game designs so i think that the space is currently exploring what has worked for the gaming industry and for a lot of these problems and protecting economies and we're trying to adopt them also uh with with our blockchain game economies so with the play to earn model um honestly games and the likelihood of games failing is is gigantic and that's why games it's really hard for investors to invest in gaming all by themselves now we've done this brilliant idea of adding like blockchain applications which are also very likely to fail that have never been like built before with games that are also innovative and very likely to fail and everyone's just going to try to figure out what formulas are working so that's why i think it's totally okay that people like loot we're starting very small at a proof of concept we're finding the most like fundamentally sticky thing about the experience and then i believe we're going to see projects that are successful from there get funding because they've proven a sticky formula and they're going to be able to go build a whole concept and game universe around those experiences so i do feel like right now to iterate iterative uh building scale or build fast and fail hard you know it should be everybody's especially if you're just a engineer and you're just trying to get like a proof of concept off the ground but i i don't think it's the right move to go do something crazy ambitious like build your own blockchain ecosystem simultaneous with like building a whole new aaa game studio even if you have industry experience on one of those fronts bro hum i remember when rohan launched flow and i was like are you sure that that's a good idea um anyways like that's so i i i'm really excited about seeing all these little projects get off the ground because there's so much potential in various ways of um so it's great seeing things like loot and these other projects being incredibly successful and you can see that there's something magical there and the community get behind it all right so before i move on to my next question i have to let rohan respond to being called roham is it is it crazy to have to building your own blockchain while you're building a game studio while you're building uh games and ip and all this other stuff yeah i mean it was nuts and we almost weren't able to do it um and don't forget we also had to build the payment rails right dapper wallet today is is still the best user experience for uh crypto payments and and you know we process over a billion dollars uh there and you know it's fully compliant fully sort of a regulatory you know very kind of well-lit experience the kind of thing that the mba and global brands want to use that's why genius is plugging into adapter on flow because they're going to be bringing the billions of fans of you know their partners and their artists and all those things and what are those folks going to do go download metamask you know it's just not going to work have to acquire cryptocurrencies it's just not going to work and then when it comes to flow you know when when you're looking at ethereum you're looking at uh l2s like there there's and then you know other other blockchains there are security tradeoffs moving off of youth maintenance but if mainnet is too expensive for most things and so when we when shopify was looking for a blockchain um and to for for shopify uh partners to be able to win 10 fts um they chose flow and when other fortune 500s are looking at the kind of network that can support not just the scale or at the cost but also the user experience the customer trust we choose flow flow's got 2 million active wallets right now million of those verified unique users from dapper and those you know across the other sort of non-custodial uh ecosystems um those are normal people they're not um you know they're coming to play train monsters and play nba top shot and uh use record shop shop and all these things they're not coming to um you know we don't really have yet the the kind of d5 ecosystem that that would uh bring kind of the traders and and the speculators well even though that's possible so was it crazy absolutely but but no question we made the right call because you know now i'm looking at what's happening gas wars and ethereum we're looking at smart contract has we built our own programming language you know cadence is the cadence was built from the ground up for uh not just nfts but also the kind of smart contracts we need the more complex kinds of smart contracts that hey we had to write four years ago for crypto kitties but b when you come into dows when you come into composable games um you know it's it's every single um every single step you know has to be thought of so you know we didn't do it lightly right like i spoke to vitalik multiple times we went through every other layer one um um uh architect and and you know from from sort of um and then we spoke to some of the later two teams although back then it was considered ron did you ever consider building a layer two as opposed to going like building like a version of like a matic in your own for your own instead of that look like we're not interested we weren't interested in saying let's build a band-aid solution we're interested in saying 10 years from now who's building the right trade-off space for consumer apps and no one was and no one is right like the paths people are taking are are either splitting things into layer twos going down the road of charting um reducing decentralization all of this stuff and flow today isn't everything it'll be in five ten years but we're very confident it's the right trade-off space nobody was thinking oh we need to write our own spark contract language everybody's thinking oh let's use russ that's a great idea or you know solidity is fine it's been around for four years we just disagree nobody is thinking of rethinking web3 you're saying well why not have you know metamask etc and then just use centralized wallets when you need it we disagree we think you need a wallet application interface that lets users juggle let's users take custody of that same wallet right cycle keys through it and you know it's all of these like bits and pieces where we couldn't convince anybody to sort of adopt our approach and we didn't want to just build a appendage to to someone else's network we think that this is the right trade-off space and someone's gonna eventually figure it out and so we said well let us all figure build it ourselves launch it with the nba uh bring on board and then oh blow up open the gates right let anybody build on top um let anybody host nodes and that's the that's the path that's going down you just want to add one thing i'll keep it really short uh i think both roham and margarita are correct in different ways here so marguerite point one of her points was you need to if you want to be a successful gaming company you need to watch a lot of things do it really fast test your concepts and iterate on them i think it's absolutely true games are a hit business uh you know rohm's point was that usability matters you gotta do whatever you can to get usability to work even if it means doing the crazy things and i think that um we do need more people that are going to do really hard long-term projects in this ecosystem dark force for example is one of those like i was really impressed with them because they integrated a wallet into the gameplay on top of a layer two right and they went and did a lot of ux improvements because they also said metamask like no one's gonna use it and that's not the way that the future of gaming is gonna look and so we're just in a stage and i also from figma have that bias you know took five years from going from starting figma to making our first dime uh from a customer right and so it's like these things take time uh and i think that um you know if you're working on gaming maybe try to do these short sprints but sign up for a long time period and know that it's not all going to work and if you want to do like the large big project that's awesome go to it you know and find ways to fund it and use the community that's around you to support you and try to rally those resources okay so i wanna i know we don't too much time but i wanna hit the metaverse stuff for a quick second so my big question here do you think the metaverse takes off and when i say take off and i know so don't you actually have like kind of opened up the definition of a metaverse in a bunch of directions but i guess at least the vision in my head do you think the meta that the metaverse takes off pre-vr or do we need i think it already has okay look at roblox roblox is a metaverse okay so do you that's that's the that was my i guess that's kind of where i'm going it might not be a metaverse that we like in terms of it being decentralized it might not be a metaverse we like in terms of like you know it's a lot of kids using it it's not like a lot of adults using it but you know like i bet a lot of kids really want roblox instead of dollars right now yeah your so your thought your your person your approach is you're i guess like so do you think that vr is even needed for the metaverse to thrive uh i i think i think that um it's vr ar are technologies that are coming and um over our lifespans uh they'll be just as important as mobile devices or screens um when exactly i cannot tell you um but i think they will become that and i think that people are already living online uh and i think that the fidelity at which they experience these metaverses will go up yeah i guess i guess because that you know when i think about this it's like if we are if we you know we're buying assets for a digital world um we're spending more and more time in the digital world the the theory that i have is that eventually our digital world needs to become more immersive to facilitate a truly um kind of almost almost human-esque like experience um you know marguerite what is your perspective do you think like do you think vr is going to play a big role in gaming and in some in the driving of adoption of nfts and is it do we have to just wait till apple decides to throw their hat in the ring like what's what's your thoughts here no i i think like the open metaverse is going to win um and i think that um i don't think i think users love collaborating and building and having the tools to participate and you can't do that and have that same ownership experience in a walled garden like no one wants to go build facebook's metaverse like no one's attracted to that um and i mean maybe there's a certain user but i can tell you the broader like everyone that wants to build the communities doesn't want to do like facebook's work for them um and so like i think that already like a little bit what dylan said is we're already here um i think that the little experimentation in the collaborative building i think that is the beginnings of the metaverse i don't know that there's going to be a definitive moment i i think there's just going to be intersections of projects that emerge and like they just continue stacking on top of each other and then people are going to work on those tech stacks to make different experiences possible and then people are going to have apis that connect um i think you first of that is openc i think openc is the hub of the metaverse right now i think the game is inventory management and that's the bottom of the funnel at the moment and um instead of like everyone focusing there and you're talking about speculation like for example neon district we have 130 000 asset owners now and and so and it's a free to play game so people can onboard and with that wide distribution since it's free and you can just walk right into the game and then we introduce scarcity and people can use their accumulation of the in-game currency neon which is not a token it's just you know like wow gold to buy and participate and compete for these rare assets um that is like for me we're creating our own universe there's a definitely an emphasis on creating our universe but it's a particular intersection and i have no doubt there's going to be overlapping like then diagrams of where neon districts and our user base like participates in other communities but i do think like giving your our users tools to help build out side quests help build outside stories have a star wars type universe where we drive major narrative experiences properties create the core economic value but give the opportunity and the bridges for other side economies to be building off of is going to be like that model for me is basically a microcosm of what i think will be the macro of the metaverse and i i think we are already building the tools and the assets that will be a part of it yeah one thing i'll add to marguerite's points uh she remind me of is just how important distribution is it's a really boring topic when we're talking about the future but just if you're building a game you need to be distribution um and that's a huge channel for you uh and so i think like that's one of the reasons i'm so excited about things like loot is because it creates an inherent distribution channel which is all the holders of loot especially as that ecosystem gets built up and people know where to look um when i think about the open metaverse i think one of the challenges that we have to solve to make it work uh which i also heavily subscribe to like marguerite i really want that to happen versus like having some you know evil monopolist overlord which is basically every other metaverse fiction they all have one um and i think what's important is how do we create distribution for people that are creating projects in this open metaphors very cool okay so uh we only have three minutes left so i'm going to ask a quick question for each person real quick name a project that you're excited about right now an nft project we got everyone's got their own little pet their own little like fun projects they're excited about um i'll drop one that i think is pretty cool because you guys just mentioned uh uh loot there's a project uh a buddy of mine was is involved in building called geohashes and i think geohashes is super interesting because it's also another derivative project but they built this derivative project over google earth um so anyone that needs to use mapping and locations and proximity they create this whole really interesting model around like a geohash and codes a geographic location into like a short string of letters and then you can you know then you can do whatever you want with that building building block so i thought that was like in the spirit of loot i think we're gonna see other building blocks like that that are gonna come out and now i'm really excited to see what games and what ways people utilize this stuff so that was one that i just thought was worth calling out um dylan which one uh tell me one that you're excited about well i've already talked a lot about loot deaf beef uh others um might be is it i think that that's just uh the the potential of on-chain media there is really exciting what i'll talk about instead uh is just sort of what i'm calling the nft chain rule which is basically that a meme's value is proportional to the number of derivatives that are made off of it and so i think like as you're looking at projects so there's a meta answer but as you're looking at projects i think that the the projects that will have the most value are the ones that will ultimately spawn derivatives um and i think that uh uh that's one thing to keep in mind is you're looking at different projects do you think the derivatives have value there's a huge debate about that uh no i think that actually the derivatives create value i know for the thing that the creature is on i agree with that part the question is do you think the derivatives that are created are also valuable if they also have derivatives that's well played well played margarita what do you got yeah so actually i'm uh launching a new interactive nft in a collaboration with uh tim king he's also known as illustrator and we made an interactive nfc with so it's with beat mixing taking stems of a famous artist that we were working with for a major brand for a big drop it's one of their first like like this big brand's first drops and um anyways it's a game also so as you as you remix the stems according to how it's supposed to be produced there's little you know of course with me making crypto puzzles naturally there's like like a crypto puzzle type game a whole inter like the remixing but the fact you can even do this from open c's asset page directly with iphone support and i'm excited about this because of a couple things one interactive nfcs and gaming directly from asset pages but then two um the fact that with music and stems i believe like this is a proof of concept imagine you could have an entire library of stems in which people could use for remixing purposes to create new content and new interactive nfts for different experiences you can have live streams of djing um and and and like having audio like the visualizers that match and so you could have these nfts that are showing you've got a dj streaming or a radio station that's playing i just there's so much to play with so i'm excited because that's kind of like a side project i've been working on and it's um dropping in about two weeks very cool very cool roman what's exciting what's exciting for you uh i already mentioned train monsters they just did a million dollar uh drop last week which which went really well chain monsters yeah that's the sort of pokemon um uh uh derivative derivative uh and and and people are starting to kind of think about well what what does it mean to build on top of these things um the dr seuss uh uh app just went into testing and that's cool because it's mobile first um it's also trading first so it's less about um you know flipping for high dollar amounts more about trading and completing sets and and then this sort of thing so um y'all should sign up sign up for that um and as an art platform i really like versus and all of these aren't flow versus sort of um totally uh on chain um the the actual site itself is um uh it is also serverless and and it's uh it's really neat uh setup because it kind of pits the big whale against the community and it says well will will the thing become a one-of-one or will it become you know more of an addition where uh multiple people can have access so that's interesting those are some of the some of the more uh someone else i'm playing around with today awesome awesome i know where can we find you guys what's uh twitter handles real quick dylan at zoink zoinks zoink rohan i'm boring i'm just rohan i'm coin underscore artist okay and i'm drew at your austin guys this is a lot of fun cartoon thanks for having us this is great thank you guys thanks for having us ron thanks again for this amazing talking we're moderating drew this isn't great thanks again see everybody and with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and the next talk is going to be about ens a lot of people don't know this but ens domains are the rc 721s and there's so much that you can do on top of this thing and makoto is here to tell us about the possibilities of ens and how this fits into the broader identity world in crypto so without further ado let's welcome a codo and i'll let you take it from here okay hi carltech uh thank you for introducing us and i'll just gonna stop now can you hear me okay nothing spray cool and let me okay uh may i start yeah okay so uh yeah so hello everybody uh so yeah this is about ens and i just wanted to do a quick introduction and uh in the ethereum world we have something called like ecm wallet and address so according to in uh kind of on chain one i'm known as zero x five way three a four two two seven rubber back but obviously no one remembers so we have ens for that hence i have a well-known ems name called my actually my real name is makoto but yeah in the same world i am mateo and i'm a developer ens team and i've been working in the uns team since 2018 and today i want to talk about so it was a grand vision it was a title my colleague bradley put and he unfortunately have some like white schedule chance so he can't give his ground vision so this is my interpretation of the grand vision uh we we as a university we kind of said she had the same vision and yeah but like because i kind of watched ens to kind of start and they're just kind of foolish so i wanted to quickly like recap how he he when he came where we are right now and also like we have a kind of a new vision like we used to say like because ens uh you know came heavily powered from the name dnf you know domain name system so we we keep thinking yeah we had a kind of internet uh ethereum kind of name service which is almost like a domain name system but we kind of start realizing that self realizing that it's actually it would be more than that we so we started talk telling ourselves as a web 3 user name so we wanted i want to kind of start talking about that transition and that that journey just started and we need to build a lot of stuff and we also need a lot of help from you guys so i want to just end my talk with like you know where is the area we have to focus on and how you can help okay and so the humble beginning is that so back in 2016 this was june's nice in london uh so ens the idea of ens was kind of inventive from the guy called nick johnson he is a founder of ens and he now he is in new zealand but back then he was in london and incidentally and i gave i got into ethereum ethereum back in 2016 about the same time as nick garden and i got i went to the foster ceremony park in april and when i went to the thought meetup nick was actually presenting about ens interestingly if you look at the june 9 i think this is the time he was about to join from i think he used to work for google somewhere then like he uh decided to join uh ethereum foundation as a guest developer and uh yeah ten minutes after this uh the dow blows up so uh you know the dow the original doubt would raise like 150 million and then it got hacked and the 30 percent of the east got like drained that kind of stuff so his first job was to basically resecure this area but he at this point he had no idea what's coming we need that and what at that time i don't know how many people were there when ethereum you know that time but we we had that vision at the ecm as a whole that that vision was the world computer that like you know whole thing is about the museum we we use you know we are the ones who who kind of compute all the wild things do something and we also have some idea of like kind of triangular system that ethereum is a computer then you also need a storage system which will swap swarm is basically similar to very similar to ipfs for the distributed storage system and but like it was kind of neat you integrates natively to ethereum and also there's another thing called whisper which is network system uh layer which is not really actively developed but i think status is taking over the idea and they're doing something called watson or something but so as part of the swamp uh because one had that kind of content id which is a hash of the basically the content you want to upload image or like all then obviously they had that issue also to have the issue of like you know very like huge machine friendly but human unfriendly name so when it started he i think he was having the idea of ens and the first use case was let's use it there so that that was a very very uh starting point but yeah at that time he just joined the uh en as our ecm foundation and he was kind of doing on his side of while maintaining the uh ethereum client and then about a year later uh made the force actually i think he initially tried to launch in that uh 14th of march which is a pie day but as soon as they he launched it he had a he hit the bug so he had a retreat and he did another launch back in may uh made a force that's easy to remember may the force be with you so that was a the actual launch and on this kind of tweet it says like you know it's 1d i think kartik said like yeah ens is one there nft project and it is actually one of the kind of all oldest and non-fungible token uh may 2007 so this is was kind of months before even the punks was born and like the standard 721 didn't even exist and during that time also it was a kind of peak of so-called ico initial coin offering and there's a lots of companies doing uh yeah raising lots of money and that it was the first time ecm as a community hit the like network spike that whenever people do i think brave did the browser did that token launch uh on like i think about the same time and then during that time there's a huge spike so what we did kind of well nick did kind of interestingly exactly because the name based on that i think something like it i think if it's a hash of the name or something he basically kind of spread the name uh with this mint period over the three months so if some names can be minted uh auctioned sorry auction like a on this day whereas the other name is this day so and it becomes uh spread over the three months just so that you we can prevent that you know people just jumping into one specific moment so that was i think it was quite innovative in a way like even it was like four years ago but he was already thinking about how to make sure like it's not gonna like you know like include the network so i i wish like more nft project actually do something like that but yeah so some names are actually like auctioned off during the even before the uh crimp punch uh was minted and yeah uh 180 thousand names were auction over three months and another interesting thing is it was a so-called bakery auction that like a fast highest bidder paid the second highest spend so like some of the name uh people the highest bid was the east phoenix which was over uh someone barefoot like two hundred thousand uh east it's a humongous amount but they're actually like no one bit as high as it so i think that personally paid like 0.01 east or something whereas something like a dark market open market it was more like you know many people bid so that that that's actually the price that they acquired which was about twenty thousand uh it was a lot but well in total i think yeah 168k is at that time it was about 50 million now it's all probably like over half a billion it's quite a lot of money but the thing is i think it was the first time people kind of saw the opportunity similar to the kind of dog con boom like people just like you know uh squat on it just holding it and it was designed to make it easier uh because it was more of the locked system so you put the deposit and you can only while there's a deposit there but like if you uh if you're gonna release the name you get the money back and the reason behind he did it is that uh because he was a kind of interim registrar he didn't know how all things works so he wanted to make it temporary and if something happens worst case scenario people can get the recent name and just get the money back so like i think it was more of a safety mechanism that was the initial design but again like that was auction was through like seven days auction so like it was very very difficult to uh basically like for every name even after the three months period every time people want to buy a new name people had to wait like uh yeah five days uh to like kind of bid and then rebuild that kind of stuff so it was really difficult so in 2019 after two years we actually did this whole permanent registrar where instead of like depositing the money to kind of get the name we decided to more similar to how dns naming system works like you know you pay fixed amount uh for southern eu so that's kind of 2019 and then like that was basically three years ago but it was even after the transition it was kind of gross wasn't really you know kind was kind it wasn't really growing so this is a growth of the mastery registration period is that like it was going somewhere between like thousand names to 5000 names a month except the spike in november that's when we released a short names which was between three to six characters but so in 2020 there's a d5 summer and in 2021 uh we became nft summer and uh people realized actually ens is also in fee and also like another thing is like when people start seeing like in ens thing as a on that kind of open c and stuff people start realizing oh this is more not just normal like you know jpeg it has some utility so we finally start getting kind of momentum and this is where we are right now and then yeah let me go to the next slide yes so from domain to web3 username uh so i just briefly mentioned that uh initially so ens started as a kind of some of the ut functionality to help the visual world computer and the architecture is heavily kind of inspired by the dns so like we have a kind of so-called domain name system it has a name but it has a hierarchy right so don't ekt the top level domain i have my token.es and you can also have this notion of subdomains so these are very similar to how dns internet domain works but one thing uh i later found out i think when we were all in the twitter space about talking about like ogns and then my colleague was asking to nick like how did you come up with this record uh is that he said so normal name you map eth2 direct one three but there's a notion for reverse record if you go if you purchase uh the egh name and if you go passing after registration is done it actually prompts you to set something sort of reverse record where you can basically select your primary yet name which associated to your ecm address that's why we call every class so in this example i have multiple names like i am talking about and i can associate which name represents my same address by doing that now if you go to somewhere like a uniswap you can so if you connect the wallet to that app they they look use a reverse lookup to see which name uh represents the ccm address and they show it to you and this is convenient right especially if you have multiple addresses you don't want to miss mix up which which address you're you're trying to do swap tokens and stuff that's useful for yourself but it's kind and then yeah that's when nick said like yeah he just kind of added as an afterthought so because we he kind of the afterthought it's kind of actually quite hard it was one of the hardest things to set after you pause the cns and even now i think still like only like somewhere between 20 to 70 percent of people uh these uh names have a reverse record set so not everybody using it but for people who uses it it's very convenient that you can almost use it as a login system and it's not just uh initial for example openc uh obviously you can actually look up your name using your keys but like if you look at the artist's page in this case uh it's a people pleaser so people please have picked people pleaser uh as a user they were in openc but if you go to different like uh uh nfc platform it may not it might not be necessary you know available so for example my facebook username and twitter username not necessarily saying a git coin is only one i was able to secure makoto because i was early but you can't have a kind of consistent username whereas if the market some nft marketplace uses uh it connects with his slam address you you kind of share the same same address then it suddenly becomes a portable uh kind of platform agnostic username that's where people start discovering and it even become more useful when about three months ago openc integrated this reverse record feature so that now if you go to scan the c transaction you can start seeing that like from where to who uh it's sending the uh basically uh sending transaction and this is the uh esa which is formed around like you know purchasing uh initially purchasing people please as uh any swap uh art but now they've formed its own doubt and you can see that you know jamies and andy are doing something you know like it's almost seeing you showing your own change history that's now really really becoming ubiquitous and that one thing we didn't really expect people do is uh uh yeah like people started putting into uh not just for three systems but i would start putting web to system like twitter like uh nixon is the one the first person who did this because that was his that his creation then i think that was about 2019 or 20 uh someone like vitalik started doing and now like so many people if you like such.eph on twitter there's so many people doing it it's just becoming it doesn't really prove anything but like it's almost showing you're kind of hey i like i i like walk living breathing it's hearing well people start becoming just a convenient method to is starting time as your ethereum identity that's that's the way it starts coming again this is not something we i i'm just guessing what nick was thinking i don't think he really did expect that this is going to happen and another thing what's happening is we have a in the strength so this is a smart point of of the uh enf system you don't need to know everything but so ens is like huge uh phone book like where you there's a name and there's a phone number kind of stuff but rather than that this is called registry but the registry doesn't actually hold your same address but it also just has a pointer to something called resolver where you can kind of customize what to show and how it show and then primarily when we start the majority of the use case was for the is to show the same address but you can actually send something else such as ipfs content hash or like swamp uh which i show us a the primary primary use case and also just a random you know text record and that's so like this is yeah brownlee's ens page and he basically puts everything his entire life is in basically on chain and that's how he's used his using tax record and then with this space construct i think about a couple months ago uh that was zapper study showing the profile photo to their website but it's great but like i think i don't know exactly where they they store this uh you know nft association information so we just said like you know okay why don't we just you know the text record doesn't stop like you can actually put any key and body but we just said like yeah let's come up with a format so that you can share uh if you store one cens you can basically uh should be able to you reuse in different doubts so are we just uh integrated a very basic version okay so this is if you look at the text record page on your ens name and if you say avatar and you can put like you know it says eip155 column one is a net changing id so if it's mainnet it's one it's so if it's polygon one three seven i got stuff then you pick each either area c721 or one one five five then uh the contract is basically collection equivalent contract address is basically equivalent to collection and the 243 is it there 2430 is a token id by putting this kind of format we as a basically this ens manager page can actually go into chain and to see not only to see which image it represents but i can the program i can also program to see who owns it and if it's owned by the actually this ens name i can even put the like say this nfd is actually owned by this you know enos name order so i can put something like owner label so this this is another things we started adding like we didn't even have it until three months ago but we started doing it and then i think we there's a couple of uh team already started creating avatar and uh like jazz library and he's going through like so many dabs to integrate so this is i can see that this is coming to many gaps very very soon and so this is a kind of alpha league apparently did i think about two three weeks ago the yeah so we are almost transitioning into almost like so social network not not yet or like basically showing your online on-chain identity this is kind of new vision we start realizing not just that we had it back in 2016. it's very hard to predict what what's going to be you know four or five years afterward but we kind of like watched how users are using ens and this is a transition we're going for so far okay so i think yeah so two that was this is by the way this is a mock-up we still have a month away to actually improvement there but not just the ui tangeriney we need still a lot more so this i mentioned you know this wasn't kind of the left side was the kind of vision in nick 2016 too this is a vision of like the new kind of direction we are going in to five years later but one of the huddle which didn't really exist at that time but now this is a scaling issue and how do we need to tackle uh and how you can help uh you know solving this problem i'm going to spend next like probably two three minutes uh is that uh so this is a uh how much gas you have to spend to register ens name and uh uh until yeah d5 summer hit you you use it it was literally one of the cheapest uh nfd to buy that like registration only cost five dollars and it used to cost only uh less than a dollar on gas to register but now east price went 10x and the gas price went like 50 100 x so now you start seeing that uh when gas is cheaper it still costs like 20 30 dollars lots of yeast on gas and then when gas is very expensive it's going to go 100. i saw that like someone's a few weeks ago when uh root and all the circuit went nuts uh there's a 6000 gas way and i saw that someone spent about two thousand dollars just on gas that's crazy so we kind of have to sort it out and the obvious solution is going to uh basically l2 and we have a some we unique proposes some framework called during which is kind of the general purpose of chain data victory mechanism and there's a diagram but i wouldn't explain this because you don't probably understand if you don't understand the architecture of ens but the visual representation is that what we're thinking is like a so registering.edh name will remain on layer one very long time and we are no other state to choose which layer 2 is a is a winner so that we should move but what we want to do is we want you to pick the layer 2 you want to have your data associated and we have a way you know i mentioned resolver so resolver is something that another smart contractor decides how to resolve your name and currently it's just directory redundant data but what we want to do with this during model is point let resolvers point to some uh web services where it returns the data and then and most of l2 relies on security or on the l1 that means there's a ways to prove the data's on l2 to be el1 and to be able to verify because they they uncut all the data but i want so we have a way to we know there's a way to do it and so what we want to do is i if you have ma tokundo is you want to change change the resolver to point to specific l2 and then rejuvenate there but this is still i think highly advancing what we really really want to see is adapts or wants we want dapps to point their resolver to their choice of uh in l2 so like if it's uni swap you need to obsess let's say hey we issued a sub domain to all the users own optimism so that users don't have to buy the name especially the new user don't have to buy the register name on l1 but rather just use a subdomains under their favorite pump and if like you know dydx wants to issue subdomain they they are already in software so let's issue the subdomain software and we have a ways to people update data on lt of their choice and they should know how to do it because they already use that but we have a unified way for for people who's not on l2 if you're not looking at for for example foo dot uid right dydx we have a way we came up with some ways to basically read the data uh through this during framework we saw you that you know switched metamasker to change the network all the time so this is kind of ideal stage we have a proof concept but so that that means how dump adopt this new layer 2 system and integrate it becomes a very really key and we have currently have 286 dots who already does like some level of integration but we really want them to start paying attention what's happening what we want to to go to l2 and the easiest way if you unless if you you know manage one of these steps or if you're building something for uh you know uh like it's online hackers after i think week after actually the following day of the east global hackathon we are having enos workshop for inviting the builder and the developers to talk about all these technical aspects and i think we'd like to invite someone uh the people who are in your hacking and who hacked with cns to kind of present in the end of what you achieved and those stuff so if you're a builder or if you're hacking something right now please apply for years online workshop uh but i mean this talk is you know aimed for non-technical people so i am aware that not everybody's uh fits for this workshop but like one thing you could do is for for example example is a punks uh lava lovers page have a quick punch page and which has a now link to you know resolve who owns the punks and it shows the ens name and i had a i had from from the disco conversation that there is some community member in a punk's disco channel they kept pushing to the level of the guys to integrate and then after he pushed so much they finally added it and now it's getting the one the most traffic to our site so what you could do is like yeah uh just if you have a favorite app and if you are the dow member and if you are active please please propose uh to integrate with cns and also like you know if you you don't you are not an active member uh the past uh community to maybe join could be the ems disco channel as well like so we were very very bothered of community management like we were very very small team but now alicia dawg is joining the ens team and she's doing fantastic job like you know managing all the discord members so maybe she should pop in to ens discord channel just say hi and just show off your you know twitter with your eth name so that's probably the easiest thing you can do to help ens to kind of get more integrated with uh you know different apps and then it becomes more useful as a username it's it's really username is only becoming useful if everybody else use the same web represent their username and we hope that we dns becomes that's about yeah so uh yes wash up i you can check out more detail on the medium page please follow enos domains uh twitter and they'll join this code and just join our website thank you very much thank you so much makoto um we don't have a lot of time for too many questions but uh just uh two recurring themes just try to shut up and i'll try to see if we can get them sorted quickly first one is um for the layer 2 integration what does the timeline look like for people to be able to uh make their ans changes on on the l2 could you talk a little bit more about that yeah uh it's still earlier to be honest so we already have a kind of walking example in optimism so i was so uh nick did it with just like on its own and i just was working on porting that example using the during framework so that's there but yeah still i think yeah for optimism they were also doing the network relaunch right so i think it's not ready to deploy immediately so it's not necessary to be honest and also it also it's not just the platform support but also we need to have a support on like something like esa.js with the library and the metamask all the tools so again like i think we want to make uh next workshop to be the place where people can discuss about what other adapts are ready to adopt even you know so yeah so too soon yeah soon another sort of uh one big theme here is that from the diagram you showed around how the layer one ens can let people spawn different usernames on different layer twos does that mean people can have a different username across different answers on layer 2 or or does that mean like the identical civil preserve and the same username maps into uh yeah just seems to be like yeah so i mean kind of ens is non-fungible whether it's elc7211r so if you have one name which on l2 for example if you have one naming arbitron points a different address and another name in polygon or like optimism pointed to different address you can't basically look it up what we want to do is like you uh i think what we that one we're still thinking but what we're kind of thinking is probably uh there are two ways if it's known eth name one thing we didn't discuss is like you can now use a uh you know like dot com mode or xyz using so-called dns security that one uh basically you can prove so i i think uh so it becomes so the resolver on l1 dictates which name it points to so whichever like if this resolver says this name i'm using optimism whatever the names resolved in optim is becomes a canonical one so you may have something else and then if you do that and if you then say that oh actually i'll do an arbitrage you could have you may have the same name on the set different chains but it's a l1 which decides which ones points to so it's always one yeah great well hopefully that clarified the questions from the audience and makoto thanks again for doing this talk and uh being part of the summit thank you up next we have our last talk of the day and we're going to go into lessons learned from doing dark forests and talking about it will be dub sheep so whenever you're ready feel free to get started hi karthix thanks so much for having me um can i share my screen you should be able to awesome can you see this yes perfect cool so thanks again to uh eath global for having me for this year's eve online i'm gub sheep um i am one of the uh creators of dark forest and today i'm going to be presenting on lessons from fully on chain gaming um so first for a little bit of context uh about what my team works on uh we're building dark force which is a procedurally generated mmo real-time strategy built with zk snarks for the evm so currently dark forest runs on xdi previously it's run on the robston test network it's a game that can be launched onto any evm compatible blockchain and basically what you can how you can think of dark forest is it is a uh it is a game that is fully on chain so all of the data um all of the state all of the game logic is on chain can be deployed by anybody um and as such it is a quote unquote infinitely hackable strategy game uh where players can write scripts or interoper interoperable contracts or any other modifications that they might desire during the course of gameplay so yeah like we mentioned all the logic runs on the evm um formerly we ran on robson now we run on xdi during dark forest rounds we generally see about we have a white list system and we generally see about 2500 players or so uh during these rounds and uh over the course of the weeks that we run these monthly rounds we'll see these players consume more gas than uh all of ethereum mainnet combined actually um so you know another impetus for for scalability if we haven't seen enough arguments yet already today and a little bit about myself i'm guv sheep i work on dark forest more broadly i work on applied zero knowledge crypto research and development um and i also work on a number of educational and ecodev projects okay so to dive into crypto native games we first have to answer the question of why build games on the blockchain at all and i'm sure many people here are probably familiar with this experience but when i talk about dapps in general or games on blockchains or whatever other whatever other applications people today are interested in building on blockchains um the thing that i always want to be wary of and the thing that i see in a lot of projects is that basically a decentralized version of something is oftentimes just like a centralized version but worse um and we really want to lean into the unique affordances of decentralization without just taking um purely many of the obvious disadvantages that come with building on a blockchain you know blockchains are slow they're difficult to program on they are they have certain scalability limits um all of these different things so uh make an argument for why to build why we care about building games on the blockchain and this argument sort of has three parts so i think that there's three answers that we've seen over the last couple of years to why crypto games are interesting or important um there's a broke answer there's a woke answer and there is finally a bespoke answer so the broke answer is that uh people are interested in building games on the blockchain because it is easier to build ponzi schemes or scams um so i think in a lot of the early days of ethereum we saw applications like you know if people are familiar with fomo 3d from 2017-2018 kind of the last bull run um fomo 3d was sort of a tongue-in-cheek pyramid scheme slash exit scam application where people would basically put in ether into a big pot um and every time you put ether into this pot you know a timer would uh increase and the timer is ticking down and if the timer hits zero i.e like you know no one has put in any contribution in the last like five blocks or something like that then the whole pot would go to the last person who had put ether into the pot and i think that these sorts of quote-unquote games are what characterize a lot of the early experimentation around crypto games um and fomo 3d was in my opinion one of one of the better ones honestly but a lot of these things were just like straight up like pyramid schemes or scams or whatever else and i think it left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths um and so you know i'm glad that the space has moved away from this sort of thing being like the dominant narrative in crypto gaming um but obviously there's a lot of lessons to be learned from this so the woke answer to why build crypto games which i think is uh more the dominant narrative today is that with crypto when you build applications you have apis into like the native concept of money or value so that means that uh it is really easy to make for example your game assets be worth real money and consequently it makes it much easier to build digital worlds where your actions have quote real or economic consequences so for example if you like uh lose a particular item or you you know manage to find a particular item or something like that uh then that has economic consequences for you as a player which you know kind of makes the game experience more immersive um so a lot of uh collectibles projects i think fall into this category so you know i think everybody pretty much has is aware of slash has seen crypto punks um we've seen games like uh cryptokitties and you know these days axe infinity is drawing a lot of attention um and also we're seeing a lot of uh you know games like for example sky weaver or gods unchanged where you've got these trading card games where gameplay happens off chain but the ownership layer of the game lives on chains so cards are erc 721 tokens and ownership is recorded on chain and these can be transacted on marketplaces like openc um so yeah like we mentioned these the fact that you have access to these money native apis so easily in crypto games means that you can build these games with real consequences or economic consequences um and that i think does two that's really exciting for two reasons this does two things that uh traditional games cannot uh really tap into the first is that because there's something at stake the game is more immersive um you know immersivity is a concept which you can measure along a bunch of different dynamics uh one is like you know how graphically immersive is a game um another is like uh you know does the game feel like something where you've really got something at stake um and i think crypto uniquely enables that dimension uh and the second thing that's really powerful is that the uh the fact that these are economic universes means that it might be easier to incentive align the community members of a game or the players and the devs so when everybody can share in the ownership of a protocol then everybody is incentive aligned to grow the community and and build out the community unfortunately i think that the current state of crypto native gaming and a lot of the games that subscribe to this thesis is incomplete um i think that a lot of crypto games currently are more speculative asset classes really than they are games um in that either the gameplay is very limited or you know the the um game itself is just not very fun or most of the attention that's being driven to these games is surrounding the financial value of the assets rather than sort of the intrinsic value of owning these assets in a digital world so i got i saw a great tweet where basically someone claimed crypto games will never be sustainable as long as the market around the game is more fun than the game itself um and you know i think this is super true i think that another uh way in which games that subscribe to this currently dominant thesis is incomplete is that these many of these games aren't fully crypto games so for example ownership is on chain but game logic or identity or you know account logic or permissioning is off chain so avsa tweeted this out uh earlier this summer um but basically he noted that this was a really popular game that had uh banned a large bot farm and also was sort of calling into question like wait a second is it really a crypto game is it really a blockchain game if there is someone who can ban people or if there's someone who can prevent people from playing the game i think you know it comes into conflict with a lot of the ethos around permissionlessness and censorship resistance that's so important to blockchains not just for ideological reasons but also for practical reasons so the third part of the crypto gaming thesis that i want to talk about is the bespoke reason for building crypto games i think that the most exciting reason to build crypto games is that building a game on a blockchain enables something that we call permissionlessness or sorry permissionless interoperability rather than explaining what this means abstractly i want to show a few examples from dark forest of things that we have seen players do that are uniquely possible because dark forest is a quote-unquote crypto native game so one thing that emerged very early on was that we saw players were scripting um very heavily in order to gain advantage in the game and one of the interesting consequences of building a game or honestly any application on the blockchain is that blockchains are blockchain applications are client agnostic in other words um you can talk to the blockchain you can hit a function in a smart contract from a script that you write from a default or vanilla web client provided by the developers from a modified client that you have forked from the developer provided client you can do any of these things you can go into your chrome dev tools and you can just you know spin up a transaction um sign it with the private key that you're storing locally or or anywhere and send that off to the blockchain uh access to the game cannot be gated and therefore what that means is that players can actually build out things like automations or bots or even ais as first class features into the game so early on we released a plug-in system that allowed players to essentially take snippets of javascript code and inject those snippets into their client and from this we saw players build like a ton of interesting utilities from data visualization tools to remote snarkers which allow you to prove um these zero knowledge proofs that are the center of dark force on web servers that are you know the user maintained and offline um we saw players writing even like very complex ais to assist them in playing the game when they were offline or you know to allow them to play at a higher level and all of these things have kind of become first-class features of the game um these snippets that are passed around between the community and that's added a whole other dimension uh to the gameplay experience we've even seen some folks fork uh or write entirely from scratch new clients so for example georgios and kobe did a lot of work to put together a dark force uh rust client that allows players to play dark forest in the terminal and there's a lot of sort of performance boosts to to being able to do this especially because you're able to prove your snarks with a different tool stack that's actually a lot more efficient um and one thing that georgios hope you had to do was actually you know do some reconciliation work between these two different snark tool stacks the first that's meant to be used in browser and the second that's being meant to that's meant to be used you know inside like a rust web server and this was super cool to see and something that you know is much harder to achieve in a traditional game with a canonical developer provided client another central concept to dark force is the idea of the there's a cryptographic fog of war in the universe that you uncover via something that's pretty similar to proof-of-work mining but we saw some players come out with gpu miners for playing dark forest which was also really incredible to see and i think the step function that we saw in the last couple of months that really changed the game and really opened the community's eyes to i think what's possible with these um permissions permissionlessly interoperable crypto games is keep building new features on top of dark forest as well in a way that fundamentally is not possible uh with traditional centralized games so as an example like because dark forest is a smart contract um anybody can deploy a smart contract an auxiliary smart contract onto the blockchain that talks to the core smart contract and uh essentially you know these can these auxiliary contracts can look thing like things like escrow contracts or marketplaces uh or you know player corporations or anything else um in this case the very first example of this that we saw from a team called project sofon was uh project sofon built a broadcast marketplace which would essentially allow you to trade information with other players via a third-party contract that talked to the court dark force contract so you can kind of imagine someone uploading a simple s for a smart contract that says like you know anybody who deposits one each into this contract will cause the contract to programmatically trigger a release of some resource from my dark forest planet to your dark forest planet and then you know what a third-party developer can do is they can write a plug-in that essentially exposes a ui for connecting to this escrow contract and share that plug-in around or they can provide a third-party client that other people can use and what we've essentially what we essentially see here is that like players have come in and they've written a new feature for the game without any input whatsoever from the developers contrast this with a traditional centralized game where if you wanted to add something like a trade feature you would have to there's there's pretty much no way for this to be done except through the core developers um so if jagex wants to add peer-to-peer trading in runescape then they have to write a data transformation on their proprietary you know data stores that live in their web servers then they've got to write api routes that um you know allow uh that will trigger these data transformations and then in the canonical runescape client they've got to write like a ui component that's a button that's hooked into their um you know uh apis those api routes that are running on their web servers um there's no way for player like players can do so much more in a decentralized game um compared to in the case where jagex or blizzard or whatever else owns the stack from end to end um so we also saw for example a bunch of different marketplaces pop up in the last round of dark force where again these were entirely player made they were not built with any input from the core devs and we think that this is a very early example of some of the richness or complexity that we might be able to see once players can actually impact the land that they're playing on um this was taken from a little like this is like a little mock-up from a presentation that someone in the dark forest team gave internally recently but you could imagine a world where someday like game objectives or even like totally new resources or even nested games are plug-ins that anybody can install in the game um where logic is running these smart contracts that are maintained by the community or by players of the game itself um you know whether it's like game modes and objectives or competitions uh or you know we've got here like oil and uranium resource plug-in or something like that those are things that can live in auxiliary smart contracts outside of the core core smart contracts deployed by the core devs and i think the last thing that i'll tease here uh is there is another game that we have been collaborating with um coming out from luden's on twitter who's building a zk dungeon game and this is something that we're really excited about because we think it's going to take a lot of these zk mechanics and interoperability mechanics to the next level so keep an eye out for dk dungeon uh and the luden's account on twitter so now that we've covered those three reasons for building cryptonative games it's finally time to answer the question like what is a crypto native game we've been tossing that term around a lot um so let's actually get to something that looks more like a definition um to us a crypto native game is a game that is maximally on chain and that can maximally leverage the unique affordances of the blockchain so this means that the source of truth for game data is on the blockchain the game logic and the game rules are implemented via smart contracts the game is developed in accordance with open ecosystem and open source principles the game is client agnostic and the game embraces real world digital value so we think that this is a super set of what is currently going on with a lot of uh the efforts that we're seeing in cryptogaming right now um to also provide a few negative examples things that we don't consider to be crypto native games under this definition are things like a mobile shooter game with the crypto wallet integration or like a trading card game where c721 nfts but all the gameplay and the battles happen off chain or um and this example is kind of funny to me um especially for just looking back at d5 summer defy apps that have like a playful skin or are very gamified or have a lot of emojis um you know for all of these categories of applications we think that uh you know this isn't to say that only crypto native games can be successful commercially or artistically but we do think that crypto native games are the most interesting and important to look at to understand the full potential of blockchain for building digital worlds and to build a picture of where the space is going so that's the what um the why is something that we've sort of uh answered by example from some of the previous slides uh just to lay it out explicitly the reason that we think crypto native gaming is exciting is because it enables permissionless interoperability and that allows that means that players can build the game experience not just the core devs beyond just being able to build on top of uh crypto native games it also means that multiple different crypto native games can have strong interoperability mechanics between them so other games can hook into your game to share assets identity systems reputation systems mechanics and more without needing to talk to like a support team or a bd team or anything like that so for example imagine if like you know you could take your sword from world of warcraft and take it with you into the runescape universe or something like that currently that would require some sort of you know like integrations effort between jagex and blizzard but if zk dungeon wanted to hook into the dark forest artifacts contract that's as simple as just saying like oh you know anybody can take their dark force pyramid and deposit it into their zk dungeon dungeon heart and if they do that that like powers up all of their units in their zk dungeon um and that means that these crypto native game assets become almost these like real physical tangible goods that you can pick up and carry around with you um throughout the ecosystem of these crypto native worlds so you know in short there's all sorts of things that you can build when a game is crypto native from marketplaces to daos to nested games on top of or inside of games to new resources and mechanics automations alternate clients interoperable mechanics shared reputation systems and i think that you know for all the hype around the m word lately um if you're looking for um what might eventually seed the metaverse i think crypto native games are an interesting place to look um you know there's still a very very long way to go to realize the full potential of permissionless interoperability in games for one thing scalability is a huge bottleneck so right now darkforce is in a private whitelisted beta where we allow a couple thousand users at a time onto the game this is for scalability reasons because current blockchains and even you know side chains plus roll-ups can't support more than thousands to tens of thousands of users um how do we get to a place where crypto native gaming is can be mainstream and can support hundreds of thousands or millions of users that's an open question um developer experience is an open problem uh if we care about interoperability then we care about it not in the theoretical or abstract sense we care about it in the practical sense we want people to actually be able to build these marketplaces on top without it being a huge headache so that means that there's a lot of developer tools and infrastructure that needs to be built out all sorts of these public goods that will be required to sustain this ecosystem it's also going to be important to find more developers who are able to you know program comfortably with solidity or with this dk tool stacks that are that we think are going to be important for building out a lot of these next generation apps um and there's you know so so far to go in terms of understanding like application usability accessibility design patterns all of these things necessary to really um make crypto native games usable for a mainstream person who isn't a crypto enthusiast as a baseline the we think that all of those things are currently being worked on and a number of them are quote-unquote just engineering problems but one of the biggest um things that we one of the biggest open problems that we think will be necessary to unlock the full potential of crypto native games is uh zk technology and more advanced crypto so dark forest itself is made possible by zk snarks because zk snarks enable um the cryptographic fog of war which is a really central mechanic in dark forest as a strategy game um but snarks are in fact a very general purpose tool that can be used to unlock all sorts of new game mechanics that weren't current that aren't currently possible on chain today um so for example this is a slide from uh a presentation we gave um a couple days ago but one thing that zk snarks can be used for is to enable rich procedural generation algorithms essentially executed or verified on chain so if you wanted to build a decentralized minecraft uh then a decentralized minecraft analog so a fully on chain procedurally generated very rich three-dimensional sandbox world what you might do is you might start by taking a procedural generation algorithm like purlin noise and putting that inside of a zk snark um and then putting that zk snark inside of your crypto game um and we actually do have in both zk dungeon and dark forest uh very um primitive examples of this of procedural generation algorithms that are now implemented in zk circuits um another example of a place where zk snarks are very important is in allowing um things like card games or private in private asset inventories um in mmo games so one of the tricky things about card games in decentralized settings whether that be a blockchain or a state channel or whatever else is that a lot of the operations involved in playing a card game are things that naively seem impossible on a decentralized system so for example like randomly and privately drawing a card in a way that is uncheatable seems very hard on a system where all applications have totally transparent data layers um but we've been working on scene constructions and we have a few proof of concept implementations out of different card game mechanics where you can essentially use zk snarks to uh you know privately and randomly draw cards for example from a shuffled deck um this is also interesting because uh zk starts actually allow you to go one level further than commit reveal schemes in terms of both usability as well as what is fundamentally possible but yeah all of this basically points to you know we believe that games are part of a larger ecosystem um and that games are actually where we're likely to find the frontier of application research and development um for those of you who saw vitalik's talk at ecc a couple of months ago um you know one thing that vitalik mentioned was that uh today you know sort of the the major production use case of ethereum is finance um and a lot of times you know we're seeing that a lot of the application level work being done on ethereum or these decentralized systems uh is applications that are simply iterating on or permuting different um mechanics or primitives that we already know how to use so i think the the example that vitalik gave was something like you know people are building tokens on yields that allow you to you know tokenize the yield captured by yield tokens or whatever um and we think that like to really unlock the next generation of ethereum applications whether that be games or coordination mechanisms or dows or whatever else we're going to need this this sort of new technology that's going to allow us to fundamentally move the needle on what is possible to do inside decentralized applications um so yeah that's pretty much it for this talk if you are interested in getting in touch dark force is hiring you can check out a hiring announcement on the dark force blog one thing that we're going to announce soon as well which we'll just give a little preview of here is that we're forming a new research and development foundation to support um application level research and development into the next generation of dapps and if you're more broadly curious about or interested in working with us on zk research and development you can email me at gubsheep 0xpark.org um my dms are also open i'm pretty active on twitter and also check out ludin's who is the developer behind who was one of the developers behind the zk dungeon game um ivan who is the lead developer of dark forest dark force twitter and ethe university which is some of the educational initiatives that we support that's about it thanks so much for having me and um yeah i'll pass it to you karthik thank you so much for that awesome uh list of uh things to do and not to or how to prepare for this um we'll we'll just do one question um i i think i may have asked you this uh a variation of this in the past but given the nature of how these things work under the hood um how do you kind of think about or balance programmability to gain versus kind of making it fun for the person like what would you see bots competing with bots and sort of drive out all the people who are doing uh playing a game for fun or do you think they'll just actually knock into a separate sort of sub committee or group or universe and play those games um somewhere else yeah this is this is a great question definitely still an open question um in our head there are a couple of different approaches here um one approach is basically that we encourage all the players to and we try to bake it into the culture of the community that uh knowledge and tools is meant to be shared so we make it so this means a couple of things one is lowering the barrier to entry to building these automations and tools and providing players with uh you know building blocks which they can construct bots or other things out of um and this means you know clean apis or whatever else the other is encouraging players who are very active and trying to reward players who are active um in open sourcing their work and making it accessible for new players um and creating those touch points like an easy to use plug-in system um so that there can be sort of a level playing field this also has the dual effect of um making dark forest something of an educational program for its players where people can steadily onboard you know depending on how deeply they want to go into the game they can go deeper and deeper into um playing with the programmability of the game so i think another possible outcome here is that you know you if you're building a strategy game you want to build a game with a fair amount of strategic depth to the point where you know like chess was not boughtable for many many millennia it's a game where you've really got limited resources and it's it takes uh strategy and intelligence in order to be a good chess player um similarly here like with rts games there is some degree to which bots can't help you but ultimately like naive strategies are still going to be beaten out by manual by players who are playing manually and have a deeper understanding of the strategic landscape of the game so in fact a lot of the top players of dark force are still primarily manual players or not developers um and i think that what we're evolving towards is sort of like a human ai hybrid uh competitive gameplay style um towards the top ends of dark forest now that that makes a lot of sense i think uh and also i guess to uh maybe just sort of think about how things are evolving in nfts overall um people are really going into derivatives of kind of games and nfts overall um and sort of branching up into their own sub communities too so as as things kind of get either more heated or complex or complicated i i do think people will just self-select into zoning into their own world exactly yeah and i think that we're already starting to see um it's becoming difficult to place highly in dark force without being a part of a player dow whether that's a group of people sharing a multi-sig or sharing a burner wall at private key or who have some more advanced smart contract infrastructure and then you can start seeing specialization like this person is responsible for building out the automation and bot tooling this person's responsible for piloting the account during this time zone um this person is responsible for negotiations and diplomacy so that's been really really exciting to watch as well and maybe just one last question before we end um from what you just said is that in line with what you wanted it to be or is that just uh you were just kind of talking about what's happened so far yeah i think um for the dark forest team we've always speculated that some of these directions might be possible but really it's up to and we want to make this true as much as possible that it's up to the players in the community to see um what uh third-party tools or what additions to the game dictate the gameplay experience like i would say obviously it's hard to measure this um quantitatively but you know i would guess that more than 50 percent of players start top players like dark forest experience actually now lives in uh actions that are going through third party code rather than the dark force core client or contracts um themselves so for us it's really about creating that room for experimentation and trusting that a community of players who is you know currently at least like culturally aligned and maybe even someday like economically aligned will have better ideas than just us and we can try to provide an unopinionated um base layer with just enough creative direction and just enough to play with that players can run wild with their imaginations that's amazing well with that i want to thank you so much for doing this amazing talk and uh i think one day we'll definitely get you to play this game live on one of these yeah maybe a hackathon or something like around just don't do it justice so uh but uh awesome well thanks karthik thank you so much guppy um all right with that we are ready to close off today's nft and creator summit i want to thank everybody who stuck around and asked questions and engaged with us on the chat we had so many amazing talks and speakers and questions coming in from the audience and i also want to give a special shout out to everybody who reached out to us last week about giving feedback on the new e global.tv design we got a lot of bugs still to fix but we're slowly working on them one of the harder pieces here is that we can only test these things on production when real time someone is going on because a lot of these are latency and race condition related bugs that only happen when a few hundred users are watching in real time but we're slowly working on this thing so thanks again for everybody uh with that feedback and hope you are enjoying some of your new profile photos so with that we're going to sign off and i will see you next thursday for the of a grand style summit and then next friday for our dao in governance summit um in the meantime check us out on twitter and we'll see everybody who is participating at the hackathon on discord take care everybody bye [Music] you
