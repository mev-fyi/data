our sponsors are going to be sharing some really cool updates that they've had made for you they're designed to be a synchronous so that they can also be on the chat and answer any questions so we have some of our messages from our sponsors that are going to be talking about so our first sponsor for the day is going to be ave and we have stani from ave who has made a video for us to watch and i'll have him share the video here and let us watch it hey everyone this is stani i'm the founder of ave and ave is a money market protocol built on ethereum and and part of the sponsor sponsors of this hackathon uh first of all congratulations for everyone for joining uh this will be very uh interesting experiment experience for you and i think you will um grow quite a lot during uh the next uh three weeks uh so hackathons are very interesting places to learn more about technology and not just technology but meet new people uh peers that you can build together uh projects that you you are following or or get introduced to new kinds of uh things in the ethereum community and one of the interesting projects here is of course ave and uh with what ava does is that as a money market you can deposit uh cryptographic funds such as stable coins or ethereum for example into a landing pool and earn interest from that uh by depositing and on the other hand when you are depositing into the protocol you can also draw a credit line uh from the the protocol by by borrowing so ave as a as a project started a few years ago we built the first landing protocol ethereum called ethereum blending which started as a very very basic proof of concept and we we have been uh evolving our uh protocol since then the current protocol of a protocol has been launched this year january and it has grown quite substantially so there is uh 1.5 billion locked value in the smart contracts which means that you can actually utilize that value in whatever you're building uh during this hackathon now what's makes of it interesting is that uh it's quite uh developers first protocol most of the liquidity comes from projects that are not are actually building on top of ave or are utilizing our liquidity and not directly from our user interface such as for example wire or device saver and besides the normal depositing borrowing functionality we also have a couple of very interesting uh functions uh built on such as for example flash phones and flash phones means that you could borrow without a collateral from the protocol as much as there is liquidity and then utilize that uh liquidity on whatever you are basically building so in essence flash mons allows you to use liquidity without actually having it in the first place for example defy saver is using other flashlights to uh close mega dial uh cdp's without direct returning the capital you could use flash loan to build refinancing products for example to offer the the borrowers own ethereum the the lowest possible uh interest rate on on their borrowings um despite what currency they borrowed and there is many many interesting uh functionalities that you could actually build another very interesting uh feature that that is related to ava is so-called credit delegation so credit delegation is a function where when you deposit into abe to earn interest and you're not borrowing you could delegate your credit line to someone else who you trust or to a smart contract for example wires uh y a link world borrows at the moment 20 million port of usdc with the credit delegation functionality and create delegation is interesting because you can make it uh completely as borrowings to a smart contracts that that does some kind of predefined function and and why it's interesting is that if that smart project doesn't have any credit risk you could actually use this uh credit delegation to get uh capital into one smart contract that might just do some sort of interesting functions such as yield farming or so forth or you might have a credit delegation vault where actually credit is dedicated by based on actual legal agreements such as open law so the interesting idea and concept above these hackathons is that you always don't need to think about puristically defy you could use dfi in in something else that you're planning to build uh it might be related to nfts uh social tokens uh e-commerce anything that's very interesting at the moment privacy or somehow to connect it to the real life and solve real-life problems now other team is going to help you during this hackathon so if you have any kind of ideas or you want some sort of uh brainstorming help i'm there for you i will i will help you in in in terms of if you need some ideas you you need some technical help or economical help i mean in terms of like economic ideas uh anything that makes uh your kind of like uh gets you forward i'm i'm i'm here for you and yeah so uh you can find us on the uh discord as well uh our own discord or in the the hackathon discord and and also from our team there is uh mark zeller as well uh one of our integration leads and also uh david truong is here uh to assist you and and he is one of our community developers and and our goal is that uh we make most out of you when you are uh building on top of ave we're using our protocol and trying to uh trying to kind of like help your uh implementation and product wise uh currently you uh we're building the version two of our protocol but you can integrate uh for the version one and probably at some point during the hackathon you might see version two on test net so it's up to you to to think uh and and figure out uh which version you want to actually uh use for for this this this hackathon and yeah so one of the important thing is there is uh over three weeks time to to hack so it's quite a lot of time uh spend a lot of time to designing the product to to make a good architecture uh keep always security mind especially if you are taking the project further and uh yeah create something that uh something that's very unique uh something that helps people uh something that you are uh interests you or whatever you actually want it's it's pretty much free zone uh for you and yeah ping me if you have any kind of uh need for for help or uh you're stuck in the the the documentation or the the the hack itself uh we're here to uh help so i wish everyone a very good luck uh and i hope you guys uh enjoy this and and uh eager to see what you guys are building thank you hey guys i'm heart from uma um and we're super pumped about being here at ethonline and supporting youth global in another awesome hackathon so uma is a protocol for building synthetic assets and other types of financial contracts uh we really consider ourselves a platform for your financial innovation which is why we're so pumped to be here at this hackathon and see what you guys dream up over the next month so how does uh how does zuma work the protocol is really designed with two interwoven components what we call priceless financial contracts are one part and the dvm or data verification mechanism is an enforcement mechanism to resolve price disputes from those priceless contracts this priceless design is pretty unique and novel in the d5 landscape where we are really designing contracts to minimize oracle usage and as an example of that we can look at this yield dollar product that's existed for a couple months now um and had over 20 million of locked collateral over 40 million block collateral at various points and yet has had only two on-chain price requests we've been able to support the whole product without any form of on-chain price feed or price oracle and one of the really exciting things about this concept is that it supports a long tail of assets and a lot of innovation you can get super creative about the types of financial contracts types of synthetic assets that we can create using this priceless framework because we don't require an on-chain price feed or don't require access to any kind of ongen api so what can you build on uma um at the hack money hackathon potion labs built this truly amazing insurance protocol and they've since gone on to build a real business around this and raise venture money um this insurance protocol can protect against price drops in any asset and they did it by inventing a pretty novel form of an options contract that uses this priceless framework uh we have other partners like perlin that have built custom synthetic assets uh using the priceless synthetic tokens that have been collateralized with their own their own token uh a couple hacks ago um uh barf was created a bay area real estate fund uh which was a synthetic token that tracks the price of san francisco housing kind of create an example a creative example of a new type of asset class that can be created using synthetic tokens and d5 concepts and i think at boston uh last year swan die was created which was an innovative token margin in usdc that could hedge against any dislocation and die so this is a token that can pay you out kind of like insurance if die deviated from its peg this is just a taste of the types of things you can build on uma and we again consider it a really flexible platform uh for financial contracts and synthetic assets of all types so what are we doing in this hackathon um in this hackathon um will be rewarding five thousand dollars worth of the uh uma token in prizes uh the breakdown is gonna be three thousand first place fifteen hundred second and five hundred third place uh a unique and innovative thing here is we are actually going to have the uma community vote movement token holders are going to vote using a snapshot.page voting page to determine the winner of of this hack we'll distribute that link closer to the voting period but it's a pretty exciting way for us to involve our community in judging your hack we have office hours that are shared in our discord channel and are also published on our calendar which is publicly available so some links about how we can collaborate please use the discord channel we will be active and prompt and responding to you follow us on twitter visit our website check out our developer docs check out our github we're entirely open source and uh would love you to pick through our code and lastly of course i should introduce our team uh the people that will be in our discord and we'll be interacting with you on our engineering team we have matt david nick and chris and our community team we have clayton sean tom henry and raya please uh please ping us please reach out to us we're here for you and we're excited to see what cool stuff you guys will build thanks so much awesome thank you uh so much heart um uma has been a great partner for us and as heart talked about is in his video we've seen a lot of cool projects over the last two years for a year and a half uh that have built on top of uma and some of them become really cool companies uh for example potion that i just talked about and we're excited for everybody to play with the uma protocol for this event as well so next up i want to introduce our next sponsor and that is isaac from bloom and uh we'll have bloom talk about what they do why they're excited to be part of eat online and also share a bit more about themselves and how you can potentially win uh bloom prizes for this event so let them take it from here hi everyone i'm isaac the cto of bloom and i'm excited to be here at ethonline today to talk to you about what prizes we're sponsoring and what we're hoping to get out of this so throughout this hackathon we're sponsoring five thousand dollars in prizes and we want to see projects that help us bridge the gap between the decentralized identity and decentralized finance world i'll explain in a bit about exactly what we mean by that but for most specifics please join us after this in the eath online discord channel for details on the prizes today bloom has a consumer application that allows you to monitor your credit and pull in various identity information that you want to store and maintain and share locally for developers we have tools that allow you to request data from these users so it's a simple concept of there's an application where users can get pre-verified information and developers can request that from them it's very simple to share this data here's a quick demo of me sharing an id document and other kyc information that bloom has pre-verified with an external application um you can see that on the screen it's prompting me what exact data do i want to share and showing me who it's going to go to and on the right-hand side of the screen you'll see that the server has received my id document and informed me of the verification status it's very easy as a developer to get started here that qr code you can play around with right on our demo site where you can specify exactly what information you want to request from the user so this is what we've had for a while now this system of verifying information and sharing with the developer what we want to get out of this hackathon is understanding how exactly we get this data on chain we have some specs we have some ideas for how we think that this data can best interface with on-chain lenders and just any smart contract but we want to hear from the community on how it's useful and if our ideas are um sound so again five thousand dollars in prizes to help us figure out these tough problems of um how now that we have this data verification system off chain how do we get it on chain a very specific example would be you know a smart contract that has a that depends on knowing a user's country of residence they could use a bloom verified id document as a source for that data exactly how that happens on chain please join us in discord so that we can discuss it and we really look forward to seeing what you guys come up with after the hackathon we are also going to start accepting applications for a series of grants to help us build out the next phase of the protocol the identity layer is something that we've been working on for a few years now and it's gotten to the point where it's mature enough that we think that these connections between decentralized identity and decentralized finance are possible so we've got a lot of really exciting stuff coming here and we want to build up a community of people that are going to help us see it through so thank you and see you in discord thank you so much bloom um so for all of you hackers who are interested in getting your product in the hands of other people uh where there is a component of identity and kyc bloom is a perfect opportunity for you to uh to integrate so you have to do the work yourself and really take advantage of all the work that the bloom team has done themselves so with that we'll move on to our next sponsor demo and that is from the teller team and they'll be talking about what teller is and how you can use that sdk in your hack so let them present from here hi youth online we are teller and i'm mike the cso and i'm brenda the ceo and i'm nick the cto and we're a decentralized oracle network on ethereum but more than just an oracle we're a permissionless community of token holders data providers and validators and together we put real world data on chain how are we different than our competition well we're actually decentralized and censorship resistant we use proof-of-work competition to bring values on chain and we reward minors for participating and we secure it through a robust dispute mechanism so to tell you guys you know just a little bit about what you might build here at this hackathon so we're just kind of an oracle on ethereum if you look at d5 projects or projects that are currently on ethereum and look at the ones that need oracle so these are namely going to be stable coins derivatives insurance contracts lending protocols all these things need access to off chain information and all of them use oracle's so if you're building something and you need access to information that isn't natively on ethereum you can probably use teller for a little bit on the bounties so the first bounty is going to be just the best overall project using teller these are going to be some high quality projects and we look forward to kind of seeing what you guys build here the next one is going to be the most creative use so if you have say some novel idea that something that hasn't been built on ethereum before maybe hasn't been built in on crypto in general it needs access to off chain information and can use teller we're except excited to see it and last but not least is just going to be the best information of teller implementation of seller into a pre-existing project so this is where you would look at say a current d5 project that's using a centralized oracle or one that isn't very censorship resistant you strip out that awful oracle and you throw teller in there and we'll give you a bounty for it our motto has always been to make things that build things that make sense build things that you can build right now with the current technology and build systems that you want to be a part of can't wait to see what you actually build with teller and our office hours are from 9 to 5 eastern time reach out to us if you need any help or just want to give us some feedback thank you and good luck good luck thank you so much uh teller the whole team i believe they're also on the chat here and uh we're seeing some of the other sponsors on the chat just interacting with all the hackers so if you are interested in using any oracle or if you need to do anything that requires talking to any other service off chain uh teller is a great candidate for that and want to thank them for being a sponsor for meet online so next up we have ahmad from bikonomy and uh he'll be going over what they're able to offer as as bi economy as a protocol and how you can make your life easier by using their sdks in your project so i'll let him uh tell you what uh economy is from here hello youth global my name is ahmed bilally and i'm from team by economy app by economy our mission is clear we are simplifying web3 experiences we're on the path to unlocking 99 of the world we're still not encrypted so what are we doing exactly we are a non-custodial gas efficient relay network that is engineered as a transaction highway for cheap reliable and secure transactions we're not layer 2 think of us as a layer 1.5 for ethereum transactions and we are actually compatible with layer 2 such as matic network and x-type our value-add really lies in its developer friendliness and rich feature set that enables gasless meta transactions flexible payments and transaction optimizations which have already powered amms liquidity pools and marketplaces we're super excited to join youth global and let me pass you over to my co-founder eniket who is all the way in india to tell you how we'll be getting involved in the next couple of weeks thanks lord ahmed hey guys this is aniket here from india and i along with team by congress super excited to be a part of it global and looking forward to contribute and learn as much as we can over the next couple of weeks so yeah without wasting much time let me dive deep into the bounty ideas that we have and also tell you more of the prices associated with them uh we are issuing in total four thousand worth of prices and then that can be awarded two to four teams with the problem statements as follows the first problem statement is for fifteen hundred dollars and it's uh two exits uh we're looking for a solution that can provide insulin gases exists from there too where a pool of tokens can be maintained both on layer one layer too and we expect then that experience to be capsules by using my economy so we are seeing a lot of projects trying our already building on day two but the one of the major problem of exiting filter is so by this problem we're looking for a team that can come up with a creative idea and solve that problem the second boundary statement is for a thousand dollars and it's for payment of fees in er32 we are looking for a team that can find a way of managing the risk associated with paying the transaction fees for the end users in er study tokens third problem statement is by economy explorer and it's for 500 a last problem statement is an open area guys so you can come up with any solution by using my economy in any space whether it's t5 gaming anything that can you feel like you know where bike only plugs the most or buy when we suits the most we expect it to be as creative as possible and we do have some extra points and bonuses for creativity as well so here list of collaterals that we have uh you know from bunch of technical documents to uh you know articles written on by economy that can help you explore more ideas and more use cases and also some videos that can help you to do integration faster and learn more about economy here's the awesome thing guys uh i'll be mostly available in every activity that is happening by economy on each global for the next couple of weeks also we have other team members always available we have the discord cells written over there so you can hit them up anytime whenever you want ask your queries we are more than happy to help you and also we have office hours every saturday you can book a slot uh with us and we are very much happy to help access and bring some with you so looking forward guys thanks a lot thank you so much ahmed aniket and the bikonomy team for all of you who are planning on building something in d5 you know that the gas may be an issue slightly an issue over the time so do check out dichotomy for making that part a lot more easier for all of you next up we have jessica from one inch exchange and uh jessica will be telling us about how one inch is excited to sponsor this event and uh i will let them take it from here hey i'm jess solomon and i work for an adventurous project called one inch our adventurous founders are busy building earth shattering defy tech so i'm just gonna take a quick minute here to explain to all you how you too could help us build build earth shattering d5 tech in this awesome eat online hackathon that we're all a part of so just a quick bit about one inch we are a leading decks aggregator that's of course the one-inch exchange we're very proud of also a next generation automatic market maker mooneyswap another cool one and a team of d5 innovators so the mvp was actually built at the new york 2019 hackathon by our founders sergey and anton so we're a great example of how hackers can very quickly become sponsors the first customers of one inch were actually our founders anton and sergey it was exhausting and inefficient for these superstars to manually check the best prices on all the dexes they like all crypto users needed an elegant algorithm to search every dax for the best trading price and instantly deliver on that optimized trade of course the solution came with one inch exchange a decentralized exchange aggregator that sources liquidity from various exchanges by splitting a single trade transaction across multiple dexes quick look at some of our stuff in one year we've executed over 3 billion in trading volume prices best prices on the market that's the point of the dex aggregator and the aggregation and some really amazing innovations g gas token reduces gas prices on one inch by up to 42 percent super cool very helpful pathfinder is a search algorithm for the most efficient swapping routes so basically all the magic happens and i really want to talk to you guys about looney swap because it is out of this world moony swap we launched in august it's a new automatic market maker to increase liquidity provider earnings the mooneyswap amm revolution uses virtual balances to enable liquidity providers to capture profits otherwise captured by arbitragers this slows down price changes to prevent arbitrage traders from earning up to a hundred percent of the swap slippages and here's an example of liquidity provider earnings on mooneyswap which you guys can actually look at on your own time to see just how beneficial this technology really can be and of course the one-inch mission solving problems and benefiting the overall d5 space in as many ways as we can our founders have been discovering vulnerabilities saving people from losing lots of money and dramatic hacks redistributing profits to deserving parties like liquidity providers and saving people money on gas all very beneficial we're stoked to see our users living their best life because of our technologically advanced products and we want you guys to help that's why we have the one inch bounties we have 5k die in total bounties 2.5 k for the overall coolest one inch hack 1.5 k for second cool is 1k for third course we've got some suggestions firstly an embeddable one-inch swapping widget that some of our favorite sites might want to add tools to help people launch ieos on mooney with an emphasis on it being better for initial liquidity providers take profit and stop loss limit orders with mooneyswap using price oracles since the price cannot be manipulated in a positive direction a clue for you if buy price on money swap is 310 die then sell one weft for 300 die prices cannot be improved by manipulation on money swap bounty suggestions continue a way to automatically donate part of a swap transaction to some charity if you want to do that a nice flow chart which shows the complex swap pass from transactions on one inch more user-friendly ui for using one-inch api and use moonyswap volume weighted oracles to do some crazy stuff but be fearless these are just some recommendations of things we would like to see of course if you have a cool idea of your own that you're excited to build then go for it be our guest innovate and here's some contact for you guys so hit me up on that one-inch sponsor discord with your brilliant ideas and questions that i know all you folks have so thanks a ton everyone and can't wait to see you all soon and see what you build bye thank you uh so much jess um this is a great intro to uh to one inch exchange and the best part about all this is that one inch for those of you who don't know started as a hackathon project at 8th new york last year so it's really great to see the one-inch team giving back to the community and coming on as an official sponsor making it easy for others to use what they've built to make their lives easier so uh thanks again to one inch be sure to check out their sdks and what you can do with the one exchange one interchange protocol and how you can integrate that into your own hacks and with that i want to move on to our last sponsor video for today and that is barney from vega and he'll be talking about the vega protocol and we'll kind of go into how you can use that in your project so i'll let the vega team share what they have to say hi my name is barney mannerings and i'm a co-founder of vega vegas is a decentralized exchange or dex protocol that supports capital efficient derivatives trading on a fully on chain non-custodial order book in 2018 when we started designing vega we anticipated many of the issues you see in d5 today like front running or minor extractable value the need for sustainable liquidity mining incentives and problems with capital efficiency versus centralized exchanges due to over-collateralization i'm super excited the baby's participating in ethonline so i'm going to spend a little bit of time today telling you more about vega and how you can get involved first off let's dig into some of the things that makes vega a little bit different vega is the start of a new generation of decentralized exchange protocols it runs on its own customized proof-of-stake blockchain which gives the vega designers and engineers the ability to optimize the whole stack for trading from the consensus layers the api is exposed by vega notes the protocol is primarily order book based allowing for the most efficient price determination but it will also support passive amm style liquidity for those who want to support markets on vega with their capital and earn yield the network's sub second block time means that even though vega is fully decentralized and non-custodial trading is fast and responsive it feels like using a centralized exchange vega initially supports futures with up to 100x or more leverage for some markets vegas designed to make it easy for anyone to propose in creating markets on the proof of stake network but this is ethe online so i'm pleased to tell you that vega works excellently with ethereum vega was always designed to act as a kind of layer too all the assets traded on vegas start off on other chains and the first integration for the vega blockchain is with ethereum that means it'll be possible to connect metamask and send ethernet erc20 tokens to the vega network for fast and completely non-custodial leveraged trading once the vega network is live and running the ethereum bridge will also eventually allow for d5 composability between products and markets on vega and ethereum smart contracts and dapps and ethereum will be able to deposit and withdraw tokens and trade on vega just by calling methods on the vega bridge contract on ethereum as i mentioned vogue is fast and fully featured this is a screenshot of the current test net this trading dac uses no central servers and relies on the same apis that you'll have access to for this challenge it has streaming prices and order book depth and the full suite of market data and trading tools but i'm also super excited to see what the community can build with these vague apis the regular blockchain exposes tons of detailed trading and risk data completely for free and to everyone for example you can find out at what price levels other traders might get liquidated visualize the settlement cash flows between traders or look for traders who are making lots of profit and try to copy them so that brings us to the eat online challenge the judges are awarding five thousand dollars across three prizes for the most innovative creative and exciting new visualizations you can build the data from the vega test net you have access to everything from margin movements to all orders and positions from price monitoring circuit breaker auctions to liquidations and of course the balances held by every public key the judges would love to see colorful novel and interesting visualizations of this data perhaps you'll show risk and leverage broken down by trader or maybe capital flows are your thing perhaps you want to analyze the data and highlight market opportunities or maybe you want to use the data stream to generate procedural music and real-time visualization visualizations that show what's going on in a more stylized way we recommend building something that works in a browser unless that doesn't work for your idea a master entry can be a serious trading tool that's not the only way to go and i'd personally love to see some anarchic psychedelic and whimsical entries too that embody the spirit of this community and showcase novel ways to illustrate and explain what's going on in the market so that's the challenge i'm really excited to see what you come up with but remember you're not on your own in addition to documentation for the full apis at docs.ethonline.vega.xyz and even more docs and other materials available once you get onboarded to testnet you can also join the community forums and get help or just chat about vega and trading at community.maker.xyz we also have a discord server which you can join by the link shown where a lot of the vega dev and leadership hang out and we'll be happy to help too that's all from me looking forward to seeing what you create thank you so much barney um for for those of you who are interested in using vega protocol be sure to check out their docs and also talk to them in our discord channel and uh there's a lot of cool features that you can now enable by using vega so uh be sure to give that a try and i can't wait to see what everybody builds with all the d5 protocols that i've presented today so that was our last sponsor video for today and we want to move on to our rest of the summit
