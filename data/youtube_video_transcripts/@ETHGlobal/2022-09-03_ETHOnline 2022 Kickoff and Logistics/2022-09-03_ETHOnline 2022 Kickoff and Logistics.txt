foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of eat Global and I am super excited to welcome all of you to eat online you're all here watching me on eat global.tv and this is the website and the platform we'll be using for the rest of this month this is where all the Summits and talks are going to be including the closing ceremonies with the final demos and of course all of today the way this works is that you can sign in on the chat and say hello and talk to us this is a live stream so I can read what you're all saying and we also have an amazing Summit right after this logistics for the hackathon so if you have any questions for our speakers you get to ask all of them directly in the chat and we'd relate them to all of our speakers all right so those of you who are joining us for the first time this event is organized by eighth Global and for those of you who don't know what youth Global is it's an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by doing two things we run hackathons and summons and this month is no different talking about Summits these are short four to five hour days with amazing jetpack content on relevant topics that let you understand what's happening and the latest that's happening in any given category and this month is full of that we're going to be running five in total there's going to be one almost every Friday starting today we're going to talk about devtools how collaborations and Dows and eats two and the ecosystem and everything else is evolving so check out the website for a lot of those details on the agenda and for the next 45 minutes or so our focus is going to be this hackathon so let's talk about the hackapack this is not only our biggest event of the year but our biggest event ever in our history we were absolutely mind-blowing with this the amazing crowd that we have uh 1600 people are hacking for the next few weeks from 96 different countries spanning 19 different time zones we also put everybody on a map to see where everybody's joining us from not only on the live stream but through our Discord email and all these platforms and it's astonishing and astounding how much diversity and this the span of who's joining from where we were all kind of being welcomed from uh six continents being represented and uh I am just so happy to see this and um I can't wait to meet all of you and talk to you all on Discord and not just the hackers we also have 35 ecosystem partners and 110 ecosystem mentors that are going to be here with us for the next few weeks helping you make sure that your projects are successful and you are unblocked on them and to top it all off we have 350 000 in prizes that are going to be given away and we'll talk about what these prizes are how you can win them and all the details about receiving them but before we get into all those details I want to thank some of our amazing Partners who without their help would not be able to make this hackathon this big and amazing so when I quickly thank optimism superfluid of a grand style scale Labs polygon ipfs and Falcon worldcoin ens Uma Aurora epns the graph Chronos live peer burn 81 AP wine Abacus Unstoppable domains connects lens Spruce covalent tableland quick note nft Port ballast Key Bridge teller streamer sismo Oasis uh ceramic unlock and xmtp labs so we're going to bring some of them on to talk about why they're excited to be part of the soccer Man 2 but before we get into all of that let's quickly cover a lot of the logistics for this month uh the goal here is for me to talk about how all these things work team formation how you can get help all the prizes you can win all the talks and workshops that are happening all together how judging and submissions are going to go uh we're going to also cover Summits and just what's gonna be the agenda and after this Logistics ends we're going to roll directly into our first summit of this month which is all about devtools and how you can learn about the latest advancements in building on what three so first things first communication is kind of the most important thing we're going to cover everything about this hackathon and this month will be on our Discord uh this Discord is only visible and available for attendees who are confirmed and have RSVP to hack and Ottawa Partners uh the way you can check this is going according to expectations is you will see and eat online 2022 header on your Discord sidebar if you do not see that with all these channels please go back to your hacker dashboard and see if Discord is connected properly and that will be your tell if you are running into any issues connecting Discord please message anybody on the global team on any other Discord channel that you see or by sending us an email and we'll be able to debug why that connection is or isn't working uh or just isn't working and these are also private channels so they're only visible to participants which means that anybody in those channels is also a attendee for this hackathon so you can also learn where people are from talk to them and see what they're excited to build as well as there are channels for getting help for any different any protocol that we have on board that's helping us uh throughout this event and for any of our partners who are giving away prizes and also a generic help that you can ask in The mentorship Help channel so if you are stuck with anything whether it's about learning hats and documentation works or how some protocol is set up or just in error that you can't make sense of just post those questions directly on those channels and somebody who's actually an expert in those things will be able to answer them to uh to unblock you almost ASAP foreign on top of that we're also going to be sending a calendar invoice for a lot of the important talks and workshops and especially for key events like submission deadlines judging the finale and everything in between including some feedback sessions that we're going to be regularly running so you can actually understand and get some direct live feedback from our some of our partners and mentors all of this is also going to be reflected on the website which is the source of Truth anything that the website says is what we'll be doing and we really want this thing to be asynchronous there's about a hundred countries that are going to be participating at this event so we want to make sure that time zones are not a direct barrier so with the exception of a couple of sessions that are specific to people being on the same call like team formation everything will be a synchronous and you can catch up and keep up with it at your own pace and whenever you'd like and for those of you who don't know what the website's at it's online.eth global.com you can head over there to see all the latest details about the akbone all right let's jump into the hackathon itself so officially the hackathon has started which means as of this sentence you can start working on your projects and you can work on your projects with up to five members on your team you can also work individually if you'd like and you can have anywhere from one to five people on a project so the max ace5 you cannot exceed that limit and you are good to start you have three weeks to hack that are 23 days to be precise and submissions for your hackathons are due at 3 pm Eastern on Sunday September the 25th that gives you 23 days until the deadline and the next few weeks are going to be covering stuff around check-ins stop around getting feedback a lot more workshops and talks that you can catch up onto and going through a lot of the internals about different protocols if you are looking to work on some internal uh or some really specific protocols that you need more help and time understanding on top of all that we have now a new feature where you can find potential team members who are still looking to join a project on your hacker dashboard if you go to your team section you'll see that you get to opt in to find the team member feature and anybody who's opt-in who is officially looking to either pair up or have somebody join their team can set in their preferences and find other people who are also in that position there are 1600 of you over 1600 of you joining this hackathon so uh there's definitely a lot of you who are still in this position who are looking to find other members to join their team with complementary skill sets and you can now also use the service in addition to all the calls we're going to be doing and have done to to find potential team members so check this out on your dashboard and it'll show you everybody who's interested as well and if it's a match you get to contact each other directly on Discord now let's talk about the rules and the criteria for a hackathon one of the key things that must be adhered to is that everything that you're going to submit must be done from scratch which means that you cannot work on a project or a site project that you have been working on already that also includes adding features to something that you have done they may be entirely new to just this event but are still being committed to a code repo that was from before this act started we really want to make sure this is fair and consistent with everybody else's experience so you cannot build from a pre-existing personal projects uh if we are if we find out that this has been the case that team will be disqualified from this event and no prizes will be given to the team and a really really important note is that only RSVP hackers are eligible to win prizes that means if you are working with a team and each of those team members has not RSVP and confirmed as a hacker and they do not show up on the team section on your project and your dashboard itself if you win any prizes we will not be giving prizes to anybody that was not listed on the team so it's your final kind of call to make sure that you ping everybody who's on your team to verify confirm and have them show up as a team member on your dashboard and if you have any questions about these things uh let us know you can ping anybody on the team on Discord or over email and we'll be happy to answer those questions for you let's talk about judging so submissions are due on Sunday 25th at 3 pm and the way judging is set up is that there are two parallel tracks there's going to be a main judging that is about going to be a synchronous session this is one of the only key times where everybody must be on an actual call Independence of the time zone and that's going to be from 12 P.M to 2 30 PM Eastern on Monday the 26th and then for anybody going for partner prizes there's going to be an asynchronous track where all of you who are trying to go for a price uh those projects will be sent to each of our partners and they'll be reviewing everything on their own asynchronously and if they have any questions for those teams they will be pinging you directly on Discord or email uh clarifying anything that they'd like to know before they decide who is going to be the ultimate winner for each of those prizes but I want to focus a little bit more on the main judging the main judging is going to be asynchronous call which means that everybody as a team comes on and demos what they built each team will get four minutes to do a demo of what they prepared so make sure you are concise in really communicating what you're doing and what you have done over the past three weeks and this will be a video submission only which means for your demo and your submissions on the Sunday the day before judging starts you are required to upload a four minute video or max four minute video talking about what you built with a demo team any other additional information and that's what you are going to be showing to our judges and we see this all the time but we really recommend that you do not do this last minute because this will take a lot of time in making sure it's concise and it fits in the format limit all these details are going to be available and visible to you on your dashboard as we get closer to the submission deadline and we'll be sharing a lot more of these specifics but you can also get a quick peek at what this process looks like by heading over to your Eid online info center and that we'll talk about the judging and submission process altogether and you can also see some sample previous submissions about really projects that we like on the submission formats and you can use that as a reference and really prepare a an amazing demo for the judging so all this is on the dashboard we're just giving you a heads up here and all these things will become more and more common and communicated really well in more specific details over the next two weeks and of course we recognize that there's a lot of you who are trying to get into web3 and are trying to explore what's possible so uh don't worry the statement is designed to be beginner friendly and that is why we have so much focus on Amazing talks and workshops and the Summits and all these things are insured to really satisfy every type of skill sets whether a beginner an expert and this is also the reason why if you are feeling like you are too overwhelmed that you're not able to understand everything that's happening or you want to catch up more you can just tune into the Summits as an outsider too everything is going to be live streamed and public and open and Summits are happening every Friday and for the hacker specifically all the details around from submissions to any rules and and edge cases to Logistics around the next entire the entire month of September will be listed on your infocenter including any frequency frequently asked questions and the Qualcomm almost common question we get and uh I want to address is yes everything is going to be recorded So if you're not seeing this live right now on 8th global.tv the same video will be available on our YouTube immediately after this live stream ends and you can just head over to youtube.com eastglobal or just go directly to to the website online.eth global.com to click on the schedule item itself and see the video recording of that event we'll make sure it's really accessible to everybody and these things will be there for all of you to catch up at your own pace so no need to uh prioritize something else over this if you have other obligations focus on making sure you are able to catch up when you'd like all right now let's get into some of the fun stuff which is some of our partners who want to talk about why they're excited to be part of this event and all the prizes and after that we will get into talking about all the summit details and um and get kick off with our our devtool Summit so first up I'd like to invite Kelvin from optimism to share what he's excited to be part of it online [Music] it's me the very serious person named Kelvin and today I'm talking to you about the only serious blockchain called optimism this uh this is a very serious situation and they need to take certain steps to protect themselves if you're building an optimism you better only build serious applications you know how serious I am look at this oh yeah that's right so why should you build on optimism because we are solving the public goods funding problem [Music] why are we solving the public goods fun problem be it turns out the whole point of everything that we've been doing for years has been to make actual widespread societal impact with the work that we've been doing it's not just to take the yam and to and to put the yam in the cup and then somehow because you put the yam in the cup with the eat it turns into two yams and then and then you take the second yam and you put it and you leverage it and you turn it into into Ste somehow and then you put it in the bean pot and the bean pot gives you uh more yams people like don't win this with the yams and the Bean Pots it doesn't make any sense deeper there's no Pepe something you gotta be kidding me I got Fashions full of Pepe but you know what we could be doing instead is having a real societal impact so optimism we made a blockchain right because we realized you know you gotta scale this stuff sorry you gotta still scale this stuff and then we were like wait a minute actually what we're trying to achieve is to use this software that we've constructed in the societal these uh these crypto economic Frameworks that we've constructed to achieve something in this case we believe that we can create a better funding model for public goods and we start by focusing on open source software because that's what we know so I'm just saying build on optimism [Music] you think they like that Dexter this guy [Music] that was the amazing Calvin talking about optimism uh as a note I had not seen that video before this thing because I was told that I need to react to this live it is incredible so you also get to see what optimism is doing for prizes but hopefully you get a better glimpse into what optimism is from those last two minutes a very serious blockchain all right up next is Fran from Super Floyd and he's going to talk about streaming money I'm Fran one of the founders of superfluid and I'm super excited to welcome you all to eat online this year this I think is the second time we sponsor Reef online and at superfood we love hackathons we've seen some amazing projects come out from last year and we're very excited to see what you get up to and what you hack over this month what we do at superfluid is digitally native programmable cash flows using super fluid you can send streams of money without needing to lock up the capital upfront and with full programmability which means you can let your mind loose and build some crazy stuff so what does money streaming mean so these are basically open ended transfer of funds you set up a stream and it goes every second it keeps moving money it's fully liquid the recipient can spend the money as they get it and you can collateralize your stream as you go by doing this the recipient gets paid every second there's no delays they never risk not getting paid because they're getting paid every second and there are no intermediaries right it's web free it's completely on chain fully permissionless and anybody can use it so basically you can imagine with super fluid we're switching up a bit the way you pay right instead of paying at the end of a period you basically get paid throughout the period right so the way we like talking about it is that we're moving from recurring payments to ongoing streams right this is the web free native way so what can you do with it you can do subscriptions you can do salaries you can do social tokens right maybe you're paying your community a reward for joining your Discord uh you can build some interesting D5 products and of course a lot of games right imagine a game that sends you their own in-game currency as long as you're playing so how do you get started well the first thing you can go to our dashboard that's app.super fluid.finance and here you can start experiencing what my streams are like as a developer we also have an amazing tool called the console which will allow you to visualize what other people are doing you can see your contract address and you can start exploring the sub graph as well uh building with superfluid you'll find a lot of interesting and useful tools we've got sdks and JavaScript typescript subgraph solitary libraries example applications and a list of uh interesting hack ideas for you to get started uh getting your your brainstorming session going but if not we have also a Discord Channel where we have a lot of ideas going all the time if your experience at the hackathon is great after the hackathon we would love you to join the super for the reactor this is basically an acceleration program where we will take you from your prototype to getting ready to raise funds or go live in production it's a completely free program that we run only with the best teams out of microphones so when you're building out a hackathon don't think about it as a prototype think about it as your first step into web free and into building an amazing project so yeah welcome everyone it's a month Vlog and please come and hack on super fluid awesome that was a friend on super fluid and we'll talk about all the super prizes very soon and next up we have Jess from Ave Grand Style hi everyone my name is Jess I'm the developer relations engineer at Avi if you haven't heard of Avi it's a decentralized liquidity protocol where you can supply and borrow different cryptographic assets probably is one of the largest and most exciting D5 protocols and it's deployed across a number of different chains we're so excited to be participating in eth online and Avi grantstar offering twenty thousand dollars worth of prizes for you to integrate with and build on top of the RV protocol you must build a project relating to one or more of the price categories and for each category you could win three thousand dollars for first place and one thousand dollars per second please we have five prize categories for the first category we're looking for projects and Integrations that can bring more stable coin liquidity into Ave the second category uses the lens protocol to assess the reputation of profiles for credit delegation and the third category looks at accessibility think about what new ways could help users to access the RV protocol the fourth category is an RV Forex tool can you help users to access Forex liquidity using features like flash zones or D5 Integrations and finally the fifth category is to create new ways to compose or visualize RV transactions we as a team are here to support you as well as the RV Grant style so please do reach out to us on Discord and let us know what you're building on Twitter and then thank you so much and we can't wait to see what you build foreign thank you Jess and next up we have Connor from scale hello welcome to ethonline 2022. my name is Connor Murphy and I run business development at scale Labs scale Labs is a core team bootstrapping and shepherding the scale Network now scale network was purposely built to bring ethereum to billions of users by providing them zero gasps and scale is able to achieve this through its transformative multi-chain approach through this approach and leveraging ethereum's base layer of security developers finally have a high performance blockchain with instant finality and once again zero gas fees now what is this exactly solving well currently across the industry many blockchains are monolithic or just single databases and as demand increases we see a squeeze on Supply and as many of us saw over the last couple years users have to deal with this squeeze either through increased gas fees slow blockchains or even worse the blockchain correction monolithic blockchains just can't solve the supply demand equation and this is where scale steps in these models with blockchains are realizing that they can't solve it by being a single database and they need to Pivot to be multi-chain well scales when multi-chain since Inception and as demand increases more nodes enter the network and scale is able to limitlessly add more Supply this allows for a ton of gasket savings and scales building for a future of mass adoption one where we use blockchains every day through gaming D5 web3 and more and unfortunately with the gas fees that we saw over the past year this just isn't possible we would never be able to hit the scale we want to hit with users paying these gas fees and this is why we built scale 's V2 launched this past July and we've already seen massive growth we're working with new depths every day and working to save end users Millions upon millions of dollars we'd love to have you join the scale verse please find our documentation here or reach out to any of the core team members on Discord or Twitter awesome next up we have polygon hello everyone uh this is sandipan from the party and devil team and we are very excited to partner up with each Global for the flagship online hackathon eat online to give you a little bit about context about polygon polygon is a smooth solution of ethereum scalability it's pleasing fast it's secure it's decentralized the problem statement that polygon solved is that no size fits at all like different uh use cases are being built out at polygon GGK and other types of optimistic rollups coming up in in the future and there is also no formalized framework that's when the polygon solution comes in with a Swiss army knife or ethereum scalability with ZK Roll-Ups optimistic rollups Enterprise related chains security chains and definitely the Beloved plasma genes so building on polygon is like developers love building on polling it and hope you have an excellent time this time in this hackathon also uh the backward compatibility Bollywood is ethereum evm compatible you can use all the tools and infrastructure you already love you don't need to learn anything new for this hackathon we are giving our 20K in prizes and there are main three tracks the general track is like first price will go five thousand dollar second price three thousand third price two thousand there's also a best Innovative dap built on polygon so like we always see a generic kind of darts built on so but what can be a unique use case did you if you can think about in that case and there's a three thousand dollars price for that track and then definitely uh some of the unique projects being built or polygon will be awarded with the pool price and seven winners will be selected thousand dollars each thanks a lot everyone I hope you guys have a great time building in the hackathon amazing that was sandeepin from polygon and our last one is going to be Nikki from ipfs and falcoin and Nikki will be joining us live so please welcome Nikki to share about whether excited to uh partner with you don't mind hi everyone uh my name is Nikki and I work on developer onboarding initiatives at filecoin uh I'm very excited to be here uh to wish you all good luck for Eep online 2022. uh hackathons are a great place to experiment and get your hands dirty and build projects and who knows someday some of them might also turn into million dollar raising fundraising companies um I represent ipfs and filecoin and as most of you know we are on a mission to decentralize the internet and buy extension decentralized storage uh while our challenge statement is the best use of nft storage or web free storage to use ipfs for Content addressing and file coin for persistent decentralized storage uh it is kind of broad to encourage any and all ideas that might come out of the hackathon uh however uh here's a tip we would love to see some depth tooling Solutions um that can help other developers easily use ipfs or filecoin or projects that are battery versions of web 2 apps that are an essential part of our lives today uh the question we are really looking to answer is how do we solve problems that come in the way to really scale and help apps and users move to decentralized storage I hope that inspires you uh we have twenty thousand dollars in total in bounties to give away for you to use ipfs and Falcon in your projects we do have a cool prize as well for up to 25 teams in addition to top three prizes um we share all of these details on uh Discord and our Dev Advocates will be there to answer any questions you have or help with difficulties you run into uh we'll be here to encourage you even after the hackathon uh so please think of this as a first step and with our grants and accelerator program and so don't be discouraged if you don't win in this one uh good luck and happy hacking thanks Karthik thanks Jacob thanks Nikki that was awesome and you can also check out all these things on your hacker dashboard now all right so before we go into all the other prizes and all the specifics of a prize when I give a quick reminder about how check-ins work and you may have seen this on your dashboard and on the info center but it's a very simple thing uh we're going to do check-ins every week this is a way for us to kind of quickly see how things are going and make sure that you are not stuck and if you are stuck you're getting any help uh getting unblocked whether it's on the code side or anything else and it really kind of helps us make sure that you are able to really accomplish your goals and continue to get to the the end product of what you are excited to build uh and your Stakes are also tied to this thing so checking also helps you get to the path of making sure you are satisfying participating at the account all this thing happens over your dashboard so the way these things are set up is that every check-in will start appearing on your dashboard uh early every week and you'll also be notified of these things so don't worry if you don't see anything now because they are not going to be visible they will start showing up early next week as a simple form that just says how things are going and if you need any help so keep in mind that those things are going on and they also help you really prep for any of the feedback sessions we'll be hosting so you can come on to those feedback sessions and ask any of our mentors or our partners for advice help direct support kind of like office hours and really see what everybody else is building as well and all that is tied all together as part of the next
