[Applause] [Music] all right welcome to the orb tear down workshop we have a ton of stuff to get through and we want to leave time at the end for you to ask any questions that you have hopefully we'll have the chance to do that and if not you can just catch us later so we're going to cover three main things today first of all why we made the orb in the first place secondly how it works and that's when we'll actually walk through the hardware itself and then lastly what's next for the orb and for world coin itself right so just to give you a little bit of background on why we made the orb is within crypto is super awesome right but it has two core problems today very few people have used it but all of the value is being hoarded by a very small amount of people and so a few years ago we thought well what would have happened if bitcoin had started by giving one to each person in the world and so we decided to give it a shot we said let's try this with a token we call that world coin and for the past few years we've been working on this but we ran into a problem which was how do you make sure each person only claims their part ones right and the more we look into this problem it turns out that this was a very common problem that a lot of projects have around the world which is civil resistance it's basically this idea of if there's 20 accounts you don't know if there's 20 people with one account each person or one person with 20 accounts and so we started looking to how to solve it and there were three things that were super important for us when doing this first how are we going to solve it had to be private secondly it had to be inclusive which means everyone in the world should be able to use it and then lastly have to scale right there had to be a feasible path to get this to everyone in the world and so we started with what you can imagine is as usual suspects right so let's let's just make people verify their emails or verify their phone numbers but that obviously breaks pretty quickly uh because it's very easy to just get a new email or a new phone number then we said okay what if we do something like kyc right like this is what banks do let's just verify the documents that people have but it turns out that more than half the population of the world either doesn't have an id or doesn't have or there doesn't there aren't sdks where you can actually verify those ids furthermore it's like super expensive and it's super privacy invasive right we don't want the names and personal documents of like a bunch of people around the world and so we discarded kyc then we run into this idea of web of trust basically the idea of hey i endorse you as a real person and you endorse me and through mathematical things either implicitly or explicitly you can actually build a trust model um where you can have like certain certainty and we actually think web of trust is super cool and there's a bunch of projects out there that are building a wall of trust the problem with web of trust is that you need a very large set of initial users you can trust right because if the early users lie to you then you're basically building a house of cards right so we actually think web of trust is how we'll get world going from one billion people to eight billion people but the only way to bootstrap that uh is to do something different right we need to find a different way to get to the first billion users and so after doing a lot of thinking a lot of experiments we we just got to the conclusion of the most fundamental solution is biometrics in general right if you want to have the concept of a unique person the thing that sets us apart as people is our biometrics so here we also looked at a bunch of stuff right and the obvious solutions don't work for three main reasons firstly they don't have enough data points or enough the entropy to distinguish between one and a billion people or one in 10 billion people right something like your fingerprint just doesn't have enough data points there secondly a problem that we had is we're not trying to verify that you are who you say you are right so when you go to work when you don't say i'm tiago sada and i am showing my biometrics to prove that i am who i am you're proving that you're someone who has never been here before that means that even if we could have enough data on the palm of your hand for example if you just make a small cut you're now a new person now you wouldn't be able to prove that you're tiago sada but you can always just keep making cuts and you're a new person every and every time and then lastly there was a bunch of really cool technology that is just very new right and just hasn't been studied enough and we wanted to have something that was super reliable and so we went through a bunch of things here went to fingerprints super is very temporary it's very temporable and not enough data same thing with facial recognition we looked at palm scanning this was actually the first prototypes that we built use palm scanning but it's just too new and there's too many uncertainties around that dna is just too creepy it's expensive it's inefficient so we didn't want to do that and so we landed on iris right turns out the iris of your eye has enough entropy enough data to actually distinguish between many people and it's also very impractical to change right you can do laser surgery or things like that but are you really going to get laser surgery to do like one more and one more identity it just doesn't scale and then lastly we said okay how are we going to do this our first idea as well let's try to do something like smartphones right everyone has a camera but it turns out like the resolution just isn't there right if you for example this is like face id it can only distinguish between 1 and 10 million people which is great because only 18 million people can break into your phone but if you're trying to prove on board everyone to one system that means after five million people half people will be falsely rejected because you would confuse them with someone else right then we said okay then you need specialized hardware let's look at what's on the market but the problem with that was they are those hardwares are made for one-to-one comparisons right they're made to check hey is philip who he says he is they're not made to check hey he's philippine new person right and furthermore the way the operation is going to work we need to operate in untrusted environments right we're sending hardware to a bunch of random parts of the world and you also have a bunch of fraud prevention things that you need to make sure people aren't wearing prosthetics people aren't just showing pictures and most of these off-the-shelf biometric scanners just did not have support for that and so we finally just realized we're going to have to build our own hardware for these which was honestly not a very good news like we did not want to build our own hardware like building hardware is really hard uh but we decided to do it and so for the past two years we've built a bunch of generations of the orb we'll get into one of those in a second and then finally after a long time we got this little beauty that you've seen on twitter you've seen here at the conference and at a high level does three things it first checks that someone is a real person that is not trying to cheat right so he checks their face to make sure that they're alive that they actually have um that they're breathing that they are uh that there's like a 3d mapping of their face to make sure it's not a picture or things like that right you're not wearing prosthetics you're not wearing contact lenses the second thing it does is it generates a code from your iris and by default that's the only thing that leaves your and then it that gets compared to everyone else that has been verified before right and then if that is unique then it registers your world id right which is basically the proof of person that we issue now this is a point that i really want to emphasize is world id is not your iris code your identity or proof of personhood is not your biometrics world id is also not your wallet right we're not verifying your wallet what we're doing is we're issuing you a new type of key that we call world id it is self custodial just as a wallet private key would be and so in the world coin app you can have 100 wallets you you don't have your iris code there because your iris code doesn't doesn't need to live there and then you have one world id key and that world id key is basically what the or white lists all right so that would already be super private but then on top of that we actually built zero knowledge proofs which means that key that we issue you is not even like a public id that people can query and oh i im number one two three four five that lives secretly on your phone and you only use it through zero knowledge proofs to prove that you're a person that hasn't done something before right so we're really excited about this system if you're curious about how that whole side of things works in particular with the serial knowledge proofs there's a blog post on our website that breaks it down it's called privacy preserving proof of personal protocol is a pppopp and you can just check it out and you can come by the booth and we'll give you more info on that but now let's get to the fun stuff right uh how how does the orb work right what did we spend two years building and uh how do we solve these problems of fraud prevention generating the iris code comparing that and then issuing you the world id and for that we have sandra here head of orbit world coin so he'll walk us through this all right let's do this let's see can you hear me somewhat all right sorry this is a rock pool you've been tricked we won't actually disassemble an orb we'll go the reverse way we'll assemble it from scratch let's go so the first part of the orb is is the mainframe here let's see and the the most important part here is it's like the the circular aluminum cnc machined uh frame it gives the orb stability rigidity etc and um very importantly it's spherical this did not come from engineering trust me it's it's a pain um to make the orb circular uh but in the end we really wanted it to be something uh unique um that has never been uh out there before i make it very very recognizable so and as you can see it actually has an angle to it um it's a small symbol it's the angle of the earth 23.5 degrees um we really care about making this clear we intend um to to really expand the scope of this and bring this beyond crypto nerds like us really bring it out to the world on board one billion plus people uh to crypto and then the rest what we can see is like cooling to get all of the heat out speakers and slot for the exchangeable battery and then up next we have the main board so this is where a bunch of really vital functions um live with like capacitors for for the illumination um we'll get into the optics in in a second we've audio amplifiers um a connector for the front unit up here uh so other pcbs uh driver for for the liquid lens is actually really cool autofocus we'll also get to that in in a second with a microcontroller controlling most of the the periphery like cameras leds powering up the device etc um sim card slot uh and then an ssd it's really important to state here that like pretty fold no no images ever leave leave the device unless users opt into backing up their biometric data so it's extremely privacy preserving and of course it's it's encrypted on the other side like connector for the liquid lens uh autofocus get to that in a second gps for fraud monitoring uh connector for for the main infrared camera and then an lte module down here um up here we also have wi-fi wait let's see to to make it really easy to connect um power electronics for the front unit battery connector down here and then very importantly in here slides the the brain of the orb this is really where where all the magic happens let me see so it's an nvidia jetson um it's an incredibly powerful um powerful system on the module it runs a custom linux distribution main program is written in in rust and supports multiple camera streams it's incredibly powerful which makes it very very flexible the reason why we actually need it to be very powerful is that a bunch of neural networks are actually running in parallel in real time on this tiny chip to make sure that all of the processing can happen locally and we do not need to upload images ever everything can stay on this device um the your iris gets converted to an iris code all of the images are are deleted and only the iris code leaves the device for for verification purposes cool so the jetson uh the heart slides in here into the main board see let's get it in there we go and then we actually assemble it here into the mainframe into the cooling to get all of the heat out let's see there we go that's the first part of the assembly let's move on so next up next up we're going to talk about imaging so why do we actually care so much about imaging thiago already talked a little bit about it is good imaging quality is really really important but but why let's take a step back on an aerial view what do we care about has to be secure has to be inclusive and it has to be scalable to make it really inclusive um like it has never been done before on such a scale in an untrusted environment out there in the wild so what we need to do here is is really something new and to make the error rates get the error rates really really low to make sure what tiago said before what happens with facial recognition is after a while you confuse new people with people that have already been in the database and you falsely reject them so of course not great if you want to build something that's fair and scale it to to the whole world so we really need to build something that is extremely accurate and the baseline for that uh really the basis is being able to extract uh being able to capture a lot of entropy and to do that we need very high image quality because that in the end is the limiting factor for all algorithms that build on top so this is for all the math people out there this is a bunch of distributions and you can see for bad imaging quality we get a lot of overlap in those distributions in the real world which means a lot of error rates good image quality is what the basis is to really separate out those distributions make sure that the same person really gets recognized as the same person and a new person really gets recognized as a new person but because it's biometrics there's always some statistical part of it so we need to make sure they're uh very far apart all right let's dive into some more of the optics um thank you okay all right yeah so we have an optical enclosure here to make the whole thing dust and waterproof so it can really be operated all the way out there not just in buildings etc but it can be out there in the world no matter where it is it's dust and and waterproof and then really the heart of of the imaging system is is this baby here so we have a with a custom lens um paired with an extremely capable imaging sensor um that lens we actually had to custom manufacture it we partnered with an external machine vision specialist in the space took about a year from handing over requirements to actually get it we tried really really hard to work with off-the-shelf components but in the end nothing satisfied the requirements that we needed um to make sure we can really scale this to a billion people um this lens is optimized for the infrared so let's see if you can see this here it's actually blue the coating is blue so it works best for for infrared light has a custom liquid lens integrated what that means is regularly for um for camera systems to to focus on on what you're imaging you are you're moving a lens with a with a motor and this of course is it's not the most durable solution not the fastest solution uh and we really want to make sure that orbs are extremely reliable it can be out there um and don't don't immediately die like if they um if they fall from like five centimeters so we took something that is extremely robust it's like a membrane there's liquid oil in it uh it's incredibly fast and durable this whole thing uh then assembles together uh like this and it slides in here in the back of of the optical enclosure just like that all right so next part is that lens actually has an incredibly narrow field of view so you don't see like uh a whole person or something like that what the orb really only sees is a tiny fraction of a person so now it's like how do you actually align someone who's trying to verify with world coin for world id um how do you actually align them with the device so very non-trivial task um wrapped our heads around is like took a while the first thing we came up with is okay let's just take two separate cameras let's put mirrors on top they're transparent in the infrared but a mirror in the visible light so people can hold it in front of them can see their eyes and position them correctly this way it's kind of worked was simple to build an mvp um but it was not great it was not cost effective the lenses are quite expensive and then um the alignment especially for people who are wearing glasses which is tons of people around the world had trouble positioning themselves so we're like okay damn that's that's not gonna work it looks cute but it's not the way to go um so then for future generations uh what we did is we built a 2d gimbal what this is basically is with the camera that you've seen before it's here in the back um then we have a static mirror and the light reflects from there to a 2d gimbal that 2d gimbal uh can be moved as it says in two directions via two motors up down left right so no matter where the user is positioned we can just steer the lens directly good thing we didn't build this for the first prototype was a pain to actually get this to work but by now the uh the verification process is incredibly easy you can check it out later it takes like 10 seconds and you're done and it doesn't matter where you are with respect to the device so there we are all right so the 2d gimbal then slides into the um let's see into the optical enclosure like this it's a little bit tricky there we go it's it's almost complete what goes on top here well let's see what goes on top is uh the front pcb um so what's on here is is a lot of very important things first of all we have a visible camera you can compare it to your camera on your on your iphone et cetera we use it to scan the qr code of of the user's app uh and to guide the 2d gimbal that we've been talking about before to make sure it's actually aiming correctly then we have a lot of leds in in the near infrared spectrum so they're all around here uh all of those sections so why do we need so many leds um all of you have probably been at some point to like a photography studio i've seen photographers use a bunch of light this is not for fun but because it makes up for for a lot better image quality making sure there's no motion blur etc um you know it best when you try to capture an image with your with your phones out there at night it becomes really really hard to image so light really helps uh to capture high quality images so this is why there is so many leds and then last but not least uh very importantly there is um a few fraud prevention sensors on there that thiago was talking about before we need to make sure that people are not only unique but they're that they're actually also human uh that they're not trying to spoof their device uh etc so we have like um like a 3d camera here that makes sure okay this is this is not a display etc heat camera um and then like another infrared camera very importantly again here is like all of those images do not leave the device um they're only processed locally unless users choose to to back them up all right this then goes on top of here and we have an fully assembled optical unit here let's see and then we marry this with the rest of the orb it slides in here just like that let's see this is a little bit moved nope does not want to oh that's why there we go and that's it we're almost done and then as the next part one thing that's missing is is a spectral filter so we've been talking about that the orb images in in the near infrared spectrum um what that means is um there's different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and only an extremely narrow part of that is what we as humans can see with our eyes this is what we call the visible spectrum it's here this um tiny tiny bump in the middle and then the camera can actually see quite a bit more of the electromagnetic spectrum are quite a bit more of the light and we really want to want to make sure that no visible light gets into the imaging process because it disturbs the imaging process what we need to do is we create a lab environment out there in the world no matter where the orb is and that's actually a really really hard part and to do that we separate out a very large part of the spectrum of of sunlight by using this this filter in the visible spectrum it's black that's why you guys perceive it as black it's not transmissive but it's actually transparent like a window in the near infrared spectrum we just can't see it because as we said before humans can't see that part of the spectrum and it goes just on top of here and it seals the optical unit for it to become dust and and waterproof so we're almost done the only part that's missing is a battery uh to power the orb so in the beginning we started with uh integrated batteries we just took like rc car batteries uh put them in uh it was quick and dirty solution it worked but it wasn't great because it didn't last for for a full day however the advantage was like you don't need certification you don't need all of those fun things but you can actually just uh test things out uh get out in the wild talk to people etc but eventually we realized okay we really need uh the orb to be able to run all day uh to get to one billion people uh we can't put it to charge for three hours and then and then get back so we had to build a custom exchangeable battery um fun fact spelled out of 18650 cells which are the same that are used in a tesla model s and then this battery goes in here on the bottom and we have a fully functioning orb now not exactly because this orb doesn't work uh all the cables we've removed them to make the disassembly here or the assembly i should say really easy however we have one where you can still see what's inside and it actually works you can uh come check it out we have 10 orbs transparent ones chrome ones purple one for miguel a bunch of orbs here for the first time at a conference a really large scale 10 orbs come check them out yeah hand it over to thiago for what's next all right super cool stuff that's way cooler than what i'm going to talk about but all right so just before we open up for questions just to wrap up like what's next the first thing is we announced a few weeks ago that we're open sourcing everything that we do at world coin so we've already started if you go on worldwide.open sourcing worldcoin you can read a blog post and already see parts of the protocol that are live and there is a roadmap to open source everything including the hardware we were hoping to have the hardware ready here by the conference everything on our side is ready to open source it the tricky thing with open sourcing hardware is the licensing because um it's actually very important that we make sure that the hardware is not misused and so we're working with leading open sourcing advocates uh on a new type of custom license that we will then also open source so that we can put the hardware out there be very transparent about what we're doing let the community contribute but limit uh or remove the amount of damage putting this out to the world can be right so that is super exciting uh the rest of the world going stack is also being open source you can see the timeline for that on the blog post next we have been testing the orbs along with the entire world going project in over 26 countries or something like this at this point this is the first time we're coming to the us not the entire project is being launched in the us but at least the ore verification is and so what we found in the field is that each of these orbs is doing between 300 and 1000 verifications per week which is super super cool and so what this means is that in the last few months we've done over 600 000 verifications around the world with just under 30 orbs on the field now these orbs where it's like super janky we built them in a lab by hand and we had very few of them so we were constantly moving them around the world to figure out how to operate different parts in the hot and in the cold in the sun and in the snow in rich countries and in developing countries like mexico where i'm from and so it's been a lot of fun getting to see all of these now the good news is that while we did a lot of verifications with 30 orbs now we have a really new badass factory and so for the first time last month we did our first batch of orbs that actually came out from from um from the factory and this was about 250 orbs so all of the orbs that you're seeing here at the conference come from that now this gives us the ability to now actually produce hundreds of hours per month and pretty soon thousands of hours per month and so you will see a scalar operations uh between now and the end of the year uh significantly which is very exciting to get ever underworld id the second to last thing that we're working on is we're obviously always thinking about what's next you've seen this is the fifth major generation of the orb we're obviously thinking about what's next uh both from the user experience side of things we've been playing a lot with using light feedback instead of voice the orb speaks today if you've been at the conference you can see that in a nice environment it's actually a pain in the ass and so we've been playing around a lot with that we've been playing with colors we have a prototype of a white orb uh in the booth if you want to check it out and then also we're already starting to do some long-term thinking of alternative form factors but i will probably take a while then the last thing that is coming out regarding to the orb is as if you heard the conference yesterday uh this week can we release an sdk where any developer can reuse the world id verification that we issue to users this means that just as we world coin have been using world id outside the us to decide hey is this a real person and have they claimed welcome before now any developer around the world can using the same serial knowledge proofs in a super private way cr verify any any action right so this can be hey i'm a real person and i've never voted on this poll before i'm a real person i've never played this nft before hey i'm a real person and never joined this discord before and so i know that a bunch of you are hacking with this i'm super excited to see what you build so that's pretty much it we want to give a huge shout out to a couple of open source projects that we use to make all of this happen and then also we are hiring very aggressively across the company obviously for hardware firmware in the orb the ai systems that power all of these and then all of the product stack right solidity engineers uh product designers both for the hardware and for the software basically if you if you can think it we're hiring for it uh community as well so that's pretty much it that's the orf the orb helps us uh verify people and issue them a world id to build civil resistance at scale it is private it is meant to be private it is meant to be inclusive and is meant to be scalable the hardware as you saw from sandra is pretty badass engineering and then all of this is married with zero knowledge proofs for even more privacy that you can read on the website and so with that we have like 10 minutes or so so we wanted to just leave a bunch of time for questions because we know there's probably a ton so yeah that's it so any questions don't be shy bring your hot takes yes pink orb soon tm yes no so the difference between clear and world coin and specifically the orb is that clear is meant to re-identify people it is meant to say hey i'm tiago i'm about to board this plane make sure that i am still the person that i was two weeks ago right as you heard one of the pros but also cons of our approach is that we cannot uniquely identify people and that is by design we do not want to be able to re-identify people randomly what you can do with the sdk which is what we also use ourselves for our products is you can know that someone is a unique person that hasn't done something before but you don't know which unique person that is right and so we i do not expect those to be using the hardware or the software for any use case related to those types of things players an awesome company and they can do that on their own what else yeah so there is if you go on worldcoin.org ethan y there's actually a list of ideas but in general i mean anything where you would want to make sure that each person only does it once right so there is governance right you might have one person one vote conviction voting bunch of things like that right in d5 you might be able to do under collateral as loaning right because you can make sure that if you lend money to a person they don't pay back they cannot just borrow money again right um you can do obviously a lot of things in the quadratic flavorings of quadratic funding quadratic voting quadratic a bunch of things where every individual like 10 individuals doing one thing is worth more than one individual doing it 10 bit 10 times basically um there's also cool use cases around nfts there's a bunch of hype around soulbound nfts there's a way in which with worldcon you can actually make it soulbound rather than walletbound so there is also in web2 as i said we we on our discord have a discord bot and it's open so you can actually install it on a discord server that gives users a real human role which allows them to post on certain channels and give them additional permissions right so that means that for moderation purposes if we ban them then they cannot come back and get that role again because they already burned that one and so there's like pretty much there's like a ton of things and you guys are way better to think about this than we are what else what else what else also miguel can you tell me the door so we as a token for coming to the us for the first time with the orbs we made these beautiful pet orbs that you can adopt so if you if you see an orb around and you actually get your wall id you can find a bunch of these around the conference and you can adopt one you get an nft adoption certificate and and you have your own little orb you'll probably never have one of those so you might as well get one of these any last questions before we wrap up all right then that's pretty much it if you have anything else just look for us in the booth will also be around definitely get your world id is the first time we're in the us i don't know we will have 10 orbs in the us again so make the most of it there's really cool stuff you can do with it and it's a lot of fun to play with your all right thank you so much you
