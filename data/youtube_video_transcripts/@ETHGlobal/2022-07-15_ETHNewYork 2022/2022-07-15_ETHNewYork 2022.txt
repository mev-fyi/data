[Music] welcome all of you to eat new york the vibe is electric it's alive i love the energy the community the inclusiveness and it feels like home [Music] this is not a conference these are hackathons and our goal is to bring on as many developers as we can into the web3 ecosystem describing hackathons to somebody who's never been to a hackathon there's just a bunch of people that are interested in creating building new solutions staying up really really late working on extremely weird extremely cool projects there's people from all around the world on all types of skills and we're all coming together to build some amazing stuff [Music] i just love being able to be part of community and building ideas not only because we're using awesome tech but because we're solving real issues that are really pressing right now we have a lot of opportunities to meet sponsors from all these different companies sharing their ideas and you know how they want to continue to build your technology and how we can implement it i think if global has been such a constant and important presence in our ecosystem bringing people together really being like a champion of innovation the crowds are always really well curated as far as the different types of skills that people bring i've already had probably 30 conversations today with hackers that have been really fruitful for our community and just enjoyable for myself i think people at each new york have really beautiful visions for like ways that we can operate in the world we can come in and we can have an impact on certain areas we never really thought we could touch to act as an optimist you make something better because you see a path to a better future how are you going to actually have an impact if you don't believe in yourself to make that impact web 3 is all about leveling the playing field it's about creating choice it's about creating opportunity and really got access to resource regardless of socioeconomic background regardless of geographic background blockchain web 3 this entire tech stack is pretty new so anybody from anywhere can do anything for a very long time minorities have been underrepresented and i think when we put diverse people into the focus people can identify themselves if this person is there i can also be part of it there are people from 56 countries different backgrounds some of them are learning how to code some of them are developers that are seasoned and we love to make sure that this experience is memorable for everybody that attends any of our events the submissions were very innovative they tackled a lot of problems across many industries they were the highest quality of youth global hackathon projects i've ever seen if global is an amazing catalyst for the ethereum community and i think an example for the entire open source community heath global has led to so many different projects it's just been a hugely important way for things to be developed in ethereum you never know what's going to come out of these events we came out of a hackerfest 2020 hackathon and we've been going to other youth global events for a while and now we're here we've raised money we've built the company and actually we're growing pretty great so just keep packing away you're going to meet some amazing friends you're going to build amazing things eat global's the best [Music] the last time we did this was 2019 seeing this being the biggest event we've ever done with over 1500 people it's just great to see that the excitement about web3 has not slowed down in any form if you're looking to build something cool i don't think there's a better place to do it than eve global
