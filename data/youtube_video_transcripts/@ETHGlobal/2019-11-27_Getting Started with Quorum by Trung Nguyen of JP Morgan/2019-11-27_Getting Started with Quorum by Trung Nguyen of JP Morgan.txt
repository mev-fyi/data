so basically about quality okay so you know that orb essentially as a pocket oh I guess plane right so in 45 actually and some more stuff in there to forgive enterprise-ready so we've got a lot of interest but I don't throw that with you now myself going to get it initially I worked engineer probably so because we use a lot of internally component therefore you that's right see the structures are most kind of tolling but I've office people so I because we use them a lot in giving back to the community yes Oh Vietnam I got you a DVD in Australia Singapore so you can find the other it's like a PITA Twitter but if you copy to the structure of a party right so vesicle what a showcase oh boy robots should be a lot of toning available to make it happen and with the demo and focus on one tool that we would like to bring it forward further what's the next one for the deployment corner now for network everyone like quorum they start with cell phones example thing to pick up over here it's it's example so it's kind of kitchen sink for a plane in horn start at the second example you can send private transactions between notes and supporter play various while you're studying at them by trend is a player first option they don't we that is very simple it's running on cinema she laptop p.m. somewhere if I don't fall into epic Ram you can start off with the superscript and by around with Network that's one way we need a second way is there's a parameter to and it is very similar to okay it's a widget like but sharply then it asked you find that network joining the network it's that very step-by-step manual interactive console can take the network or easily we have curved Club which is the one that I presented today for the demo and the idea for Claire is we would like to have the ability to bring up for that look in and infoproviders in a dress agile there's a actual project service that they found this year which power bike or by probably use that service is over and also you know again hopefully we can do something called plan to support our Joe as a Bible he aims as well and DCP of Google cloud platform waiting for your contribution and we have another project just open source recently people at ease leave yourself right here yes so basically the idea is I generate a bunch of cloud verified form of any questions you get with that may the data fine you should check it out oh sauce and media play around it and give us some feedback on such an issues yes of the idea is using temple as a tool to consistently provide workflow to deploy quorum on different virus cell phone to a program or any other traffic or some xeroform supporters so looking back there for me see the ability to mix and match so if you can really like start to notice and if you want to that's possible because their form give you the very nice abstraction layers that complicate with all the providers in the API and on top of that it probably has some something the HCR a complication language so you can describe what you want to do with your infrastructure or software so when you describe it different runtime it you know going through that you know configuration file and then perform API calls to all the same yeah so the first version of cloud that we have at the moment is mainly focused on tiger breasts it's actually very first project that I did when I was transformed because back then we had over the seven for example and that's it and there was an issue of ow and we ate in or so I really wanted to see like how I run it you know for a long time to walk to observe the memory and CPU usage and stuff like that first I borrow my laptop you know like to sleep I that talked obvious is that compacted the next day it's paid yeah I need the letter was being L so I can call my doctor but it was I I created the flower like a glass using less it has to contain service because we already produce containers images so we can use that to read or network in in CCS easily some SP and so easy so the quadratic doesn't expose you know all the notes with perfect practice and all the traffic will go through the fashion show they don't that a moment how to protect you the so this compound project is except for zero point eleven so if intersects a way to change its language Hotel I bet it gets or an absolutely compatible with a little time 11 now the telephone give you a very consistent workflow so once you describe infrastructure the workflow to provision certain structure or software that is very consistent if you plan the applied finished on a sicily through our AWS of our jewel you brought the same come on in Atlanta crime destroyed so that like it's very powerful in terms of experience and the consistency in terms of how I can change I can provision find a structure now from flower i SS dia is doing stopping called mango from scratch means that it doesn't depend on an interesting question in rojo check coffee for you there's some before clouds with some daytime directory you run it by getting it collect on our keys and be the static oxidation now one of the challenge in the in flower is like the a container on the tyrants oranges or me how to fix an IP if you want to fix a happy on the cloud and have to pay money for it and that's why we don't want to go that problem and the some workarounds which show that only way the note comes out correct IDs and then I give the study notes of JSON and that I wish to be back into the network before I actually start America a dress Wow very good point so here we are talking about the day one operation for the network it means am I only care about whether we got the network this tool doesn't give you a day to plus features it means that if you want to change an echo even if you don't need what if what if it notes down doesn't give that feature yet it's a bit tricky but it's doable just like we need to spend some time and get it that's owner features about removal or a pet ignored or any node in they are API survival already rock crystal as well it just need to make sure that we can collaborate on Monday make it happen and that's a good point because I'm going to know at the end of the slide show you what is our planning to do all these things can support a two plus in a certain angle I'm not saying under percent you know like being a network management at all but it can give you some level of management that it's good for testing and so we use it actually we use it to run our second test suite on a daily basis so we've got the best fit running on campus it's over soft walk every day it planning for a plow provision the forum network on a grass run a bunch of tests and they shut it off it's already very clean sympathy for the phone and give us a output of you know where the output having any issues open existing features or not and the second thing that we use for is to keep track a long-running mo because we really care about you know the memory usage the city usage to see of generators any error from the law it's going to be present you know that way you can see how the network's perform in a very long period of time I'll show you they don't actually be on you know monitoring available we native dress it correctly Citiz that's not much work to do it's everything is integrated nicely yes yeah so give me a lot of demo now I pre-recorded it because I don't trust me the wires over here it is slow so but it's exactly what happened bunch of videos here I'm gonna skip a bunch of things because it's not very necessary because for terraform there's one thing that we have given my knees there for managing the step for us the step means the infrastructure state so it has his own view of the structure and as actual data structure so when it runs in traffic compare those two together to decide whether it should delete anything infrastructure so the state management is is is a shorter form so that's what option one is you can start our state locally it's a five second option is you can start state in the remote location like s3 so to prepare environment here they need Estate Management is bound to make sure that the term therefore has a place to store the state so tell from recently nothing couple months ago they are they open for public something telephone plow which allows you to remotely manage the state which is people because uh right now is very troublesome and manually a manual work to practice a magnet should be public now several plow is online services a service from telephone I should call they make it very easy so you should check out their little brown to manage your steps walking instead of using something like s3 lifetime so yes there from clients just another service from hajikko and you're on temple runtime version is sitting in your local so when you run it it just store the state of terms of structure in that their contract its separate service doesn't do we think anything we can't restore finish so you have a bunch of SEO of the question here under local when you want a cellphone we need to an apply what it I is it over your classified of choice provision everything remember the state of it and upload it to the DEF CON clock yeah no so they're from class only to score state infrastructure like your s3 bucket your ec2 information yeah it's just a state of jock infrastructure not the state of the four vector the Coronado business story later to execute so is a how thing work so initially yeah you know when I start when you start the core network I give it a security group Penn State so the one can access to my core network so do these computer call it will give me the current IP of it and then I can fit into monitor from scripts like that okay trade for me the security group that allows you it is happy to access my data so by the way what I do so the next thing is I just copy define and that's a fine content uniform not see a box which is only equal to my telephone operation so you're going to be input that you can see better something ID information topics of that kind information and there's access question Snyder blocks that's why I put my IP so that from my local I can access to the because it's a second security Hoopeston that I want to put on as some other things like context of mechanism that we can configure the number of nodes you have to spin up there's a couple image tags the version that we can use they're more you know like he puts that controls to that were more authenticity but if I for the variable stops here that is this part for you all the input that you can do to customize a network yeah just a copy today set that part and then very simple I did it make sure that I'm using s3 to store my home state for my home network it's going to devote a bunch of providers providers are the one that managing all the idea of all of the resource creation that is defined in my cell phone application and it's a different populations like a template spirit so it's quite a structure in SEM so in the sector for plan it's going to tell you that whatever you saw fit to be created what what the things are going to be destroying stuff like that but because now is we committed the trend your network so it's everything is act so when you planned it yourself some equipments right over 32 resources to be created just imagine that you get credit back and forth when you apply give you a preview of what going to do as well and when you say yes he's doing a bunch of things it's got a whole bunch of API provision I am policy provision you know security group creating the CCS fast services as ec2 instances widen up together recognized and in a few seconds these are our pilots but I cut it short so here yeah fitted and then it provision the bastion we copied information to the bastion and then to the start of the network so what is done because it's an output coming out of it is give you some information about the network that it's just provision image version and name get from the tower watch the group and you can see all the locks of all the nodes that we have the passion was DNS and IP for you to access duty to be Bushido so that you can jump to any stuff like that so whatever the thing is if check it for you the private key before so this private key and use it to access to do video but you know this one so after you've got a network that's that's cool practice how do you connect yeah the formation about the network or pitch now after that I was there for my client copy the bash in node so the ec2 justing now the bastion Lord I think as a campus with a private network or Devils but also he we deploy the e stands on the budget on this one so that it can give you the information about the whole network so we feel that so the question was if we adapted the network that I audited provision ethnicity standards from prepare that this dinner all the nodes in the network and some useful information right that is that go prepare long times like two billion plus block generated nominee mr. hole yeah some circulation that you know it's exactly the same answer that you are that you can get for running the inter stats and publish the metrics to read the stats so here waiting about back here if at least how the the current factory that's a vampire right which is the private key five that were using to access my gosh it on user and watch it all ba I jump into the Jumbo's for my local right and then if I want to get attached to and you know I just say note 1 note2 window 4 to 5 so on so far it means that now is sh2 the Jumbo's and then from there it's cold but it's not very useful right what you want you want to access John the network from your local machine so what how do I do that it's a yes sir it's a batch command just because like a modicum of information about what IP for the loved one and move to and so alright so I just quit a chefs being Dallas and everything else but Frank speaking its bit useful but it's not super useful this one is a two points to because most of the time what we want is we want to access the network from outside right not from inside seven just do something again but it's so much emotion you know so you can always run a tip from our cool command to display the existing information okay and that's it now if you want to connect from outside those same things are from a port to get information now because you can SSH to the power to the machine note you can do the SSH tunnel that is wrong right so but we need to know some information about the network was but you don't know the IP of every node you don't know what other public key your privacy addresses or of the key they share our privacy engine so there's a information available in the parking lot and Q beta parameter data and information and after you go you know it's by some information here we know that okay here's my network right the next thing is we gotta start an SSH tunnel by Apache dome so this commoditize very standard come on establish an SSH tunnel to the bastion node and make it ready right so the next thing is okay I got it ready all I need to do is I export all HTTP proxy using so subscribe to the SSH tunnel that I created over here save five thousand right so it means that all the HTTP requests going through this proxy when heat through the jump off to the private network so it's go all the way in any business he was wrong because you're the only one get a private yeah right so you can see a little bit so after you export the HD poxy and two songs fine or 5000 which is the SSH tunnel yeah we just started private in the left hand side then you can get attention to the track it might be inside there like this you can snare sort of tunnel fire Jumbo's though it to be symmetric and you can even run of character don't sweep up the contract and private contract and stuff like that so easy do exactly the same or not we can do it I can have a low hole now I should quickly about our bet it's just something about the network so this is my cluster because the Buster these are my set another example you think is yes I click on say you know seven tasks this would be one task because I start with tourim I click on task go down there there's a bunch of very interesting information so India different potatoes that I started and most notably there's only ten states are running for Brad right it's nothing that uh bootstrap container which died by the way after it is jobs and in the Quran is actually running the quorum package of shall speak some levels your network and you can do those people here it's gonna like YouTube flower watch for seven and from here you can filter and search you can set alerts for certain block information from the network send the emails and text blah blah whatever fancy patient services that a progressive over you can use it here as well right so it's all information is only the logs we fine okay we listed here this one is quite interesting it it's a clown watch and click on the matrix I'm searching for my quorum network it's a music ECS and click on easiest PR the memory and CPU utilization for individual don't you find that work if I search for memory studio video memory or the top right click everything and you are it's a memory utilization for all seven notes and I started I can do a kind of filling and displaying you can see that the technosystem what's on spike which is okay like block generation again feel after that it some TC and raga well the last one which is being consistent so we know that all okay that's good that's no when we take over here it's in the position that I encountered there was a memory if you can see clearly that is going up somewhere and then yeah so that's how we get you know more insulin and detect whether s anything wrong with the yeah so yeah some people what's next okay now very interesting right now the new stuffing is like couple inside these yes container so I have I have to run like multiple containers to get information like I have to run get container to do the guessing game I have to run a Syrah container to do the tea generation with Israel which is crazy right now we need to look for that make sure that we have the bootstrapping and port network on the local you've gotta be structure already just merge them together in order to do that we have to do something for we have to write our own cell phone provider blocking which is very easy to write as well and we're planning to work with and she talked to to salsa and when it happened so everyone can use it for their own plugging to bootstrap or network using telephone and then they can do our own kind of tell form you know of the question v and needs to deploy the forum network into the infrastructure easily and the second thing that we want to do is we want to be used by Dow C 2 instead of container because a lot of question is okay you start up container and stuff and how do I access to the law I don't how do I access to the box is a completely to see the instance running so we need to make happen server but sounds even higher by that and on UNCP's text all
