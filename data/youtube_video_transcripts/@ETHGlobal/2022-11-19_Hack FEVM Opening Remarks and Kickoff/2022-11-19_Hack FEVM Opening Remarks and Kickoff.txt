it this event is brought to you by Eve Global and for those of you who are joining any Global event for the first time we're an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits and today and this weekend is going to be no different so let's talk about what the next 48 hours are going to include we have an incredible Summit of talking about all things filecoin virtual machine we're going to bring on a lot of people who have been behind the scenes making sure that this runtime and this whole new innovation is is ready for all of you to use and make really amazing things and also to get feedback so they can improve things and we're going to bring on all these speakers to talk about what is possible and where things are going and then in the same time we're going to be kicking off our first ever fevim hackathon so let's go right into all the details about this hackathon this is the world's first ever feven hackathon we're gonna be giving everybody an early release on how things are going you'll be able to chat with everybody uh to understand how to best use this runtime and build amazing things and the best part about this thing is that this event's already huge there's over 400 Hackers from 70 different countries participating spanning 19 different time zones this is a online weekend event by 8th Global which means that all of us will be pretty pretty involved in staying up for the next two days and we kind of put everybody on a map to see where they were all coming from and it's super exciting to see representation from six different continents so thank you so much for joining us for this incredible weekend and I can't wait to see what all of you build and meet all of you and say hi to all of you on Discord all right let's go right into it not only do we have 400 plus amazing developers trying to build things on fvm we have 22 amazing mentors who are going to be here all weekend making sure that you get all of your questions answered and help to really do anything that you want to do as part of building your project and to top it all off we're going to be giving fifty thousand dollars in prizes and again I'm going to be sharing all those details with you shortly I want to really thank the ipfs and falcoin teams for making this event possible they're going to be here making sure that you have the right support and you all have a really positive and amazing experience in building incredible web 3 projects so let's talk about this weekend lots of things to cover from from our end uh we're going to talk about how team formation Works how you can get help all the prizes you can win uh impact by judging a submission and also after all of that we're going to run into the summit piece and kick off with our first set of talks so the most important thing here is that everything that we're going to be doing over the next two days is going to be on Discord so please make sure if you are a hacker that you have gone to your dashboard on 8th global.com and connected Discord connecting Discord will give you access to all the fathom private channels these channels are only available to people that are participating at the hackathon so if you are hacker you will have access to these if you are a mentor you will be able to see this as well and you get to ask questions here and see everything that's happening on Discord if you know if you want to just confirm if everything is right you should see that hack have them category on your left sidebar so just quickly check if you can see this and this is where everything will be happening we'll be making all the announcements covering everything around judging and all of the prize info and mentorship is right here there's also a dedicated channel for getting help so you can just click on the mentorship help Channel and ask any questions and we'll be there to answer all these things for you and clarify anything that you may be confused about and also we'll be giving and sharing all a lot of calendar invites for some important toxic workshops and things like judging and submission deadlines so don't worry even if you are currently sleeping which you want to get to hear this uh you'll know exactly when things are happening it'll be normalized for your own time zone and the website is our source of Truth which means everything that's happening here this weekend is listed on the website down to the minutes and whatever the website says is what's happening so if things are running behind or something changes uh which it won't uh you can check out all of that directly by heading over to the website we really want this thing to be asynchronous and as as different as possible we have 70 countries in 19 different time zones so we're going to try to make sure that you are at your best setup to take advantage of this entire weekend and the only synchronous part here will be Sunday judging which I'll talk about to make sure that we can all see and enjoy what everybody builds and as a reminder the website is fedam.eth global.com or fbm.ed global.com also works all right so how does the hackathon work so this is a unique event for us because this event is a large introduction to hundreds of you to really explore what this virtual machine can do and as part of that the most kind of question I got was what can I do here and how is this different than all the other events we've done I'm going to cover all of that in a second so officially the hackathon has kicked off which means you can start working on your projects now and you have 48 hours to build anything that you are interested in and gets your demo and present that to our judges on Sunday uh you can work on a project with a team if you're working with somebody on X team your team can have up to five members and it is also totally okay to work on your own you don't necessarily have to have a team you can have one person on the team or two three four or five uh the submission deadline is 12 p.m Eastern Sunday November the 20th in relative time that is 47 hours and 40 minutes from me saying this sentence so we'll be giving ample reminders just to make sure nobody has any uh confusion around the time zone normalization but you have 48 hours before everything is due from a submission standpoint now let's get to the question that we've been asked the most what can I build this event is to highlight that the most important thing piece here is that for this event fvm is evm compatible you get to use everything from tooling to libraries to your Dev tools to existing code all out of the box and really deploy things that take advantage of storage as a primitive now with solidity and smart contracts and that gives you access to a lot more new things that were previously not possible before you have a lot of new unique interesting applications on decentralized compute you can do a lot more interesting Integrations with ethereum uh you have a lot of stuff that you can do that is specifically native to follow coin on retrieval markets and storage derivatives uh or replication workers and data availability or just renewing contracts based on conditional logic you can automatically now make cross-chain applications possible that take advantage of the filecoin virtual machine and different chains and there's a lot of stuff around data dials and integrating with content and data to be now programmable there's a lot of room here for really really creative and impressive and interesting ideas especially that now that you have evm compatibility and you get to use a lot of things that you already know to how to do on on solidity and on ethereum and the big most important thing to remember is that experimentation is okay this is a 48 hour event we we know that you can do too much in in the short time and that is totally expected and known and we really want to encourage all of you to start small this is okay for you to have a large idea and only gets halfway through uh implementing some of those pieces that you wanted to do on Sunday or by Sunday so don't try to finish too much and compromise on anything from sleep to rest to just making sure that you are well suited to really function and do things that you're excited about and because you're also going to be trying this thing for the first time the goal is to really explore the possibilities of ideas and really make sure that you can see what can be possible and used now after Sunday to really continue building those projects so starting small is also okay if you have a grand idea you can just aim to finish a few features for it over the next 48 hours and one other important thing here is that we really want to make sure that fvm gets better and fathom is an exciting run time for people to build cool Integrations leveraging storage so one of the other highlights that we want to bring up here and make sure that we get to prioritize is that if you think something could be better you get to actually actively improve the protocol and the runtime and the feedback that we're going to get here helps everything get really even better for the next set of builders and if you are interested in doing something more than just playing with this over the weekend there's also a early Builders program you can see that on the fbm.falcon.io website so if you're interested in taking a project further there's direct support and a next batch of Builders program cohort that you get to be part of to get direct feedback advice and Integrations and just work with amazing people that are building similar things on the same platform all right so let's go into some of the key other pieces rules and criteria so this event is going to be slightly different uh as part of being in a global event the rules and criterias are fairly straightforward for for all of our events which is everything that we're going to be doing must be done from scratch and you cannot build on a pre-existing personal project uh we want to make sure things are fair to everybody that's participating from across the world so adding things to something you've been doing for months or or weeks or even days in in your own free time on a personal project makes things kind of hard to really assess um and keeps things a bit unfair however we are going to be making one exception here for this this hackathon and that exception is that if you are are trying to Port one of your existing civility projects to be compatible with and run on fem or favim uh you get to do that and that is allowed and that means we get to really see how compatibility works here we get to explore how we can do interesting Integrations between two blockchains or two or more blockchains and uh that piece is allowed so if you are interested in importing something that you've done before two entirely this new runtime uh that will be allowed and there may be some magic cases and nuances here so if you are in this category uh just send us a ping and we'll be able to clarify this for you the other piece I want to be really uh kindness enough is that only RSVP attendees can win prizes which means that if you are working on a team please make sure that your team members are listed under your teams section on your dashboard if they do not show up and if you will win a prize then we will not be giving prizes to anybody who is not listed as a team member so you have today to just really make sure that all that is ironed out and that all of your team members show up on your dashboard and if you have any other questions that we haven't addressed you can ask them directly here on this on the global.tv chat and I'm going to look at this right now or ask us this on Discord or email or any other way you can contact us we'll be monitoring all those channels all right let's talk about judging how is all of this going to be set up so the most important thing here is that submissions are due on Sunday 12 p.m Eastern that is in relative time 47 hours and 30 minutes from now this will all be done through your hacker dashboard so if you just go to 8th global.com you will be logged in and you'll be able to see what is cement you'll see all the information that you need to do and once a submission is done from your side you will have to go through the main judging process the main judging kicks off immediately after summations are due which means that as you are submitting you will be told what the next steps are and we'll do a first come first serve basis for assigning a judging room to all the teams you will get to present what you built to an amazing set of judges and then in parallel all the prizes will be judged asynchronously from the protocol labs and the ipfs team and if they have any questions they'll be able to pay you directly on Discord but project judging for any prizes is going to be asynchronous and in the background while domain judging is going on now here is how the judging works after you submit your project you'll be told to get to a zoom room where you will be assigned a room for Edge judges who you'll be presenting to you will get seven minutes in total to present to one of our judges and that is broken down into three minutes for questions and four minutes for a demo uh you are allowed to make a live demo happen which means you get to share your screen directly uh on zoom and demo what you built you will still get four minutes I will cut everybody off on the four minute mark because there's a lot of projects that we have to do in a really short amount of time and then the next remaining time will be moved over for Q a we really recommend that you record a video of your demo instead of trying to do everything live if you get the time try to just quickly record a screen share of your demo up to four minutes and submit that as part of your submission process because if something goes wrong or something takes time or if you're trying to do some main net transactions on a blockchain that's going to take a little bit longer uh you want to be cognizant of the fact that you still have four minutes in total and if something goes wrong at least this backup works really well for everybody else to also see what you did and spend all this weekend working on so really don't do this last minute if you're listening here I really really encourage you to at least take one hour in total to make sure you have all the stuff for submission in the form worked out as well as a demo recorded as a backup in case the live demo doesn't work last minute all these details are going to be on your dashboard so you don't have to worry too much about remembering any of this will be prompting with a lot of this thing from calendaring advice to Discord messages to just your dashboard really telling you what the next step is the other important piece is that there's a lot of prizes that uh we're giving and I'm going to cover a lot of them in in a couple minutes and when you are trying to win any of these prizes make sure you select that you are trying to win those prizes as well and uh in that submission form and only if you select that is when the ipfs and Falcon maintain will know that we have to evaluate your prizes so if you forget that there's no other way for somebody to know that you wanted to be eligible for a particular category of prize so make sure that you do forget don't forget to check that box and do remember to check it all right and of course there's a lot of you here who are joining us for the first time there's a lot of you here who are joining us from web2 for the first time as a season engineer so I want to welcome all of you here and really kind of talk about what happens if this is your first time uh participating in in this event uh this event is designed to be friendly for everybody with any skill set uh this has an intentional goal around onboarding a lot of existing developers into web3 and we have amazing content and plans for how do we onboard a lot of beginners and also make this equally interesting for anybody who's been in this space for a long time that means there's a lot of talks and workshops some of this has already happened some of you already joined us on a lot of these workshops and brainstorming sessions everything is on the website from the schedule we're going to kick off a summit in about 10-15 minutes right now directly and uh uh our goal is to make sure that you are as informed as possible and you get to learn about all the exciting things that are happening on The Cutting Edge so don't be afraid to just jump in learn about what's happening or join any of these toxic workshops or just simply ask questions there's a lot of people here who want to make sure that you are successful and you are able to learn uh and get your questions answered and also all this information is recorded which means that if you are in a different time zone and if you want to sleep in 10 minutes but you want to really catch the talk that's in two hours uh you'll be able to watch that immediately on YouTube the second it finishes and uh that means you have a 60 second delay in catching up on something after it ends and all these things will also go be reflected directly on the website for this event fevm.e global.com and you can just head over to our YouTube channel to watch anything that comes out of this weekend directly on demand and if you are still looking for a team you can head over to find a team channel on Discord and reach out to all others that are looking to also meet other potential teammates and really work on exciting projects and of course there's so many of you from so many parts of the world so don't forget to introduce yourself into the hack Venom chat Channel um we're really excited to meet you and see what you're excited about and where you're coming from and again just to remember if you can't find a team that's totally okay if you want to work on a project on your own and use this as an opportunity to learn something or learn how to deploy something on Evan for the first time that is totally okay you don't need a team to submit a project you get to work on your own as well and in case you haven't seen this yet you also have access to a tool on your hacker dashboard to find potential teammates from this event you can look for people who are experiencing certain skill set if you're looking for a front-end engineer or a designer or a back-end engineer or somebody who really know smart contracts you get to use this on your hacker dashboard to find other team members that can contact them and see if they are also interested in working with uh you this is a double opt-in so if you are looking to be found on this database you have to go on to your hacker dashboard and check the box saying I would like to be contacted by others who are also looking for a team so give that a shot and we're also doing a information session shortly later today so just check out all of those details on the website now the other couple things are that this is a really tight weekend and there's a lot of things going on so to make sure that you have opportunities to get feedback on anything that you are either stuck on or want to know more about or anything that you are trying to understand better so we're going to be hosting a feedback session with the the filecoin team uh this is tomorrow 3 P.M to 4 30 p.m in relative time this is going to be man this is hard 29 hours from now uh 20 28.5 hours from now and uh you get to uh come in get feedback on what you're building if you are trying to get some questions answered you get to just hop in and this support kind of like an office hour still be the people there to make sure that you are unblocked on anything you're excited about and if you want to just show off what you've been building and just get feedback on how to make this even cooler you get to do that right now so check check this out and you will be seeing all this stuff on your infocenter and all of our schedule websites too and lastly we want to talk about the code of conduct even though this is an online event all of our rules in Code of Conduct still applies to this event

reminder the website is fathom.global.com that has everything for we're going to be doing the next 48 hours all right before we kick off with the summit I want to quickly talk about all the amazing prizes that we have and then I'll stop talking and get to listen to a lot of more amazing people talking about all the things that they've been working on so a total of thirty five thousand dollars will be awarded for this event from the ipfs and falcoins team and to quickly talk about what these things are let's go right into this so there's a lot of prizes that you can win for just building

going to be two winners here and you'll have bonus points for also integrating any storage retrieval Market use cases as part of uh this this category we also want to make sure that we get to do some cool experiments with data dials and the best you use a fabin within the data dial will have two recipients winning three thousand dollars each then there's also a category for the best building blocks such as building native taxes or amms or other Primitives that will be useful for others to build on in the future and there's going to be two three thousand dollar recipients for this category
