all right welcome everybody and this is our final day of hack money defy hackathon demos I am Karthik one of the co-founders at beep global and for those of you who are joining us today on a Sunday afternoon this is the last day of us going through all of our judging for the projects that was submitted for hack money so for those of you who don't know the livestream money was a hackathon organized by Eve global and for the past four weeks we had over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and over 15 different time zones participate and and builds on top of defy protocols in this ecosystem we had people from all these amazing countries we had over 40 mentors that were there to help our developers and our hackers with anything technical product or marketing related and an amazing set of sponsors who made this have been by dedicating their time and resources and making it easy for all of the teams to really use the res DK's and extend the composability aspect of defy so let me just say this one more time we had 350 hackers spent four weeks working on projects that they wanted and they had on their own wish list and as of last Sunday a week ago when we finally going all the submissions with the projects we had a hundred eighteen defy projects come out of this hackathon now this is absolutely incredible I mean I think I can comfortably say that we've doubled the defy spam projects in this space just in the past five weeks alone and we're using this entire week to showcase everything that's that's come out of this event and today is going to be no different so I want to quickly walk through logistics of how the next two hours are going to work we're going to have 13 teams present their demos to our judges and everybody else on my screen where each team will have four minutes to showcase what they built and we will have three minutes for questions in feedbacks this gives every team about seven minutes in total and just to save and minimize any technical difficulties we've asked it to record a video demo which they will get to play to keep everything else on track a quick overview of how the event was structured the rules and criteria for this event were simple we had teams that could work on a project and each team could have up to 5 members you were still allowed to work individually if you chose to and the only rule that we had was every team must incorporate it if I primitive and that's kind of what made it hacking on money and just like any other hackathon all code that was submitted should have been written over the course of the hackathon so everything will be seen today was a result of four weeks work and the way we're gonna structure our judging is going to be on these five categories we're primarily our judges are going to be scoring every project on how technical original practical it is and then on top of that how is it to use from a usability standpoint whether the UI UX is suitable for the audience ratings you fill this for and if it's a developer tool how easy or how high level are the abstractions for the end good offer and of course in case something is an account employing those previous four categories we have a general catch-all category called the wow factor which lets us offset and outliers and just to kind of be absolutely clear this is not a competition the hackers are here to learn and really share their excitement they've been working on these projects last month and they just really want to show this off and we're excited to see what they've done and the judges are here to get feedback their their comments your questions will help them will help our hackers not only improve the projects but also understand how they get communicated I share those stories better and in just another disclaimer I'm not everybody's trying to become a business that's not in the intent Oracle so some projects are me going to work on and go and publish them to let anybody else be a user of them but we are not aiming for businesses to come out of this thing this is purely about experimentation and increasing the size of the space so with that this is our schedule for today we're going to have these 13 teams come on and their demo and a quick reminder for everybody else as well after today's session has done that which concludes our judging we're going to be having our finale livestream which will be this coming Tuesday June 2nd from 2 to 4 p.m. for sir where we were going to have risen top Lewis Thomas Brittani Ashley Chad Robert leshner Vitali Luther interest on eco chop look at our top teams from this entire set of hundred Asian projects and we'll use that as a way to celebrate the really cool projects that came out of this event so be sure to watch out for for this Tuesday if you are a hacker you would have been already invited to the event from so check your calendars and then everybody else can sign up by going to the 8th global Twitter so with that I want to call up our three judges who are doing all the hard work today and we're extremely thankful for them giving us their Sunday to judge and give feedback to these projects I want to welcome velocity from 1kx Brendan from pull together and Ken from foundation to say hi and with that we're going to kick off with our very first demo that is project Maximus so we'll be sharing their video from our end and the team will be there to answer any questions after so I'll kick off Maximus you I'm Andrea I'm a GP member at Byzantine capital hey I'm Calvin I'm a developer blockchain developer and also I'm marrying just a teen as if I promised hey I'm Shane I'm a software engineer and I architect hey I'm Gary full-stack engineer hey guys we're team Maximus we're building a fully on chain decentralized bank very similar to make or Dow where we differentiate ourselves from maker is that we are community owned meaning that those that provide value to the bank are those that earn ownership of the bank and so there - I think we're having some choppiness here so we'll get around to here this is generally expected and we still help to minimize all these years but give us another second to make sure that this is done properly I'll try to share this on my end all right think I have a high maybe got a bit more stability on on the internet side so let's kick that off I'm Andrea I'm a GP member at Byzantine capital hey I'm Calvin I'm a developer blockchain developer and also I'm learning just a team that defy products hey I'm Shane I'm a software engineer and I architect hey I'm Gary full-stack engineer hey guys we're team Maximus we're building a fully on chain decentralized bank very similar to make or Dow where we differentiate ourselves from maker is that we are community owned meaning that those that provide value to the bank are those that earn ownership of the bank and so there are two ways to earn ownership of the bank the first is to take out loans from the bank credit creation also known as minting a CDP and the second way is to provide liquidity to a unified pool between the bank's stable coin and ether so yeah we hope you guys enjoy I'll let Shana take the product demo from here awesome hi I'm Shane part of Maximus as you can see we've already connected a minim ask account here this account is this is on localhost although we do have a deployed version on rank B but for brevity we don't at the time so here we have a lot of methods here we we were very ambitious with our contracts but it this works a lot like the like the compound contracts for the liquidity and money market parts so what we do is is we give the contracts access to move our tokens around and we explicitly enter the markets for the currencies that we're we're trying to lend to supply or to borrow and so what we might do is we might lend a theorem in order to in order to enter the market and have some collateral and we can do this here to this we might collateralized some aetherium and then we might you see there's there's actually a lot of UCM the system supply and there's no borrows so we might go over here and we might try to borrow some usdm from the system and and enter it that way this is happening really really fast here because it's all local so if we refresh here we can see there's now 100 um and part of my numbers this is not the actual interest rate I have a wrong order magnitude here by negative 14 but there's a borrow interest rate right now and supplies still super super low so in you know you can also repay your loans you can withdraw your ether and you can withdraw your your um and then there's the you know swap pools as well here or you can add and remove liquidity and here's the remove yeah and so there's a look there's a lot here we were we intend to do governance as well in the future and more management features but this is the cert demo hey thank you for video we're waiting for questions I'm quick question it seems like it seems very very complex which you know is a scary thing just from the security aspect is there reason why you also make your own stable coin so one of the reason is we want to make something very similar to die but we don't want the governance to be controlled by one organization even though it's a decentralized organization one more something similar to to what you experienced with a bank today so everybody who participate will become a ownership a shareholder essentially for forming itself and in order for us to do that we can't really use a third party stable coin so we're just using what thou wicked I'll make as like a great example and then we just want to deal extend idea for different purposes and that make my cacao was you centralized or to my knowledge it doesn't have you know really sort of token holder governance in your library like how how that would be different so the the whole premise here is that Makita even though it's a decentralized organization the ownership is is heavily concentrated to a certain organization or influence influencing people we want to pick that out and make it more like a shareholder structure and so I'm not saying that it's not a decentralized organization but if you think about any any governance token if over 50% is owned by a group of people a smoker people it's not gonna be just like blotching if it's owned by 51% of the validator it's not gonna be giving presentations oh I was gonna jump in I just wanna I just have a quick tactical question so these did you effectively fork the maker system or did you write these more contracts from scratch so CDP is so complicated we didn't have time to do do the whole thing so what we what we did we actually fought a compound and because the compound on collateral system is very similar so that's what we did in the demo so it's it's not complete even even with compound is so much work to do so we basically just  compound and make a mirror is in P behavior I'm looking through the this is really cool cuz I like the I create distribution and kind of how it's broken down it reminds me more of like a mutual bank which kind of has the people in mind right how did you come up with the allocation to credit the equity allocation and what does the Dow actually do in I guess the 30% that zone do they like are they only ones that have governance or can purchasing governance or requirements the other 70% so the governance part is is really conceptual right now it's not part of the demo but definitely we thought about this we when we first started we thinking about we're just gonna FJ drop the token the governor's token to to encourage people to provide liquidity and we've created this unit swap pool originally but we want people actually to own on some governor's token we haven't thought like the actual implementation in the real-world scenario so I think it makes sense for us to retain a 30% just like a face one of compound you you have a organization running the development and everything but eventually you convert that into the town so that was the beginning of the concept we want to distribute like 70 percent of the token to the people and they incentivize them to fund the unit unit swap and then we will maintain the 30 percent at the beginning at some point when we completed the development then we're just gonna decentralize their pockets were cool thank you so much team Maximus we're gonna move on to the next team the second for today which is d Fido - so please welcome them to the stream hello I'm Doug Lloyd my teammate was Richard far and we built D Fido 2 as our hack it's a smart contract wallet that uses Fido two security tokens for all key storage and signature support its command line native it has a lot of D Phi integrations for example compound unit swap Ave and open gas station network the advantage of using a phyto of token over a custom hardware solution is that they're very common and useful you can use them for everything from logging into Google or github to SSH into your servers they're also very cheap you can pick up a solo key for 20 bucks let's continue to a demo D 502 is a C++ command-line application you can run the application with no arguments to list the available commands the first command you should run is the list command which will show all the currently active 502 devices on your computer next you should select the device you would like to use and then run the init command at this point you'll have to enter the pin for your 502 device if it has one and afterwards it's waiting for the user presence activation so a physical press of your Yubikey is what you need to do at this point you'll have initialize that JSON file we can look at that and see that it contains the public key and a credential ID in some metadata but it does not actually contain any private key material that being stored purely on your 502 security token the next thing we should do is deploy our D 502 smart contract to the network this is our contract address we can check to see how much ether we have by using the ether command east balance will tell us the first thing we might want to do is deposit some beef into the wallet from our sender let's deposit 10 e now if we check we see that 10 each has been moved into the into the smart contract if we however tried to withdraw one Eve now we need to actually go to our security token for permission so enter the pin do the user presence and it will invoke a method on a smart contract and withdraw one e back to the sender now if we look at the eath balance we can see that 1/8 has been removed the first defy integration I'd like show is compound let's check our compound balances it says we have zero see Ethan zero see died let's mint some seee how about five ten and send presents now let's check our compiled compound balances now we see we have a cee balance the next step is to enter the market or C e again every operation requires permission from the security token and now finally we can borrow let's borrow ten CDI now we should have ten died in our wallet which we can check with the ERC twenty command let's use unis walk to to change some of these dye to something else first approve the unit swap the for dye trading next use the dedicated unit swap integration to swap say to a three dye for rapt ether success let's just make sure by checking our rap ether balance thank you for watching and be sure to check out our github repo for future updates and cool for my side it's more like it hopefully helpful suggestion that the the security token it it there's a different association with it you're technically correct but a lot of people at the beginning for a while I'd thought you're doing something with tokenized securities just you know good point yeah this is true yeah I guess we should be a little more explicit or description not a big deal yeah it's not a big deal it's just like you know some people might go for the first 10 20 seconds down the wrong road that's all yeah thanks for the suggestion I mean I guess this being a defy hackathon we should be more cognizant of our wording there yeah yeah what we're really what we really wanted to do was to provide an alternate interface to these decentralized finance contracts because I think it's very important to not just rely on these websites is the interface that are you know obviously centrally hosted they have essentially issued ssl certificates but to also have alternative interfaces that people can use to interact with them and being able to use their security keys for key storage I think is quite powerful too because it adds an extra layer of comfort for people that's really interesting Doug Richard I like what you guys have built I'm just curious just in terms of more a little more technical detail I'm not as familiar with these like UV keys as you are so it is it's not a cold storage wallet right so it doesn't actually have you know the public private key on the device that's compatible if they're if they're em right you're not sending like a transaction you haven't signed this is a slightly different process I correct it doesn't actually sign-in aetherium transaction on the device but it does actually keep a public/private key pair elliptic curve public right here on the device and what happens is that we have a smart contract written in solidity that can validate those signatures so the command-line application creates a message and then hashes that and then sends it to the security token for the signature and then that is what sent it validated by the smart contract so it's sort of like signing a meta transaction yeah right so you could actually sign it by anybody as long as what you're signing includes the signature of the Yubikey that isn't can be interpreted by the recipient smart contract so it's kind of like a public function that can verify an additional layer of security exactly and anyone anyone can send the transaction to the smart contract as long as it as you said has the right signature and we kind of our plan is to incorporate the open gas station network to you know handle the incentives for other parties to send like for example you could pay and die yeah and just one more quick point is that it's really interesting that the actual public/private key pair isn't completely stored on the Yubikey it's actually derived every time by providing the credential ID so it's really a neat design and that you can store an infinite number of public/private key pairs even on these very small devices and this is exactly how the web offense tan derd works you can have thousands of different websites and all have their own public private key pairs works the exact same way here you could have a thousand different smart wallets and you're just one would you be can handle all schools don't think thank you so much MD Fido - thanks for joining us and we're welcoming the next team to the stage Mehta badges you hi hey welcome you showing your video great yeah so we are team Mehta batches I'm at the Renault I took care of the smart contract and Scott error and took end of the front-end and back-end be a miracle service we worked on CDIP for maker Dow a community development initiative proposal on non-transferable pages for maker ecosystem activities so how it works we propose an incentive ation mechanism to enhance activity on megiddo is ecosystem this is like an overview of the smart contract we integrated also been GSN and essentially we interact with the maker maker the system check checking Redeemers on chain for example if they accrue one died interest on on part or if there are currently 3 voting on a governance pool or if they are they are the high bidder in a bid for other auctions and then we keep track of Redeemers checked on chain and off chain via the graph and then they can redeem a batch for their activities and this is our preview of the user interface and now we launch you hey looks like the audio isn't streaming so we can only just see the video so would you mind quickly pausing it and sharing the same again so still walking I think I don't think your screen shirt so make sure that you check boxes there from a star over or just we can just go on that yeah so we can scroll back to a few seconds but everything else is good now I think okay I'll start over or I know they're just just a demo okay okay it looks like we have still have a problem you're not getting audio so what I'll do is I'll just share it on my side okay I this is not zero Masari maker dow ecosystem this is tacked on building collateral up auctions then the Redeemer it's here now keep tracks of the Redeemer check on chain and then four and four Redeemers check off chain we are using Merkle tree be a miracle service and and then in senior Dow is linked to badge factory where is formed by page factory and beige rolls inherits batch roles we're leveraging on access control of open Zeppelin we created a new role template er that can create a new template and then the Redeemers checked on chain or off chain they can redeem activate the batch the activate batch and then there is not transferable and then they can born eventually the batch now show you a quick demo how to create a new template so any work now we can check pending it works now we can try to activate a batch for a change checked Redeemer that we have to set we already said the route - so we need to insert the proof then we need to insert the leaf and we can brown now we can check the transaction spending any wars now we can see that the bands badge activated Redeemer this is the Redeemer that is these accounts these accounts here and is transferred from account address 0 to our account also we worked on open GSM and you can find all the integration from in to in the smart contracts in open GSN branch where I worked also on creating a badge paymaster that it's already been funded to pay for transaction thanks thanks Nazareno I'm just gonna jump in here with some technical questions I think it's just just to clarify so we're doing on Shane sort of proofs that they accomplished something I guess with the protocol and then they're using those proofs in order to mend themselves these like badges essentially yeah so we check on Shane Redeemers if there are four activities they are doing in real time like if their crew won more by interest on part if they are voting on a governance pool or if they are high bidder in a clutter auction in the in the present moment and then we we saw the ash of the address and we keep track of the Redeemer check on chain and then off chain we check for activities from historical data from events and then we store in America tree on back-end American service and then both Redeemers can activate a specific batch and via batch factory through activate batch and they can redeem those batches other NF teas yeah r NF TS and also we added a non-transferable feature so the the Redeemer means the the batch and it can transfer so it's it's your it's a batch so it's something new very cool gives a bit it starts building a reputation for this address yeah yeah yeah it's kind of interesting because on one hand we are you're using on chain data to create mint these NF T's which can then be used I guess to say for example to unlock you know community forums or other features and whatnot but it's interesting to me that it's if the data's on chain then can't they just check that on chain data and but you mentioned something about real-time and so that's kind of interesting is that you're able to I guess have a history of these of this activity even if it vanishes if or if it gets deleted or so thing so that seems like that's that's the advantage in this case interesting interesting so thank you so much mail batches and we're gonna welcome the next team up to the stage legal pools here representing legal pools it was aimed to be a gateway for users to be able to deposit and withdraw very easily in liquidity pools like avid compound unit swap balancer we chose to make it a contract where we can create a League of pool factory pool we can create a pool for any provider and any underlying accepted currency and we have wool so we can create providers that are Unisa have a compound we can register currencies that are linked by and create food with the specified provider and exited currency through a function that calls factory that is specific to the provider program and each factory implements the create food function specific to to this provider this is the have a fermentation we have a factory limiting the create will function and the pool implements an interface with deposit and redeem functions that have the n here is the implementation for Ave we have a pool and that receives an underlying accepted currency in in the constructor I could die and and this was like the backhand side and then in the front end we made the game okay I will take it from here on the front end our idea was to make a very user-friendly interface to interact with the different providers on a form of a PC platform game so you have a level for each provider well do it to a very easy end the idea is not to make a bad game but to get to know about the different providers so maybe if you go to the box to the Box down here or here the good could get tips to get more information about the different providers and in the end you can invest so maybe you said the dice you want to invest and you do it right now the functionality is not working we also have implemented the logging with parties together crypto wallet aim and we loaded with Skynet I do the link on our submission submission and we also want to make another view where'd you get the different providers doing invest you invested in with your profile and the different tips you got and tips remaining to learn more about them and this would be life game because every time a new provider gets to the word we could include included here and that was our idea thanks a lot for listening thank you yeah we're idea is not finished but we just wanted to get some feedback what we could have done better um I think so I think I've seen a few of these sort of you know interfaces to add liquidy different pools but what I did find very original is the UI and UX to kind of gamify that that seemed that seems very cool this idea was just to make it make the experience very easy so you don't have the impression to be learning the complicated things but while you play do you get to discover new tips like in a game but the tips actually mean something and they mean information that you can use to make money while playing but sadly we didn't have enough time to get it to a nice end that's okay you could continue working on it yes we will for sure do so currently the the game itself is not related to what you guys want to do right so what what in I guess in in you know the future what as you guys keep working on this what kind of game do you envision would be a part of this that actually does teach people you know a lot of these primitives we had a different ideas we start working on because we wanted to make contract that handles the user information and invest in the different liquidity pools but it was a bit more complicated than we thought because we encountered some problems during the coding so in the end we tried to switch to the idea of completely free a game that would be the fronton sia free to everyone to just learn about cryptos and get into this world yeah take at the beginning we wanted to do the contracts but then we change our own mind and we didn't know at the end we had this dilemma either doing it all with three or trying to do it also in contract with years xx of the shares in the pools what do you think better yeah I think it's definitely you should definitely keep playing around with this I think right it's it's especially like the UI idea I think that's it's like a cool road to go down to and just yeah I'm more fun with it okay thanks will we will let you know if something comes up yeah I mean I think I think the the way you guys are heading in terms of you know keeping it all in contracts keep it all on chain would be I think that's awesome right I think you can actually start tracking stuff there yeah I would I think that is probably a way more preferred especially because then you know if you're Furio sorry or time but yeah if you all keep it within kind of the the user and have it you know all on meta mess you can just get in jump in in and out I think it makes it a lot easier and more seamless when you actually do want to invest or I guess not invest but you know it be a part of play around we've grouped those - exactly awesome here's awesome thanks thanks so much Liga pools we're gonna bring up the next team to the stage my project is liquid e5 all right hey guys um we're pretty fine just gonna share my screen and show you guys the video a lot everyone welcome to this presentation of our project liquid defy which is about democratizing defy liquidation so what we build is a shared liquidation pool because existing liquidations were quite inaccessible to many users of the application but at the same time the you'll stay gays are pretty high so what we did is we love people to cool their songs into a smart contract and then these funds are used by our liquidation box to liquidate underwater position then the process of these regulations are shared among all the investors in the pool so this is a theme and now we'll dive right into our demo so we built this dashboard that shows you the the pool the the entire pool and we're just going to posit a hundred died in there as we want to make some money so that gives us a madam asked pop-up I'm just gonna up the fee to no 100 because who wants this transaction to be fast so demo we're gonna put the gas to a hundred [Music] so here we see that we the public 100 die into this into the pool which right now corresponds to about 80 shark body and that is because the value of one shark guy is going to be higher than the value of one die because school is always making money um so to sort of simulate our liquidation we are going to be sending we're going to be sending from a die to our smart contracts to the people to the pool which is so stimulating the pool making money so let's say we're going to be sending 100 a tie to the entire pool and again we're gonna up the cash price and then what we're gonna nose here so we can see the value of our die change so we're gonna have the exact same amount of shark eye and the exact same share a share of the pool but we and everyone else in the pool is going to make a little bit of money on this on this liquidation we basically made five died on this simulated liquidation so let's go through how this works technically for a little bit um so basically the way it works is that we have these our liquidation box we have investors in shark I and then we have people that are getting liquidated so investors turn some of this die into shark guy Direction noobs and what happens is this contract hi asleep its invest and died in are they in a die SEC either yields of a die on our own yields um and then at some point there's going to be some price crash on something and there's going to be an underwater position that are about capitalized and what's great about a contract is that it ensures that the investors in the pool must actually make a profit so there's no way for the bot to scam the pool so that happens we get collateral back from a B and we swap this collateral back to die with unit dropped and then at some point the investor gets back there died from the pool and probably have made some money so this is a future plan we're going to launch a main map we're going to port more liquidation platforms than just ahve we're going to support more yield tokens as well make both improvement I guess token you know anything to be more efficient and girls who want to hear from you what you guys are looking forward to in liquidy fine alright that was the video when do you take profits right because if there's a crash in price or there's a there's a crash it keeps going right I mean I think when we have automated it was a zoo with the alga trade I mean this is this is the most fun right at what point do you do you pull out so I mean um the the effort in the pool are just and I and as soon as there's any like profitable liquidation position or bar takes it and immediately turns the collateral back into dying so that pays their work so it's like immediately you like this idea I think this makes so much sense to democratize that aspect so everyone can start earning yield on that out of curiosity though I feel like there's there's a lot to be said here for knowing how much of that liquidity you're utilizing because if you're liquidating liquidating fairly small positions and yet there's millions and those profits are being spread evenly across all those deposits so it seems like have you thought about constraints you want to put on the different sort of pools so that or do you just see them as the market getting so big that they just utilize everything out of the singular pool so um I guess we're probably gonna see some sort of equilibrium where people are because the more people are in the pool the less yield is gonna give because the profits are going to be shared by them so we thought about this and um we don't have like a real strategy for for that but I think so so we think that probably become market equilibrium for that hmm interesting yeah you said to let the experiment play out and at the but you you're Bessie the parts are running on your server or how does it work yeah so basically our smart contract sort of acts as an interface between the box and the actual thing we're liquidating so in our case Ave but could be any other that's from as well and yes obviously are bought called smart contracts which is called through to the Ave liquidation okay jump jump in for one more question when work technical question so the the bot the bot could be a person as well right it could be anything because the smart contract ensures that there's no kind of custody of the funds essentially at any point right yeah sort of that trolls the internet so the function is also its callable by anyone because like like you said it's some old and forced other smart contract that the pool must make money so could be anyone raising thank you so much liquid EFI we're gonna move on to the next team which is urban scale welcome to the live stream anything to that we do it looks like your audio might not have been shared oh yeah so sorry it was a take the screen share off and make sure when you do share again you're clicking the audio share button in the zoom menu okay and so pointing the talk hi folks the Phyllis deliver bigger this harmonic and there's my hackathon sensations by the same name it's a platform for government education to issue public bonds public bonds are a common mechanism used to finance different government projects and it's also a good form of investment as the returns on these bonds are guaranteed by taxpayers for based on pools where was a sharing the bond so quick demo whenever someone signs up whenever someone visits the application they get to see all their stock bonds that's currently available and it's easy to go and purchase so that's a big part of my application because public bonds even into today are or like it's it's meant to be accessible to ever you but unlike stocks or anything it's like often directly traded between two parties so while it's available for ready it's kind of difficult for them to access and that's where my project comes in where I'm trying to use I'm converting the bonds into EOC 20 tokens and their trade and purchase can is much more easier than online through this platform it suppose different social logins so let's with you log in with one of my accounts when you enter the system and if again let's have a quick look at how the creation process works so you have to fill out a form with basic details about what your issue would be like I'm gonna skip to jump jump the video forward to a point where it's pre-populated that it has being fresh from Emma which is a government initiative which is our website which currently displays all the bonds that have been issued publicly let me fill this up and quickly jump forward so here we are back to a populated form I fetch the information from the my website it's an issue by the city of Long Beach for the recovery of all taxable for the economic redevelopment of a certain part all the paths are filled and were these also the principle that they were trying to gather the kind of returns they could guarantee and this is something that the number of tokens that we're gonna issue this so each token would effectively we priced this divided by this so let's quickly jump forward and shoot once again since the bonds with an issue rather it ends up on a page like this which gives us basic information about the power bond and views to virtue I said it's list it's been listed with along all the bonds available that all on the platform and a user can just click onto it move ahead to purchase it so they specify the number of tokens that they would like to purchase and it's currently integrated with meta mask that's a local wallet or it also integrates with photos of stuff like this I think makes it really easy for a common user to just go in and purchase amount [Music] so that's after the purchase is complete I'm I'm redirected to the page like this which has the certificate containing all the details about the bond that we just purchased and it's also verified through this QR code if I check my portfolio it lists all the bonds that I have purchased and I can't trade or the bonds have been issued as how you Ana swap compatible compatible yeah I see 20 token so future work would be enabling trade for this across all of those different participants so there's a secondary market for bonds that's it thank you for questions so what happens I mean what happens under the hood yep I see sent you essentially creating different IRC 20s and then and then how would you think that will connect to the you know this the city of long beach eventually like how also that I end up as that's money in their bank account sure so though it's meant to be a platform that are supposed to be used by the government institutions so the way that took the way they ensure the tokens I should it supplemented by Emma so it's playing along with the existing institution because when someone issues a bond like this which can only be done after they complete the due process through the government agency and in in a sense the other ones ensuring that the bond issuers are fulfilling their demands but that's actually or to anything like the governing body needs to ensure or that the returns are being met out and also the platform can enable whoever's is in position of the tokens to make sure that there are dispersals reach the correct individuals the certain answer question so sorry copywriting in the background so I have a question how do you see this actually happening like what do you what do you need to move this forward and see it realized well I guess like having like interacting without like being in connection with public institution or government bodies who might be interested to issue their bonds online platform like this cause right now it goes through banks and it would be an alternative means of issuing such loans have you thought about if they effectively defaults on these bonds what is the course of action for the lenders right also that actually that's the state that's a responsibility on behalf of Emma Emma like the other ones insuring bonds I should and the other ones oh-hoo and sure like the bond with the bond is respected honored great thank you thanks so much me thank you urban scale so we're now gonna take a five-minute break before the next presentation so chance to stretch the legs grind your coffee whenever you need to do then we back after five minutes with the rest of the teams for today's session you you we just live streaming a five-minute break is that do we just hang out here I think we are still live streaming but we're welcome to chat over the break slide if you want to have a conversation I love the world right now ken how how you doing how's your neighborhood in New York it's all right it's all right um the protests are pretty crazy I'm not gonna lie actually I just hear a lot of sirens outside today is not as bad as yesterday but it's you know a CA P you know it's EAB you know I'm just gonna mute myself oaragaintrail walks fine we're just doing a good morning show but yeah we'll call it for a couple minutes you you back everybody the next team up is defend money so we can get them live on the stream hello and welcome to the defend money presentation I'm your host Chris Powers first a look at the team Jack Tao sue and shadow fly from China and powers from the US what did we build defend money is a decentralized insurance pool it gives users the ability to hedge crypto asset risks without sacrificing the price up side users will pay for downside price protection for volatile assets how does it work once a user deposits their asset in to defend money to ensure it automatically splits these funds into two groups first 5% is converted to die leant out on abend this is the risk-based capital pool or could also be considered the insurance premium this is used to compensate in the event of a price decline or is payment for protection if the price increases second the remaining 95% is deposited into yoona swap to earn trading fees as time goes on the price will go up and down when a chooser uses to exit there are two possibilities if the insured acid increases in value then the user will only receive the 95% that was deposited on Yunus wha if the insured asset decreases in value then the user will receive the same 95% plus additional funds from the risk-based capital pool to compensate for their loss here is a diagram walking through the steps for when Alice wants to insure the account defend money uses chain-link for price information and records the price of the token in the insurance account and then when Alice wants to liquidate or redeem the price information is fetched from chain link and compared to the previous price recorded in the defend money insurance account let's look at a live demo first select start to begin the insurance process next choose the token to defend right now there are seven tokens once the token is selected you will go to the main page on the left you can see the status for the entire defend money insured pool right now only Ave and link are included in the insured pool and then in the middle you can see the incentives for the entire defend money insured pool on the right you can see the rate of the return for different assets over time and then in the bottom right each user can see their own profile for the insured amount if the user wishes to withdraw assets they can or if they would like to ensure additional ones they can also what's how it was made the first thing was brains from the different architectures particularly the compensation logic and also separating the insurance pool then the team tested it and deployed to the chain using remix and solidity and then purchased the defend money URL interface and use in Fuhrer to connect all of the web 3 stuff and then render with you framework and deployed it to the server in the future we hope to integrate new features add compound and also add more tokens through chain link and that's it thank you very much and cool can you so it's kind of a little bit like an option right you're buying this like so the security option again surprise can you specify what happens let's say I go I buy it if 200 and then it's ethers at 150 and I withdraw how exactly does it work yeah so I think if you would think about the number of these right you're kind of ensuring like the number of eath rather than just like the dollar so we have I think this is the one we are setting at is 95% so 95% of the East would kind of be set aside right and in the event and then the 5% is converted to die and in the event that there is a Redemption you would get back the 95 percent of yeast whatever that would be plus the die and presumably in that case because if Heath has gone down to 150 then you would be getting more because that 5% of your asset would have 150 is converted into died you know obviously it would be a bad investment if Heath would go up right because then you would sacrifice the 5% and then that 5% is in the surplus pool which would hopefully be able to compensate in the event were eath went down to 150 again all right thanks into a stable coin to sort of head or make sure you don't are less exposed to volatility and then if you want to sell you get that back if it's dropped if you want to sell and you get that back you don't get that back that's gone up so why wouldn't I just do that on my own why would I use the insurance protocol if I'm getting that right yeah I mean I think two things I think one there is a little bit of a shared risk in this right like if if it so the compensation can be determined like you would need to have more than potentially what you could set aside to compensate for like the downside risk if that makes sense so like in the long term it would be better so that like people can get compensated for things that they can't insure themselves like in that amount but that takes a certain amount of the pool growing in that time but I think to your point like I think this is a good product for anyone to just do it themselves and so whether this is just like a defy zap you know kind of product - all right great thank you so much defend money and we're gonna move on to the next team which is tsunami wallet welcome to livestream hi there can you guys see my screen well everybody good yeah good so sorry I didn't prepare a video I apologize I didn't have time so tsunami wallet is a mobile privacy wallet for etherion sorry about the lack of a video and so the the premise was can we can we provide a mobile can we provide mobile promisee on aetherium and so if you think about the easiest ways to leek privacy today on etherium that would be a dresser accounts and then your IP addresses the first thing I tried to target was IP address link ability because of the lack of SPB it's kind of hard to do that to have any type of IP address privacy on mobile simply because you have to connect to up to a node and then the general question I had was like you know we all love indira they're doing a good work but what if they were evil they were evil they could do a lot of nasty things such as link IP addresses of accounts together keep track of which IP addresses are in charge of which are interested in which contracts and they can even do pretty interesting timing analysis to try to correlate like let's just say you're using a VPN to connect out to here they could say oh well you know this VPN IP looked at these three addresses all in unison those three addresses might be linked and so the question was you know can we approve this the best way would be through tor and so I'll touch on that in a moment and the challenges ahead of that for address privacy we now have zero now it's proofs which is cool I started actually working on a stack because I really like the ability to send any amount as opposed to tornado unfortunately they don't have any address privacy on a stack right now on a stack - they will but until I was tech - no privacy so I want tornado our Tony that was cool but of course it doesn't have a really good SDK and it only allows you to create fixed amount notes which kind of is less than fun for spending but anyways I went I went with it so when I decided to move to tornado I started to play around with it the first challenge I had was how do I actually get tornado proofs to be generated on mobile that wasn't so simple but eventually I decided to just do it in Android Jas sorry in JavaScript and an Android webview the things that I tried to prevent the user to from doing when they're leaking privacy even while using tornado is one a relayer like when you use a tornado note you have to relay it to an address and so you want to make sure that that relay is done through tor you have to calculate the total anonymity sent to that be the total amount of deposits that have occurred since your first deposit which I think 20 is a pretty good number I could touch them out later if you guys are interested and then timing just making sure they don't immediately deposit ten either and then immediately withdraw ten either that doesn't really provide very much privacy and other things were just like UX issues of keeping track of notes that's really frustrating so what I was doing was I was actually storing and encrypting the notes using the private key of the private wallet in terms of the mobile environment it was really painful actually I wanted to do this on iOS to start but I couldn't simply because tor there's not a really good color library on iOS and even if you do connect to tor on iOS you can't proxy it through web view so he can't really use JavaScript so I initially started off of a fork of block stream green which is a cool Bitcoin wallet that has a really good tour support on cross-platform but it would have meant that I had to recode all of the zero-knowledge libraries and see and I didn't really feel like doing that so I just dropped iOS and then a corpse samurai wallet which is another privacy wallet on Android which worked quite well and I was able to actually start doing communication through web 3 through tor on a mobile device and so what I was hoping to actually have at the end but I failed was that like you you have this mobile app that as to all you have the regular wallet that's not using tor and it won't let you send directly to any of your private wallets which will touch on in a second and you can look up your balance any time and then you would press a button to take you to your private wallet and this would be an entirely different wallet but you can only transfer from your regular wallet - you're probably well through tornado cash notes but it takes care of all that for you in the background it only connects through web 3 through tor encrypts all your private notes and keeps track of them and calculates the annuity set of all of your notes but kind of obfuscates that from you so just like it only lets you redeem notes that are anonymous enough and it doesn't actually let you send directly back to your other wallet just so that you can't accidentally like transfer back to the regular wallet from the private law eventually it could be web to read a prowler but I mean that's pretty a lofty goal in terms of how far I got I mean unfortunately I got pretty close I was able to generate groups and JavaScript and relay them and tour but I kept on guiding invalid proofs after going back and forth the tornado cache team like a bunch they were able to explain to me that I was using the wrong keys and that they kept keys in a different repo that wasn't really documented I was a little frustrating because it's really hard to debug your knowledge proofs but I mean I was pretty happy with how far I got I think I had like a model for how you could build private wallet on etherium it'll probably take a bit of time to actually complete it though so that's the well what would have been my video had actually fun Thanks this is this is super cool so when you said it failed is it really just the the ZK proof I failed what's her natal or did you have more things no I got so stuck up on that problem that I just continued like I didn't finish the rest of the app right like I was like man I can't get this thing you know this is frustrating cuz it worked on like and get act like yeah this is where I stopped like I got stuck up on it's gone for a while but I do intend to continue going and building the rest of the app now that I have like the framework super cool and yes I mean it you got it yeah I mean it's ambitious I think it's fair enough that it does this didn't work out right away it's it's pretty good complicated technology so kudos that thank you mm-hmm vice versa yeah I really like this idea and I feel like it should be built into a lot of our different wallets if not as an option and you might want to have a look at NIM so nimis is like tor but it actually times the packets so that they can't even do sort of statistical analysis across the edges it's a really cool piece of tech I don't know how far along they are with you know public deployments or test nuts but I people worth checking out yeah I would love for something on iOS if you have a look into Steve there's any type of a min library and iOS but the challenge I had was on an iOS you can't proxy web views like on Android you can proxy all the traffic on a web view through a port which or bot will open like your portal open but on iOS they like it just doesn't seem like that's possible so I think the only way to do an iOS is to create like an EM VPN that your app would like create a little edgy but that's a good idea thanks for that mm-hmm interesting good effort I have one more question so with with the private wallets do you envision it to be you know someone would just set up a different private wallet so do you think each one is sort of an ephemeral and you kind of have disposable private wallets in that way it really is kind of an extra layer later if as tech 2.0 pulls it off you could actually just kind of not really even really know cuz like you could just keep all of your your notes in Aztec because they're kind of like utx OS and just spend however much you want but with tornado I think it's kind of ephemeral wallets because they're fixed amounts so you can't really you can't really do anything but half of emeralds until that yeah that makes sense cool great man thank you tsunami wallet we're gonna bring up the next team to the livestream which is the wall No - I read I want to show you my screen - Madrid thank you very much for permitting us to be hacking money let us send the wall we are two competing Iniesta specialized in finance in Madrid and we have built an idea that is a decentralized diddle of fluffy short mainly is a crypto fan that tried to profit from this kind of spike moments that happens into space I will have seen price discovery doesn't work we were in crypto market is not so efficient to attract liquidity when we see irrational leaders price and that's become maybe because liquid is scarce maybe in the eternal well known and it's not so much connected and with volume you can really put prices at levels that are very very rational and sometimes it is returned very fast - the fundamental price for sure that will be a price that will be fundamental but sometimes out of spike movements and that's mainly because it's very cheap to move the price so it's the Croatian profit product and for an environment so little happens sometimes we're lending protocols have been liquidated here in flash loan should be to have liquid even for free this price effect for some time sells in that kind of moments and the question static is stake audience that Commission have Commission for every trade for sure profit from that volatility and high volume usually even we as he needed stood trial in order to to organize like this kind of capital in order to avoid original price what we occurs in the from the mcniel and the issuance of makita foundation with a magnetar stop so they will try to make profit from that the kind of spikes and in some way they'd they try to make more expensive to move the price because it makes sense that we would call the sinner short and we know that they are out of capital right now sitting on protocols like compound Ave that they want to erase they won't be too exposed to interest rate but probably if they believe in the project and they will be willing to take about inserted price will probably willing to buy even at eight dollars how do we define like this kind of ground and setting prices where we are going to buy and sell in order to say in this kind of extreme positions we are going to do it in that way as my contract we will have this investment in its additional protocols of lending with low risk and would serve eight but we are going to put this ability in balance when we see an expect moment and take profit that in that moment that that can put a feeling to be at 800 dogs so in our demo we have seen we have to dedicate an environment where we can really have this kind of simulations and that that's that's where we are we are right now so you simulate in that case we assumed rate and attack the price with the fact we will put the devalue probably 19 put liquid in that moment so we stopped the price in 173 aren't even we put 9% of commission so we profit a lot and we will defend the price in that in that case so really the main conclusion with that is basically that it's possible to do and it's my contract that my control really can be mostly invested in in interest rate in every component without freeze but we can trigger in some way this liquidity to put to buy in some kind of instruments and we put in a commission of nitrous anymore that means that it doesn't care about the Commission so you can even to be more cautious commissions so next step will be to do it for different asset if you do buy and you don't want to oversell and tomorrow to study more efficient way to move liquidity from that thank you very much ok if I understood it correctly it's basically it's it's an interest yielding money markets except for massive price crashes or a specific price that you specify before and then it just buys eath should have fault you know or certain to a certain price is that it yes not what is really it's try to like to have the Calico Critter fun like can put liquidity if you are willing to do it in certain price of the moment instead provided acid so to move very efficient in a balancer and to profit in the straight in that with high volume occurs with this especially so just just try and understand here I'm trying to follow out all the different bits and pieces so basically you use like compound as your Oracle effectively to see okay if the price of eath is dipping then you have some trigger set somewhere to buy ease and so is that triggered by a person then in this case or anybody right bouncer yes right now we are right now looking for the balancer price because at the end we are going to buy imbalance after the price but I've hidden in the future we will see like a options like set protocol we will see like an option balance adoption you know that that people can really balance as fast as possible because okay in that moment speed is very important so we are going to pay for people who were parents in that moment with the first we will be paid for that so in the case of bouncer could you have those than the the weights then would dynamically adjust to kind of encourage the eath purchasing is that the kind of ideas that you have some some small contract covering that yes we think about balances you can put either equity dimes in that moment and it in so it's like you are buying in reading so you can put your balances like Maury in capital you know that you you do you can put a lot of us do are to buy and with that kind of configuration you can manage that in order to put the equity in that moment to buy your glasses okay great well thank you so much the wall and we're gonna move on to the next team bring them up on the livestream and that is block sheets welcome to the stage just uh give us one moment folks just trying to get them onto the live stream here okay looks may have lost connection I think we're just going to move on to the team after that if we can just promote them to the the live stream in one second so just hold on everybody for 30 more seconds and we'll keep going okay welcome and above from project parcel we'll let you take it away with your presentation you okay folks continuing to run into a few technical difficulties here as we make an adjustment on above can you hear me right now it looks like you're muted okay okay and if you do have any jokes now it's certainly be the time I drop you there yeah can you guys hear me yes yes thank you sorry about the last-minute change there I do a video you're gonna share with us yeah sure I start over great all yours demo for partisan parcel is a service which allows users to deliver my children quick when above looks like you're not actually ring referee oh okay so just use the use the share screen option in the bottom of the zoom menu make sure that you click share audio and then will be able to see your video great demo for bouncing parcel is a service which allows users to deliver multiple transactions in one click where my I am on above I am locking developer at bike on me what I've built I will to service which is called parcel which lets users send ether or tokens to multiple addresses in one single transaction how it works it uses patch transactions for multiple calls so there's a four loop running over a hash called a double is calling different contracts we have used units of p2 individual for swaps what that means is if the user has come with each let's suppose and he wants to send I to someone else we use Yunus work or to swap each to die and then send it to the recipient also has integrated compound an hour for d5 so what that means is the bill to customized pass transaction system where users can come and build their own money necklace perhaps some tokens and send it to multiple places in one single donation now so I'm gonna use okay let's address let's send MDR to this address as well start to postulate let's confirm the transaction transactions in successfully the transaction has been confirmed and as you can see the ether or swap to die and M cured and sent to the recipient address which of course of action is to integral DNS to make it better and clearer for the users and also to go token agnostic or meaning that right now it's supposed city Liam as the main currency we want to be able to support every token the users can come and send any tokens and swap and get any tokens to the recipient and obviously the plan is to go domain and so on feel free to check down our cell is like on and thank you so much for your time and question for my side just make sure to make sure I understood it so I only that wallet only had eath in it and then that transaction basically went to Yunus what board I bought em kr and send it to the destination addresses is that correct that's correct and you can do it for multiple addresses at one n one single transaction like first of all how you denote everything in East I think that shows your needs max will us having that is the base fixed currency this this dispatch transaction is now very common amongst a lot of different wallets but yeah I do think it's interesting and that we're talking about sending these this money to many different recipients at once do you see this being tied into sort of like being triggered by say a prediction market or do you have a sort of broader vision for this kind of this social these these multiple transaction things sent out these batches yes is that a good think of I think the plan is to open source it so that defy community or the gaming community can use it so for gaming what I thought was let's say game or game owner wants to send multiple tokens at once to all the players so they could use that for the if I think that there could be a lot of use cases for wallets and other defy protocols could also integrate and use it but to precisely pick out I don't think I have any specific use case in mind so that's why I wanted to open it one other one other I guess question or perhaps is more suggestion so working on pool together I found that we've now been trying to optimize a lot of these withdrawals from protocols because we have say for example you know six different deposits and compound that we all want to pull out so we effectively batch them into a single pole which then we then can distribute as we wish because we just saved hundreds of gas so I do see there there there is something valuable here in the sense that if you're sending all these different types of tokens if you can collapse those into single swaps or withdrawals or what-have-you do you think there's some potential there to kind of abstract that so that might be an avenue worth pursuing is you know and it's something that you're already looking like you already kind of working on so yeah there may be something there yeah the idea to build a bit of front and after after the hackathon and let people come and do multiple transition at once so working at buy economy and we send payments through crypto and VR a team of eight people so I think yeah we could I think utilized a service instead of you know sending single transactions to eight people we could use that in save gas also it's more calming convenient than the usual process mm-hmm you know you might want to have a look at say blur as well for streaming payments I feel if this is me is kind of batching possibility there as well or some kind of integration so yeah it was looking at that I was looking at that but did not have the time to look at it completely but it's an interesting prospect yeah great okay thank you thank you parcel appreciate the change around there just for everyone on the watching the stream we've just got two teams left to present so we'll bring up the next one now block sheets welcome to the stage hello everyone uh I'm sorry about that I had some bad technical difficulties um beyond that um my name is ty Cooper I am the greater black sheets I'm just trying to know hold on um my computer is frozen can you guys still see me or hear we can hear you but your video is frozen same thing you want to share in your screen or maybe we could try and play your video for you yeah played a video for me um that'd be best because I cannot move my mouse at all in my screen here what so I can't see anything will cue that up and just roll with it thank you well everyone this is the introduction to block sheets it's essentially a all of your assets right into one you know spreadsheet it's little bare-bones right now but here's the main application so when you come here you want to make sure you have meta mask installed which I do here and then when you connect the meta mask it's going to show up here and then all your token balances are going to be sitting right here there's still some more added features on my ad as far as um getting a CSV file I haven't people be able to export their balances and so much more and if you don't have metamath so let's say I open this up on so let's say you I don't have metamath and I open up on um a browser then I could just go to a nother address here and then I could juice into the address here and get toki balances for those addresses so that's essentially how it works in a nutshell and then if you want the recent transactions you can press get transactions or if you already have it connected here you can just press this button here and then is just going to load in the recent mm-hmm most recent transactions it's gonna take a bit because this dress has a lot of them but you can see as they load a torso that's how it goes very very simple and lightweight okay I'm just gonna say that was a lot better than what I was about to do so yeah and then I can share my spirit actually updated quite a bit so I will a somber I was actually a little more enthusiastic I don't know most you know but I was actually getting hacked while I was making the video because I made I made video Sunday night and so what right when I had uploaded code github and pushed it updated everything I was getting hacked so I was getting notifications being my gmail that I was losing a lot of money but I had to stay strong and make the video regardless of that I'll show you the updated version of it so you could already see here project lightly reference I got my little 15 seconds of fame in decrypt and getting same thing occurs already got address here so that way I don't have to go scramble so you just want to add it here and you get token balances the idea behind it was for people to be able to auto generate all auto loads and all their tokens that they'll have associated with the wallet and for some reason my meta mask at I don't know it was working perfectly fine until just today it just everything broke regardless of that people are able to connect meta mask and load in all their token balances via the address and not only that address the attempt was to be able to get all of their other addresses jiménez but we're having difficulties executing that as well and one last thing I want also want to add into was for people to be able to calculate how much eat or how much of their dress was at a particular point in time so I have a graph of their portfolio per se or this address portfolio just to move automatically show and update like that and that's it that's the application stuff not too complex not too spectacular in a sense but just something simple for people to use really any questions so it's like a lightweight kind of like eat first scan like personal ether scan for my for my addresses precisely yeah cool it's a it's lightweight eat this game because one thing I like either scan but it's just so much to consume all at once but this is supposed in a sense is your own personal eater scanner so I like the idea around tracking your the history of your portfolio I think that's kind of interesting I think you should look at the graph protocol because they have a really interesting feature now or you can just tell it what block you want the the data from and so you can essentially code it as if it's real-time so then you have the most up-to-date data but then you can go back in time at any point with the block number it's pretty cool one other question though how so I might have missed this but how do you detect what tokens they have what approach did you take right so I was having difficulties with that as well my my initial idea was just that have a lightweight JSON object with the top 20 top 200 tokens and if it detects a balance above zero or the checks that that it's a number because there's also issue if you input it and fill it just returns not a number so I was going to lightweight approach to the ticks that's why I have pre generated tokens right there if it detects that they have tokens above that amount then it'll just automatically show those and hide it the rest in the sense that was the initial approach but I'm still trying find ways to do it automatically awesome Thank You kya glad we're able to figure out the technology difficulties there and we're gonna bring up the last team now for today's judging session and the last team for any of the livestreams little finale on Tuesday please welcome potion insurance the stage hey guys good to meet you we're very excited to introduce you to potion a new way to insure yourself in d5 please meet our team christian on ux gilliam on contract logic and finance fabian on front-end Kristin on the back end and Jordi on financial engineering this is what we did we built the first perfectly priced put AMM system it's based on black Scholes pricing and Ummah priceless articling potion introduces three key innovation first it uses a single pool of collateral to mint puts off any strike expiry or insured asset second from this single pool potion is able to write insurance on any asset whether it's crypto assets like Bitcoin maker link etc or field assets such as gold Tesla the S&P 500 etc thirdly potion uses black souls risk neutral premiums settled with Ummah priceless technology achieving risk-neutral pricing for both buyer and seller let's see it in action welcome to potion in this section of the site were able to buy put insurance potions first I connect my wallet as you can see we're able to I put contracts on several assets let's say I want to protect my maker position I want to get three contracts strike 300 expiry let's say three weeks from now to make a potion i unlock my diet notice that I'm being asked to pay 63 died as a deposit for this potions unless there is some crazy volatility I should be able to get back some of that since I'm buying three the total amount is 190 go ahead great the potion has been created okay now I go until my potions section of the site Here I am able to manage my potions you can see that I have one potion here that I just created let's try to exorcise it I select the quantity I want to exorcise 3 let's pretend that the price has come down below the strike so it's now 200 so we should be able to withdraw $100 the system is asking me to stake 5 die I will lose this money if the values I provided are disputed and the dispute is successful the liquidation went well and now I'm able to withdraw the money after the liquidation the amount you see on screen is the combination of the hundred dollars of each of the contracts plus all the volatility that we overpaid at the beginning after this withdrawal I will have paid perfect black salt pricing perfect the withdrawal was successful this is how pricing works at minting the user deposits a worst-case scenario premium deposit at liquidation or expiry the option is priced with the actual volatility observed during the life of the contract using a black Scholes risk-neutral approach the difference between the premium deposit charts that minting and the black Scholes premium calculated that liquidation is sent back to the user resulting in effectively perfectly priced black Scholes put contract to hang it's super cool potion uses Yuma's priceless aura clink system during minting or exercising the user is able to freely submit pricing data sponsors actively monitor this prices when the prices are fine no Oracle needs to be called resulting in savings in transaction costs and time if the pricing is wrong sponsors are able to dispute the pricing and invoke the humans human DVM Oracle to produce a neutral price and settled on action fairly Unchained users risk losing money if they are disputed and so they're incentivized to always use correct prices future steps include getting price identifiers approved by Oba demise the gas consumption of the Minter create a UX for the liquidity providers slowly liquidator bots deploy the protocol on maintenance and as new assets are available as price fit cinema add them to the platform you can check the system life at potion dot financed and reach our documentation at potion get booked dot io we're very excited about everything that could be built on top of a general-purpose put a mmm system we very much look forward to your questions so guys looking for to your questions so basically at the end when you know what exercise it's busy the less volatility there was the more money I make or how visit maybe just like simplify load but like how these how these options work yeah so they work exactly like normal options so you have a strike and like the question you asked earlier like if the price of beef is two hundred and you buy an option with strike 150 if the price goes down to 100 you will be able to take 50 out of the contract okay the innovation here is that normally with options the premium that you pay for the insurance is calculated on expected volatility because we're in the present and I mean shirring up into the future I don't know what the future is going to be so we have to kind of work out what volatility is gonna be we do it differently we basically take a deposit from the user we wait for volatility to take place and when you do have liquidation at that point we measure what the volatility was and we work out what was the fair pricing then someone should have paid had he known what volatility was going to be but because we do it at expiration we actually know what volatilities and then we can we call it perfectly price that put option understood very interesting very cool thank you thank you well I just want to chime in here I thought the presentation was great and I really liked your interface I'm still trying to follow along um as to you know just finding out what a put is to begin with yeah so you want me to try and explain super simply yeah if you've got an Eli I've even less so than les says that'd be great of course of course so it's just totally regular insurance so say that you have Bitcoin or maker or link and you're concerned that prices are gonna drop you can buy a potion insurance for example you could buy potion on Bitcoin 8000 and then basically you start making money when Bitcoin goes below 8,000 it's that simple and you can think of it as an insurance policy the cool thing is that these insurance policies fully loaded on chain so if I'm giving you insurance on Bitcoin going below 8,000 I'm going to be locking 8,000 on change so you're guaranteed that you'll be able to cash back that that policy if if price goes down and the other cool thing is that you can do this on any asset and you can fully customize the option on what limit you want to choose so that's why we call it like an AMM because if this is a contract that you can always go to and it will always sell you an option you can choose any parameters and it will produce an option for you how does it work on the liquidity provider side yeah so my risk Nicki what what risk am I taking as a liquidity provider so as a liquidity provider basically you're taking a position on the market like if the market goes down then you're likely to experience losses if the market continues to go up you're basically collecting yield because you're collecting the insurance premiums that people are putting through so liquidity providers are playing like a yield game on the expectation that prices are going to go up but that's it right now because it's it's sort of pooled so I don't know exactly when I'm gonna get stopped you know when I pay or not I just it's just roughly if the price is going down I lose prices go up I win that's right that's right and because we're able to write options across multiple assets and across multiple limits and so on you're basically diversifying your risk so we think that the experience is a liquidity provider it probably rest less risky than if you're just exposed to one asset interesting so it's similar the pooled risk pool liquidity provider model similar to head Jake which had some challenges and okay yes that's right that's right in fact originally we wanted to buy to build a perpetual header we wanted to use hedging options or open options to create a perpetual insurance product the problem we found is that the solutions don't scale very well for liquidity providers in particular like open for example there are not that many markets right like there are put options at 200 or 180 and if you need something else you kind of stock so that's why we wanted to build a general purpose option writer you know that was efficient for the liquidity providers but also predictable for the users you great well this concludes our demos for hack money I want to just make sure that I correctly highlight pad over the past seven days we ended up demoing 118 projects from this hackathon and with this thing I want to congratulate you guys to do the last demo and and I think this is a political project in general and so far we've seen so many amazing things don't when I just make sure that we get to thank every team that took the time to work on their projects for the past four weeks everybody from those 45 different countries 18 different time zones and just generally being available to to work with this on on the schedule whether these are our judges or our hackers that were mentors all of you make this possible and I also want to give a special shout-out to theyíve global teams that also put the same amount of time and to make sure that this event goes up to our our goals and standards and I think we can safely say that this was a mission accomplished so with that we're wrapping up that judging for AK money entirely today and be sure to tune in to our finale which is this coming Tuesday from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. Eastern were we doing all our top projects and we'll be following up with all the teams in the next 12 hours with respect to who the finalists are so we'll be sending a discord message in an email and we'll kind of continue that and let the next two days to prep and make sure that everything else goes smoothly for the finality so thanks again to our judges thanks again to every hacker who participated and with that we'll see you for our next event and I hope you have a great rest of the evening
