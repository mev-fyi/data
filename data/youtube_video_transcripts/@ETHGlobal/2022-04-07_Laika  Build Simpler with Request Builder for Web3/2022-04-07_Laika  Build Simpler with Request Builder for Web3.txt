get started here real quick i'm joined by my friend natha khan from uh leica uh he's gonna give a quick intro in a second uh i've been requested to tell you that we'll take questions at the end so for everyone just joining us now feel free to post your questions throughout the presentation in the zoom chat below and we'll get to them right afterwards he'll be handling questions uh right after the 30 minute segment um but without further ado i i would love to hear more from you not to come the floor is yours yeah thanks a lot luke thanks a lot for introducing me i'm going to show you my screen real quick just so you guys can see my screen yeah uh well i have something to confess before we're going to start this workshop my internet was quite bad today so uh please let me turn off my camera during this session all right so [Music] so yeah uh i just want to introduce myself again my name is donna don from like it uh leica is a team best of from bangkok thailand we are builders from thailand and we are building a product called leica and it's a basically a request builder with progressively i'm going to show you the interface of lighting real quick as you can see that interface looks similar to what postman or what hops gosh or what insomnia have it been used used to working with that before leica is actually a request builder for smart contract you can use leica to making a request to any smart contract that you want to connect to on any chain that support evm so this is a really really basic idea of liger and what like it was built you can just you know just open like it and making a request to smart contract without having to write a single like code and if you used to work with postman before uh like is really have a family uh family feeling of that when you're using postman so i think you're going to have a really short time period or very good time getting started using leica and for the next slide i want to you know just to just to briefly tell you why we're using uh why we're building a lighter and what is the reason that you should use like it so like it was built to solve one problem and one that problem is uh to making a request to smart contract we want to offer you a really simple experience when making a request to smart contract and by simple i mean that you can use leica to improve your development workflow on local network on on live network just imagine that when you working with some smart contract on a local network like maybe you forking some mainnet into your local machine and just want to quickly checking some smart contract and you just don't want to write a code for that you can just you know just just open like it and connect to metamask and you're kind of good to go you can just query on any smart contract that you want to use and for live network you could also use leica to making a request to all the smart contracts on those network you can use flyk on any evm compatible chains you can use it on ethereum magnet you can use it on any l2 that support evm like optimism like polygon or iotum or other chain that was evm compatible like uh our launch or phantom or anything that you could imagine and yeah i think that i'm talking for a while and i think you may wonder that hey uh the either scan could do that too or maybe remix could making a request to smart contract too that was a question that we've been asking a lot so yeah actually like it was meant to have a sole purpose of making a smart contract request really easy so when using like it you're not going to have an experience of opening a lot of tabs of each scan just to making a contract request to a lot of contract and every time you open remix you have you may have to you know just setting up your workspace every time but like i would also like it would always saving your smart contract request so you don't have to do that but yeah i just want to say that i didn't mean that like it was a better tool but either scan in both remix was a really really great tool but like it was meant to have a sole purpose of making a smart contract request easier so yeah the thing that i just yada yada just uh earlier slide which just wasn't just really came from me we have been launching for a while and a lot of people have been using it and giving us a lot of great feedback that we used to building like it and to improve like it all along the way and so i just want to you know just uh i just want to ask you and i just want to tell you that it would be really really awesome if you try and like it out and maybe if you try using like and if you look like it please give us a feedback because we really really welcome for every feedback and we're going to use it to improve like in the future so yeah uh i just want to stop my slide a little bit and go ahead to the leica website you can you can go to like a website by clicking uh by entering this address on your browser the get like that app think too quickly let's get like that app on my browser and you're going to see our landing page where you could just uh exploring around what we have to offer but for this uh purpose of this workshop i'm going to go to the launch app button real quick to just looking at what like i have the first time you enter like are you going to see something similar to this but i already uh connect to leica before so i'm going to see that i already connect to leica but you're going to see something like this let me click disconnecting you're going to see something like this so uh the first thing that i encourage you to do after enter liger is to connect to your wallet you can choose to connect with metamask or choose to connect with web3 provider if you want to working with a intruder or alchemy or something but for this session i'm going to pick metamask and after you connect to metamask it's going to show you the address that you're connecting and the chain you're picking for this uh for this session we're going to uh exploring this smart contract which is a wrap ether smart contract on corporate so i'm going to picking kofan from this all right so after you picking your decision connecting to your wallet you are pretty good to go to using leica using leica was really easy as i told you that it was similar to postman if you used to work with postman you're going to find yourself like you were at home here uh i'm going to click some method that you could making a request to like uh the first time you enter like it you're going to see the example contract that we generate for you this contract was called like a testing contract it was a really really simple counter contract they could you could just query the counter value in this counter or you can just use an increment method to increment the value that discount is kept i'm going to quickly send the transfer send request to this method and you're going to see the result down here so what i do is that i'm making a request to this like a testing contract with the method of count and you can just do it all by ui you don't have to you know just writing code for that so it's it's a really really easy way to making a request to smart contract and yeah uh as i told you earlier that we're going to looking at the wrap ether for this session so uh let's uh i'm at the edit scan for now and the contract that i'm going to exploring for this session is a wrap ether smart contract it was a esc if you don't know what rap is it was a erc20 compatible this if you have a native currency you can transfer your east into this account to minting a new wrap either that was esc20 compatible so this contract was a really really simple contract it's going to have all the functionality of the erc20 token but the special thing is these two functions called deposit and this function call with if you want to you know just minting a new wrap easily what you have to do is just to making a request to this method and transfer your ease to this and this smart contract will maintain a new wrap is for you or if you want your is back what you have to do is going to withdraw from withdrawal from this contract using the withdrawal function here and this is basically what wrap ether that i'm going to explain in this session was so uh let me quickly copy the address of this and get back to live all right so uh well just get back to wrap easily again let's say that i want to making a request to this function total supply function what i have to do in like is that i'm going to click new to making a new request so i'm going to pick new requests here and put the request name and as i told you that i want to making a request to total supply so i'm going to name this total supply with the collection name or let's see down hit create to create a new request and you're going to see this request popping up and what you have here is basically a request builder tool that you can just put things here to making a request to some place so as i told you that i want to making a request to this smart contract so i have to copy the the address of this smartphone track and put it here this is the the address of the smart contract that you want to making a request to and i want to making a request to the total supply so i'm going to type the method name here total supply with the state mutability of bill because total supply was was really and it doesn't require any parameters but it's going to return us unit so let's put it into like it it doesn't require any parameters so i'm going to leave this empty but we're going to need a return so let's add a returns here and let's pick you in and now let's quickly making a request to this so you can see what uh what making a request to smart contract it's going to feel like i'm going to send and you're going to see the result that like is making a request to this contract of this method and what i see is a total supply of the wrap ease but it was in the word unit and sometimes where you knew is quite hard to interpret so uh let me introduce you to another function another feature that built in with lighter that's going to help you just that so i'm going to hit the converter tab here and choose the converter to be unit and i'm going to copy this into this like you also have a unique converted built-in so you can just sing and you can just uh it could help you interpret the value of that request easier so as you can see that like it is convert this really large number to this 876 000 ether which is uh which means that this wrap easily have a total supply of of this number right so that's basically how you making a request yourself with like it but yeah i i just think that when you want to requesting to a lot of to a lot of method on the smart contract having to you know just creating a request yourself every time might not be very convenient we also have another feature built-in that's going to making a request to smart contract really easy and that was in here let me pick new and piction explorer here well leica has the functionality to import the avi of a verified smart contract from either scan so if i i were to pick in this address and put it in and i'm picking the chain to be open what i do what i do now is that i want to making a request to the easy scan just to you know just import it api from this contract and if i press import what leica does is that it's going to refreshing the api that was already verified from from either scan and it's going to making that request in like automatically so i'm going to hit importing and it's what you're going to see leica is going to import all the function of this smart contract so you can just easily making a request to it without having to making it yourself all right so let's making something uh exciting more exciting than this query for the total supply i want to mean wrap easily for myself but firstly let me make a query to get my balance first so i put my address here click save as you can see that after i query from my valance with this address which is the address of my wallet what i see now is the uh is the balance of rabies in my account which is zero because i don't have any rabbi's in my account if i want to have wrap ease in my account what i have to do is to deposit my ease into this smart contract using this function so let me put my if real quick and i'm going to hit send and what i do now is that if i hit send i'm going to send my youth this um i'm going to send 0.1 ease into this smart contract and what i expect is that i'm going to have wrap ease in my account of c with a value of 0.1 after this transaction was finished so let's quickly click send here all right and yeah just just as i said that what i expect is that after this transaction was finished what i'm going to see is that if i uh yeah it's already finished but what i expect to see is that if i make a query to this balancer function i'm going to see the different number not the 0 that i saw here so let's make a request to this and as you can see here that i have a different number of wrap keys in my account now let's copy this to verify it was really 0.1 east so let's convert the tab again pick unit and here as you can see that i also i am now having 0.1 repeats in my account so yeah this is basically how you're using leica to making a request to smart contract as i told you that it's going to have some similar experience as when you're using postman or author request builder but we i just want to quickly show you the other function that we have provide if you're making some if you want to making some requests to smart contract and after you finish with the ui and you just want to use this code maybe in your test script or use this code in your in your i don't know your bot or something we also have a code snippet feature that you can just copy the code and it's uh like it would all like it would will uh auto generate the code that you can just use in your uh in your notejs or something yeah uh yeah before i wrapping up the workshop i want to show you the feature that we've been working on and it's a feature called scenario request it's going to look something like this just imagine when you just want to having a request of a lot when you want to making a request after a request of a request or when you want to plan into you know just making a lot of requests to some smart contracts and you want to make a scenario of it we also have a experiment feature called scenario request that you can just planning your request in a flow chart and it's going to work something like this let me walk through you walk you through this scenario real quick so the first thing that i do is that i'm making a request to get the balance of my account and i'm putting my address as a parameters and then because of it was a view function it going to return me some value so this value i i am going to assign that to the variable name my balance and after this request was finished i'm going to this condition and checking as i said that after this finish i'm going to store the value into the variable called my balance and i could exit that value by uh adding context dot after before that and what this condition does is it going to comparing my balance to 0. if my balance were larger than 0 it was going to take this case but it was uh smaller than 0 it's going to take in this case which is a it is taking this case that means that my balance of gravity is more than zero what i do is i'm going to withdraw all of my rarities but if it's not it is going to this case what i do is that uh i'm i don't have any rabies in my account so i'm just going to uh making a request to get a symbol of this rabbit so let's quickly running this if this was uh really really worked i'm going to hit start here and it's going to make it all right this is going so quick let me confirm the transaction alright so when after i finish making a request to smartcon to this method of balance off and i've got the return submit what it does is that it's going to starting this value into the context table over here with the key of my plans and the value of this really large number and after that it's going to this condition and it's going to compare this number to zero and this condition obviously hold true so it's going to this uh this branch which is is going to withdraw all of my wrap ease balance and you could kind of you know just uh looking at the transaction details here and yeah i what i expect is that if i press this button again what it does is that it's going to this route instead of this route so i'm going to press start button again and you see here that it's going to this route instead of this route and the value might balance its update to zero so yeah this is basically what scenario request is going to look like let me getting back there was another thing that i want to show you let me get back to the landing page go to the documentation and using hot headlighting if you're using contact in your project to making a smart contract we also have a hard hat like a plug-in that's going to help you syncing your con your contract to like it so you don't have to making a request yourself and this feature is uh also in the experimental uh state but that was that was really cool to try i encourage you to to try and it's going to work something like this let me show you to give i have a hard hat project on this side and i'm going to run some script here and after i run the script what it does is that it's going to syncing the api to the leica so you can just import the api and you can kind you can kind of making a request through the ui without having to write a code and this it this would be really convenient when you want to quickly uh testing some you know some small function or something right yeah uh let me get back to my slide again to wrapping up everything i have said i know that i've been talking so quick in this session but feel free to ask me any question after that so ah yeah like it would help you to making a request without having to write code this is very convenient you want to quickly shin changing some code and want to quickly test it and also you can use like it to uh you can there's a function there's a feature in leica that will allow you to making environment variables so you can reuse it again in your request in the future this feature is called environment rival where you can just you know just define a new variable that you want to use again like you see here i assign i just i just defined the variable of uni swap token and it was the value of that address and they're just reducing again and again like it is also this this is what uh the the the hardhead like it was like is also offer you a seamless notice request experience where you have your where you have your hard hat and you making some change to smart contract like i would like i would have ability to auto thinking that api to to like it so you could just quickly make a request to and this feature called scenario requests you can kind of plan your scenario or plan your request and making a request after each request with just one click away and not just a lot of large feature not just a lot of huge features we also provide you with a lot of small feature to help you making smart contract faster or just have a better experience working with smart contract i show you the converted tab that i just convert the value boy to to ether and i also show you the first snippet i just quickly show you the cursor in the bed and there was another function that i haven't showed yet that was a function called nodes this feature is going to help you uh like maybe when you building a lot smart a lot of requests and you just want to quickly noting something you can use this note feature to do that and yeah i think this was about all of my half a day i i i think i'm i'm talking really quick on this session but feel free to ask me any question if you want to ask me let me open all right uh so that was uh that was vg he asked me can i not call public custom function that actually caused gas as i'm updating this contract uh yeah well actually we did not support that yet but i think there was a way to do that and that way was that you can just  some minute into your local machine and making a request to that on your local machine so you don't have to pay a gas for them thank you for uh excellent presentation i think that was a a a great time to mention if you if you have any questions i highly recommend uh continuing the conversations in discord it's a great place to meet with everyone uh including him um and and continue those conversations um if no one has any more questions i think we can wrap up the session here but i want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to ask feel free to throw some questions in the chat real quick and we'll get to them that being said i think you you did a great job explaining everything yeah it's clear everyone i got all that got all the information that they needed so i want to really appreciate i really appreciate your your help in this session uh we're going to be closing a session right here i want to thank everyone for joining us um and good luck hacking yeah thanks to everyone
