foreign [Applause] [Music] Ty of the smartest developers in the wet 3 ecosystem the first youth Waterloo started out as just a kind of manic obsessed kind of passion project what kind of was clear to me and a bunch of my friends at the time were we had a bunch of students that wanted to learn and build things and a bunch of companies that wanted to either hire them or test out their products we in fact we put on Reddit this post saying hey this event's gonna happen it's gonna be amazing and it went to the top of Reddit R ethereum we've got over 2000 applications in like a few days and we didn't have anything prepared we didn't have a building we had no plan at all and yeah we just got all these people showing up and it was just like this amazing kind of flash point in the industry's history this is our third time back in the last six years since we started in 2017 and I couldn't be more excited whenever I go to the hackathons I just I'm going to see if you're going to higher quality of technical efforts cryptokitty has came out of Youth Waterloo and there's a lot of other examples of just big things that started off by being hackathon projects so I mean I'm always excited to see what's going to come out of this one I was here for eat Waterloo 2019. it was cold in wintry but very charming and cozy at the same time this one just feels at least three to four times larger and everything's bigger it's better it's more exciting like there's a lot more tooling that people can use and speaking to hackers like the diversity of projects has also expanded quite a fair bit particularly for this event 47 of the people are brand new to ethereum and that's incredible because we have almost half of them who are developers but have never done anything in smart contracts or just in wet three you can see these as a playground when you got experiment with your ideas peer-to-peer interactions it's it's just amazing you can debate with other teams you can debate with sponsors share ideas the feedback it's it's like close you know and since we are here you take all the advantage you can I think it's really exciting that there's so many people here who want to work in public and share you know whatever research they're working on I guess my favorite hacking someone is probably my first hackathon because I feel like I learned the most during that time that was when I literally knew nothing about web3 and I came out of it being able to deploy smart contracts and build like an end-to-end app the best hackathon products are the ones that like when you see them completed you're like amazed that you even did that in the 36 hours today I'm really excited to just you know see what the latest and greatest is at one of the most exciting hackathons for the ethereum space in the world we've seen so many like essential projects get started at youth Global hackathons and I think they'll continue being the case the people that were here was crazy a lot of a huge Amazing Ideas I love hackathons they're great I think it's great uh introduction for people to understand what's going on in the space and to get a feel for the ethereum community in person so it's important that you know they happen globally everybody has to start from somewhere so just remember that and remember that at some point everybody was here for their very first time as well to think that East Global now has been able to onboard just about a hundred thousand developers into the web3 ecosystem is is crazy so um it's it's far more successful than we even initially envisioned it and uh it's pretty it's pretty surreal to be back here and seeing all the folks that that have come back and and the new folks who have never even been to Canada before and who come here just because youth Global is here and and they'll follow youth Global wherever hey Global Waterloo
