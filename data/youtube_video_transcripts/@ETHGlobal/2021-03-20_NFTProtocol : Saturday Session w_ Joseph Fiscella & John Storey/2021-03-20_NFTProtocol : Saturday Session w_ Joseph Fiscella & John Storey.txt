everyone thanks for joining us today for this last talk today and uh we're ending with a great session with the nft protocol team we have joseph fiskela and john's story sorry if i'm sabotaging your name with my french accent and um yeah i mean everyone if you want to ask any question please feel free to ask in the chat here on zoom or in the youtube channel and you will be able to find any further conversation in the sponsor channel on discord if you still have questions after this one hour with the team i let you take it over thanks hi uh hope everyone can hear me just okay um i'm joseph from nfc protocol i'm here with john my colleague and we are developing a few products on top of nfts our website is nft.org john's going to be walking through it a little bit on a screen share but i just wanted to give a little background on myself i'll let john do his intro and then we'll do a little bit of intro on nfc.org so i've been in the space since about 2012 was mining bitcoins and litecoins uh with solar power energy got really involved in the development community back in the day on bitcoin talk uh helped out with some altcoins and programming in the bitcoin space i've been part of the new york city bitcoin community since the very very beginning which is actually well uh back in the day it was the biggest uh meetup group in the world when meetup groups were still possible and that's just kind of like the beginning of the story i've been working this space since then just full time and came across block party which was originally a nft for ticketing company and block party kind of focused more directly on nfts for art and began creating a marketplace for nfts early last year and now nfts are much larger like the market's much bigger and we're able to make something like a dex on top of an evm chain which we're going to be using ethereum and we're going to expand to binance probably the whole eco chain phantom as well as other chains that are not avm based like flow and cosmos so we have a lot going on i'm not going to go too deep into details i'll let john introduce himself and then we take it from there sweet thank you hi guys yeah um kind of getting into the space i first got into it from a friend in 2013 but didn't really start coding in it until about 2016 when i learned about ethereum and uh got really interested in the smart contracts and this idea of code as law and a lot of the work around like organizing groups of people and the ideas around dows really kind of brought me into the space and uh at that time i was a web developer working just at a e-commerce sort of a platform and messaged a whole bunch of people in the space and found my way working with um consensus back in the day working on a few different products for accounting and then for like tokenizing real estate stuff and anyways i just been working in the space and uh yeah took a little break a little personal break um a while ago and wanted to get back in and then was really intrigued by like joseph was talking about the work that block party been doing on their vision with nft.org and the protocol and uh like yeah kind of basically everything he's been talking about the uh expanding to other chains and and spreading just a a decentralized marketplace essentially for these nfts it's really a uh it aligns very well with um my motivations in the space so very grateful and uh and excited to be working on these uh these tools and these products awesome thanks john uh actually i think you're uh your screen is set up for screen sharing so maybe we can go through the nfc.org uh website and take a look at some of the products that we're building okay yeah would that be um sorry my uh my computer is not set up for screen sharing right now okay perfect thank you do you do you want me will you just direct me where you would like me to go to and i can uh yeah let's do it that way that seems fine perfect cool so this is our site nft.org and let's go to docs check out some of the stuff we've got going on uh so basically i'm not going to read anything off but what i'd like to describe here is the fact that we have voting we have a swap platform that's launching soon and we have an index and staking kind of program so the first thing that i'd like to talk about is actually the voting platform so if you're familiar with snapshot.page this is a off-chain voting mechanism that everyone uses in the crypto space kind of in line with john was talking about earlier where you have a snapshot of all token holders and they can vote on specific initiatives that they want the development team to work on and a lot of these initiatives are proposed by community members and then voted on by hundreds of different people who own nft protocol tokens and the reason for this is that we want the network to be completely decentralized and even though block party is the lead developer and the issuer of the nft protocol token eventually the treasury and everything inside the treasury and all the decision making should be completely decentralized in a way that the protocol perpetuates itself and lives on as an nft enhancement protocol on top of evm and other blockchain chains so one way to do that and pretty much the the best way to do that is to organize decision making into some sort of voting mechanism where by owning a certain amount of tokens it gives you a certain amount of votes you can even stake your tokens to have a larger uh percentage of a vote or to like boost your voting power although that isn't live yet on our protocol it's something that other decentralized protocols like curve are using we think that's extremely important so as far as like what nfc protocol is you know this is really the base layer of what we're trying to do we're trying to create something that perpetuates itself is a true protocol in the way that it just lives on as a piece of tech it doesn't have a decent or doesn't have a centralized point of failure such that everything is completely decentralized all the decision making is decentralized and that's really why nfts themselves are valuable because you have a thing that represents a single item or like a group of items that isn't fundable uh but it's still tradable as an erc20 or like a bitcoin is tradable and you have all the decentralized properties of that you know permissions trade and the security that comes with the ether you know whatever blockchain it's on so in line with those philosophies we've built nfc protocol to live on as something like a thing that can exist alongside nfts and really make sure that they perpetuate the same use cases and the same philosophy that you know the erc721 standard was released with so we've done a number of proposals before actually the the original staking contract was written based on a community proposal so this is just one way that we're making uh the community more involved in nfc protocol but also making sure that there's no central point of failure because nfc themselves are like owned on the chain so we want to keep in line with that uh so that's that's our voting process and how we plan to be decentralized uh if you could please go back to uh let's talk a little bit about our decks so one of the things that we want to do with nfc protocol is create a fully featured dex and dexes exist like openc and wearable technically you can you know they're web 3 apps you can log in uh they're decentralized in the way that you can trade with them and they use the evm they use the ethereum network to actually uh facilitate those trades but what we want to do is create something that's more philosophically aligned with how a web 3 application for nfts and nft trades should look and what i mean by look is not only how the experience feels when you're using it as a user but how the architecture is created such that there's no central point of failure and that there isn't any central control over the list of nfts that you see or the trades that happen so one of the really really easy wins that we've added and no one has really been looking at is otc trading you know if you're part of the nft community you might see like 10 to 15 nft channels on your telegram pop-up every day with thousands of different messages and these are for the most part people trading collectibles and trading art and like discovering art discovering content that they like to consume that's being produced as nfts and this is just increasingly increasing so one of the things that we're doing is facilitating these ogc trades if you look at a lot of those telegram channels people will buy it in nft and then they'll dm each other and trade with it but that has the problem of who trades first right if i'm sending one each to somebody to buy a piece of art uh either i have to send the eat first or they have to send the nft first then one of us can disappear and that's a problem that we can solve with crypto and in fact has been solved for erc 20 or c20 trades with air swap so what we're doing with the nft decks on nft.org is making an otc channel where you can have a private trade between yourself and other person and that's done with using an allow list so you can as a trader create a trade an order and send that to somebody uh put them on the allow list and then you'll be able to trade with them privately so in the alternative scenario where you're using wearable or something like that you'd have to post your nft publicly and then anyone with one ether would be able to buy it whereas in our case you have a private trade uh you can send them a link directly to the trade and then they'll be able to to take it from there without anyone else having authorization to buy it from you so we're facilitating the need for these otc trades that are happening on telegram they're happening in different areas of chat and we're basically creating a dex that allows the use of that i see a question came through on zoom uh when you are trading does it do it off change so there isn't the same level of gas as the ethe network so we're actually going to be deploying our decks on three primary networks maybe four um that are evm based and the three that i would like to start with and we think are the easiest wins are ethereum binance smart chain and phantom network so as you know phantom network and binance smart chain are evm compatible so it's very easy to deploy code on ethereum and then also deploy it to binance and um and phantom and actually about 12 hours ago andre the creator of yearn he released a um documentation on how to get like cross-chain trades between binance smart chain and ethereum and phantom network going on multichain.xyz which is a urine product so we're gonna be working with that product to make sure that oh yeah you can you could pull up multi-channel xyz actually um if you'd like uh thank you so this is a web3 app where you can transfer assets between different chains so to answer the question about gas on the heath network if an nft exists on the ethe network and you'd like it to be on a different network these bridges that allow you to transfer swap aspects between one chain to another these will pretty soon facilitate nft transfers um yeah the site is a little bit finicky if you're not logged in uh but if you go to tokens you can actually see that the token list pops up with like a bunch of different assets you can trade but in any case like that's yeah you can you can trade any of these tokens from one chain to another uh actually looks like they added will be there if you look at uh about halfway down with any swap there's ethereum kobe and phantom for any swap so yeah it's hobi's ecochain is something that we're looking at as well so this is all to say that we want to expand as many l1s as possible and beyond evm chains we're looking at flow and cosmos which also have really low gas fees and are supporting nfts i think flow is the biggest supporter of nfts uh as far as l1s go in fact the whole chain is based on that so yeah we're thinking a lot about gas um and in fact in april there's going to be an ethereum upgrade which actually increases gas costs so if that gets through uh the gas costs on the ethereum are actually going to go higher so we're thinking about you know for our users that are collecting a large scale of collectibles that have a lower price point it's going to make more sense to do it on the hobie eco chain or on phantom for example or on finance smart chain the next question from youtube was endows i participated in community members can make proposals in community however the team decides what gets put in core for an official vote which can be limiting how do you balance team and community involvement that's a good question there's actually a proposal right now that we're probably going to decline because uh only one person voted and it's not really in the ethos of voting to just have one person vote with like a million coins so i think the community should come to some agreement and have some guidelines on what constitutes a valid vote right if one person votes yes with 10 coins or with a million coins and no one else votes is that really something the team should do and i think this is a property of off chain voting so you have all these like snapshot page pages and you have these like suggestions that the team should go through uh you know being part of a lot of these decentralized communities in the past if you go against a community vote and you know there's backlash your token value goes down you know you lose confidence in the community you're actually undermining the voting process if you go against um what the community has voted for and in the same vein if someone like tries to sneak in a 12-hour vote like at midnight one night and they're the only person that votes yes and they try to point to like hey like this initiative passed well you know you have to reasonably assume that that is something that is not really like a legitimate vote so there has to be some uh human element to this and i think that's really why dials are powerful because it's not just code is law it's like well you have to deal with the community you have to make sure that the community supports the decisions that are being made and you could use the voting as a guideline now once that gets into on-chain governance and people are voting to facilitate a chain with tokens it becomes more important to set those standards that i talked about so maybe you need like 12 different people to actually vote to cast a vote for it to be a valid vote uh plus you have different things like uh for example compound the compound creators have a veto key and they can veto any vote that comes through no matter how many people voted yes on it so there are different like trade-offs to implementing those features for voting that i think dao's are working on right now and in my opinion like this dao concept is still extremely new and in fact one of the things that we were going to talk about is uh another feature which is going to be gallery.nft.org which is going to be basically when you find a piece of art you can make it into an nfc and then sell the future like option on that nft becoming sold via the creators like you find the creator and find like you know the authenticity that they created that piece of art and then give them like the opportunity to sell it as an nft they might not know about it or they might not know that you know someone has already like pre-purchased it uh and then the issue there is what if they say no i don't want to have anything to do with this like delete this you need some dow or is like some governance like process to revert the transactions and also you need a governance process in the case that they say yes to authenticate that they're actually the creator of that nft so i think we're still really early in dao's and like making sure that everything works in like a decentralized way like decision making and a dao uh and you know we're we're kind of pioneers in that right now it's still a young concept um but yeah that's there's a lot of trade-offs there depending on how you give power to people how much like voting has power based on tokens what kind of veto rights others have uh and i think it's just something we're exploring and it's gonna be more uh it's going to be bigger in the future i have a lot to say about daos but there's like three more questions there that i'd like to answer um so is it possible to mint off chain and then trade via nft protocol onto the chain so i never to pay gas yes actually uh john you want to take this one with block party i know we've been working on minting you're closer to that than i am yeah yeah we're we've been working with these flexible minting structures so that people can mint um not on on one of these uh basically on a side chain or on a different chain and then only when you want to do using ethereum as a essentially like the settlement layer or the source of truth when you do want to make one of these these jumps i think that's that's what you're trying to get to but at some point you will always have to pay gas um when selling an nft if you want it to you know reside on aetherium or whatever chain you're using now i feel like we've looked at different like zk roll ups and you know ideas for how we're going to make that feed lesser but joseph you probably have opinions on that as well but for right now our main focus hasn't been our main focus has been in spreading to as many as possible and and making these bridges to evms and then letting users say oh yeah okay i want to be using this just on the binance smart chain or just on another chain and it's kind of up to the end user in the projects that are involved to really drive that is how i've been looking at it yeah absolutely so we we have a centralized platform called block party and that would be like to answer andrew's question the off chain protocol where everything is minted originally and then the user can choose to withdraw onto ethereum or withdrawn to flow or withdrawn to binance machine whatever we implement in the future so in that way you're not paying any gas costs that you wouldn't want to pay so what that means is if you want to pay the ethereum gas fee to withdraw your nft onto ethereum then you can do that if you don't want to do that you can just keep it on the block party system and resell it or you can withdraw it to binance smart chain or some other layer one that we're integrated with and i think john also touched a little bit onto layer two we are aggressively hiring for nfc protocol and recently we're in talks with hiring somebody who's been working at mutablex which is a layer two for uh nfts and we're looking at integrating that into the text as well so we think that you know the nfc protocol decks will have these really chain specific and uh like crypto native features whereas if you look at a lot of our competitors it looks a lot like ebay or like a web shop that you would normally see um and you know they have one website that has like you know their front end and it has like the links to the latest uh pieces of work but who decides what gets put on the front page right who decides which of the items are like the hottest items where is that information stored and we'd like to think that you know they would be eventually decentralized in that way but we're going to take a decentralized first approach and make sure that the dex is as simple as possible to run on something like ipfs or run on something like our weave or you know even see a skynet to give it a decentralized architecture from the very beginning uh because we think that that's like the super important part of this yeah i think to follow up on that question does it work on flow uh currently we're looking at getting some cadence developers onboarded so we can port over the decks of flow in fact it shouldn't be too hard to get that running uh we're just worrying about evm chains at first because there's so many of them uh and then flow will be something that we're looking at in the future we do i think we have a full node running on flow don't we as part of our our thing so yeah we know them pretty well um yeah thanks andrew i'm happy to answer the question um so yeah i think that's all for the questions for now um can you go back to sharing your screen i think it got cut off uh i was explaining it i believe i was explaining the decks we were going through the new interface that you created thanks so john's created this really beautiful interface for swapping uh nfts for erc20s or enots to eat uh and we think that it should look something like this where instead of having like a super big gallery of like millions of different fts you have one trade for what you're doing uh and it's as simple as possible and you just get to use the decks and get in and out and that's it so we like to think of this as a very specialized tool for trading nfts and giving as many features on top of that like concept as possible oh this is a live page yeah did you did you want to try like the live demo yeah if if now is a decent time for that it's risky yeah i mean totally up to you uh you know live demos can go but i i think you were working on i'll let you take it because uh you're working on this this morning yeah this is a live demo and um right now this isn't i guess um everybody that's on the call that you just bear with me um for these types of things um we have basically some of these contracts and i'm going to be using one that we've deployed we're actually running this on uh rink fee also and so this is um something that's already been deployed and let me make sure i have my this looks great is this a replacement for the multi-page thing everything's on one page i just put them all on the same because it was like i was having to jump around so yeah um let me make sure that this guy so i'm checking right now to make sure that yeah token id that my current guy owns this and so essentially i'm gonna input in um so this first address right is the the token address and then the id of the token i'm gonna trade these right now don't have like token uris and information that go along with them they're pretty bare bones tokens i've just been using to test and develop against so yeah pardon that but i'm going to trade it for token number one which is owned by another one of the accounts um so yeah when i create listing great let's see so in the in the uh in the full running version of this once we're totally live you would send this url to somebody and be like hey i created this listing and it would pop up with the images i think what john said is that we didn't send any images for this test because it was just testing functionality but essentially it should show you like hey this is being swapped for this and then you click go and it works so that's what we're building towards right now um and yeah the interface should look something like that yeah and i'll uh yeah it will um i'll keep going through this so this first pop-up is for to do the approval um and then it starts basically we just it'll be pending for a while and uh right because this is going to be the approval for the dex to be able to transfer your nft on your behalf um then after it's successful we pop it up again and now this second one is for the actual um transaction listing so when this happens this will be to start the uh the actual transaction what it's doing right now is moving that token into the escrow contract and then putting as a requirement to be able to get that out um the the this second one the output the what you're expecting to receive is kind of payment for that first one um then it gives you this link to this would be essentially the link that you get to share to whoever you're doing the otc deal with you would copy it and of course it won't be localhost it'll be at the time what we're actually using in production but um when you come here it comes pre-loaded with these um with the addresses that you're doing the swap for and this will probably end up looking different to to show a little bit more like hey this has already been created and but for right now it's just uh like read-only inputs and if you were the creator of it you actually have the power to cancel it which will essentially void the contract and uh you will be able to you'll receive your nft back and the listing will be closed but right now i'm going to transfer over the person that has or the account that has this uh the second address is this first guy so there to fulfill this listing it's going to do the same it's going to ask to do an approval we're going to have to wait for that to mine in the future i'd really like to get it where we kind of do they've started to do like approve alls and i am slightly curious to hear from people if they think that that's important to do right now i'm manually always checking for the approval of that token and not necessarily trying to do like an approve everything and then check to see if it's been approved and but that will save on gas fees of having to do you know a second transaction if at very first there's i mean ideologically you could get behind you know is that really responsible to do an approval some people do when doing erc20s you know you'll approve for a million tokens even though you're only planning to do 10 or 20 just so that the debt the adapt doesn't have to continually ask you for your approval to transfer things but there's the other side of me that really likes the safety involved or just that process of okay i know it's always been improved before and it's a little bit more um i guess like uh from standard anyways so we're going to confirm this and this is going to uh fulfill the transaction and this enables the decks to transfer on your behalf the nft and so what happened is that one got put into the escrow and then when it gets fulfilled we approve the decks to move this one back to the original owner and then the dex transfers that first one back to the other person and just like that you have a successfully uh filled trade and we can verify it by going to the actual contract and making sure that the dex isn't the owner anymore of any of the tokens they should be yeah owner of zero tokens and the owners of one and two have swapped um let's see is now this guy now has one when before he was he owned the other one and uh we're working a little bit this has been an interesting page um starting to go through like the actual listings and and create like somewhat of a record of what's going on um this definitely needs help right now these aren't um accurately displaying but this will be a useful place to be able to start creating like indexes or start creating like lists of you know essentially like a transaction log of what happens on the decks so this is a yeah kind of um very cool if anyone's ever used tornado cash they also have that like previous uh previous transactions that go through uh pretty cool to to actually see that happening thank you for the demo john that's actually great worked well um and uh yeah i can't wait to get those images popping up like if we start doing demo yeah and and we could have i mean if we go to like something if somebody even wants to it does recognize other like if i go to open c or something where's my little oh so if you put in the content oh yeah yeah if i is there one on in the dm let's see if somebody has a uh something that's on mainnet i don't think so i think you could find one though uh while you're finding it i'm gonna answer these questions in zoom uh so on the dex topic could you set up a private trade where someone trades more than one nft for one of higher value uh the answer is yes so we started very simply with one nft to hero c20 and one in ft to one nft but we're looking to expand to 1155 and erc 1155 is a standard for trading collections so once we have collections logic involved we can also add multiple single erc 721s which are just one thing so yeah those two uh those two upgrades will come at the same time but yes it is possible to do that and it's on our it's on our feature list uh and then there's another question when doing an nft swap uh whoops i'm doing the mcg swap is there a way to check whether the asset of the nft is decentralized i've been worried about if they have in an aws url etc then they can take an image down and have a useless nft yeah so there are two things two concepts that this touches on the first is that like what are you actually buying when you buy an nft right are you buying the image file are you buying like the assurance that it's going to be online forever and i think that this comes down to information asymmetry which means that like the customer and the consumer has to either be guaranteed or they have to know the guarantees of the system so for example if the creator of the um of the nft guarantees that that url will live forever then they either have to do that work themselves to make sure that the aws build is paid or they have to use a system that is paid to do that work which for example would be something like r weave or ipfs with file coin or cs skynet so the best way to check would be to actually go to the token metadata on a block explorer like etherscan or anywhere that you can see that metadata like i think on openc or wearable you might be able to find that and check to see where it's hosted so if you don't want to buy nft that has its data hosts on amazon then you just reject any entities that have their data as uris pointing to an aws url and then the second part of that question is is it useful that or useless that you know you bought an nft that the image doesn't resolve well maybe you saved the image when you bought it and really all you want from that nft purchase is to have the image like saved on your local computer and then you also have the autograph of the creator sending it to you so that's really like what a lot of people are buying nft is for they have that personal connection with the creator that says well you know if i get a signed copy of like hey let's say uh boxing gloves from rocky right then really i'm paying for the autograph i'm not paying for the boxing gloves it's probably a mass-produced pair of boxing gloves but those pairs of boxing gloves they were signed by sylvester stallone so to me it's valuable because it has the autograph and you can think of the digital signature on the blockchain as the autograph that gives you the authenticity that it was produced by the creator that is what's valuable so yeah is it actually useless if an aws url goes down maybe it depends on what you're buying the nft for um but like i said you can check to see if it's decentralized or not based on that data uri and there are multiple ways to find that i believe openc even our decks you know like john was showing the listings page you can drill into the nft and see exactly where the data is hosted for it but for the most part i think people are buying that chain of authenticity that says that this nft actually came from the creator and i have that digital autograph so yeah good good question there's a lot it's pretty deep concept um you know there's even the concept of authors being able to change the uri so like if the image is popping up as like a cat image and then it changes to like a picture of a rug then you know that's you know is that considered a scam right uh because you actually bought the thing but part of the code was that it could be changed um so there's a lot of different things that go into like what makes it nft useless or what makes it into something that could be changed um it could be that the website goes down it could be that you know the data itself was changeable by the creator uh anything like that could be programmed into the into the contract so you have to be careful and the only really way to know that is to either adhere to a standard and make sure that the standard is you know being followed or to check it yourself so yeah it's a little bit of like the the classic trust versus verify scenario it's a pretty pretty uh well-known trade-off uh okay so there's another question here sorry go ahead yeah i was gonna say did we touch on the the doing uh multiple multiple trades of multiple cards because i i just i guess i wanted to touch briefly on that because we have been thinking about adding in 1155 support um as definitely on the roadmap and i think that that will be really powerful to be able to have that functionality of doing like kind of batch and you know multiple cards and there are some other ways to do it um that cut immediately come to mind around like wrapping and creating these you know kind of there there's been a little bit of work in the space around creating like um baskets of nfts you know and say putting them all into something and then being able to say okay yeah we're going to trade this for this kind of like sets um but it's definitely on our mind of how we're going to do multi uh like multi-collectible swaps as well yeah for sure uh i think the 1155 upgrade will come along with like trading multiple ufc 721s i see another question here would it be possible to set up a party session where a bunch of people trade cards between each other would it be possible to make it like chain trades cards as in nfts that's a cool idea i hadn't thought about that like maybe you have a group otc session where it's like three or four people are authorized to trade between each other and then they can make they can construct like well two people trade this for the other three people's thing uh that'd be kind of cool uh i haven't thought about that but it's definitely possible and i think that you know to simulate the real life i think what you're getting at is like when you go to like a real life meetup when you're trading cards you're playing card games uh you often have these groups where people are trading together i think it would be cool to make that into a blockchain based system where you can do the same type of trade you would do in real life at like one of those events uh that's a good idea i like that it it makes me it reminds me of like playing monopoly where everybody has like the different trades and you're all trying to get like a you know your your monopoly but you need this person to trade with this person in order for them to be happy to then be able to trade this card to you and i could see that being a really cool um you'd essentially start giving out all these approvals of like potential trades that are worthwhile and what would be interesting is to see like when one of them hits it would like trigger this chain and it would it would close other people's trades that then wouldn't be able to you could have like multiple you could give multiple approvals to different people to be like hey if you can you can figure out how to get me this card i would give you this one or if you can figure out how to give me this nft like anybody can get me a cyberpuck nft can have access to any of these nfts and so you can like start doing conditional uh chain trades that's a cool that is a cool idea just wanted to touch on that i used to sell people insurance in monopoly how did that work what was that uh it was interesting just take their take their pasco money and then like if i had to pay luxury tax i'd pay for them oh that's cool yeah um there's another question here you mentioned it being changed from a cat to a rug but if it gets changed to something let's say not safe for work that's something you absolutely can't want to happen so is there some sort of security so yeah right now i think uh people don't realize this but uh ethereum standards are very loose you really only just have to implement like the few functions that are in the interface and that is it so to make that into english like an nfc is valid as long as it can be traded pretty much and it isn't the case that the url for the image file has to be the same so what you would have to do to prevent something like you know not safe for work content being posted you'd have to do one of two things either have uh let any nft through to your website but have a curation standard where people are employed to curate the front end so that those unsavory images are not displayed or you create a new standard that mandates that those image links are not changed and you would only accept nfts that can't be changed onto your decks or onto your website uh both are possible i think the first one's a little bit harder to do but the second one is a little bit more limiting because you wouldn't be able to accept most of the nfts contracts that exist today uh allow that change to happen um so yeah uh yeah the magic card trade that's exactly that's exactly right hey um by the way we are like in our we had mentioned in our keynote there is a 1000 nft prize for the best idea for the decks uh i think that trading card idea is winning right now so if anyone else has a good idea the thing is is something that we could do with the decks that others don't have please let us know um you're now in the running for 1000 nft protocol tokens um yeah and touching on uh andrew's question of could you put the contracts in escrow so during the time limit no one can do anything with their nfts while they wait for into individual peoples for trades to go through that is um exactly how the uh the dex is working so there's not necessarily a time limit which that would be an interesting functionality to add of it going through but really at the end of the day i think we would want the issuer of that listing would have to withdraw anyways like we probably want to do auto transfer for them um it would just be up to them to come back and cancel the listing and then they would then receive their nft back into their their possession um and i'll go on this other uh this other one says you mentioned something like a marketplace would it be possible to view someone's collection and make a trade request this is actually um we have a collector that we've been talking with um that actually really liked that that functionality of being able to view somebody's and and like offer trades so yes you can definitely offer them it hasn't been on our immediate road map as we were talking about with joseph we're interested in otc but it's definitely come up in conversations of having kind of like a user profile and you can see different collectors and be able to like offer you would have to you would essentially create the trade the other way around so you would offer what you what you wanted or what you had to say hey i'll trade you this for this and then you would probably have to contact them directly with it being fully decentralized there is a little bit of like how these people get contacted right like how do you contact an address to tell them somebody wants to to purchase something from you or what joseph was talking about earlier if somebody finds like a piece of art and say hey i want to i want to do this how do you find sometimes you know a creator or somebody um that brings up other interesting questions but uh very worthwhile to to think through yeah i think actually open c has that functionality where like it tells you if someone's offering external eath for your for your item um so we we probably want to take those features and you know add on top of them so i think it is possible to do that any thoughts for governance as nfts catch on with the adverse problem with on-chain metadata that is copywritten yeah so this is i mean this is something that like dc has been struggling with right where uh their artists are creating nfts and they're selling them for like absurd amounts and then it's actually contractually dc dc comics like intellectual property um and i'm not familiar with the zach schneider job but i'm assuming you're talking about this this issue where like someone who's totally the illustrator of like a comic um but doesn't own all the ip started selling it uh selling these things and you know proliferating this data and just making money off of it and um dc got like mad about it right and they released the statement and they were like stop doing this um so i think it's good it forces the issue it's sort of like bitcoin being uh accepted by financial institutions right like what where do you draw the line when you have this new concept of who can trade what right and the restrictions of like what can be traded are lifted uh people are going to start trading with each other and it's up to i guess really just the community to decide what's right and what's not and if contractually there's some obligation for these artists to not do these things then it'll be litigated and if it becomes too it becomes too overwhelming of an uphill battle for let's say dc to fight against all their artists selling because i actually know that marvel does not have the same uh restrictions so artists that work for marvel can do one-off sales of like wolverine and stuff and it's totally cool there's no there's actually like a stated uh allowance for them to do that and so you know maybe people will just start working for marvel more than they work for dcs and artists will will stop working for dc um i think that's sort of like a problem that's solved by i guess the market right the free market but really it's just what what do we accept as like a society uh to be valid or to be fair for the people that work for these big companies uh and i think giving people the facility to trade and actually run into these issues head-on is a good thing so yeah i think it is sort of a problem right with with metadata and copyrighted data and something that we're trying to solve with with a dow where we have like auditors and speculators working together to try to find the price for something that like is identified but hasn't been verified yet and then you have like a certain amount of uh those dow votes go to authenticators who are like appraisers and things like that so yeah it's it's pretty far in the future but i think uh as these issues get kind of weighted through in the in the meantime we'll figure out how to get through it uh if the assets weren't sorry go ahead i was gonna add to that one of the things that i really like about the uh i guess the crypto space is this like do your own research or you have a lot of power you hold the power as the consumer and as the user and so even going back to some of those questions about like oh is the url mutable can they go back and change it it's like up to the consumer to say i'm not going to buy that nft because it's not it doesn't conform to what i want it to be and i kind of feel like the same thing with these uh hey if that's something like nobody can stop somebody from minting something like i could go in and take a mona lisa picture or try to you know tokenize all banksys things or go in and like nothing can stop somebody from doing that it's up to the consumer to say oh but i'm not gonna buy it because like uh i don't necessarily maybe agree with the way that it was done or and to a certain extent almost circling back to the off-chain proposals that we were talking through um with like the legal stuff it's like the technology i i kind of feel like technology is never going to be able to solve all of humans problems you know humans are still going to always be able to to use any technology for two things right you create a gun and a bullet and it's going to be used by all the different sides that want to be able to use those things and so there will continue to be legislation and continue to be problems that humans have to solve rather than the technology solving um i mean we can we can build in standards and things but um that's part of i think the beauty of the technology platforms is it's kind of open and then we as a society get to determine what we like to support and what we want to help push forward yeah i like that analogy so gun can be used for a lot of things right you can sell it buy some vegetables feed your family you can use it to rob a bank uh it's up to you so yeah tech powerful tech has implications for society i think that that's the bottom line and that's it's cool to be part of something building that follow up to the uh like the legal issues and the copyright uh just as a matter of you know our company being semi-centralized with our block party centralized marketplace um we do have access to a lot of really expert copyright lawyers and just people that have been involved in looking at like art law for a long time for better for worse and they're giving us a lot of good advice on how to navigate that field in a way that like a decentralized network could be compatible with the law um and just having that insight is really valuable so just wanted to touch on that really quickly and that's that's from our ceo vlad his connections are very strong in that space so it's it's it's pretty much um sorry i think my internet's unstable right now but yeah that's that's some advantage that i think we have uh another question here is that if the assets were on ipfs then there'd be no way to take them down so i think there's a lot of misconceptions about ipfs so i categorize the decentralized data layers into two different categories there's the sla category which in tech terminology is a service level agreement so that's like for example i pay amazon 120 a year and they get that money from me to provide a service that they guarantee for a year right and that's their business so we actually have ipfs and ceo coin uh doing this sla type business on chain and they're basically like hey pay us our native tokens and we'll promise to like host this data for you for x amount of years right x amount of months or this is the amount of data you get for the amount of coins that you pay um so i think that's really cool because it's a blockchain based sla which is like divergent from you know a contractual sla that you would get from amazon that lives in like the web tool world um i like the blockchain based ones because they're decentralized they have like you know permissionless properties they're more connected to the marketplace because like those tokens are actually valued at what the value of the sla is so like if you're uh valuing the ipfs like network as a whole higher than the price of filecoin goes up or if you value the skynet network like higher than ipfs then the skynet ceo coin price goes up and then the problem with that though is there isn't really a guarantee that all of your data will be there because it requires this ongoing payment and who the question becomes like who's paying for that rate so you can build an nft system where like every trade a percentage of it goes towards goes back to like ipfs uh in the form of filecoin and using uni swap you know it can just be part of the protocol that like you pay percentage goes into uni swap gets traded to file coin and then like you have a smart contract that drops it right into the bucket and it says like keep this file going right and then it could perpetuate itself like in the code forever um i haven't seen anyone doing that by the way that'd be kind of a cool idea uh and then the second category uh outside of the sla data storage is something like r weave or actually a network that i've worked on previously called flooringcoin where you pay up front for forever file storage and that's more of a guarantee that things will be there down the line so i think arweave is probably the biggest name in that space they get conflated a little bit and i mean it is at a high level a data storage network that's decentralized but uh you know they are separate in like the visions that they have and like the use cases they have so yeah i would take a look at r weave if you're thinking about something like uh data permanence versus ipfs which is like lively data that's like right now being accepted and being uh being produced and i think that you know probably ipfs and r we've have a lot of overlap and maybe they'll eventually like add the features uh that you know each other have and maybe they'll be like one to one compatible down the line but right now that's the philosophy split and the way that i look at this is like you know flow the blockchain the flow blockchain which is dapper labs like cryptokitties blockchain every blockchain can facilitate all the features of every other blockchain right there's no reason that bitcoin can't have smart contracts but really it's up to the community behind bitcoin you know a lot of them decided we don't want smart contracts on bitcoin we want it just to be a dumb rock that transfers value and you know what that's great because when i want a dumb product that transfers value i'm going to use bitcoin but when i want something that's specific for nfts then i'll go to the flow blockchain i mean really if you look at flow versus ethereum they're both smart contract language blockchains that have the facility for these different types of trades but everyone that's developing on flow has this idea and this philosophy of like perpetuate nfts as much as possible that's kind of like the whole point of it when you go to flow you're going to get like a wallet that facilitates entities better you're going to get a community that's like thinking about entities and what can be done with nfcs and you're going to get like the whole community behind ideas that make nft trades and things on top of energy as possible so yeah the difference between our weave and ipfs there is like one of them is focusing more on providing the service that's like lively service and the other one's more focused on a uh data storage and data permanence uh category so that's that's just like how i look at that um a lot of people don't know about the uh the uh the options there but a lot of it is just keeping up with like the development updates and the specific pitches that people are giving and actually the way that the code is written i think philosophy and code is super important so when it comes to like you know bitcoin versus ethereum or are we versus ipfs or flow versus cosmos it's really important to think about like how the community of developers and like the support that they get from from the different people that are involved and what direction they're going in yeah exactly so if you value your entities you have to be sure that doesn't go offline yeah i i think it would be kind of embarrassing to show someone your nft and it's just like a four or four link right like i spent 10 eth on this and it's just a broken link uh that would not be good so yeah i think that these networks have to think really hard about how to actually provide data permanence uh and you know if our weave becomes that standard then yeah and yes you can have ipf actually you can add multiple links right so then it comes down to how does the display read those links like does it try one two three or does it know to try one two three or does it just go to the first one uh it's an interesting problem and yeah you can pin an ipfs uri on our weave wow you just blew my mind i didn't know that uh very very cool and yeah i i figured eventually that they'd have some overlap right so i haven't kept up with it too closely but when you think about how to solve that problem there's a lot of ways to look at this guy as a link to ipfs.com that's hilarious so there you go so yeah as we're talking about it it already exists um i think that that's that's awesome it's good to see that they've they've thought of this because it is it is an issue that people are having today cool i'm gonna check that out actually give a little give it a bookmark thank you for that uh yeah that's i mean i think we're coming close to the end of the session here i just wanted to make sure that uh everyone is aware that we are giving away 1000 nft protocol tokens as a prize uh we've got some ideas coming up here like different types of trades that you can do we can also think about how like the dow should be structured and yeah if you guys want to follow up uh send me your e's address in um in discord or in the zoom group chat uh we can we can have like a collaboration of judges to see who gets gets that prize awesome thank you so much for uh the talk and the presentation is there any we have like two minutes left is there any more questions uh that's the last call before we wrapped this up i see one just came in it would be cool to use the decks as a prize pool like multiple parties place an nft into a pool and a winner of a draw or an external game like competitive match with the pool that would be kind of cool you know actually chain link has a verifiable random number generator so it could be like a weekly thing that we do a an nft lottery and then people put in like you can stake an entity to win more entities that'd be kind of cool uh something that we could use chain link for just as like a decentralized sort of lottery system it would get uh that could like promote a certain user's art let's say we have a creator that wants to promote their art we just feel like hey win this lottery you get this you know picture of a cat or something from this creator then everyone would like place their nfts into the lottery and we would choose randomly based on the chain like oracle that'd be kind of cool i like that idea well thanks everyone and um yeah please the the chat here will be erased so if you have anything that you well i'm not sure if it will follow up anywhere so if you want to keep on chatting with uh the nft protocol team please go on the discord channel in in the event discord channel so this is pretty much it i think unless there's something else you guys want to add otherwise i'll thank you very much for this beautiful talk and for all the questions that you guys uh contributed yeah i just wanted to say thanks catherine for sending this up uh with heath global and just having us uh giving us this time to talk to the community and uh thank you thank you everybody for the suggestions and the feedback it's been really great awesome thank you
