hi I'm Veronica Kutz um I've been in crypto since 2017. I work for office for post-time Packers I would give the advice of actually plan out what you're going to build before you build it don't just rush into building it it does not go like well like that um and also leave time at the end to actually pull together your project into a real presentation really try demo the product that you've built but also really emphasize where you're trying to take it you know what is the grand of vision that you want to build after the hackathon judges love to see that you're actually thinking about building a real product and not just a one-time hackathon
