planning on talking i'm just here for the show it's gonna be a show i don't know if zoom will be able to handle it i'll find a way it always does all right the stream is good cool i think we're gonna do um video off for everybody else who's not being interviewed just so for the live stream and everything it looks like uh more of an interview setup if that's cool well how did carson you oh wow that was so cool you like shut off your video but your background was still there somehow it was fancy disappeared into the version cool let's see uh still a couple last minute people joining so we'll just wait like another 30 60 seconds or so also andrew i assume the live streams and everything going well yeah it's good andrew i need global confusion all right sweet maybe we'll just get started here uh awesome well welcome everybody good morning good afternoon good evening no matter where you are in the world um we're excited to be here with uh textile team and uh with andrew and sander in particular um you know textile's been uh you know one of our key sponsors for this event and really providing you know just a ton of technology some we're definitely going to talk talk about in the next couple of minutes um just to all the hackers so that everybody can can build super easily on ipfs or filecoin or or what have you so uh really thankful to have them uh we think that they're gonna level up a lot of projects um and you know ultimately that's the the best way that they can help out so really appreciate that and of course if you have any questions about uh any of the anything as you're building with their tech um feel free to drop a note on their channel um and then they've been super responsive so thanks again for being super responsive as well so it's been uh you know awesome having you guys at the event um so yeah so uh purpose of today's chat is basically um just get a little bit kind of behind the scenes look i guess if you will on on kind of how textile got started uh you know what you guys are working on um future the current the the new the old um just basically get an idea of kind of everything about textile and have a little bit more of a kind of in-depth look beyond just the tech level that everybody i think has been interacting with so far um but kind of get a sense for for where we started and and you know how we got to where we are um so yeah so intros aside um i'd love to maybe just dive in um starting from the beginning in a way um maybe starting with andrew i'd love to kind of hear a little bit more about you know sort of like uh your your kind of early stages of your of your career your background you know um you know if you went to school like what did you study and and also what were sort of the first couple things you did um in that transition period yeah sure um so i don't know where to start i mean i guess uh so i i guess i university i studied biology i got my phd in um biodiversity informatics and uh i don't know it's kind of like very easy to thread the needle when you look back to see how you end up where you are but i think it was a pretty not obvious path to where i where i am now however when i when i was studying biology um one of the one of the areas that we were working on uh was how to turn data into information more quickly for science so how we could understand environmental change uh how we could uh understand human impacts how we could under understand um uh extension extinction and these big topics where you wanted these big data pipelines and you wanted to be able to crunch them very quickly and turn them into more and more layers of information um and what was really cool is we were working on some networks uh that at the time were really touching on some ideas that i think this community is is getting at now so a really interesting one uh is how um is how the natural history museums were collecting and connecting data sets they had this interesting problem because all the national history museums at say for example um at universities they had these historical collections of biodiversity data so the actual drawers of say birds or beetles that scientists had gone out in the field and collected um sorry there's a bit of a diversion because you asked but i'll get back to where i ended up but i think it's a really interesting thing so so basically um as biologists those are those are some of the best data we have for historical biodiversity because they're actual points out in the field that people collected and we can look them and we can tell um you know exactly what species they are what their characteristics were and so when i was starting my phd it was during this sort of peak period of digitizing that information which actually was a great opportunity for nationalist museums but also represented a risk because if you think about digitizing one of their greatest values which are these collections and putting it out in the world for free what then is the value for the museum anymore and so they started building these networks that were federated networks where the actual museum would be responsible for curating and hosting their own data and then it would it would move up through the federated network to these different um thematic collections and gateway portals to search and find that data as scientists with one of the top ones being a directive of the un called the global biodiversity information facility gbif it's still out there it's a really great institution and so they were just struggling with a lot of the same problems about data interoperability like what sort of community standards what was the future this data once you connect it all and i really started digging into that and being very interested in a lot of those problems early on um i ended up having a side project um that was always there which was i was very interested in how science was communicating to the public and how we could make that better and i got really into data visualization uh in particular mapping um and i was sort of i had a foot in both worlds of um evolution and working on phylogenies and biodiversity and looking at mapping and niche modeling and all those things and that's actually where sandra and i first worked together sam and i were friends before we started working together but we got a small grant from the national science foundation and built a pretty awesome data visualization tool back at the like advent of basically you know html5 and canvas based rendering and all that good stuff um but so so i but i got more and more into the data visualization and i went and um had some friends that started a company that they wanted to build better mapping tools for scientists and researchers and ngos and they asked me to come join that company and so we built a startup called cartodb uh now it's just called carto.com i spent five or six years there kind of wearing a lot of different hats everything from like marketing and growth and uh engineering and and eventually really focusing on research and where we could take back to that question of where we could take data and extracting information from it and at that point sander and i got back together and we're like we should figure out what we want to work on for the next 20 years you know and uh and i and i really liked the process of building the company from scratch i really liked those early years and so ended up back here working on textile with sander very cool and i love asking this question just because kind of the diversity of backgrounds that that people who come into well web3 have um it's just always astounding to me so phd in biology that's seems kind of a little bit far away but i love how you kind of brought all that together um maybe same question to you senator i'd love to know a little bit more about uh you know what what your early days and what you were working on and then we can touch on that part where um you and andrew came together and started talking about textile yeah um well i actually went to school for mechanical engineering um i grew up working in a machine shop and i did that through college and then in my engineering studies i came in contact with a professor that really got me on the software track doing like matlab numerical stuff and from there i just um kind of sort of a long story how i ended up as a pure software person but i kind of stayed as a hybrid working up until an electric motorcycle company called mission motors and this was back in 2009-ish and it was a about a 50-person company of just hybrid of all different kinds of engineers and i started getting really into big data and electric vehicle telemetry and i ended up doing that for quite a while and then building some some big systems at other companies as well and then yeah andrew and i started talking again and i was feeling like you know like a lot of people do at larger companies where you can start to be kind of like a cog working on these large systems and i just felt like i really wanted to have more of an impact on people's well-being like in the in the moment and so i started getting really into like quantified self and thinking about tracking personal data and all this stuff and having no really idea about web 3 or you know early ipfs days or anything like that so around that same time andrew and i were talking and trying to figure out we knew we wanted to do something together so just trying to figure out where to make try and make an impact um and we we took a couple different initial starts but we eventually landed on this this um this the same sort of problem that we had been scratching our brains with realizing this huge community had already been thinking about this for a long time and had made big strides in this direction of you know how do we enable technology to continue improving our lives by solving real problems and by you know taking insights about ourselves and turning that into value but doing that in a way that protects um protects you from you know just the engines of advertising and all that kind of stuff so still a huge challenges there obviously but yeah it's just a really really rewarding fulfilling things problems to think about so cool yeah that's about it awesome and what did those kind of early conversations uh look like between you two like uh were there kind of other ideas you didn't pursue you know obviously you you settled on what textile is now but um you know like what were some of the kind of those early conversations and discoveries and you know maybe if this leads and also like what what your aha moment looked like with with crypto or with web3 in general um if you could touch on that that'd be great too i can take a stab at that and then if you want to fill in anything i miss here sander but probably just really briefly basically uh i remember actually like one of the earliest conversations center and i had when we were trying to figure this out was that because i was working in the mapping world we were working with a lot of different companies that were trying to figure out what to do with their geospatial data in order to drive their next business decision or figure out the next product feature or whatever and so i started having exposure to data sets of real people moving around the world you know where you could zoom in on a map and see more or less some resolution time scale dots of people moving around and i remember sandra and i talking about that and just going like is that right like do those dots know that they're in that dot data set like is that is that the world that we really want to be part of and that was a real like i think that's always been kind of part of the motivation um sanders said we had a couple false starts like one of the false starts we had was we said okay if the premise here look i think we had a couple early ideas that still are pretty core textile one is we thought that data needed greater interoperability it's clear that data on the internet is pretty broken and interoperability is one of the kind of foundational pieces that just isn't baked into the into the internet as we know it and so if we could figure out ways to add greater interoperability we could sort of fix that that component of the web um and then the other was sort of sovereignty and kind of control and ownership and or at least visibility into what's happening with your data afterwards and so we started talking about those two things and one of the early ideas that we had was like okay it's clear that one of the big problems going on are these data pipelines that just are consuming data as quickly as they can pull it out and a lot of times they don't have a particular value that they're trying to extract they just know it will be valuable and so we're losing these data sets from ourselves that are going off to any company that can collect it as fast as they can collect it so they can either sell it uh warehouse it for later use or sometimes put it into the into the flywheel to create value from from advertising or whatever um and so one of our first ideas was like okay maybe we can just help those companies that don't really want to collect they just want to get information from it and we spent quite a while working on um the area of looking if we could put better machine learning tools directly onto the device so that your data would never have to leave the device for applications to get insights about you and trigger events around you we didn't make much headway there i mean we spent quite a lot of time seeing what kind of models we could build and and what could really be built there and that's when we found basically ipfs was was the first thing we found we were like oh okay if we could re-architect the way apis work around interoperabil interoperable data maybe we could still we could still have a lot of the values created off the device and maybe we don't have to like force the platforms to change in order to get our vision to work we can we can actually just build really cool services and systems around interoperable data and then we started just hacking and building on ipfs yeah one of the insights we had around that initial product was just talking to potential customers and trying to get them you know to use our on-device machine learning platform and invariably i mean people were very much interested in the concept but then they would talk to their data teams and they would come back with well actually we just want all the data you know which because they just don't really know what what they want yet they just kind of want to throw it out and throw it all into their black boxes and see what kind of cool things pop out it makes sense but it's it was sort of like one of those duh moments um yeah we had a pretty big moment there which i thought was like a significant part moment in the history of the company where i think everything we built today to that point was like we were doing some really awesome feature extraction tools for machine learning directly on device that was like the key thing we had built so far so we could take a a pretty rough input of data on device and create this really cool stream of features and that's what would drive some really basic simple models and then what sander's saying is we we realized that they still just wanted now they wanted those extra features off device and we decided to just turn our turn ourselves completely and said like nah that's not what we really want to build and uh yeah that was all kind of all at that moment where we discovered ipfs and everything very cool um yeah i mean maybe we can dive into the sort of discovery of ipfs and you know like what has you know been the i guess that the face of textile now that everybody can recognize but um i i guess like when you first started getting into ipfs um you know i think probably buckets was probably the first product that you had launched at some point um you know what what does kind of buckets provide that um is different than just like natively using ipfs or and just sort of like you know what did you find um made it so that was like a compelling thing to build uh over and above what what ipfs already provided that's a sander question um well yeah i mean just so buckets are kind of a user-friendly skin on top of a unix fs directory and they sort of gloss over some of the things that take just a couple extra steps to do yourself like ipns addressing like full node encryption um and pinning so those things combine kind of create this i the idea was to create an experience that feels more like a web to experience but still carries with it um the things that we know and love like content addressing and the ability to flush to file coin um using our powergate so that's kind of a tag on product but yeah the general idea is you know we saw a lot of people just wanting to to throw data up onto somewhere but and not have to think about this concept of pinning which is makes sense that we need to think about that in this in this world but it's not necessarily an intuitive thing yeah just to add to that i think um i get really excited about buckets it's like um uh it's it's it's kind it kind of like wraps up a lot of the textile sort of approach to these things which is to say like let's try to take let's try to take these protocols that make data uh more open or make data more decentralized and try to make them very simple for developers that aren't necessarily thinking about that first and so like pinning is a great example that where the pinning concept becomes very obvious if you've already been working in ethereum and you already have you already have to figure out how to get data from a contract or reference data from a smart contract but if you're if we're trying to talk to somebody who's just you know building a react app and then and then telling them that their images need to be pinned it's a pretty foreign concept but if you can instead tell them oh you you need to take that app and you need to put it in a bucket and a bucket is just a folder and and then behind the scenes the pinning is there it gives them that sort of reverse way to then learn more about the pinning learn more about what it means to have ipfs nodes what it means to have local or remote nodes it just gives a much more what our goal is a much more sort of easy landing point where everything makes sense in all the framework that you already understand and then you can grow from there to learn all about the network yeah and then just and then being more true to folks that do understand those things or aren't just playing around because that's another thing it's got to be easy to start building and maybe you haven't checked every single box that you know you wanted to check but but the key thing is is can i build what i'm trying to build um and then being true to okay like the folks that want more like you know actual offline or um local notes and stuff like that so you can run a bucket server locally if you want um so that that's just a very important caveat you know um it's not you're not locked into someone else's infrastructure necessarily and it's backed by our threads db um which is also something that you can run yourself but you can get started using a hosted node yeah i think that that's a cool caveat i think to dive into a little bit um you know like i think like kind of the theme of some of these discussions is trying to understand like how different companies like approach the sort of user experience difficulty that is sort of like going with the full decentralization like security way versus like um you know making things kind of easier on boarding um you know i know that textile especially like around powergate is posting your own nodes and that sort of thing and um you'll be part of the infrastructure but you know arguably in like a slightly sensor centralized type way um i guess like where you know how do you see the kind of trade-off between like the kind of initial developer onboarding experience um and just like being able to build like you just mentioned versus like you know kind of keeping everything kind of very decentralized and and that sort of thing so yeah if you could dive in i think a little bit on that kind of local hosting and that caveat i think that'd be really useful for everybody yeah well i i could do a little first there i think that basically usability is the first problem always when developing developer tools and so providing hosted services is just like a very it's a very easy way to get developers that aren't already thinking about these things to start using them and not have to go through the trouble or the uh the learning process of understanding how to onboard to a decentralized network so not running your own nodes and also if you if you're trying to build something for developers and you force them to be only using the fully decentralized model it means that they also have to do that for their end users which isn't something that all developers want to do and i and i really think that if we want to have success in web3 the the next two years is all about bringing web 2 over and the more we can bring them over with things they're just familiar with the more success i think we're going to have and so our goal is really just to make all of the hosted things interoperable like you can tear it apart like you can put your data there but you don't have to believe that it will be there and that that's like some of the demos that we've done with powergate where like you could put your data there and actually have it be backed by deals and filecoin where the like the textile hub could go away tomorrow and you could still go get your data out of the network so really it's about building your app so that it works it just will work faster or scale a little bit more if it also uses the hub but if the hub goes away it will still work um and and that's been a lot of our kind of guiding principle that's hard i mean it's it's there's still a lot to build so it's definitely not a complete vision but totally what we work on yeah i mean that's this this has got to be like a combination of of tools you know there's no silver or what we found at least there's no silver bullet to like going back to that sort of intro that we covered around um you know how do we keep technology that needs more and more data doing good things for us and with our well-being in mind um and it's just there's so many tools at our disposal like encryption um you know content addressing blockchains trying to use those things all together in sort of a nice harmony while also providing that ux it's really a hard thing yeah i think it's uh i think it's a difficult choice that and kind of uh kind of bridge to to uh to cross on the whole uh this web 3 ecosystem in general and yeah i think just personally like offsetting and making it as easy as possible for web 2 developers you know certainly paid off for at least this hackathon and certainly like in general um i have providing yeah go ahead i just have this thing that i i haven't i've been like sold it hard inside the company but i talk about it uh occasionally and i haven't figured out how to measure it yet but i really think that the driving kpi that we that as a company i think we've kind of arrived at it even if we haven't totally measured it yet and i think we will figure out how to measure it um but it's it's it's i think it needs to be sort of the guiding kpi of all companies building in this space which is time to failure and so our goal right now is to build tools that allow developers to try them and fail as quickly as possible so they can learn whether they can build their idea or it's not going to work and not not because our technology fails but because they their idea maybe doesn't work and the reason i think that's really important is if you look at success on the web if you look at success during web 2 if you look at success um in companies and building for society in general there's there's rarely ever sort of a planned success instead there's sort of a trail of thousands of failures and i think if we want web three to be successful we need to enable that trail of thousands of failures which just it doesn't mean that we have to set developers up for success it means we have to invite thousands of developers to come try very quickly and try building their ideas very quickly and just figure out if their idea works and if it sticks and if it has that like slight little edge that will make it blow up and be the next interesting thing and so that kpi for me is i think the the one that we'll be focusing more and more on i like that that's a super interesting way of looking at things because it's it's definitely true that you know in web 2 i could have a website tomorrow right and you know having having that fail as quickly as possible so that i can iterate and improve um incredibly valuable i think for for i think really like how we've developed software in general um in the web 2 world and yeah to bring that to web3 i think that's a great kpi and if you think about it like if you think about the way developers outside of our community are building things so like building something for the facebook platform or building something for the app store it's a very it's a very different feeling and there not only is it does it have that kpi there's another thing that um that's still tricky which is on those platforms the the the audience discovery is more clear and i think that's another big area that we'll we'll be trying to figure out and we won't be the only ones figuring out i think that this community's been trying to figure that out but if you're a developer who who's going to see the thing you're building who's going to get it who's going to be able to play with it and and helping developers figure that out i think is really important too yeah yeah it's sort of you know using good any kind of tools whether it's building something physically or digitally this is it should be fun and not hamper the creative process totally agree maybe a tall order but it's yeah maybe we can dive into this a little bit as like sort of like a segway to you know kind of what are the next things you guys think you'll be working on and obviously powergate is is still a big focus but um i i guess maybe two point question is you know one is like you know what keeps you guys working up textile like what what's exciting what's interesting about the problem you're solving at least personally for you and um and then also yeah like you know are you thinking about tackling these kind of bigger community user issues like what kind of the next pieces look like um if you're able to chat about those and yeah i guess just a little bit about that senator you want to go first yeah um well i guess i mean just the uh recent integration with powergate has been our file coin via powergate has been really exciting for me just seeing this this concept around data interoperability and user and data user ownership of data in our hosted systems be able to be sort of leveraging this purely decentralized storage backend and seeing data added through buckets for example through the hub being archived to file coin and then restored using the lotus client for example from a totally different location on the web is kind of really just it really is a satisfying thing because um it's sort of the full circle combining all these tools for me yeah i i would yeah i'd reiterate that i think that like i think that filecoin vision and where it will where it kind of slots into the network um it's super important and it's just been it's been kind of a missing piece for ipfs right because a lot of people have it's been a hard gap to understand you know the incentive models for persisting on the network and um and so getting that solution in there i think helps so many so many ideas then become real um which is super exciting i'm also really excited um another another kind of area i'm excited about is um is is back to that kpi i think like this hackathon has been pretty awesome for us because it's shown us some new ideas and reinforced some other ideas that we've had about where the usability challenges are and what we can really build to help help lower those and help people just get their idea done faster and so that's really exciting to me and i think like say it again i think hackathon like this is really exciting because it brings so many people that are just just giving that really fast feedback and that's been awesome so i'm i'm really excited about the next sort of wave of outputs we'll have which is which is pretty cool yeah so let me just to let's add to that a little bit the um sort of you take threads and buckets and that's a bit of a database and object storage um and making that work like a platform like mongodb plus realm um if you've ever used realm on mobile this is like a magical experience um and it does all this offline sync and stuff like that and we're we're going to be releasing some tools around that in the near future which is going to be awesome cool awesome uh sweet so maybe i'll turn it over to the to the audience um if any anybody has a question feel free to sort of unmute and turn on your video if you can if not happy to keep the conversation driving we'll just wait a moment all right it doesn't look like it's gonna be any biters live cool so maybe i'll give you guys uh i'll ask another question and then i'll give everybody in the audience time to to think up of one of their own so um i i know like we'll kind of go going back to like halfway through the conversation we chatted about um sort of the early days of textile and the first kind of products you were working on and you know i guess that pivotal decision that that led you down this path and um keeping in even in terms of like your your morals and ethics personally i think that was great um maybe it would be great to kind of chat about a couple other decisions that um either like early on that were either you know very good decisions that paid out dividends later or um you know bad decisions that you end up having to fight off later um i think uh you know kind of every startup has a great period of uncertainty at the beginning um and i think it's useful for people who are listening or are otherwise watching this later um who may have companies for the first time in their lives after this event um so it i guess would be cool to hear a little bit more about those early days and some of those decisions i have some ideas uh uh so i'm like a big uh i'm like a i really i'm a really big fan of building you know the a company you want to work at that's like super important and i think that we've done that pretty well like i i wake up every morning and i really like working with the team and everything so i think hiring has been really awesome but um not but so let me finish that thought hyrun's been really awesome so carson and ignacio aaron they're all killer killer teammates and so um if you are starting a project think very carefully about um the team that you're going to bring on because going on sort of a long years long journey with them is you're going to hit challenges and i've never felt like my team hasn't had my back and that we haven't been able to make our decisions together pretty quickly too like you know that time that we had to turn our back on potential customers and a potential business i think we made the decision in like a one or two hour phone call with everybody and we were like oh new new direction let's go let's figure it out uh i think that we had a team retreat that was like fortunately um already scheduled right after that we were all in a house together for a week and it was one of our best team retreats we just spent a week going like cool what next and and that was really exciting that but that's another really important thing so we're um we're a venture-backed company we have investors um and we've raised we've raised money and but i think we've gotten really lucky because we have really great investors um and i i've always thought like um that when you take investment it's really important to think about your investors like they're going to be part of that team like do you want to work with them every day you're not going to work with them every day but like do you see them eye to eye and do you are you able to have good conversations and get candid feedback um and so that moment that we went through through that sort of hard decision um our you know our our investment team was just like cool go do it that's awesome and that's really important and they've always had our back and have always really respected our points of view and where we're going so for me team in all directions has been really great and i think that's like one of the most important things in the journey yeah absolutely all about all about people um i think yeah we've been really lucky on our team everyone can be a leader and a follower and high five along the way um yeah it's really great i got a private i got a private question here um somebody asked me and i think they just asked in private in case i didn't want to answer but they asked if i would i'd talk about texas textiles business model a bit um and so and i'm happy to talk about that so we don't we don't currently have a very strong business model like you'll see we don't charge for anything um and that's that's totally driven out of two two facts one we think the market is really early and so we're trying to figure out what exactly our people want what do people want and what will they be willing to pay for um and so to that kpi of letting people fail fast we really want just people to onboard as much as possible and try these apis out and try these tools out without having to make the commitment of what kind of payment plan do they want to be part of or is their idea even does it even have revenue that they can pay for these things really we're in a fortunate position where we can really be experimental right now and just put these things out um but then more long-term what our business model will be i i think that there's actually some pretty obvious directions of where we could go in kind of like a traditional sas direction where you'd be using our apis and paying for them we've already had some requests and this is something that we've talked about quite a bit was having more kind of interesting models within that so letting application developers have like user pay models where the users are actually paying to get their to keep their data persisted or moving around the network um a lot of the architecture around the powergate is actually and it could enable things like that and then we have less traditional business models that we're exploring like there i think that in the file coin ecosystem there's probably going to be a lot of opportunities for um for specific tokens and so we have that in the back of our minds too uh but we haven't you know we haven't committed to anything there and we're not certain what it will really look like but we're just kind of in that experimental try things really fast right now see where the market is see what people want and try to put out some really valuable things so the answer is like those are all on our mind but we don't have a we don't have a concrete direction yet very cool um awesome and i guess i think you kind of briefly mentioned um you know the the fact that you're a venture back company um i think it'd be kind of interesting because you know we've we've had uh some of the products and projects that have come out of uh the hack money event that we expect for this one to um go on to start doing the venture capital side of things um maybe if you could just you know talk really generally about um what it's like raising um in in a you know sort of like in a very future type leaning way you know like uh you know in a way where you know the technology like you mentioned is still very early the market is early um just kind of touch briefly on like how investors receive that sort of thing and uh just kind of different techniques on dealing with that yeah it's a really tricky thing i think that the whole um i i think that the whole uh blockchain and crypto community really opened the door i think there's a lot more um there's a lot more vcs today that are willing to back more speculative projects maybe we're in a dip since we were a year or two ago um but generally much more willing to back speculative projects and and really back projects that are um trying to do the preliminary research that could lead to big transformative projects but it's still tricky i think that um having having a clear uh having a clear sort of vision about where your market could be and who you're really talking to and what problems you're really addressing haven't changed like versus just doing a traditional kind of you know startup out there and so i think that's the most important thing like i hear um i hear um kind of through through rvc's i'll talk with other companies and things like that and i think that tends to be one of the biggest separators um between companies that get funded right now and companies that don't are whether or not they do have that clear vision of where their market is going to be and whether they have the tools to go and talk to that market and get your product out there um and so i think that's not always the easiest thing for um for a first-time entrepreneur it wasn't easy for me to think about that you know you just want to go build technology and if you build it people are going to use it but um that's not necessarily the way it's going to work and so thinking about yeah what are your different strategies to get it in front of people and to get people really building on on the things that you're you're building or using the things that you're creating i don't know if that helped at all but the other thing is network i mean it like it it it's really important to have a strong network and so make sure that you're out there talking to people and learning from people and meeting people as much as possible because even if they're not going to invest in you the more that you can get introductions and um and and uh uh yeah so warm introductions from people you already know or or just talk directly to vcs that already know you it's going to be 100 times easier than than sort of the cold the cold process and so because of my last um because of my last startup i already knew investors that were investing in that startup so it was much easier to move and then they open doors to meeting investors after that and so it it that that sort of like is your early network of pcs is such an important problem to figure out too so yeah your market and who's your uh who's who's your uh network of these these are kind of the two big problems to figure out outside of your technology gotcha i think that was very helpful sorry guys i might have dropped out now you're all good um i was just gonna add just i'm not sure what andrew just covered there but just the same rules seem to apply like if you're a super product driven company you know and you're making this widget um yeah who's gonna buy it does it work and that kind of stuff seems to be still extremely important which makes sense yeah i think i think that's valuable to know is that you know in a lot of cases this experience shouldn't be that different so you should you know really be focused on those those core um you know the value of the market those types of principles that uh there are a lot of resources for which is also convenient um jay i see you have your hand up possible that means you have a question yes i was starting to type it in the chat box but i was just wondering you know it's very early still for the textile um toolkit and so forth but what are some of the most innovative applications you've seen built upon the toolkits and toolset and what are the what are the most surprising uh applications well i have uh i have uh a few that um are really are really interesting so uh i think um i don't know if you've been following fleek's work so fleek has been going really deep into some of the technology and i think one of the cool things about what fleek is up to that's really exciting for us is back to that interoperability story um is really they've been looking deeply at how we've put together the buckets and the threats protocols and seeing how they can build new and alternative apis that or like local apis as well with um with their space daemon that expose those same protocols in those same formats which is really cool because then you can think of uh you can start thinking of more services that build around those objects that then people will be able to do things with their data so that's really that's really cool and it's it's definitely different than we imagined the some of the early products we'd be using um the textile stack and then another really cool one is uh is slate i don't know if you've been following what slate's up to over on the protocol labs team but they've been really just so quick to adopt the powergate apis and really be um figuring out how to use them and giving us great feedback so we've been able to iterate really quickly on making some usable apis there and that's just like such a um a cool community that's built really quickly around a product so i've never seen anything like that the way that they've been getting so much sort of people contributing and um excited about building this product all together um so that's super cool and i've been i've been really like um enjoying watching that unfold um another one that we're starting to work work with just uh early early days is world brain that's a really cool product for organizing kind of your it's sort of your knowledge layer on top of your internet sort of behavior so you can kind of mark up and and organize what you learn on the web um and and and things that you're learning off the web as well but um uh they're they're starting to look at uh integrating with some of the textile stack to again give users that interoperable data storage and um hopefully in the future file coin storage for your for your knowledge graph they do some really cool things with like organizational knowledge graphs which which are really cool and exciting um and that stuff gets back to sander mentioned that we're always interested in that personal data aspect and so that gets into a really cool area of kind of personal and organizational data that i think is really exciting so check out worldbrain for sure those are kind of three really good ones since you mentioned organizational data you know i've been delighted to see that you have a whole application for organizations what are you seeing with organizations starting to use the textile toolkits and how how do you see organizations adopting this and creating entire platforms for their companies on this i think the organization thing first was to scratch our own itch like could we create buckets for example that as a team we were able to all be working on those same buckets were we able to start you know pushing our documentation out to ipns or but have it in sort of that way that we could all manage it it's it's interesting because it's very hard to think of like group managed data on ipfs group managed dynamic data on ipfs has like several layers of abstraction that would be hard for any developer to just build overnight but i think what sander and the other guys have done with buckets and threads kind of like it pulls that all away and just makes it okay i have a folder that i want to sync to a remote node i want to give permission to this other person where they can also uh they can also be updating the state of that folder that's a really cool concept on ipfs and i think i think we have a lot more to do as far as like showing all the possibility there yeah i think it'll be interesting to see um and just do some case studies around organizational usage and figure out how we can help that cool awesome any other questions from the audience otherwise we can do a nice wrap-up question all right maybe i'll ask the now very common last question um you know i i know obviously you are you're busy working on textile and um you know with the day to day there but you know if you were in the place of some of these hackers and you know otherwise maybe you know weren't working on anything full-time or kind of had all the time in front of you and in a 30-day window to build something awesome um what would you be building right now if you were in their place well i had something i thought about working on and then i just got too deep in current textile stuff but i think you could with a few api changes um maybe a couple hacks you could make a pretty cool live streaming feature built on top of a bucket so you just take the camera from your computer and then you just start writing those those blocks to uh to a stream endpoint on a bucket which would need to be tweaked but i think it would wouldn't be too hard and then you could just watch it live from anywhere or or over at the thread db address or ipn address and then flush it to file coin that seems like a big deal looks like we could get rid of zoom pretty soon yeah i had i have one that i uh that i've been like wanting i think carter said maybe exist so it would be one of the tax you're like oh but doesn't that exist i'm not sure so basically uh there's this there are two two kind of there are two kind of problems that i hit with ipfs pretty pretty regularly and i was like gosh why don't we just fix those one is that um i i mentioned this on the brainstorming session that imgur for example is broken they kind of like web to themselves out of being a useful api from anymore so my pattern with inger was always like i had an image that i wanted to embed in in say markdown so i'd put it over an imgur and then i'd get the url and i'd put it back in in markdown so then i'd have my image that's become tricky not it's not impossible but they've kind of made that that direct url kind of layers deep and so it's not an easy workflow anymore because i'm not their target audience but then i always was thinking gosh why don't i just do that on ipfs that's the perfect that's a perfect thing to just do an ipfs and now buckets has made that pretty easy so i can have a bucket on my desktop and i can drag new images into it and then i get the i get the ref to the um to the image and i can make my markdown again um so that's problem one and and that solved and actually last weekend i did a hack of my own and i built a browser extension on a bucket that will do the same thing so i have like a little ui where i can drag and drop images and it has all my images and it has like a helpful copy link where i can just copy the markdown format or copy the html format to embed it in a document uh i'll clean that up and i'll publish it probably before the end of the hackathon um but it's it's pretty like pretty ugly so i don't wanna i don't wanna put it up yet but but that works but that's problem one and then problem two i started revising is that once i do that the only way to embed the image is actually though um well there's kind of two ways one is to put the full image tag in my in my um html or in my markdown but pointing to a gateway which is cool it's like useful but it's it's still on a gateway and then the other way is if i actually use js ipfs to take the cid and go pull the cid and everything so my hack would actually be a little single use library that was something like ipfs data data attribute and what i want is a custom data attribute on the image tag in html so it would be like like the image html and then data attribute cid and if you put the cid in there this like single-use library would load ipfs go get that cid and replace the image with the data of the image so you'd so it would be able to load any cid and display it as the image and i think some of the work on on putting web uh basically ipfs into shared workers gets really cool there too because i could then have an embed uh script or sort of embed copy for an image tag plus the script to load that javascript library where a user doesn't have to think about it they just drop that into their html and even if they load that script 30 times it still would use the same instance of ipfs and queue all those cid requests and just drop all my images in and then i have a real way for a developer just to have images pulled right from the ipfs network instead of pointing to gateways so that would be my hack i think it would take you know a week of work or something like that but be very cool uh for my own use cases awesome that sounds great yeah i would totally use that too uh screenshot on your mac and then all of a sudden you get an ipfs link to that image that'd be sick 100 yeah awesome cool uh sweet well i think um you know it goes without saying really appreciate uh youtube taking the time to chat with us um thanks for your insights and and of course you know thanks to textile for being such a critical part of this event and for for helping out with hackfest um so yeah so thanks so much for everybody and uh awesome we'll catch everybody on slack thanks for watching thanks for having us of course take care everybody
