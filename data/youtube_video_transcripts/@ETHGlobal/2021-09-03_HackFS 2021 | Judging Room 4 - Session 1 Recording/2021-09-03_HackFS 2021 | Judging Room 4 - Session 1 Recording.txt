awesome well i want to thank everyone for joining us today um obviously this is the hack fest judging session we've been assigned to i want to thank anton for being here today we're bringing in uh 650 hackers uh from over 61 countries and 18 time zones we're actually pretty impressed uh we were definitely shooting for a little bit lower the number blew away our expectations the judging format we have four minutes for the demo we're going to be giving you three minutes for questions afterwards and then a 10-minute break will take every six to eight teams um obviously if if you're right in the middle of a question and there's a lot of good banter i think we'll you know we'll be a little bit loose with it i don't think there are too many teams today but we'd like to keep things you know to a quick pace the judging criteria uh like all of our events we're gonna be judging on technicality originality practicality uh the ui ux factor and uh the wow factor you know we want to see things we haven't seen before interesting creative ideas that we know that you're all possible that we know are possible that you all will create um this is not a competition i know that we're judging i know that we're giving out prizes but this is really about you it's about your growth we uh we're here to help the space we're here to help every developer as part of that and you know we want to give you the tools to succeed this is really you versus yourself to see what you're capable of um our judges were joined here today by julian i'll give him a second to introduce himself uh arjun will be here a little bit later um and i'll give him a second to introduce himself when he uh when he joins us julian if you'd like to take it away yes definitely uh so my name is julian i'm the ceo and founder at unlock protocol which is a protocol for memberships it's basically a way for any creator any whether you're a musician an artist a blogger a journalist a developer to create a membership of their own and sell access to their work to their community in the form of nfts using unlock we've been around for a little while we're now deploying magnet on polygon and i hope arjuna shows up on xdi uh and soon will be on other layer twos uh and and side chains uh we have built a bunch of interesting things for example like a credit card integration that allows anyone to purchase a membership with their credit cards so for people who don't have a crypto wallet that's actually pretty easy and convenient you can customize like any nft you can customize the image um there's a lot of pretty cool things you can do with unlock and i mean i've already seen a couple pretty cool integration that was they were built during hackathon i encourage everyone to keep looking at unlock we also have a grants program uh so if anyone wants to um keep working on luck they should definitely apply for grants uh to reward basically to receive a reward of tokens uh based on on you know the integration that they want to build uh the protocol with thank you thank you for joining us you know really looking forward to seeing what kind of projects we have today i also want to thank anton obviously our rmc i'm going to be handing it over to him um and uh it's time for demos let's get this started okay perfect so first up i believe we have team nft options if you could raise your hands you guys could be um promoted to yeah perfect so you guys will have um like um luke said earlier you will have four minutes to present as well as on three minutes for the questions and answers hello hi uh i was facing some issue with screen sharing so emily told me that someone would share the screen in the green room i was facing some issue with screen sharing and sound so you could anyone could share the corresponding video then that would be it for sure do you uh have a video link or is this a presentation i got a slide deck i'll pull that up for you don't worry this is not going to cut into your time i want to make sure everything's set up for you okay hello everyone i am aditya and i have created nft options protocol in hikfs in july nfts racked in over 1.2 billion dollar in sales they are one of the fastest growing niches in crypto and has a huge potential so problems faced by nft enthusiasts today are good nfts are expensive and no income on idle nfds so what nft options protocol bring to the table is hedging speculation and income from nfd options it creates synthetic market to get exposure on the nfd assets instead of trading an ft straight the option to buy or sell an nft at a strike price before a maturity rate so i created nft call options using uma's long short pair library after minting the user will get a long nfd and a short nft and nft options data is stored in ipfs user can sell the option nft using any nft marketplace such as openc to collect premium let's dive straight into the demo so this is the home page of our applications and these are the set of whitelisted nfts let's create an option for crypto punks so basically you can select a strike price the expiry and the amount of option you want to maintain now you hit create so basically it will create a long short contract it will instantiate a long shortfall contract which will be unique for every set of strike price expiry and underlying nfd so once that is created see it's now created now we can mint our long option and short option so basically we can see all the nft related data which is stored in ipfs so this is our unique fingerprint and this is the data which is stored in in the ipfs the corresponding strike price the expiry and the lsp address lsp stands for long short pair so this particular address will be required at the time of settlement of options so as we can see the corresponding nfd is long enough t and short nft has been minted this is the long option and this is a short option so basically the option seller can sell their corresponding long option in order to collect a premium and for a normal user user can come to any secondary marketplace and can purchase this long option and if if the price of the underlying nft is above the strike price then the user can earn the difference by coming to our settle page so basically they can come to our settle page and they can they'll they'll enter this lsp address and the corresponding token id since the option has not expired yet we'll click settle function so basically it will try to settle it but since it's not expired uh they will not be able to earn anything and the code will just revert in that case here is an example here is an example of the settle function settle feature for a different option which has expired the corresponding long option will get burned so i'll be adding lot many features into this but one of the features i've added to this platform is profit calculator so based on the strike price and the settlement price you can calculate the value of your call option and covered call option using this price calculator so this are the set of features nft options protocol is offering now but i'll be adding a lot more into this thank you for listening great thank you for your presentation so now we can move on to the three minutes of q a hi aditya this this is great uh one thing i want you know does it work with any erc721 contract yeah basically any underlying nft you can mint long option and short option those options are denoted as erc721 so it since it is compatible to erc 721 it can be sold in any of the uh marketplaces like openc variable so so it takes any esc 721 like a punk and then creates two other ese 721 for the longest calculations okay so i'm i'm definitely not i'm i'm not very familiar with uma and so can you explain a bit more about the long and short option what does it do like it's basically i have an i have an nft and i want to hedge against the price going up or down is that the idea yeah exactly so basically uh you have an nft and you want to trade basically the variability of the price of that particular nft instead of that nfp sitting in your vault so what you do is you basically set a strike price and it's basically set the strike price and the expiry for that nft and you meant basically long option and short option so what does does that mean is like you can basically sell your long option in order to collect a premium so the person who is buying it he's expecting that the price of this asset will increase and since you are selling it you are thinking that the price will decrease and if the price of that particular asset is above the strike price at the time of expiry the option buyer can collect the payout of it by coming to our settle page if the price of that is below the strike price then basically the option seller can earn the premium which the option buyer has paid in order to purchase that long option so basically yeah so long option become your option call and the short option becomes your covered call which will be used for you to collect your collateral which you have deposited earlier that makes sense i okay i have to deposit collateral initially and then basically uh that's what is used okay that's really cool okay that's really helpful um and uh so use uma use obviously uh your c721 contract use polygon in some for this or no you're building this on watching so i'm using ethereum as of now since it was completed in the last moment i was i didn't have time to integrate polygon as well but definitely it will be going for default change as of now it's only hosted on ethereum using ethereum blockchain cool all right that makes sense uh and you use ipfs to store the uh the lmd data yeah cool all right that's really cool um thank you very much uh what is there one lesson that you take from this i think we have one more minute what's the what's the one lesson that you've learned for yeah so basically when i started this particular project there were not many options into it so before reading about every options i jumped straight into the open like instead of ums library i jumped into open library and i started building on top of it so since till 3rd 13th of august i was building using open and then suddenly i realized that this has become very complex and it the settlement feature wasn't working so then i started reading about ema stuff and then i was able to do it at like just two hours before submitting that wow so the lesson i've learned is first uh like read about everything and then decide because it will save a lot of time makes sense i mean it's definitely a an environment where there's a lot of uh documentation that is not a two-day date or or projects announcing things that they haven't shipped yet so uh congrats on building this is pretty cool uh good job thank you thank you very much great work uh team nft options um so now um the zoom admin will now demo you to attendees where you can choose whether to stay on the call or you could um hop off the call i'll be here as an attendee okay perfect and so up next we have team fracture oh we don't have east poster um sure i mean that's fine it's just like in the in the in on my side there's the second one but maybe one of them later sorry i forget what i said let's do fracture okay yeah welcome to team fracture if you could um raise your hands i'm not sure if the zoom admit has already promoted you to panelists perfect hello hey drew um just like the last presentation i had trouble sharing my audio so there's a video link in the chat fracture is an app that allows users to make a royalty payment splitter and then mint nfts with that royalty payment splitter as the beneficiary of any cell on royalties i give the token a name and a symbol and i hit deploy once this transaction completes the interface will populate the address of the distributor from there i can distribute shares to different beneficiaries of this contract let's give this account 10 shares and this one 40. for a sum total of 50 shares we can copy this address and use it as the royalty recipient in our nft mentor let's upload an image and store it to ipfs using nft dot storage now that it's there we can select the number of this kind of nft we want to min let's say 15 and say that further sales will have to pay 10 percent to this royalty distribution contract the transaction completes and now i can view this nft on openc as this nft gets traded on marketplaces that support erc2981 royalties come in and users of the contract can claim their royalties by going here and clicking claim distribution while both of these parts can be used on their own they work well together and are particularly great for use cases like ticketing with tickets secondary sales have lots of the cash flow but the original creators usually see little to none of this money using the nft mentor to create the tickets and the royalty splitter to divide earnings from the tickets this problem can be addressed in a decentralized application without trust for a single party to to hold on to those royalties thank you for watching i hope that you find more ways to use the royalty splitter and the nft mentor to create some really powerful tools on the blockchain yeah so now we can move on to your three minutes of q a thank you andrew that was great uh let me understand one thing so when you deploy the two contract you deploy first the splitter and then the nft contract is that correct yeah because for receiving royalties um it needs to know where to put them so you need to have the splitter in place first um and they're separate parts instead of one ui because you could use them on their own it's like useful to have a recipient contract that can take tokens and split them out and the nft contract does it have to be special or is it just the own i mean is the splitter the the owner of the nft contract to guess the nft mentor that i've built is a single erc 1155 contract okay and individual token ids there are the different nfts that's just so that the code for respecting royalties is in there if you have your own nft that has the royalty info standard in it then you can use that instead i see and the royalty standard info is the erc2981 right yeah just finalized okay yes i was gonna say it last week or something like this okay interesting and uh so in theory that splitter should work with any erc i mean any nft contract yeah and the tokens that it accepts for right now since i'm using super fluid they are only super fluid super tokens um but there's code in there to upgrade from other drc 777 tokens to their respective uh super token interesting cool uh was that the first project that you built uh using ethereum or have you built other things before uh it's my second one cool what did you do before uh it was like a gofundme type uh escrow contract nice cool is there any big kind of gotcha or lesson that you've learned building this um i think it was just a lot of debugging uh i spent a lot of time like writing code without writing tests first i'll probably get better at writing tests in the future yeah what what is your dev setup uh i i use a hard hat okay for this i use scaffold beef which is actually really really great yep cool awesome well thank you very much good job on this um i mean i hope you keep building on on ethereum it looks like you did a great job there thank you of course so uh great work um team fracture um so now the zoo manager will be demoting you to an attendee or you can choose to either stay on the call or hop off and up next we have team decentralized social media hi everyone yeah i just shared my screen um let me know if you are able to see it yes that's good everyone and welcome to our um submission which is a decentralized social media platform uh apart from our regular instagram or other social media platforms this platform has a couple of additional features apart from uploading your own pictures you can also mint an nft out of these pictures and we have also added a a news feature that is you can read trending articles or know more about what's happening in the world news based on your preferences about you know just apart from the mindless scrolling that we do this is also a feature that we have added the main platforms sdks chains that we have used are zora polygon uh chain link for this trending information uh polygon and zora for the contracts themselves and the minting of course and we have also of course ibfs for storing decentralized storage and we have also tried to use unlock protocol uh so without further ado let's see how this works i'm going to upload an image i have already connected my wallet here earlier and i'm just going to say an image image i'm going to choose a file and upload a file uh let's say all right okay i'm going to submit and this is not going to be maintained now that the image has come so you can see that it takes a bit of time to actually retrieve it from pinata but this has been uploaded on uh ipfs now as you know uh just like a decentralized storage now the next part would be that as a creator you can see that it has been uploaded by my uh address which is connected as a creator i can also mint this nft so i'm going to click on mint nft and now it is minting at the background using the zora sdk uh our nft has been minted we can see the minted nft in the marketplace so let me go to the explore marketplace and see the different nfts that have been minted so as you can see this nft has been minted and the owner address is here uh there are a couple of other images also that we have entered as an nft in this marketplace we eventually want to enable the auction house as well uh using zora so let me just show you that i can also set a price for this particular nft which will call the set ask zora sdk and set the price for this particular nft uh you can see the price of this nft has been set uh for one of the for chain link basically uh we want to get the information from uh the news feeds using chain link and we will filter it by the different hashtags that the users enter as a part of their uh preference now uh one last thing that is usage of unlocked protocol uh is that we would like to lock the nfts of creator wants to lock the nfd so that users follow this creator and then only can buy this particular nft now uh we have just minted uh done like a bare minimum version of unlock protocol as you can see uh by clicking on buy which would ideally be unlock one can unlock the nft and only once they are a member so this is uh what we have built so far of course right now i built like a lock on ring by uh so you can see since i've switched to polygon i'm not able to yeah so that's pretty much our demo uh sorry i misspoke in the beginning of the demo it was not minting an nfp it was just uploading it on ipfs and then later it meant it i kept on looking at the clock to make sure i record within four minutes so i was kind of uh you know nervous while doing the entire demo so i think uh it was just a bit all over the place but i hope you kind of understood the concept as such definitely you did a great job don't worry too much about the clock uh cool uh what's so i like that you use a lot of different things um and i really like the idea of providing a an easy interface for people to kind of create uh mint nfts um when you set the price i want to understand how you did this so use the zora auction house set ask no we did not use the auction house yet that we would like to use the auction auction house eventually uh but since we were a bit short of time we just use the set ask uh which is setting particular the ask price that excel and the first person would pay that price would basically uh pct uh access this really cool um in terms of uh in terms of so that price it showed two hundred dollars how did you said is it using die is it using usdc or how does that work yeah so basically um the set task will work on the native uh currency so we should have ideally changed it to like matic or something because we use the polygon test net the mumbai uh mumbai desnet contract of the zora sdk so that's the price that it would be set in but of course to show in the ui we can always pull you know the dollar price and show it uh using any of the spot prices equivalent api or something so yeah that's cool great um is there any uh i mean what is the big lesson that you take from from hiking on that for two weeks uh i think one of the big lessons that we took was uh we should have started slightly earlier as you saw we were a bit ambitious in terms of incorporating various functionalities which we also saw that fit this kind of use case like you know one of the things especially that we wanted we were very keen on doing uh chain link contracts and my teammate ravi on the call can testify to that we spent about a couple of days working through that but uh unfortunately we couldn't get uh the data and bulk string data that we wanted to get like the whole of the url the news feed etc so uh i think one of the lessons for us uh would be to understand little board little more in depth uh about the different plugins that we would try to use and you know maybe experiment a little bit uh earlier than kind of going for it uh in the last minute for sure that makes sense and was it your first uh big ethereum project or have you built something else before uh no uh i have done a couple of hackathons uh recently we built uh uh unified uh rewards which is uh the reward points that we get like amazon rewards or any other uh your target rewards or something all of it in a decentralized wallet so that was one of the recent projects that we had built for e3c and uh my teammate ravi here also built a project on superfluid which again was on polygon so uh we have been building a couple of projects this year and uh excited to kind of bring this decentralized social media idea that we have been brainstorming for a bit uh you know kind of like a influencer uh thing as well like you can a photo that gets a lot of likes you can mint that into an nft and eventually transfer the ip rights you know uh something like this we have been brainstorming for uh for some time and we were happy to be able to implement this uh at uh this hackathon that makes sense great thank you very much yeah thank you so much julian i don't know if luke has questions oh no i you did a really great job you know asking them i'm wondering maybe at the end of your video you might have gone into this and we got cut off early but what are the next steps for you in the project uh yeah so uh of course many parts of the project like the decentralized storage and the maintain all of that we have already implemented so we are looking to see if there are any grants that are available where we can take this forward one of the things we are keen on doing is of course setting up the auction house as well as trying to see if we can make the chain link work to get the live price feeds from different apis so we are definitely looking uh for grants or opportunities to see if any of the partners would like to support us and uh you know we can work with them to build this and take this forward because some of our friends were also quite interested to use this app as such right now so we definitely see this once out in the market has some good use case perfect thank you so much for your presentation um now the zoom admin will demo you to attend these and you feel free to stay on the call or even hop off whatever you prefer and up next we're going to have team shutter c hey hi i'm going to give a quick shout out i think our our second judge uh arjun has joined the chat um hey hey guys hi sorry i'm just getting over flight so i just got in the cab and just joined as soon as the code that was pretty pretty interesting i i just saw the i just saw the demo by uh gunner lakshmi i don't know if she's dropped off though hashi uh yeah okay we can continue uh conversation in discord if you'd like thank you thank you for joining us hi my name is ariel and i have built an application called shutter c for the heck of a cyclone shutter c is a decentralized platform for sharing freely usable images so users will be able to download free stock images or any photographs and use them for commercial or personal use and attribution is not required and what's in it for the photographers is they can they gain more exposure by sharing their work and it's also a form of giving back to the community similar to open source softwares and this model is similar to unsplash but this works in a decentralized manner and let me quickly jump into the demo so this is the shutter c home page and here you can see the top images if i click on an image i can download uh download it in multiple sizes i can view information about the camera the lens etc also there are some attributes like title um the location date etc which the author provided when uploading this photograph there are also analytics metrics like number of downloads number of use and a number of favorites come so users are able to favorite um favorite the photos they like and uh they can also see uh users uh all the photos have uploaded by a particular user and also search for um images i want by keyword so until this point the end users they don't even know they are interacting with the app but when when somebody want to upload a photograph upload a photo that's when they have to log in using idx so this is it's asking me to connect using three id connect so let me click on it and once you are authenticated you are able to download you are able to submit photos i can let me quickly select a photo okay and i can give a title location and some tags uh once i submit it what happens now is uh what happens now is this photograph is um signed using user's identity and um upload converted into multiple formats and distributed into ipfs so now this photography is here and since i'm the author i have the ability to delete it so let me go back to the presentation so the technically how it works is the uploaded images are converted in multiple sizes and shared in ipfs using web3 storage the cid of images and the metadata etc are stored in 3db also the number of use number of downloads etc stored in 3db as well for identity it works using ceramic idx and innovates it also access like an authorization layer because all the changes like uh photo upload or delete or liking your photo this is signed using the user's private key and validated in the back end uh using public key before pushing to 3rd db so in a way idx is used for managing the data in 3db uh for the future i'm planning to make the onboarding of uh for non-crypto users easier like maybe more more tutorials on that uh and then the search of the photos has to be improved like the searching functionality uh and also implement some kind of uh decentralized moderation protocol to prevent abuse um yeah i think that's it and thank you for your time hi thank you celine that was great uh so just so you clarified this in the video but i want to make sure i understand very well use uh idx ceramic uh so that the author or big picture can and later delete it or change it i guess um yeah as they want is that the idea yes only the author can uh other signs the data and in the package validated it's the same user so basically um authors have um ability to control their data what they share and they are the owners of the other but we say in the back end what does that mean like is there a back end i missed that part yeah yes currently the pushing uh to thread db uh i mean uploading to a buffer system using a back end but the majority of signing everything happens in the close research i see so as a user i sign in the browser it goes to the back end the back end kind of enters access control basically uh and then make sure that i have the right permission to um and then pushes to thread db uh and then it goes to ipfs and okay cool um that makes sense well is there i mean is there any big lesson that you take from that experiment like building on ipfs on instagram um yeah it was uh technically i learned a lot i mean what i really wanted to do is um something good for non-crypto users as well so the application users here don't don't even have to know that they're interacting with the app and that's why i didn't go to go for anything that has to do with so here only the photographers needs to use their wallet or anything like that um that was fun so and uh what i learned new in this one was definitely the ceramics idx part which is something i have never tried before and i think i can use that for more many other applications as well cool awesome perfect thank you team shutter c that was a great presentation um so up next we have team fidelius.eth if you guys could raise your hands um our admin can promote you to panelists i guess while uh while we're having the next team come up arjun do you have any questions or comments or just want to make sure that you're able to ask for that prompting i was just gonna say when salil talked about about non-crypto users i was wondering if he tried out something like magic link or i'm not sure how that would interface ceramic for identity but but having something which allows like a facebook or a google login like you know just makes it that much easier uh but we'll kind of notice that you know not many uh you know crypto users may be very confused with different types of wallets so that's i guess the only observation i had but it would be interesting to try something like that along with ceramic yeah well yeah that would be great awesome um yeah let's move on to the next project asm we're not getting the audio maybe now better yes fidelius is a centralized application used to share organizational secrets among biomembers using public key encryption in the context of fidelius with the lyricist application the house have accept of secrets secrets are encrypted secret keepers are who created and serve them with confidence and the confidence are who can see but not share with others or modify the secrets we in the we started the hackathon thinking on using metamasker pc api to encrypt on the clip data but in the context of the hackathon we realized that ceramic offers a better solution in order to have identities out of the box using web standards that store engineered data and storing data on vfs so we went through these two tutorials and one of thirds asked shima to store note lists and another ask shima to store secrets so we created a schema to store encrypted nodes or segment nodes and we are also using decentralized identifiers and json web encryption standards in the application in order to store them so a quick demo we can save a note and what is shared and stored is the cipher text as you can see here but if you retrieve again the node you can see it continue the decrypted of this application until the point it can be used by real louds they should be able to share their social media passwords and their other secrets among the trusted members in a secure and revocable way okay awesome great thank you very much for the presentation um can you clarify why you were using metamasks or actually the web3 wallet api didn't work out that wasn't i missed this okay the initial idea was to use metamasks api but idem3 sorry 3id and ceramic idx already of course the the same functionality in order to encrypt data and decrypt it using public keys with the the ids it was something that we didn't know and we realized in the context of the hackathon so we discarded to use metamask specific api for this because the other web app web three wallets do not have this api in the way and okay that makes sense and so when you say this is useful for daos uh can you explain me a bit more about that the the application that we have been building it is a very rough proof of concept taking the two tutorials that there exists and we have a proof of concept of how we can save a secret note right the thing is that we want to extend it in the future in order to share it among members of adao the idea is that each member will have the id and using the gwe you can encrypt a secret for many people so we wanna a way in which you can encrypt it to all the members that you want to share it and using the harry potter fidelius metaphor concept which is a charm that you are the secret keeper of something and you can and this secret can only be shared with the people who you choose we we can make it into an into an application and make an admin of the secret that can share it with the people that he wants or her wants and those people can have access to it but cannot modify share with others okay that's cool i um i know you've spoken about switching to ceramic after learning that that worked better for your use case um are were there any other challenges or roadblocks that you encountered on the way it was quite interesting i was not um familiar with ceramica at all and one of one of the members of our team uh was very interesting we're very interested in ceramic because we are you we want to use it for another application that we have together uh in order to manage user profiles and it was a very nice surprise that ceramic was already thinking on encrypting some some data and the next thing that we would like to check out is how we can have shared administration of uh ceramic document like many many the ideas that can that can modify the id we didn't see that how it can be done and we will be very interested to to know if that's something that ceramic already supports or it will need some external way to do that maybe a smart contract or something awesome i'm wondering uh if arjun if you have any questions before we move on i just had one question so with respect to uh using so since you're using ceramic or what you're essentially saying is that since the message is encrypted there would be on-chain evidence that a message was sent however only the person who was the target for for the message you'll be able to decrypt it right did i understand it correct uh cities right now um you know when you have the sith of the ceramic document you are able to decrypt it because you are using your own the id to to retrieve the the message and this the id can decrypt the message so it is right now it is only um symmetrical encryption well it's it's using public key cryptography but it's like you are saving it and retrieving it but what we want is to be able to share it with many more people of your life got it and and what a transaction then we pushed on change so what i'm trying to understand is that would there be evidence that such a message was sent i think so um i don't i really don't know yet how ceramic is working in that context okay um what it is going to be safe among all the servers that are storing this message is that this there is a message there it's it's encrypted nobody knows what it's there but probably you will know who will have access to it because when you talk about that document use case that you know four or five people have access to the document then you can have sort of that access history right who access the document if someone changed something so that evidence if it's there on chain then it makes you know from a tower perspective just makes governance easier which is why i was wondering um but but very interesting use case very interesting no doubt i also think that some people in in the f c series year i think that joel was commenting that said the ceramic team is working on making it working with zero knowledge proofs in order to have a better privacy for the people who is sharing and who has access and these kind of things but i i i can't i'm kind of interested in how they are working on this i i think that it's quite interesting perfect thank you team yes do the judges have any other questions okay if if not um our zoom admin will now demo you to an attendee and feel free to hop off the call or stay on the phone whatever you prefer and up next we're gonna have team open vessels like we said before you'll have four minutes to present and then three minutes of q a are we supposed to be getting any audio with this i need to reshare uh yes i need to be helpful only if you want us to hear it separately from the act i will define the hack nervous i'm sorry so we log we have a upload page and a browser page so here you can see we have a browser page and an upload page here i'm going to upload 10. icon files as a test background files are essentially a medical data format to store ct images and medical information here you can see it's a ct scan of somebody's lower uh stomach kind of leading up into their lungs so here if we can see the hack revolves around stored data on follow coin which essentially is talking to web3.js in the back but i will prove that by just using console.log real quick so here when i press store data on filecoin it's calling the javascript through webpack so in the background webpack bundles up our javascript and all our modules and that puts that render for us so flask is then able to pass session id information of the data stored on our sqlite database so here we uploaded the data we had async functions promise us that cid is coming back and the cid came back what is not happening is we're not triggering the redirect back to the browser page so we do that manually and that's just simply for development here i take the cid and i store it in the sqlite database and here my cid is in the id input so when i click retrieve data from filecoin i'm able to trigger the javascript code to api call the data stored according to the cid and to prove that this works we can simply delete the upload okay and we're going to retrieve data from file point so we sent the cid off we got our this is what dicom file looks like in json data structure and if we refresh the page we have our restore data with this with the attack in the back end what's happening is that we're pa we're passing an input tag with a session id associated with our data and a class for all the buttons related to file coin so in the basement down here below we pass bundle.js file called filecoin.js which contains all the javascript for web3 storage so web3 storage api allows me to pass the session id then through a series of asynchronous functions here in succession we pass the data and then we wait for a cid this cid to the back end function is a web request of ajax throwing the cid back to the flask app endpoint and this endpoint right here it waits for a response from the javascript uh we have some validation code to see if the cid is already stored on record and then we store the cid in our sql like database here we can see that um these data tables were also coded for the hack where essentially we have id the data was uploaded session id for the data hi how are you doing sorry about that uh that was the video i hope you guys heard it so um any questions um of the project uh yes i mean this uh i'm i'm not familiar so um is there any challenges around storing uh medical data on i mean in the wild in public space like on ipfs yeah uh with filecoin it's exposed on the ipfs so anyone can access it so you know everyone's first question and feedback i've gotten is about encryption just simply with um you know i work a full-time job and i'm self-taught i didn't have time to implement encryption but i've explored i'm interested in chain link because they have articles because if i store all the private keys on the platform and it gets hacked then everyone's medical data gets exposed but the platform's original idea that's not part of the competition is just is to put medical data that's de-identified for researchers so it's to manage and organize their open source databases things like that um but the identification encryption is definitely where i want to go with the project but um just time really oh yeah that makes sense no of course i answer your question i don't care yeah i don't know it does like clearly i mean i think you emailed it like the privacy and the encryption thing is a requirement it's just that um i wonder in the end if it's worth storing on a public space um if you end up having kind of the only place where you can decrypt the data yes it's doesn't make sense uh no sorry could you read it if if you end up building a kind of a centralized version of this where encryption decryption happens in a single space yeah yeah i i wonder yeah what's the what's the benefit of using ipf and that scenario oh no i want to use chain link for the encryption with oracle but we just simply did not get to that implementation yeah but that's where i would want to go in the future cool that makes sense yeah awesome thank you very much okay this year is one of your first hacks or is yeah this is like my first hackathon um right try to keep it as simple as possible um you know i wanted to keep things clear i don't want to use old code but like there's a clear start to end date with what the code is touching so yeah for sure for sure martin uh i just yeah i just have one question leslie uh yeah the ui there was this button right like click for machine learning like what was the thought process there like what's what that was uh from a year ago so like i said um it's built on a platform the platform just allows me to upload the data to a database to develop easier and not read a file off a local disk um that's submit to machine learning was for competition a year long ago where we did a k-means algorithm on ct scans so if you have a ct scan you have pixels right and if you use the k-means algorithm you're grouping pixel pixels according to their hu values and what that means is like grayscale in like the radiology ct world so that algorithm is just narrowing down the region of interest because a lot of deep learning models need preprocessing for let's say um you know if there's a 512 by 512 grid of pixels you're taking in each pixels and that's so much data so the submit to machine learning is just so easy way for a developer or a data scientist to deploy into the platform and then run their code and data with it there's a lot of there's a lot of issues and the reason i'm really attracted by falcoin is that with any startup the cost of storage is heavy and then people want to like federate their machine learning weights so um i just wanted to keep it simple so developers could extend it and they you know open source community kind of like that so that was a little much i'm really sorry about that but that that's a separate project and that was just part of the platform i think also if you're storing data on file point it allows you to collocate the data so so filecoin has the capability where like for example typically your data would be distributed you know randomly uh across ipfs but but there is a way to sort of get the data to be co-located so if you really had to use it for machine learning you actually could and uh and and and filecoin also i think allows for some level of compute so it's a co-location of compute and uh storage uh you might want to look into the docs a bit deeper if you want to have that capability you actually could do that yeah i'm um i'm looking at it i want to use filecoin plus because i've heard something about the 10x multiplier for user data but i want to push for like what about medical data because i've talked to some doctors last year and they need to build a database that's like international database for like liver scans for like liver cancer and they want to go in that direction but you know file coin is speaking to this like global interplanetary storage that i really just want to be a part of that and there's issues like you know i need to share 50 gigabytes with somebody else and like it's not easy and google drive has some problems and all that so yeah yeah i'm with you i want to get go deeper but um you know a full-time job yeah guy got to pay for the server somehow make sense yeah all right good good stuff leslie okay cool thank you guys appreciate it for sure uh leave thank you team open vessels that was great so now we will be moving on to our next presentation and we're gonna have team eth poster hey how's it going how are you perfect i'm doing that right so let me just get it started uh let me share it briefly and one second oh i think i need to one second i'm gonna restart this down let's get started let's get it started hi everyone my name is jose nega i'm a web engineer and blockchain developer and together alongside ari macmillan we're very happy to share with you poster or submission for the hack fs hackathon so poster is a regular simple general purpose socials media smart contract pretty much is six lines of code and that makes um an alongside it with the subgraph from the graph protocol gives us the ability to pretty much create a twitter-like layer to social media network so we put together all the specifications this originally came from a conversation that we put together on twitter that we realized that we wanted to do something alongside social media and in general um metallic from the last ethereum conference share some of the insights that you know social media could be quite a thing on the ethereum blockchain so with all that i do i'm very happy to share with you just the the ui the poster sponsor was deployed on polygon and thanks to its very quick confirmation fees and confirmation speed and very low gas fees it's very easy to actually do something on the network right so right now we can just do like a hello world that we can just very quickly post on the polygon network and what is going to happen actually i mean as you can see that you know it's going to do the confirmation uh it's going to go through the the general metamask workflow but you know the gas fees are minimal sure social media network requires confirmation to execute everything is maybe not very exciting but at the same time and just because it's so cheap and it's so fast uh it's not that bad of an experience right now what it's going through uh is we're gonna do the submission on the ethereum on the polygon network and we also have um a few um subgraphs that are actually fetching that information as it's been submitted so the moment that submission goes through it's being passed and parsed by or or or poster or polygon soft graph and then it's been fetched uh immediately in the application so you can see the application actually went through and then we're able to actually uh preload again another feature that we're able to do is we're able uh to a reply and of course uh that will actually generate another another submission uh to the boston to the blockchain and again you know it's not that exciting because it's just a bunch of submissions but if you're seeing that all on the exciting part about making everything unchained is that it allows us for compassibility right so the benefit of having a social network on top of the blockchain is that everything can be built on top of that right so you can create a tweet out of the whole uh ecosystem and you can create a of a whole of the entire database you can create an nfd based on a single tweet you can create a new subgraph then instead of parsing the text actually just parse emojis so that's the beauty of the whole uh whole blockchain network right so just for the last feature that also takes advantage of the new um of the web3 storage is that um is the just adding an image so we can also add that image which actually uh if you saw it it immediately submitted to the ipfs network using the web3 storage application and for the for the application is just the same thing the only thing that is doing is that it's appending this the cid into the network and actually submitting it so well that has been loaded let me just share with you very briefly uh what is coming next so this is this is pretty much what we have done uh with a positive network and what is coming next is we're probably gonna start exploring some other layer two solutions on top of the polygon network maybe some roll-ups maybe putting an open uh gas network layer on top of that we're looking to probably apply for a grant and yeah that's pretty much it i hope you like it um it's all working you can test it at poster dash app dot on flick.co and yeah thank you everyone for joining awesome well that was pretty much it oh one second i think i'm not hearing you oh sorry can you please ah one second i'm gonna serve my video because i think i might not help in a little bit once i can all right can you try again sorry yes i was going to say you said the domain name posted app dot and then i missed the end yeah applestrap dot on week which is the oh there are actually also providers from uh ipf as well okay yes okay awesome uh yeah i'll check that out um so you said basically uh this can be used uh for um i mean social media but this could be used for beyond social media like all kind of media right you could post articles like i'm thinking in newspapers or you know um whistleblowers could use that to post um stuff that they want to yeah i mean i think that yeah the value comes from being um super generic super simple like i think other social media efforts are trying to analyze the complexity of indexing and analyzing and you know building identity i think being this very append only uh allows us to to really create you know um multiple ways you can create a small subgraph that as long as you post signatures from let's say i don't know or say signatures for specific enterprise you can do that right i mean it is nothing new right i think some some projects uh in the bitcoin network actually that herb ray's case was was you know appending things on up to data right and on that so i think the value here is is that now we have something like graph that allows us to index some of that data uh it allows us to create a composibility world right and i think currently there is a need of some um immutability and some composability on social media networks that make sense cool thank you very much no worries further questions actually no i was going to say it's interesting i i was following the twitter discourse that you were part of so it's interesting to to be in in this judging session and i think it's no um no stretch of the imagination that decentralized social media applications are going to be sort of the next frontier in use cases and necessity in the world um given that i think i'd be interested to sort of hear like next steps for you and your team like what you're what you're planning and what you'll what you'll be getting into and then margin go for it i guess so i think any social media requires adoption to provide any sort of medical data so i think right now the the first thing that we're going to do is remove all barriers of entry so you still need to have a website signing wallet but i think we're probably going to take the approach to either offset the cost from the user so probably have like a gas tank in the back so people don't have to go through the same process or use some uh um you know um smart pre prepared signed a contract that allows you to pretty much offset the cost and the second thing is we have been talking very close to the craft team and i think they're very interested into to the value of having kind of like a general base index in data so having in close talks with them and you know perhaps applying for a grant because the value the real value in appending data uh it's not it's not innovative right but the way how the algorithms let let's say how twitter or facebook uh grab the data that they want to you know quote unquote sell to you or target to you i think that there's a lot of value there so i think that there's not necessarily a lot of work and research that it's open source these private companies have a lot of proprietary intellectual material that you know that know how to target uh these huge data sets uh so the next page will be very close to sitting very close with the graph and under next particles and try to get some leverage to keep you pushed a little bit further very very interesting man so here i just had one observation so i'm just going to type this out real quick in the interest of time so if you so essentially for user flow what you want to use is meta transactions you mentioned open gsn in your roadmap but i would say used by economy so it's much easier to set up and and it would be like much faster they have an sdk approach right there also you might want to use like some sort of uh magic type sign in for that and uh what what a magic type sign name will allow a social media sign in for users you might also want to use a white label wallet in the background like something like venli which sort of makes a user flow really really amazing for the user because you're talking social media and everything your ui ux user flow is basically going to make or break this also reach out to me on telegram i think your views on how that data has to be used is something very interesting and uh you know here at polygon we i would also be interested in like sort of uh figuring out how we can give you guys a grant and then you know sort of uh discussing more on how you're thinking about that problem so so reach out that was great appreciate it arjun uh i know we're in touch in other another channels and i'm very happy to take on that and i'm also very interested for instance and integrating things like the harvest network so the good thing is that uh roll ups is totally adorable right so i'm thinking like similar lines but very interesting let's have a longer conversation just dme sounds good and then you know we can get on a call and discuss this perfect all right uh anything else otherwise i'm very happy to share your time and yeah thank you very much right see ya thank you team eth poster that was great so we'll be moving on to our next presentation and we have team snap nft uh yes i'm here to take pictures and videos hello welcome to team snap nfp we are building an air filter and ft marketplace so it stemmed from the idea of selling code using nfps what if people could build websites in a decentralized manner to build a proof of concept for this we decided to build air filters on nfv so a solution is a decentralized solution for air filters people can use these air filters to take pictures and videos and post it directly on a platform this is handled using what we are calling as executable nfts wherein creators can mint their codes as code as an nfp which can be integrated with the website so on minting any new air filter it is added to the platform people can purchase this nfts using options or directly through the creator and then use these filters on the platform to finally put post what we plan to do is to integrate our creation of this ar filter code through instagram and snapchat creator studio we also want to streamline the ui ux of the application and finally we want to build a generic sdk along with a generic platform for minting of executable nf so this is the implementation with the flowchart which you can have a look on our github repo so now i will move to uh the demo so we will first go through the filter screen this is the place where you can easily and quickly create filters uh uh you can add a description you can add name uh you can upload a logo uh you can add amount uh which for which the nft should be sold uh you can add the percentage that should go to a creator on each sale and the percentage which should go to the previous owner this is how the card would be displayed and these are the prices in each and matic so all this metadata that we have added we are using protocol labs nft storage for storing that and finally we are using the content hash and url along with metadata url to mint nfts z and ft's using xora protocol once the upload is complete we can preview our nfd filter and then mint it on using xora so now i will preview the filter which we have uploaded as you can see this is the tiger filter which we were waiting for when the tiger opens its mouth it throws out bubbles which is quite cool isn't it and we will quickly go to home to see the nfts that we already have as you can see the tiger is added so we can save these filters to create posts from here these posts are created using ceramic protocol and these which which are stored into each bucket and we are saving these images into ipfs so let's see one another nifty filter that we created the statue of liberty filter as you can see it looks quite cool uh we will quickly go to the posts page and so here you can see this is the tiger man nft that we created while creating the nft we can add title description and music url which is stream using audios as you can see this plays as we open the card [Music] then the last page is the other nft split page uh this we have implemented using covalent so this grabs all the nfts uh external nfts that the user holds and if the nfts are images we which are compatible we can show them as background in our canvas so it's stem from the idea of selling code using yeah yeah and that's it for the demo so we also integrated super fluid but could not fit that feature into the video uh that can be used for renting of filters and using them instead of buying directly can you tell me about the superfluid integration like i'm not sure i understand so basically uh below the filter so this is an extended video we will quickly uh show you the favorite part as well home page okay so now let's go to the filter marketplace screen here uh user can see all the snap infps are executable nfps which is not held by and which are for sale or rent as you can see these are the filter buttons similar to what we saw on home screen along with that there are buy and rent buttons so let's click on rent on clicking on rent what happens is we start a superfluid stream which is based on the stream amount is based on what creator added in the beginning once that super fluid scene starts we will open the same model that we show that we have shown you on the home screen and user is able to take a picture and post uh his picture along with the song as a post on the platform which again uses ceramic only so user can click on stop rental or they can post the image and stop rental closes the nft stream and similarly post as you can see over here a user can also put a bid on the nft which uses zora to set the bid for that nft which the creator or the holder can accept also yeah that is the completed any questions so i see you uh uh scaffolding here uh is there any other uh framework that you used or yeah what are the tools that you use for this specific hack yeah so uh the other technologies we have already gone through uh other than scaffolding we use a face filter face filter library which uses basically neural networks to get your face points and converts it into a mesh which we can then use to create uh these filters basically it grabs different images and attaches it to specific locations in the mesh there is there is a 3d animation and 3d engine built into that library we are just using that library and putting together all the json images and other stuff and generating providing the framework for user creator to give a executable version of the animation yeah so we divided the filter part and the model part of the library so that we can separate out the nft as a code okay make sense and other than that we have used different storage technologies we just wanted to go through some of them and understand what are the good things and the bad things about each of them along with that we have used zora to mint the nfts and handle them and superfluid to handle uh the renting part and chain link and chain link to get the price in ether matic using price consumer contract and audios to play the video play the audio sorry current nfts what we see is mostly images like i think in real world people want to media rich nfts which has association with the animation and along associate with the audio of their favorite songs so this is a media rich version of the nfl yeah so what we feel is this this can be easily extended to other codes as well so you can create a platform where people can mint uh their code along with the nft to provide a service let's say and possibly people can add integrations to the an existing website uh with uh similar to let's say google chrome extensions uh using nfts and they can monetize along with that cool thank you very much very interesting i like the fact that you've like worked with so many different technologies i think that you know we've given you guys like lots of learning on how like all of them work together i i would still say that you know like like there's a lot of discussions around you know using documents and even code for example admitting them as nfts but the problem happens is that let's say for example you write some code right and you meant that as an nft i'll take the same code add a space bar right and then remit that rft so so you know using minting code as nfts has not been i would say like you know very successful uh let's say as a concept or even with documents right because those kind of problems exists like honor although to be fair you can then you know detect these frauds as well fairly easily um but you know i could like sort of add a few comments in there etc mix around the code and then you know there could be fights so you know whether this code is you know plagiarized or not uh considering that you know detecting frauds for like let's say image nft is far easier than you know detecting a crowd here so i would say that i think the streaming or concept of renting out nfps for me is like the most interesting part uh because i know that there are already a bunch of games like comments etc where you rent out nfts and use them even uh axi and then you know having like this kind of concept here where you know for for every time like instead of every time i use the nft it is i have to pay for it versus you know uh like for example having to pay a flat rate when i rent them is is i think very interesting for me so so i think good good thinking that great thank you team snap nft um if the judges do not have any more questions we can move on to the next presentation and up next we have team doe maker there we welcome to dole maker turning data into dough so what is dolemaker doll maker is an easy way to convert data into do essentially a new cool web 3 based ipfs method of monetizing your data so how does it work so don't make her the story is very simple we have liz liz is a really cool tick tocker she has lots of information lots of great content that she generates yes she creates and that she curates and but she doesn't know what to do with it because it's so much enter dough maker so what doe maker does for liz is that dough maker takes all of her content and data right in a small bite size and it puts it into ipfs storage it then surfaces the data to people like martin who like to follow liz but they're not keen in terms of trolling her entire tick tock profile to find one link which she posted in march of 2020 so they use dome maker which basically helps them assemble different little bite-sized pieces of liz's data set with those bite-sized pieces in order to access those bite-size pieces martin basically subscribes to liz's files that she's uploaded and the subscription money goes into dollmaker and eventually gets to lives but there's a problem unfortunately we can't pay liz out until martin's subscription is over and the modern subscription might only expire after two weeks so what we've cunningly done is that we've basically used off to basic to manage um the deposits of the subscription fees paid by martin into off and we give liz an early payment loan whereby she can take her money nice and early as soon as martin has subscribed [Music] all the while we are provided with consistent pricing of our chain link because different prices can be set at different point in time and we have in addition to that on martin's site martin can create an nft data byte which he can surface on zora using doe maker um and basically he saves the results from um uh his searches of liz's data right into things which he thinks will sell as as uh nft data bytes and posts post them using maker into zurich supported auctions and he can monetize the liz's information that way on liz's side liz can also use zura to create an a data nft which is different from a data by nft in that um this is basically liz um turning her entire data set into an nft and when she sells this nft she doesn't doesn't just sell the data she also sells all the revenues that are going with that data uh which are being acquired uh through dolemaker so that way if she finds that you know she's a really cool data set and it's worth um a lot of money she can now simply sell the data all of her data and all of the revenue from it because she now has a real world valuation which she wouldn't be able to get in any other context even with ocean protocol so that is dough maker very complicated but also very simple and we have web3 ipfs that manages all of the storage um [Music] and it helps us to keep the lights on and keep everything running and so that's dough maker turning data into dough okay any questions uh thank you very much this is uh really interesting uh this was a presentation obviously uh did you have time to actually implement um that or oh yeah yeah give me a second so this is the ui that we managed to uh to implement so you can upload your files here that gives you the ability to monitor your collateral your auctions the file uploads you can see how many subscriptions you're actually getting uh you can see your recent uploads here and on the flip side if you're looking for stuff then you can basically search stuff tells you which new categories are within new keywords and then you've got your results here the new stuff that people have been uploading on the other side if you want to subscribe to it you know your current subscription should you have them to save results if you want to turn those into auctions and the current options that you've actually got going good okay and and this is uh this is another uh i mean what you showed us was kind of a i call this uh a placeholder html there's no actual code behind it right no there is there is code behind it we just didn't get to quite finish it because this is quite a lot of code it looks like it's very small but it's it's massive because it's trying to bring what yeah what were the biggest challenges from the technical perspective that you faced when you were uh ipfs and blockchain uh well i ipfs and ethereum bring those two together uh because it's kind of like um [Music] because ipfs is more like storage and it doesn't have a lot of libraries which are very like you know i'll just click this and we'll do all the ethereum stuff for you you've kind of got to work out the sids and then you've got to put the sids into the contracts and then you better check the sins and so that was a challenge on the design side implementation wise it's pretty straightforward to use javascript to do that but um from a design from a design perspective i think there's there's uh yeah there's an opportunity there for sure and what were the biggest challenges that you um i mean what are sorry what are the next steps that you're thinking about so the next steps of this project is the idea is to basically sort of like uh you know get get us further on um sort of like pull out as many of the generic components which are in there which would be of use to sort of like other projects which you're trying to build in the space build those get brands to build those with with with partners just to make it sort of easier to do things like you know sort of like upload and uh drop your data onto a contract and keep yourself secure or at least as secure as you can do and also do things like encryption because one of the things which sort of occurred to me during the judging session is the fact that you know people you tell them don't put sensitive data or stuff with your address on it and that's exactly what they'll do and ipfs well it's nice and open so it means we'll have a lot of problems so basically sorting those types of problems out and working out how we can do that effectively that that's kind of like the next step of the project and you know trying to get as much funding as we can so that you know we don't have to worry about the day job great cool awesome that was really helpful yeah i'm really really excited about what you were able to create such a short amount of time and you know the ux ui designer in me is you know pretty impressed by the ui you were able to put together for your project with with all the other considerations being made um in a perfect world i mean what would you add to this you know if time and money you know if neither were concerns for you um what i'd add to this uh i would i would i would add tick-tock continuation because this is like perfect for tick-tockers because they're creating so much data and i'm not gonna lie that's where i learned most of my stuff you know i mean it's like it was facebook but now it's tick-tock and and basically it's like it's helping people to consume data much better uh and and use web3 in a real way uh that's non-gaming and that is actually very effective because the thing is people are learning and they're learning a lot and so this would help people with that and uh yeah 100 man 100 i i can already see that great job thank you thank you team uh dollmaker that was great and so now we're going to be moving on to our next presentation and we'd like to welcome team land pier uh yeah thank you for having us uh let me share my screen hello everyone uh this is um opinion here i worked with four other team members in this project so five people in total um and our product is called land here now the objective of lampier is to be able to get recordings of parcels slash land from the metaverse and you can display as a video over here at the me meta website now the point of this is because people who want to buy land might not have the tools to be able to access decentraland like for example using a windows machine without the proper graphics card and all the um computer components to be able to run uh decentraland might they might not have it which in this case they can watch a video instead of having to go in game uh themselves and view the parcel now let's go look at the demo now over here in localhost which i'm running locally we are generated with the stream key and we are given a stream url now the point of these is because using the live peer api we are able to get the stream key which we will be able to use the live peer network to be able to stream and be able to record our streams now we can copy our stream key over here and we can head to obs we can go to our preferences and we can go to stream and we can set our stream key over here now the server i've already set it but users will normally go over here and copy the url and they would put it over here and they would set their service to custom now we can press ok and we can start streaming now that our streaming has started it has it has told the live peer api to be able to start the stream now we can head on to an in game and we can show off whatever we wanted to show off um [Music] and this point is our little it's a little box showing around some art now after we have shown around some art we will be able to go back to our extension and we before that we need to head to obs and stop our stream now once your stream has stopped we will be able to go over here and be able to press play but the live peers api takes five minutes for the video to load for the video to process and everything so now we will let it load and we will be able to show uh play it once it's loaded now it also gives the error saying the stream is currently processing if the user tries to play it when the stream hasn't processed yet now after five minutes the stream must have been processed which we can see in our live peer dashboards if we go into sessions we can see our test stream that we created and we can see our recording url and uh the mp4 has been generated on the developer dashboard now if we go back to our browser we can click play now it will start to load the stream and once this has been loaded because it might take some time due to the the longevity of the video but after it has loaded we will be able to press play and we can watch our recording right here now our get coordinates button will be able to get coordinates from the exact website right here we can get the specific coordinates we need to be able to generate it in our me meta website to be able to get the exact parcel location now our record button was supposed to be uh able to be using an in browser solution opposed to obs which we couldn't have get done due to some limitations and that is basically our learn to use and go with sick uh yeah that's our uh video we have for today so uh can you hear me yeah of course yeah cool so basically you're recording so you're recording through the uh obs is that right i'm not familiar with the streaming software uh so we you're recording and then you're selling the videos themselves as nfts is that correct uh no what we're doing is we're using the videos to be able to show the users how their lan looks like so when they purchase the land they will be able to see a preview of what the land looks like without having to use the hardware and resources of their laptop or computer because i mean again i'm not very familiar with decentralized but like aren't the parcels visitable without owning them uh yeah they're visible but the problem is they use high resources uh on your machine and so when you're trying to join in it could really lag out some stuff and it'll really be an unpleasant experience so using videos would be much easier for users to be able to check the land out without having to jump in themselves okay yeah so essentially um it's much quicker you can click on the parcel and then it gives you that video preview about what it looks like below i see that's great okay and the videos are uploaded to ipfs i assume um as of now they are not but we plan to implement it okay cool um is there any uh i mean what was the uh the biggest lesson i don't know what's the yeah what's the what's the what's take home from this what did you learn in this hackathon we learned how to use the live peer api and which we can send data and receive data um and the problem is um the issues we had sorry is when we try to implement the in browser solution we couldn't be able to set the custom rtmp which uh so the server we used uh had to be live here but the um the sorry the project that we that we tried to use for the in-browser uh solution wouldn't be able to connect to the live pier one and they use their own separate um protocol easy okay cool yeah we also got together with a live peer representative and he kind of instructed us on how to properly use it i see cool it's awesome what's sort of what are the next steps i was going to say what's next step so great great i think gumdrop steve would be able to answer that best yeah um so i'm with we've met um essentially what we want to do here is we want to plug it in so we just released our aggregator like this morning or late last night technically it was supposed to be the day before but technical details right um yeah and so the next the next step is obviously cleaning up a few more things uh and then uh putting this in so that when someone goes to our aggregator and they're clicking it's basically like a zillow for the metaverse so we have a decentraland right now you click on a parcel and instead of just seeing the map you actually see a video uh or a short clip segment of what's actually there and the angle what we talked to eric about from live live care about is setting up solutions and key points in the metaverse like around the metaverse where you identify like key foot traffic yeah and so that people can just constantly watch that and we're probably going to use a headless solution for that um on the back end oh cool yeah so basically headless would be like you would automate the recording from right okay and then it can just run the whole all day and so i i think that especially as the metaverse bros you're gonna see like central you know meet up places like times square but in the metaverse and so having a constant feed of what that looks like and then from our website you can already jump right i'm not it maybe it may it may be one of those things that we have to technically you know fix a few urls or whatever but you can jump directly into the parcel and so i kind of see it as a it's a it's a view into the world and you would just go straight them so you can see like oh this is what it looks like right now that looks fun let me go john oh it's almost like cctv where you can jump into the thing yeah yeah exactly okay pretty cool nice dress on any other questions i'm good on my end it was great i'm all good too really great job guys yeah opie and john really crushed us they did the overwhelming majority of it uh so all credits you might have mentioned this i might have missed it was this your first time hacking together as a team yeah yeah yeah so i i've i've done each level account before uh we actually won the web three a while back um and so i kind of just wanted to come back for like the mems uh and then avi and john i believe this is their first and so hopefully it was an enjoyable experience and i didn't you know ruin it for them excited to see everybody excited to have you back you know i i hope i hope to see you guys for ethan online yeah well our the goal with as long as the company keeps going is to do as many of these as possible uh we think it's a great way to stay involved in the ecosystem and on board new people that's why we do it thank you thank you team led peter that was great so we're going to be moving on to um our next presentation and i'd like to welcome on uh team time rose oh hello hi ryan hello yeah uh cameras uh basically tamaros is the big the idea is quite big on it and it's quite simple that is index in the database based on faircon mpfs firstly let me give a short introduction introduction about kin labs the key labs use the research driven labs for for ipfs and faircoin and the goal of king legacy to create a research environment and also give the opportunity for the product and we want want to get the benefit from the research and also we want to get some some products from the research and and that some new things we can imagine today and our team members is from um different countries william is from england and aber is from beijing china and uc is from chicago from usa and me is is located in chengdu of china we have basically the team have built uh have built a biggest fair commander service provider in china we have built the biggest banner pool in china and we are familiar with the faircon ipfs but after the fair calm minute we think of that the fair code as the change of the fair coin many is not very interesting so we move to the new areas for next steps that we that's why we set up the king labs and do the index things how does king labs works the uh we follow the research philosophy of female algorithm to solve the problems the basic result is write down the problem and think is very hard and write down down solution okay the mission of the collapse is to build the cloud 2 of the web 3. basically you can see um you can think of the the card to have computation storage and specialized protocols for example we will we'll do some computation based on the fair presence of fpfs and we also do some indexing for the falcon storage fspn service and some on-premise data providers and uft storage the key point is the specialist protocol for example content service discovery and the contents delivery so the cloud two in the developer stack we build the transaction transaction layer uh and the actual layer you know um the smart contract of the fair coin is coming very soon uh based on the smart contact we can build the actor layer now for this service and have the instrument governance and the self-serving and identity now will also be the data plan uh maybe the count may be based on the story market and the reaching market we also build the control counter plan of the reaching market content content discovery and the graphic database and index service et cetera and the indexing uh easy in cultural need integrates with the marketplace for example we build the index for the data plan uh not only for the umpteen and also for the off team based on the control plane we build the quality api for the youtube market and necessarily market and in future we we will build the service discovery for the computation competition market okay let us move the demo uh basically we have to do some demos previously now i just give some picture of the demo uh from the high level point of view you can see the three layer of the index service data plane control and the incentive plan oh sorry you can see uh you can current work we are doing is interacting too uh you can see of the index and two is indexing the uh the local um local data local uh datasets and the and post the metadata and the index data to the index node the index 2 uh is for example you can think of that as ipfs watch and i have everything tools that also integration and the index service and the post the index metadata to the index node you can see the index the metadata in the timeless gui and we also we can dive into the metadata of the each phase for example the dg metadata that is basic name of the uh our current plc now for next step we will do the uh currently we are to the uh we are doing the uh options indexing obviously to market and accounting the discovery we also did the uh ancient indexing for example the ancient data size display and and data analysis for the engine data set anti-data size and next step we will do the max indexing for some for example smart config contract and the next step will do the service discovery that is basically the journal map and of the time rules any questions this this is really interesting um so you mentioned you're one of the biggest or if not the biggest provider for file county in asia in china is that right yeah uh when you say you're indexing the data is the purpose to help the miners uh is the purpose to help kind of content discovery what's the yeah what is the purpose of the indexing yeah the index is not only for the uh for the fair commanders is the uh is the data plan uh uh often i mean the different storage and also for ipfs uh the often data providers for examples uh i mean the fair commanders is here okay so the goal is to also help i mean the miners but not just the miners yeah okay and uh how is the data made available is that also stored in ipfs or or filecoin here or is that consumed from other apis for frequent manners we get the data from the deal the deal list and get the data through the deals and for ipvs we integration we consume uh ingested the uh the the ipfs pinners and some other uh on-premise data assets to integration with this indexing tool but the the the index data is that made available publicly or do you just use that locally uh on the node um we will make it um publicly and currently uh we we are aligned the target of the faircoin teams that is the index node maybe centralize the index node great thank you very much yeah this is super cool um which uh if you could go into detail a little bit more about which part um you were working on like during the hackathon specifically i'm sort of i'm trying to piece together what the focus was for the past few weeks yeah for the hexon we are focusing uh this part is from indexing to uh to the index node and we build the is kind of kind of graphic database in the index node and we have we have the local index in the uh in the story strategy provider and we also watch the uh the detached size change and uh post the new metadata to the index node and the current that is the current we are working awesome thank you we wanted to get help from the hacksaw uh get more people involved in the youtube market and the indexing service uh we also wanted to meet new friends and get new engineers to join us currently we have about 10 engineers in our team and the half of them is research engineer and and half of them is going in golang uh engineer that's awesome were they were they all here for the hackathon or were you able to have some of your team here uh they are not in the capsule because we need to speak some easter eggs another um people join this uh awesome thank you for thank you for walking us through it thank you tv memory thank you team time rose that was great and uh with that that is the last presentation of our event now going to share my screen i finished my part sorry i think you're still shy okay um how is the rusher thank you thank you no thank you sorry can you see my screen nope okay there we go yes all good perfect so yeah that is the last um presentation of our event i'd like to take this opportunity to thank um all our judges julian thank you for your time as well as all the hackers the teams you guys were absolutely great as well as our zoom admin as well as our timekeeper and luke of course thank you so much and arjun oh yes awesome awesome guys thank you very much it was great really interesting to see all of these projects very nice too yeah when i saw some unique ideas today so especially that one about uh that social media uh idea right how they could potentially monetize data just like some very interesting angles could be found there love to say some very interesting stuff yeah okay make sure to uh follow up with uh kartik after this i think he might have a um something to this sort of debrief on um but i think we'll be closing the stream now um all right good thank you everyone thank you good night for those in the uh on the evening side all right bye-bye [Music] you
