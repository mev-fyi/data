[Music] um [Music] all right welcome everybody and uh welcome to hack fest judging day seven my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of beat global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you for uh for this call today is our last day of judging this is day seven and group number 10 for judging and for those of you who don't know hackerfest was a month-long hackathon that each global did with protocol labs to have people play with and experiment with what's possible with storage and smart contracts so over the past four weeks we had over 470 hackers from 50 different countries 19 different time zones work on projects of their own choosing to see what they can actually do in the world of decentralized storage in in smart contracts and i'm super happy to announce that over the course of this event we had 132 projects that came out of this and we took this entire week to showcase all these projects to all of us uh and uh in judging them over this uh call so before we go into all of our demos for today i want to quickly walk through some of the logistics of this event and how judging will be set up today and uh the kind of the quick just evolve this thing is that there will be 12 teams that are going to be coming on over the next two hours and each team will have four minutes for a demo in four minutes for q a and to make sure that we have no av issues we've asked all of our teams to pre-record their demos so we can go through all of them smoothly a quick overview on how the event itself was set up the projects you're going to see today um we're done with uh with groups of up to five team members a lot of them uh are working on these projects individually as well and everything we're going to see today was written over the course of the hackathon which is in the month of july and also all tools and as a criteria to be eligible for this event everything you're going to see today was required to incorporate technologies and tools from the protocol labs into their ecosystem so we were seeing some really really creative mixes of what you can do with decentralized storage and smart contracts so as we move on to how judging is going to work our judges are going to be looking at a project in asking them on how technical original practical and usable a project is and we understand that everybody has different and varying skill sets and these four categories may not be enough so to make sure that we account for other possible ways to score a team we have this catch-all we like to call the wow factor to help make it easy for all of our judges to score and rate these teams so before we move on i want to just emphasize this event is not a competition the hackers are very much here to learn we have so many beginners here at this event that are playing with what's possible with falcoin and also ethereum and they're very much here to share the excitement and demo you what they got uh built over the course of the past four weeks and the judges are here primarily to give feedback and encourage them and offer their suggestions on how they can take this to the next step and and just to kind of really emphasize this not everybody's trying to become a business our goal is very much experimentation and giving people the opportunity to play with and improve how we can make the system better so with that said uh these are the projects that are going to be coming on today and doing their hard job are going to be our three judges i want to welcome ayush adjusting from protocol labs austin griffith from the ethereum foundation and bradley milligan from ens domains and with that i want to welcome them here on this call and we'll kick off with our very first demo and that is team erc20 reward engine for online forums so i see y'all is here kick it off with uh sharing your video hi everyone can you hear me okay yeah hey perfect so should i share my screen now and play the videos that'll be great and make sure you check the share audio box yep okay can you see my screen it's good um so i'm gonna play just a two minute video just to introduction about the background of this project and why we're doing it and then after the two minutes i'm gonna do a real demos to you guys and hopefully um it'll be fun and a lot of questions from you guys and feedback welcome so um let's get started hi everyone thank you for watching this video we are the developers behind ffo ffo is a decentralized online forum platform similar to facebook groups or reddit except you actually control the content control your privacy and and there's a lot more to it lots of people actually creating their groups on facebook or reddit without knowing that they don't actually have a lot of control of their own content think about what happened a couple years ago with google plus communities think about just what happened last year with with the yahoo groups that being shut down we we don't know how long the facebook groups already can last but it's certainly not forever we've been thinking about how we can build something in a decentralized way for online forms so that great content great discussions um on the online communities can live on forever so um we find out ipfs when we really really like it and we are just we take a lot of ideas from traditional online forums and you sort of package them together and have it run on top of ipfs so but our vision about ffo is not just about putting the content on the ipfs decentralized not in a decentralized way but we also think about in addition to the content what about the the governance of the communities what about the ownership of the community what about the use of prophecies uh have confidence knowing that the community he built on this new platform is going to last forever and it's actually owned by them so these are the quick two minute videos i hope you can hear it okay so basically just a quick background we are building an extensions on top of everfull and uh but the same extension will also be compatible with any other traditional on iphone platform so this the extension that we're building it's a it's a elc 20 tokens airdrops um we will engines for communities meaning that any commodities whether they are crypto communities or or they are not they they can us they can still create easily create their own erc training tokens easily so um not only creating it but also ability to reward it so uh for the sake of this demo i i created two groups so i'm gonna demo it uh in what we have done uh in this month so we started groups um in every photo and then and there is extension you can enable so this is specifically we built for this project so once you enable it uh you see the crypto air drop tabs you can actually create a new token or you can actually use existing tokens so for this demo for this group i create a new token token a and then token a uh two so it's actually connect to um to the to the test net right now and actually creating the the smart contract in the back end so i think the takes about a minute to create it so um without wasting our time uh why don't we um go to another groups that i also created to um to demonstrate um the um the ability to not only create token but also you can choose existing elc training tokens um for example you can you can choose um this is just for the demo but this is actually the testnet token that we created for example you want to create you want to import your your bitcoin you want to use bitcoin to airdrop to rewatch your member you can choose it and then um and then it will actually um respond with the uh the wallet that you can actually import uh dmam and you can actually set the rules um to how how you're gonna reward your members so um for this demo i'm gonna just show how the import is being done here um i'm gonna show you the metamask and then i um let me see it's not connected okay so let's see i transfer um one thousand nine ten thousand okay yeah we also want to have some time for q a so if uh right so um okay so so basically you import it and then and then you create it and you can actually add rules uh how you want to rework your members for example you want to reward it um one token for one one new topic for example you entered the email and then you created one topics and then you were able to um to um to customize the rules so let's say you you create new topics and then as a member you will see you are being rewarded from here right here okay so basically it's how the community owners to configure the um the reward to their members to encourage participation and so on and as a member you can certainly interrupt a couple questions yes um so i'm just a little confused uh sorry i can't i can't hear you um well okay uh can you hear me now uh it's it's very hm well maybe it's my video okay okay he can try again uh yeah so okay good uh yeah i guess i'm just so where is the where's the information actually living if i you know created some group and i'm making some posts and so on where is that information living i don't think i got that okay so the you mean the content right the post right yeah they are they actually store it in ipves right now so um if i show that to you um on the screen here uh let's say i um i go to another groups for example i go this groups um let's say i post this content here oh this is all content so um let me think so basically when you create something here um you're not sharing your screen right now just oh okay oh yeah sorry um yeah i also think yeah we could just talk about it okay okay cool so so basically you you will see a um a ipfs logo so you see this hit right here can you see it yeah so when all the content i actually synchronize with ipss uh so this these are the being hosting this content right now okay cool yeah and is it also coordinated on ethereum like so you're pushing the content to ipfs but then there must be like the app must have to talk to some kind of uh other like like i get that there's erc20 tokens and those are being used on ethereum for like uh reward systems and stuff but what does the content also go on ethereum uh no the content is not the the content is only on ips right now so so it's all ips cool yeah right right so but the the ethereum right on ethereum so basically you can in the future we envision that you can actually use voltain to select moderators with the same token that that the homeowners had dropped to their members by the report engine and so on so everything hopefully step by step will be more decentralized over time so but for this project we're specifically creating the the the evm um airdrops um token so that just a beginning of the journey of the decentralized governance basically that's kind of what reddit is doing too right they they have done a couple different tokens and they're trying to use those as incentives so that's it's a cool example of that the ui is gorgeous too yeah you're i was going to say that too your us beautiful i love how it looks yeah yeah yeah i wanted to comment on that yeah i mean the ui looks great um so just so i understand are do you have a team was this by yourself did you use a framework for the ui like how did you achieve this ui so um we are using the um the note.js and um we've been building it for six months just forever full for the platform but for this hackathon we we specifically spent last month just to build the elc training tokens for air drops so um that project's been going around for a couple months and we just launched it two months ago and we're thinking about how we can sort of getting more attention and um using this hackathon as a way to motivate our team to continue to work on things that's the most important to them and we have three people by the way uh we have years of experience on online forms platforms so um we built a lot of plug-in for like we bulletin b2b so we know the pain of the homeowners and the end users um and and i personally love facebook groups i think that ui is fantastic but uh um but there's a lot of disadvantage to it right being a more wealthy old guy so i want to marry that interface with um the old spirit of online forms where it's a lot more freedoms back in the day in the news groups in ntp you can host your own new server and you can use your own client without too much control from from from someone else so so we wanted to bring back that kind of feeling to everyone yeah okay that's that's great so that that's that makes a lot of sense so you're saying that the the hackathon project is adding the erc20 functionality to everfurrow that's the hackathon project yeah yeah but the way right yeah the way we structure it is so that the extension can be repackaged for other traditional forms so that not just ffo but any any form that been around for 20 years can start incorporating this into that uh we'll move on to our second episode for the day thanks so much thank you very much thank you yeah yeah i see the team is here so i'll let uh free mail come hello hi robert feel free to kick off the okay the video to begin my hello today i will be presenting free mail so why is pure pure messaging useful first of all the receiver and sender can be obfuscated and it is encrypted so what makes female unique first of all it's extensible it can be used with any email client including outlook and thunderbird we have authenticated encryption the sender and receiver are obfuscated and data is stored on a decentralized database so what is female made with first of all orbit db the ipfs mongodb lib sodium 3box and smtp server here's the thunderbird client and daniel if you would like to talk daniel okay so uh here's uh the thunderbird client and uh in the back and we can see that running a nodemailer a nodemailer smtp server that's sending messages to myself and we don't really have a front end we use a client and in this case it's underwear getting mail there are locally stored there's a locally stored address book that is in mongodb collection that associates ethereum addresses with orbitdb documents to listen to when a new header is detected in the orbit db inbox it is decrypted and linked content is retrieved from the ipfs and content is decrypted and sent to a local server we use devcop from there we can view your email with your favorite email client we use thunderbird for sending mail locally stored address books also stored in a mongodb collection associates ethereum addresses with orbit db documents to write to the email client the email client or thunderbird is set up to send to the outgoing mail server on port 1587. in actuality we are running the server on port 1587 that interceptor's message encrypts it and pushes it to the ipfs after this an appropriate header is generated and sent to the orbitdb document orbitdb so each person has a general inbox which contains a public key and is used to begin a messaging database a new document database is created whenever a person starts messaging another person only these two people know the orbit db address of this document so currently email addresses follow this pattern after first communication orbit addresses for further communications are negotiated however the first commit communication remains tricky currently the general inbox contains an ethereum compatible signature for verification in the future put the id of the general inbox in a three box profile to secure with your ethereum address and prevent spoofing thank you okay so we currently cannot demo uh because my partner has thunderbird set up and everything on his computer running arch linux i'll kind of pick it off and i'll let you guys just take over but what made you uh wants to do this i mean this is a super cool project especially the reported reception here but uh what what kind of decided you to uh make this work uh so we we thought about it and uh okay uh we thought about it and how how has this not been made yet basically uh the the receiver and sender are totally obfuscated and no one even the government can uh find out what's happening so we thought it was a really cool idea and it was inter it was interesting and we would love to make this work yeah no i think it looks really cool um and we need something like this uh so what's the so does the demo work all the way i think okay daniel is trying to say something here yeah but we can't hear you trent is uh let me make sure there's not some maybe sitting on our side looks like it's leave and rejoin or something yeah you could talk us through it i'd like to know about the encryption so are you using do you fall back on like three blocks to handle encryption or are you doing the encryption yourself uh we used a library called user uh we used a library called lib sodium and that was this loop sodium yeah we're using public and private keys to uh obfuscate like headers and all the information and this is all running on a local node.js app that has to connect to a client sorry uh so pardon me can you hear me now yes yes okay okay good um so sorry i just wanted to uh more thoroughly answer the previous there was a previous question about the rough um like the motivation behind this and uh just kind of while robert answered it greatly uh it's helpful to think of like a practical example so uh the the real thing that that i i thought was you know the like application was uh for example the case of edward snowden right where he wanted to communicate with the the uh journalist i forgot her name but uh in order to communicate with her if i if i'm not mistaken he uh you know accessed he needed to create like an email account somewhere right uh because he he couldn't constantly run his own server um so he would you know go through the tor network onto uh gmail create a new gmail account i i think it was gmail through said tor network and then uh you know through a third friend negotiate the um the public private keys right uh sorry the the public key that he would uh you know that so uh our system is supposed to um make that bit simpler because it's impossible to tell the difference kind of between um nodes in the ipfs network as in you don't know where a message is actually coming from right the the tor network here is not is not a problem there isn't you know like a client server model where the client the sorry the server could maintain you know um record of who's connecting and so on so um sorry with so what was the or were there any other questions i'm sorry i've been we bounced around with the encryption but i think it got answered yeah it's yeah uh so and so and does this currently work oh that that so um right now yeah uh the encryption like has is not it things are not being encrypted fully um but as as it stands yeah i can create an account and i can send an email um and it it does push it to ipfs and then it does receive the header uh in the the i i have not tested this with multiple accounts i've only tested it sending one email to like to yourself but the two systems the server and the system that's supposed to send the email to your imap server so like the smtp server sort of and the the sender program they both clearly do work and the ipfs is the link between and i can shut like kill the program start it up again and it will receive the emails that were sent before so that's you know it's persistent in ipfs yes yeah great cool yeah i i think this is great um i think uh i i definitely agree with your how does this how has this not already been built yet uh sentiment uh i think there have been some some attempts at building something like this but better but it's great um good job yeah uh to add on i think i think it's called mail chain it's something like mail chain i think i've seen something like this before where they use ethereum addresses to encrypt messages like email back and forth but i think what you guys have done here with the like the hijacking the smtp is something i've never seen before like getting it to interface with a traditional client was pretty brilliant i think that was a cool move well thank you it's only like a fake it only interfaces right it just like proxies it basically yeah it doesn't send it to like gmail or something it doesn't really yeah well thank you so thank you awesome thank you so much springmill and then with that we'll move on to our third demo and that is reddit now so i'll be playing this video for the team and then the team will be here to answer any questions hi welcome to the demo video for the abridged hackfest hackathon submission we're here to empower cooperative economies with reddit the vision for this project involves leveraging cryptocurrency to encourage humans of reddit to create value for their specific community and the problem we solve is really simplifying the scary user experience of onboarding into web3 today the onboarding experience prevents about 99 of people from using crypto due to standards like metamask transaction costs are simply intolerable and so our solution is to use dao ops which is building web 3 and web 2 and creating systems that integrate both of these technologies in order to create a nice and fluid user experience the stack includes the abridged sdk a taurus login and oauth system as well as k channels to scale and our solution includes this advanced private key management system state channels and relayer and of course using the reddit interface to make token distribution extremely seamless time for the demo okay so i'm a new user um i'm called eth the ether world and i'm just joining this new subreddit that i really think is super cool um i'm like reading through this new thread and be like wow wow this post is awesome and you know the purpose of our demo really is making it as easy as possible for people to actually get onboarded and begin receiving tokens and so i'm you know just hanging out and boom immediately and greeted by a bot who's like thanks for commenting please claim your reward and i don't know what this means really i don't really need to know what this means but i'm immediately directed out of the page to a new wallet this is using the taurus login with the bridged contract account on the back end in the future we have some ways to make this more seamless to be all built within the reddit interface but uh right now this is what we're what we're building with we now see that okay yes i have received one moon which is really epic like i didn't do anything i didn't even know what a moon is but at very least i am able to actually start monitoring what this means and if it does have monetary value i can immediately see that the next piece here um is like continuing to understand okay so if i like am around here and i i'm like thanks um lurkey wikibot thank you for the moon i really appreciate it and the system will continue to give points based on contributions in this in this in this page and i know this is really gameable for now but it's a very simple proof of concept and eventually you can make a system that's more modular that people will be able to or admin will be able to monitor or provide different solutions for and so once you have these moons and i just received another one for that second comment i can withdraw from the k channels so this withdrawal is actually going to bring the moons from layer two down to layer one this is using the abridged relayer and the nice thing about the ridge relay is that it is configurable so you could have within this reddit a an ability to at um lurkybot or at some of the other users and send moons either on layer 2 two other people or you can actually withdraw those moons onto layer one using the relayer and this relay is configured for eth payments and so it's actually sending some eth to the user so that they can pay for this transaction it's not requiring any refund and the relay is also just the cost of a single transaction and the other piece here is that you can actually pay in moons and configure the relayer for paying so in minutes awesome that was a cool demo so i'll uh i'll let the judges take over questions but maybe one quick clarification for myself here is this is like not a chrome extension or anything else this is just the reddit api interfacing as normal comments that you now link to your bridges is that correct that's yeah that's exactly correct so just integrate into the reddit api yeah like custody is a cool thing to start talking about kind of piggybacking on that sort of like they're logging in with taurus so taurus handles the private keys is how it works that's right that's right cool so we have this notion of um what we calling off keys so it's a contract based wallet so your first off key which is counterfactually generated based off of the salt from your private key that's coming from reddit and so you can have this like guardian access so in the background we have a default where uh you know and will expose for intermediate and advanced users the ability to remove this guardian key but it allows for the ability what we call incremental decentralization where at the very beginning we help you walk through this where you have a guardian by default and then at whatever like threshold if you're an app provider let's say it's because you're not going to put your life savings in crypto when when you're first starting out right and so uh you are going to put a dollar or five dollars you know well not until you understand key management right and that's the big ux hurdle and what we're trying to do is align incentives here so when you're starting out you're dipping your toes in you have a couple of dollars in maybe you've gotten some free moons and maybe you get a little bit of eve you know a couple dollars worth of a cup of coffee worth and so like you know you're not really caring so much about like you know if i have a guardian or whatnot because there's not a lot at stake and then once you get into it once you're generating comments on reddit once you're like accruing more value you're like wait a second you know like like who has access to this money is this really my money and your incentives are more aligned when you as a user are interested and motivated because now you have more at stake and so uh you know then you can remove your guardian if you want um and you know we call this incremental decentralization then you instead of getting hit with advanced mode at the very beginning where you have to learn about key management we defer that to when the user is comfortable when they're incentivized to learn about it very good you guys know i love good onboarding ux go ahead bradley yeah no very good so uh maybe maybe i missed this so your project was called reddit dao was there a dow that i missed yeah let's talk yeah yeah i'm happy to happy to dig into that that was actually the original we pivoted a few times we also were thinking about using xdi um originally for the scaling solution which we talked to austin to like a large extent with i think dow though is a relatively flexible term and to me honestly any token network i think ethereum and bitcoin are effectively daos right they're they're coordinating people across the world to do a specific thing for the benefit of that network and everyone who holds that token have the um incentive to make it more valuable right um so definitely using dao in a more flexible way there's no voting or fund management necessarily within the system that we built but there certainly could be very easily if you're already setting up a non-custodial wallet for them and giving them tokens a natural use case would be to use those tokens for for a little utility within some kind of system like this forum yeah essentially essentially what we wanted to do was uh be able to uh incentivize up votes or down votes and those would actually be dow votes but the limitation of the reddit api is that you don't get to see who upvoted or downloaded you get an aggregate total and so instead of having some complex ux uh we decided just to like award anyone that just compliments that except um couple quick questions um so i think this project was great i think it's really creative um i i didn't i feel like i didn't get it initially but now this makes a lot of sense that you're definitely solving a very real problem here i'm curious to know what was your i what because it feels like the real problem you're solving solving is definitely like an onboarding problem where getting people onto web3 world is hard is that what you started out to solve or did you all just kind of end up there that was the main um motivation and we think of like the layer two is actually a ux issue not so much a scale of like it is a scalability solution but the way that we have our uh contracts and our meta transaction relay or uh people can get onboarded without having this like chicken or the egg like needing eat at the beginning because like if you start out in a channel you can like just send funds in a channel so it doesn't cost gas and then when you want to withdraw then we actually require eve because an automatic transaction relayer it deploys the counter factual wallet and then gets refunded back and so the layer two issue combined with the smart contract and the and the cf wallet allows for an easier on-boarding experience that allows them to incrementally decentralize so it definitely was like onboarding kind of focus makes sense that's cool uh really important question james where are you right now me i'm in my car i'm actually i'm on the way to the uh to pick up my sister from the airport not your standard hackathon judging location that's right that's right amazing all right well thank you so much both james and uh demo and now with that we'll move on to our next project so um please welcome eat out coin by stone so i know you're here feel free to share your screen hi everyone hi everyone my name is song and i'm a full-stack developer i built this red app called el coin which rewards customers with tokens when they make a purchase from a restaurant so i know many restaurants are struggling on game customers because of the pandemic customers feel discouraged to go outside because of restrictions especially to social distance most small restaurants do not have the budget to promote their menu or advertise it so here is where this red app can help it can reward customers with tokens when they make a purchase from a restaurant which will encourage customers to go out and eat at these restaurants and earning tokens customers can redeem these tokens for discounts or prices restaurants can promote their menu by green profile and unknown image of their food and drinks with discussions and price on this app for customers to see all the image that the restaurant uploads will be stored on the free storage tokens are created using the erc20 standards to work on the ethereum platform and it's time for the demo so here is the home page of the website and we click on the restaurant in the list of restaurants and we can see the deals for this restaurant and here's the deals and if you want to create a profile for restaurants then you can enter the name of the restaurant and the location of the restaurants in the descriptions and you can upload the image of the restaurants and we click on create restaurants the images be uploaded to the fixed website so let me refresh and and there is the image of the restaurants and if the customers buy something from this restaurant the owner can send tokens to this customers and right now the token the owner has ten thousand eop coins and and let me copy the address of the customer versus account three and paste the address of the customer's address and the owner can send like 200 er coins to this customers and then you can confirm and it's successful and you see the donuts and 200 tokens to this customer so you can see the transactions and when i switch to account three for the customer's account the customer has 200 payout coins so this is what i have and thank you for watching awesome thank you so much [Music] just ask some questions or share their comments i'd love to see like a gasa solution here like adding in meta transactions something something that you'd be handing out like a signature based system because you know a lot of these are probably could could you know could be used for interesting things but it's almost like you got to worry about all that gas that's going to be going into distributing those tokens i'll i'll uh pass it along though that's one of my first thoughts no that doesn't make sense um how who can create a restaurant on this can anyone do so uh yeah any restaurant owners they can contact us yeah discuss yeah yeah this is really cool i'm sorry i thought you were done no go ahead um uh so you get these tokens and i'm sorry if i missed this so you get that what's the economy with the tokens can you talk more about that um um originally i thought i was thinking of like creating a tokens which they can use to redeem night night rewards like discounts on you can redeem the tokens for discounts on certain restaurant products or get some by price basically encourage customers to go out yeah interesting uh so i guess it would be your website would need a portal for you know maybe or like eventually hook into something for ordering food or something like that or we're doing something like the redemption process do you have any anything with the redemption process yet or you just have ideas right now it's okay i mean i'm just wondering um i'm like usually i was thinking like the customer they can maybe they could order from the website and then it was send like transactions to the owner's account the owner will get notification and then and yeah and then once the customer goes there goes to the restaurant in person picks up the order then the owner can approve the transactions and then they will earn the tokens awesome maybe one question yeah it was one question from me uh what was uh what was the experience like at the hackathon was this the first time you played with smart contracts or kind of uh what did you sort of end up spending most time on mostly the ideal and then the design and end of the blockchain because i was i was really new to blockchain and then i didn't learn how to create smart car chart using cylindy and were you team of one or do you have other folks on your team oh i'm by myself okay so i was doing everything the design the front end back end uh cylinder wow good job interested in that yeah what was your tech stack what did you use like what tools did you use how did it go oh yeah so i used react the bootstrap for the front end and the back end i use node.js for express to like to upload image to the free storage and then i use solidity to create smart contrast and tokens and they're using you know use the erc20 token standards from open zeppelin probably maybe maybe cool awesome well i'm glad that you were able to demo today and i know that this was a good exercise for you to see how small our contracts work and how front-end development works so i wish you continue building on on this and uh hopefully you will uh we'll see you in on the next uh hackathons here yeah keep hacking i love it okay thank you congrats um and with that i would like to welcome our next team to uh demo the kyber project hey i think if you're ready feel free to uh meet yourself and start the screen share if not we'll wait a few more seconds i believe we're waiting for cal then looks like he's in now let me get the okay here we go um so this is just the um draft ui that we have it's not uh entirely complete but um that's kind of like the article but uh i'm just gonna play the video sounds great due to a psychological party affiliation hi welcome to the kaiper project this is our team we have the front end backend and our ai engine what is the kyber project many voters generally vote within the same party and this is largely due to a psychological party affiliation tiber project is an effort to minimize partisan voting and get voters to consider issues that are important to them instead the main aim of our project is to have our users register on our portal and then post or upload articles of their choice to our web3 application they also have the option of voting for articles relevant to them uh or relevant to their or relevant to the issues they face or relevant to the political opinions based on the user's voting preference our ai engine recommends them a list of political candidates who also align with their who also align with the users political views so this is the technology integration that we chose to go with so ujs will be our front end uh three blocks for user authentication and uh data from uh from the user will be uh pushed into textiles such as articles and uh postings and from that it's stored into fpfs for long term storage and any modifications to those articles will be tracked our ai engine will parse into text style for the articles to analyze data and we use inferior to connect to ethereum the users will be accessing our front-end via web page with which they are greeted with a quick message letting them know their political concerns matter and our service will help recommend the candidate that best aligns with their concerns once the user clicks the get started button they will then be asked to check off all the issues relevant to them once they have completed the form our backend systems will push a candidate recommendation to the front end for the user to see who best aligns with their concerns and for the back end we have for the ethereum network we have the solidity smart contracts which are deployed on the rockstain testnet and the smart contracts store user addresses that are passed from three box and the store awards and ipns of the articles for the server side we decided to use coa and node this is to expose the ethereum back end as an api for fetch calls from the python ai engine we use ethers instead of web3 to expose the theorem backend as node modules for the front end for its read and writes into ethereum contracts we use instagram infura as a ethereum provider to connect to live contracts on the tesla and for storage and caching we chose textile using the hub we allow for uh creation of organizations from developers and hub user groups for the authentication authenticated users via three blocks and we chose the buckets for host storage of articles by users and three blocks for data processing for the ai engine to make candidate recommendations and uh three uh thread db to dependencies for three parts this is slide seven the nerd pipeline the web application feeds into textile we run the nerd pipeline which is a batch processing pipeline to pre-compute all of our ai for the application so we don't need to do it on the fly this is done by retrieving the news article link submissions and then there's two things that can happen either the links have already been submitted so we retrieve cached results or we parse the article for text content when we do the parsing the two main things that we want to extract are topics and keywords once topics and keywords are extracted where a topic could be a popular keyword or collection of keywords we do named entity resolution and disambiguation or nerd this process allows us to use things not strings and it really helps with the downstream logic and functionality once the nerd pipeline is complete we're able to provide updated metadata for the back end which feeds back into textile amazing thank you so much for that demo um i'm sure everybody has a lot of questions so i'll just let them jump right in cool yeah maybe i'll go first on this one um i think this is an interesting somewhat unconventional choice for uh kind of a decentralized web project um i guess a couple questions um first off yeah why uh why do you think this should exist in in the d web space um and also does this already exist that do you feel stuff like um i think eyesight with and the other kind of political quiz which candidate aligns with me solve the same problem um oh so one of the main things that we wanted to to do um is to kind of like track consistency of candidates uh so articles are pushed um like into the web um if they're modifiable or can be uh taken down um i think we've uh i think pushing the articles into ipfs allows for a censorship resistant uh method of tracking what what canada what candidates do in the past and you can see that over over time throughout history yeah it makes sense to be using something like ipfs and ethereum where you can be writing this kind of stuff kind of like signing the hashes of the articles that get trained by the ml or whatever and having that kind of attestation on chain it's it's a good way to kind of keep that from being tampered with because there's a lot of scary stuff that could be tampered with here like i i can see why why ipfs and ethereum yep i i definitely find that argument persuasive um yeah then i guess the other question is ai uh touches a part of my brain that gets uh that doesn't work very well uh but can you describe how you uh how you answer the question of which candidate aligns with a certain user's views at least at a high level oh excuse me oh i could how do you make the final decision of essentially which candidate should i vote for if that's what the answer is oh uh so the thing that we're working on um and i think tyler could describe it uh better but we're associating kind of like tags uh of what issues uh each article um uh talks about and more actually i think tyler might be able to explain better yeah i'm not sure i can add too much to what calvin was saying because it was working um yeah so it's you have a number of issues that the candidates are um aligned on it's actually very hard to find that alignment across news stories just because they're so like party oriented and so you have to do some work to get there um and then so just seeing like what candidates are saying across an issue and then um i think we have a pretty straightforward interface right now where you can see like which issues matter to you um so i'm from ens and you guys uh put yourself down for the ens prize i guess i'll just ask while you're here i didn't hear ens in that presentation did you use enos or did you not just that's the project so uh that was something that uh we wanted to use uh eventually but we we didn't we weren't able to touch on it um yeah that's fine just wanted to know cool project thank you yeah i think the one thing that it's lacking is like the the flashy demo where i come in and say i'm against this and it tells me and i see it right yep well uh thanks again for demoing and uh hopefully uh you can ping our judges after you have a demo video ready for to check out so uh i hope you continue working on this thing and with that i'll move on to our next team and that is a project yeah that is project plasma connect so i see that he's here so i'll just let him kick off and share the video hello everyone i'm santosh and i'm gonna present you the plasma connect so here we go the brief info with plasma connect plasma connect is a simple uh client side of a draw where it aims to connect or grow the people who wants to donate blood or plasma or for people who are in need and to achieve this uh what better way than spreading the data decentralized time coping up together let me dive into the demo so it's a client side uh i'm currently using magic link to connect onboarding any non blockchain people directly connected to the ethereum world as soon as they connect they have to provide certain details so that's the ethereum address which can be unidentified apart from the they do get a decentralized id plus by theorem address secondly they have to provide the personal details which for us the soldier canvas is their id which is created after they present the information uh okay so when they present the data is then first encrypted then push to ipfs then deployed on the small contract directly rights to the smart contract yeah and so you can see your soldier can just getting updated with the new itself so this is a simple client for plasma connect let's call stack the functionality happens here whatever the data is pushed to ipfs uh should i shout out to austin for this amazing introduction all right so the data when it's pushed to ipfs uh is addressed to the tao the people who uh who is going to organize the event so is it we are one entity where people organizer can connect and request data can be on top of everything and the doubt provides incentives for warriors to organize themselves to incentivize to work together and to contribute or conduct drives and donate plasma of blood so simple working uh the data is then decrypted uh decrypted data again we can get the decryption with the science signature we can get back the identity of a person then later we can communicate back your ipfs messages so only thing we would require for the plasma variation is uh we have to know whether the person has donated the blood last last three months whether he's healthy or what kind of plaque did does he have so according to that we can match the donor to the receiver and connect to the person everything decentralized liaison security so this is plasma connect awesome super cool i'll i'll uh i'll let her just ask any questions yeah can you tell us about uh what was the hardest part of making this project well the hardest part would be onboarding so when you consider getting people to use it uh the initial idea was to replace whatever the google forms people are using to collect the data rather have it a single ledger single database or corpus of data people can dump that data and people can analyze and contact the person who wants the data directly and which could be possible when each person have a d id or in this room or ethereum address or any uh d id in display when this distance less acts aspect comes to the point people have to be connected to a blockchain so rather having a server or centralized system wandering and misusing or having a replicate data because one person is might be submitting medical forms to multiple organizations and that cluster of data is just a redundancy in structuring and uh hitting data so onboarding the user would be one aspect and engaging the user uh because this is not something that uh once he has been written once he has submitted the form it's over every period of time every three months or every every time there is a need everyone has to be notified like irises like a feed saying that there is a requirement for the donation of the blood or every time the person who directs the blood has to update the database saying that i have done your blood for that updation simple c uh cr ud uh they have to incense twice to engage them is another problem so those aspects which will initially uh solution for web 2 are the bottleneck for web3 because it cost on web3 it caused to make a simple write operation it cost to ping a person and those aspect are the uh onboarding problems for uh any common user who wants to use that yeah it's cool that you're using magic though that's a good way to do the onboarding that seems like that could help a little bit to kind of give them that web to feel this this seems like something you'd want to be very careful about putting a lot of identify identifying information about the person and health information it almost seems like a problem for zero knowledge where you could like use zero knowledge to prove that you gave plasma without having to give away any details and by proving that you that could give you access to something or some kind of reward system like you have set up it's pretty cool it's a cool project i think we're out of time but i'd love to talk about your tech stack sometimes too that was cool to see build in there keep keep on hacking hit me up if you have any questions too great thanks santosh and now with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is powergate docker hub with a lock so look if you're there you can start playing your video yeah uh yeah we'll just start with the video and this is unedited so please bear with me so now we're building the docker cluster for power gate in which i've added the docker registry image which is pointing to the power gate cluster which is yeah and initially it fails because it can't find it so but then it finally connects and creates the new token for the api and then the new store the local dj and then we're just going to push an image that we have just built and just see what happens so as you can see bunch of ops are happening on the docker image there are a bunch of push operations that are happening you can see the put content and all these are like generating like ipfs hashes underneath so adding to hot storage yeah so the ipfs hash and we also store the job ids for the storage configs on powergate yeah so as you can see all the images the sub images are getting pushed these are just like a bunch of messages that we think just hot storage successful and then we also see the testnet trying to create execute the deals so docker is doing this for some reason it pushes it's like trying to push some things and then it just cancels in the end and it just redoes it again so that's happening a bunch of times but i just like i don't have the time to see why exactly but it does finish eventually so yes so yeah i think uh we can go to the question so maybe i think would be super helpful for you just kind of explain to all of us one more time what you wanted to do and sort of how close you got to it and we saw the demo but just hearing why it is it's going to be helpful yeah sure so basically what i wanted to do was uh create like a so docker hub has like a storage driver which you can extend and write different storages storage back-ends to support so i wanted to uh enable like powergate support for that so i built this storage driver which so the power gate usually has like a key value type interface and the docker storage registry is sort of a file system interface so it's mostly like just connecting the two and having like an intermediate a local db which sort of stores temporary manifest information and then we can even back that manifest up so that to like ipfs or some other r2 power gate and then you know instantiate other clients in other machines and things like that yeah i hope that was clear yeah sorry just like adding where i got to so i was able to push images and then make the deals on powergate but it's not like 100 working i'm it's still a work in progress but yeah i was able to push and create the deals and using the go client for the power game right now this is a this is a really cool idea i like it a lot um i'm curious did you talk to any of the textile folks and uh uh during the hacker fest uh actually yeah so the thing is i wanted to find some teammates uh i had put up on the slack but uh it's just like most of the people working on like javascript type projects and i'm from a go background so i didn't find anyone and then i had like a lot like a lot of work on my main job so i didn't have too much time to interact during the hackathon but i think the go client was pretty straightforward and i've been working on ipfs for some time in my main job as well so i was kind of aware of what things are happening and things like that yeah cool very cool yeah no the reason i ask is i i'm sure the powergate and textile folks would be very interested in seeing this project so we should definitely make sure that uh uh that they are that they become aware of it um uh but no i i think it makes a lot of sense uh definitely some some weirdness that you might have to iron out but uh this is it's a really good idea how did you come up with the idea uh so actually this idea was posted in uh the initial ideas for uh the hack fs i started looking into how we could do it and then i came across the docker storage uh registry and then all the it was pretty straightforward to do because the power gate they had this whole docker compose setup right yeah i just had to add the registry image there and then have a you know like my own registry having this custom backend integrated and then i could push using the docker api nice what are your what are your kind of next steps or where do you want to take it beyond like bug fixing so uh i think what i want to do is like i want to have another like command or an api to do the backup right now i do i push to the deals immediately when okay i'm like writing the data but that's like a slow process so it would be good to have an intermediate step where we just push to ipfs and then have like a another api which then says that okay now back up to file coin so that uh then i could get like a new hash and then i could share that across and you know use that yep that sounds like a good idea very cool good good project thanks um yeah so where do you plan on taking this like um do you plan on kind of finishing this out or yeah i definitely wanted to finish it i was not sure because as the hackathon did ended i did want to work on it but i i didn't want to you know be bad on the competition that i did after the end of the day but i yeah i'll keep working on it make sure it works completely like right now there's some issues in pulling the image uh that was not there conveniently in the demo but yeah i would like to solve that issue as well since there are a couple of small issues and i think yeah i mean it it should be like it has to be integrated within the target uh you know family of apps to be able to be useful definitely keep working on this i think that's the key is like keep see this to the end it seems like a very cool project and you know tag us on twitter when you finish it let's see a screenshot okay sure but it sounds like you should go talk to those other teams too like a lot of this is over my head i get i get the docker stuff i get the the storage driver but i'm kind of i don't know about the deals and the power gate stuff so it seems like very specific for a niche show i'd love to see you connect with those guys it sounds like maybe they work on something similar yeah so the power gate is like they they have like a tiered storage system where they have hard storage within ipfs and then the cold storage is on filecoin so uh it's like an api where they it's easier for people to get into filecoin rather than directly using the low test node or things like that very cool and you tried to build like a driver to integrate that with the docker storage stuff so people could have containers that sort of were backed by these these tiers of like basically financially back storage which is really cool neat neat okay awesome keep keep it up man keep keep hammering at it definitely definitely see through till the end and just comment for uh like uh kartik and trent as well like we definitely want to make textile folks aware of this and ideally uh get them to talk to each other because i think they'll be excited i'm pretty sure they'll be excited absolutely we'll make sure we connect them so thanks a lot and we'll move on to our next demo and that is product supply chain dap and z will be presenting the video so whenever you're ready to see uh go for it [Music] i believe uh we have enoch can you start with the presentation uh if i guess he's not i believe he's still muted we'll give it a few seconds if not i have nope there you go okay okay good day everyone we yeah we we're here myself and my colleague here we're here to present our um project which is called blockchain supply dabs is actually a solution for the supply chain management one of the goals is to plan the flow of goods product services including data and finances it covers the procurement of raw materials from the manufacturer to the delivery point one of the goals we are trying to achieve with this project is to reduce the manual operation in this supply chain industries uh supply chain industries as we all know operating a paper based recording keeping so we want to see how we can automate these processes the reporting system also it's it's scattered and is incomplete sometimes there's a lot of falsifications but the opportunity this solution is given is that it's going to bring a very transparent record skipping solutions all changed all these stockholders stakeholders have their store and chain values chain they have their stores and their they're stored they have their stores and their document intact with the blockchain um advantages it brings traceability transparency and trust um as we all know in this supply chain there is always a challenge of tr tracking some flood paths but with the blockchain it reduces this my colleague here will be presenting a short video for for the application will resign what do you see uh yes i'm going to share my screen ah i'm sorry i have to quickly disconnect and quick connect again would it be helpful for us to do it instead if it's the video from a submission because it's a permissions thing looks like i don't have permission to share we can uh quickly test it just give us okay two seconds trent if you're able to confirm that there we go yeah i mean that the permission is there but maybe it's something local on this machine so desktop yeah it could be a browser oh hey we got a screen okay later okay what we we see here is the producer side if he has a product he's going to enter his information so it can be stored in the blockchain can you guys hear me see it yep we got it uh so so unfortunately we weren't able to finish this as we had hoped but here's a little demo of what we are trying to accomplish so a person here will go ahead and enter their product name i'll just give an example they can enter any type of info they want they can enter the value of their product and also the coordinates we really want to be able to eventually have the product as it's moving to its destination be able to report via maybe a iot device just give its location and then it would automatically be populated on the blockchain anytime the consumer the producer the seller they could check this information and be verified because it's encrypted so here's an example the gpa coordinates from uh it's actually gpga say northwest zero maybe they would be able to get this from google data google maps and just copy and paste it in that's that's the future uh feature we would like to put in and let's put destination new york it would enter that confirm it and you'll see here product three is now available to see um we wanted to add let me show you the actual code we wanted to have the addresses of the other players in this such as the consumer and the distributor and the seller so that is also another feature that we we plan to implement then this would be stored on ipfs file file coin using the slate system and then we also wanted to be able to have the participants uh message each other and uh as i've seen these other projects we'd also probably have some authentication with three box [Music] so uh yeah this is there's really a lot of capability that we want to put in uh unfortunately we couldn't demo that for you today but uh it was really fun to work on this and uh we hope to complete it yes no thank you so much for still presenting everything we were able to accomplish until last thursday uh what uh was this sort of the first time you were playing with smart contracts or what kind of made you work on this project uh yeah i've been interested in this space a long time uh i've been working uh consensus boot camp online training and uh you know i'm really i really should reach out for help a little bit more to move things along but uh i'm learning and i really like to learn on myself and get over those humps and uh and i really made a big leap with this project so it was really fun uh working even though we couldn't finish it yeah wow what was the hardest okay so if you're learning a lot i mean that's great what was the hardest part for you the hardest part was managing multiple data getting and getting it from the from the front end to the blockchain and then back you know getting a single value was easy but multiple values um you know it was just small glitches that uh you know we were hard to find um and also using uh i was coming from javascript just pure javascript and then just digging into react and then uh hey there's a lot of updates everything's changing um you know i've been working since uh what is version zero four uh and i as you i like to really mess with the code and keep everything with the uh comments and probably too much i should just uh just build so uh i really learned and that's what i'm gonna focus on next time it's great and this is i mean this looks like what i built the first time when i started messing with it too when you start learning how to like write stuff to a smart contract get those event back get those events back call like you're you're you're hitting on all the primitives that you're going to need to build something amazing so just keep keep it up and keep building and i want to see it's a next hackathon too i think we're connected on slack too so hit me up if you have any questions i've got tons of tutorials all right thank you thanks so much awesome thanks a lot all right thank you thank you um we have three more projects to go before we finish judging for hacking fest and i'd like to now call up decentralized full market directory to come on and kick off with their video that looks like um the audio check box was not checked when i used the full screen on zoom so maybe if you want to do that quickly uh which was hello everyone thank you for finding time to see our presentation today i'm going to tell you about our hackfest project which was called the centralized full market and in short defuma the team that has been working on the project is myself thomas kavatsky and nix began and we together have plenty of years of experience in building solutions for web 2.0 and now we thought that it's time to see what's happening in web 3.0 space our idea was to build decentralized data market and connect advertisers with providers so by advertisers i mean some websites aggregating the offers like comparison sites and the providers are the companies that offer a product or a service and to that we wanted to build a model of incentives to also include users so the advertisers and providers would have a common goal of attracting users to the offer and the user could also have some benefits from actually seeing the offers how did it go the first week we started learning about ipfs and its ecosystem thanks to the great docs we could easily wrap our heads around what's the problem space that ipfs is trying to cater for and also what were the tools that were helping to implement solutions for ipfs so with that under the second week we started playing with uh textile buckets and biddler and see if it can help us solve our problems we also had fantastic support on the slack channels so thank you to the teams for helping us with especially the textile team with with packets configuration it led us during the third week to creating the initial and the app so what we did was uh creating a smart contract and connecting it to the web ui we also started working on a content manager that would help us manage the the content of a bucket but then we started thinking uh that we actually wanted to try the peer-to-peer content distribution so that was our objective during the fourth week we started looking into leap p2p and we started investigating the content distribution problem and yeah now the future plans so we'll continue exploring the decentralized system space especially with some questions we still have around the content distribution and how to how to manage the re-encryption problem here and yeah but that's that's the future plans so let me just uh quickly show you what we built okay now the demo time so let me show you what we've built over the past couple of weeks and what we've learned now let me show you our app we integrated three box to manage the identities and also metamask to provide the identity so here is the web ui of our app it's it has very limited functionality but what works is the authentication with metamask and authentication with textile uh textile stack so as you see here that's something that we we fetched from from the textile stack and also we we are hoping to have the content manager working for the files using textile buckets but we were not able to finish that so that's a pretty short demo and let me now jump back to the presentation the next steps for us is actually the exploration we discovered a lot of problems that we could solve for and some of them are presented on this slide okay time to wrap up yeah feel free to to follow our discoveries because we are really pumped for for research thank you very much and thank you if global and sponsors see you all next time it's really cool how the market is integrated into this like it's it's an important part to add the market to it like when you have the storage and you have the market going with it and the discovery uh it's a neat project good good hackathon project i would have loved to see more demo and less powerpoint i love getting my hands dirty and actually playing with it yeah sure i mean it's it's live uh but yeah as i mentioned the functionality is very limited uh we've had some problems during the development and we've pivoted a few times i guess yeah it comes from the because uh yeah we like we used to work the way that we we plan ahead and build things and and then eventually have some things working but the hackathon is totally different experience so i guess that's one one part here a different speed you have to learn how to cut all the right corners to get it to work this way yeah indeed what was the uh most fun thing that part of that you worked on with this i think that personally uh i like the the content content distribution problem the most it was totally new space to me and during the i i think it was the second second demo uh second weekly demo uh that the problem was discussed uh with juan and uh i think that yeah this is very interesting part here but also what i find what i find missing uh is the um end-to-end developer experience uh that is yeah we've had our problems with with getting things working and so on so i believe that this is a very interesting space as well to contribute to in terms of it it's less less about the web itself it's more about the tooling building the tooling here i'd love to hear more about that like what tools did you use what happened yeah so so we are trying to i guess uh go with the monorepo approach as we were used to that but then it ended up that it was yeah the the idea was not the best one uh to start with because we had some problems on how to copy the con the apis into you know on the on the build pipeline and so on so also the the typing typings for typescript they were we're missing some sometimes and i think that yeah it's it would be cool uh to build something like uh a single command to deploy things to testnet and have some uh have some uh you know wallets uh out there that would provide the the current contract that has been deployed with some with some uh test money so we could have the yeah like the very neat experience yeah you gotta use it right i have a bubbler script that does that hit me up on twitter we've used it actually yeah we use your script yeah we modified it a little bit yeah the we wanted to have it live so not on a local host so it took actually a bit longer than we thought to deploy this on heroku configure all of the the the web sockets plus all the missing pieces so there is not like a good uh good document for this you know for for deploying all of those pieces different technologies it takes a lot that's web3 man it's it's a lot of complicated stuff it's yeah quite fragile so so two two things here two key things uh one way is the one thing for us is to continue with the idea on its own of the decentralized full market because it's the e-commerce problem that has been around that people have been pulling data scraping the data from some sites and then using some ai to remove duplicates and so on what if we reverted the cycle and started pushing data instead of pulling it so that's one thing and the other thing to sum up is that the end-to-end tooling for developer to to really uh enable the developers to come to the space and not feel uh not feel uh lost definitely can i decide that your presentation looked really good oh thank you very much very good slides beautiful slides keep keep hacking guys i think that should be like a a thing like two thumbs up keep working keep building i want to see you guys in more hackathons like keep creating something something awesome will happen there sure thing yeah see you around then thanks a lot thanks both congrats again and now with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is claudia with the retro so how do you know you're here feel free to kick it off with your screen share and uh in case you're saying something we don't have audio but if the video hasn't started playing yet or you're muted okay yeah okay perfect sorry about that guys there you go so this is the retros uh thank you very much everybody my name is claudio uh with and with ektor and jonathan we built uh this decentralized retrospectives app during hack fs so the idea is your retros your data sorry about this so our goals for hackfest basically well yeah created app to let distributed teams do participate in a retrospective ceremony for the information to be owned by the users and our core fork is security and privacy so we choose street box and metamask as our tech stack to build the solution um so what does the retros do uh it lets teams run a retrospective ceremony with the three w's for those not familiar with the scrum descri the scrum ceremony is a what went well what didn't go well what can be improved and for teams to get this information uh and for third parties not to be able to to have access to this information just the uh the participants on the retrospective ceremony so the login we do it with meta mask to authenticate to an ethereum account we leveraged three box bases to sort all the retrospectives data and users sign in signed the retrospective ceremony with their three box account so that means that all the information has been stored in their tree box account and we just provide the game dynamic okay ready for the demo um i'm gonna let's see okay there you go okay guys so this is the uh d retros demo video uh this is what we managed to do in this four weeks uh really learned a lot and so we are using the treevox um platform to to to do this so um that so we sign in and so uh we get them where's the brave browser so we get the authorization for the wallet uh to use it so we said connect um so we're connecting that okay then we get uh the three box connector data yes we're gonna continue we're gonna confirm our wallet okay your signature's been requested we're gonna sign confirming our wallet okay so we're going to connect our data one data source signing in okay so we're logged in uh the so this is this is the retro so this is we're gonna be the dashboard um so um so here you see uh the retros which is one of the retrospectives we want to do right now we didn't have a well we ran through a bunch of issues uh building this but we were had a lot of fun so when you select the retros so it jumps into the game dynamic of the retrospective which is what went well what didn't go well what can be improved uh we didn't manage you can write um on this uh you can see the many how many votes what didn't go well uh basically not enough time what can be improved more time get familiar with dab development uh what went well hack fest rocks and so so this is what we managed to do so it's basically get the game dynamic uh get all this uh information um right now it's not saved in the in the uh three box space we're working on that and we'll continue working on it during after hackfest so well this is a quick demo thank you very much uh really had a lot of fun thank you very much joel from the three box team for helping us out and we're looking forward to keep building on top of uh three bucks thank you very much to us all so what we learned basically so we we come from the from the atlassian ecosystem so we built we've been building applications for agile teams for the last six years and for us it was our first understanding on how to build the decentralized app how it should behave which is uh was totally new for us so we're still learning on that one we underestimated the real-time messaging uh we're gonna be using threads three box stress threads in our next version uh the idea is that anybody uh a party could log in and start um writing into that uh three box space and so that was a challenge we faced uh above uh the the the three box team has pointed us to the right direction on that one so that's that's cool so that's that's the next step um uh well we're gonna continue building the retros uh the real-time messaging we're gonna work on that we couldn't work on on something that's the wow factor which is basically supporting video and audio so basically we can do transcripts on that and leverage ipfs to store that uh so that's hopefully in the next version uh for our beta launch so well uh that's about it thank you gracias danke grazie from actor jonathan myself thank you very much everybody that's that's all for this demo amazing very cool what a good idea like obviously your audience is generally going to be excited if uh if you present something that they would want to use and given that you're presenting to a bunch of tech people and software engineers we're all excited uh no i i think this is a really creative idea a cool cool project uh well done yeah you guys just needed you guys needed to get this done like this is the thing like this is this is such a good idea the the execution you guys no matter what keep building finish this idea this this isn't like usually most hackathons ideas are like okay you learned but you need to get context for the face space and find something that like will find market fit and i think that you have the fit here like it's a great use for it get get or done man no no and it was a great excuse right so so we we we managed to do our first uh mbps on other on other uh platforms decentralized platforms we didn't get up and running on that but then like hackafest was right around the corner and so we say you know what let's do it let's do for four weeks let's try to understand where we where we stand uh we managed to get some people excited about this and we have some 10 12 people sign up in the beta group so uh if anybody wants to hit me up uh please do so uh i'm still going to be there and defile going uh slack group so yeah happy to send the invites to everybody who's interested in this absolutely you should i just send a message to the technique group and uh and put that on the showcase channel all right can i say something real quick uh i thought i mean i i agree i think something like this highly useful would get huge amounts of use in this space i mean people are constantly doing retrospectives and things like that all the time um how is the voting working where was that like happening i was curious yes so so right now uh that will happen in uh in the tree box space so basically when everybody goes in signs signs this space it means that we were going to keep a tap on that right so you're not able to there's going to be two ways to do it either you would like for it to be anonymous when do the voting so you don't do any group thinking right or you can make it right in the open right like cloud bought it for this or kartik voted for that and just put that over uh leave it in the open but yeah we're gonna we're leveraging three box we really liked it a lot really give us like a a a really good stepping stone in order for us to build it up but the idea is to have it in in the three box space but but signed with your with your ethereum account or your three box account uh that way you know that it was your boat and nobody can uh can can vote for you yeah i think that's the key here is it can't be tampered with it can't be censored there are so many things where you know there just could be some fun around attacking someone who came up and came out with this smart contract vulnerability right it's a perfect thing to be like you know he he or she can tweet it and say hey you know i did this thing and and it can't get attacked right and i think that's really cool yeah but most importantly is that you're keep you're owning that information right we're not owning anything that means if if the retros goes away you keep that data and if somebody get has provides a gain dynamic you can reuse that data and that's not lost so that's some feedback we've gotten from our customers uh enterprise customers like okay what happened because we are storing that information and we saw that need in the market and and and this is an experiment we're doing uh uh yeah it's it's we're gonna start with the uh small teams small groups startups and then hopefully uh go up market but but anyhow that it's a need right building great building tag us on twitter amazing welcome the rest of the team and with that we'll move on to our last demo for the day so uh cheers thank you very much that's welcome to instagram browser streaming hello nice to be here to give you a little context this project is like a continuation from the last hackathon hack money where we built like a decent large university so a very important piece that was missing was a decentralized platform for streaming where teachers could stream classrooms for students so i'm going to present this demo of this experiment i did and let's see let's see what you think of it hello i'm going to present the operating streaming application first of all i'm going to start streaming we don't need to connect my wallet that is meta mask it's configured in my browser already and then i'm going to fetch my credentials to connect to flick through up api uh using a smart contract that store my credentials i'm going to fetch this data that is ciphered and i need to decrypt it with using a password if i don't know the password i can request a new one go to flick and put a new set of api keys in secret no problem and record it in the smart controller for future users now i'm ready to stream i'm going to connect my camera here and in order for people to easily access this stream i need to configure uh address in the ens so people can resolve the my address to this name that i call the stream test and also get a stream record here with my bucket on flick for uh easier use so i'm going to confirm this info here and my camera is already recording so i'm going to start the streaming and the files are going to be uploaded to flick while we are speaking and if we go here on the connect channel feature i'm going to connect my wallet again and i can just type string that's going to be resolved to my address and then i can access flick and see all the files here so i'm just going to stop it here confirm and i also can upload files for my computer to be stored in this same directory with my videos so if i connect again to the streaming channel i'm going to have access to the updated file list and i can open this image that was uploaded for video files i can do the same process to reproduce them in my browser but currently there is no protocol established yet to play the chunk of files the chunk of videos seamlessly as we would experience normally in a streaming application use https because each ls one of the protocols that handles this on common applications like netflix youtube can join the files one after another inside one video streaming to all the players but inside ipfs and filecoin there is right now no way uh to make this process happen without downloading every file and merging them inside one stream inside the protocol level this is a work in progress there is much to be done in the protocol level until we can have live streaming using ipfs and filecoin but i hope that this application can be of use thank you all yeah so uh teachers can go in the uproot application so what is called and send links to the students because i want to be caveat when you are in that decentralized environment but you need to use zoom google meet or skype to connect with people and you see their identities so we need to cover up this flaw it's not like a ready product yet but was a great experiment uh over this hackathon so so for the last hackathon you did kind of like a university thing where people it must have been like a teacher-student kind of situation but the the video wasn't decentralized so you you kind of doubled up on the project to stream the video through through fleek yeah is that right there was enos in there too that was great yeah yeah yeah great but it's a standalone tool as well so it can be user in any other project as well or even in the next next uh global event from here guys so what about streaming money there it seems like maybe you did that in the last hackathon but it seems like there should be some streaming money going on there with ethereum yeah yeah uh on this last weekend i implemented new cipher uh it was not inside the hackathon but the idea is that you only get the decryption key actually uh to be honest i did not implement the cipher entirely i implemented only on pro uh encryption but the idea is that you only get the decryption key if you have as much content inside that university that give you access in that classroom and the thing with that approach university is that you pay by staking so the money goes to defy and defy earnings pay the teachers and he want good studies okay so there's kind of a lot of ethereum in there with staking and tokens and stuff okay i got you awesome project yeah uh interesting can you tell me more about so you did the custom text record with the stream key that was really cool you tell me more about how that was used i kind of missed that so you're storing something in this text record and then how is that being used in your project yeah you could write the address to fed the the end point that fix flick gives you is it's like they are abstracting the i ipns but would work with ipns as well the same way but instead of having an address for that a big hash that can be unfriendly i can just ask for the the record calling stream so instead of description instead of email and i i get this stream record okay that's cool how many people are on your team by the way uh on the uproot project the university there are three on this streaming platform only myself okay seems like a lot of technical stuff you had to tackle to make that that streaming video work yeah sure but i guarantee there's a lot of books ah me too all my code man appreciate the honesty when you go alone man you go fast but you you go all around i hear that yeah so are you going to keep it going like what okay so so there was the university now there's like the streaming video like what's what's next i guess maybe cart whatever whatever card that comes up for the next theme for the next hack that'll be your third piece actually what we need mostly right now is users because we had like a better classroom you know on last uh better classroom in their uproot with like four persons they all loved i can do it eight with 16 20 100 and then it can become the next thing hit me up on twitter man i'm always trying to stream and if we can integrate some kind of uh ethereum stuff into it it'd be a lot of fun yeah for sure for sure we got a ecosystem grant from aids and we are like trying to build community if you if you that would be great thank you amazing well i hope you continue working on it and can't wait to see how this connects with the next next hackathon so uh with that i want to thank everybody this was our last demo for hack fest um a big congratulations to all the teams presented today and everybody who's been part of this event for the past month and all of our judges of course for this entire week and especially austin and greatly today so um thanks again for giving us your evening thanks again for sharing some amazing insights and feedback with all of our teams and we'll see you on with the hackathes finale next tuesday at 12 30 p.m eastern so looking forward to seeing everybody here and uh thanks again hope you have a great rest of the weekend yeah thanks guys happy bowtie friday bye
