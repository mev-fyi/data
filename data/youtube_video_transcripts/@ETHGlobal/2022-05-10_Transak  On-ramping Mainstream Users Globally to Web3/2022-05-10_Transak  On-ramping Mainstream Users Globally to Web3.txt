hey everyone thanks for joining just going to take a couple seconds to get set up great let's get started um hi everyone good afternoon good evening good morning depending on where you are um thanks for joining for the tuesday of hack money workshops uh we have rocio and sam from tranzact doing their workshop on on-ramping mainstream users globally to web 3. questions go into the zoom chat and they'll be more than happy to answer them and with that being said i'll hand off the mic to the two speakers brilliant thank you very much yes and hello everyone uh lovely to meet you and thanks for taking the time to join this workshop yeah as i said um i'm sam and i'm with me is rothio and we're we're both from the product team here at tranzact on the t-shirt um and so um yeah um if you have any questions feel free to chat i'm as we go um yeah we'll be explaining exactly what we do um and then um hopefully how you can use this as part of uh the hackathon and uh integrate with us and then maybe even um use us for real um in production uh in the future so yeah who we what are we what are we doing here so um you know any of you us who've been in crypto for a while will be very familiar with this problem you know everyone says that crypto isn't isn't user-friendly um and so this is what we see we see decentralized apps of all type have a massive amount of bounce of new customers because basically if you know you're a normal person you haven't been in crypto for ages like some of us you know you don't understand how wallets work you know how crypto works gas fees public private keys um and then you know you've got to think about you want to use adapt the process to do that well first of all you've got to find the platform then you need to buy crypto so you probably need to find an exchange join up to that exchange go through kyc you know buy some crypto on the exchange then you need to set up a wallet you need to transfer your crypto from the exchange to the wallet then once you've got that wallet you need to integrate with the app and then you need to um transfer the crypto from your wallet to the app so you know this is something that can take up to a week a lot of costs um you know there's a whole process that someone has to piece together you can't do it all in one app so this is why we see a lot of normal people dropping off um and you know prevents crypto and all the web 3 reaching its true potential so this is where transact comes in and so one of the key things we believe in is simplifying this process simplifying onboarding mainstream users into web3 and there's a few different ways that we we do this and so at the core of it is this crypto fiat api so so we like to say that we're the um you know the fiat component uh the fiat protocol as part of your your web 3 lego building blocks um and so through that you can bring in users through kyc uh connecting up the rails of the traditional finance world the traditional world of apps as well you know all the web 2 and tying it together to web 3 all in one go so for a retail customer they can do that all in one journey uh or all through transact so you know you can think of it as a simple journey user signs up they go to the dap um they um pay you know just like you would pay with paypal or check out on amazon or any of those kind of classic um web experiences that everyone's familiar with and then you use the dap and that's kind of the the simplicity we want to reach the user just goes fro to the dap and entirely within the dap can sign up get their crypto um and use it within the dap so there's no bouncing around between different services you know getting confused no worrying about all the complexity of the gas fees all of that other stuff that you you would need to do in order to use the data which at the end of the day is what the normal person actually wants to do right so yeah so we're basically crypto onboarding infrastructure and developer toolkit um you know the simplest way to fear onramp as a developer integration so um mainstream users across the world can purchase crypto directly to their wallet um there are a range of fiat payment methods you know bank transfers card apple pay google pay uh local payment methods etc so whatever way locally they want to pay they can pay buy crypto have sent to their wallet and then use the app and so we're supporting over 125 countries crypto costs 30 blockchains over 100 different cryptocurrencies we've got this massive uh coverage of pretty much any need you've got and if there's you know cryptocurrency that you need to support um we provide the process of adding more cryptocurrency so we're already expanding our coverage both on the fiat side and and on the crypto side um we have off ramp coming very soon and so also you'll be able to diverse so a web to sell crypto and cash out and turn it into fiat to you know pay their rent or whatever they need to do um but one of the other key bits is reusable kyc so um we can't escape kyc that's the the world of traditional finance we have to do it but we can do it in this a simplified way only do the what we really need to do and also once you've done it once you can keep it with you so anyone who's done kyc through transact through any of the various different partner apps that we integrate with they don't need to do it again so once you've uh kyc with us you can go to any app on board and and you don't need to go through that process and so we minimize that pain point for users as much as possible so how do we work so yeah so we're we're a developer tool um and we allow you to onboard users fiat and so kind of the process for a user is um they place an order by the user interface that you can add into your app or you can use our api and build the user interface yourself use the kycs with a streamlined process so uh 90 something percent of our users complete that entirely from end to end getting approved in less than 10 minutes so super simple and there's also risk based so you know riskier the user more kyc you need to but if you're a low-risk user doing a small transaction um there's much lower requirements for you then the user can do a fiat payment as i said they can do bank transfer apple pay google pay card you know whatever they are thinking we also have a whole bunch of payment types in in other parts of the world um and then what transact does is we convert that crypto and send it to the user's wallet and then they can use it in the blockchain app so we cover the fiat processing all of that kind of integration with the world of the traditional finance payment rails we handle all of the compliance so kyc aml risk monitoring all of that we handle chargeback risk so unfortunately there are fraudsters who will will try and um you know you stolen credit cards to buy crypto but we handle all of that so you as adapt you don't need to worry about any of that and we handle the liquidity as well so um buying crypto at the best possible price and selling it to the end users at the best possible price so you know for an end user rather than going bouncing between finance coinbase whichever to try and find the cheapest price we're sourcing from a whole different bunch of sources so we always provide the market rate to the end user so from you know you folks building adapt you don't need to worry about any of that kind of complexity of the traditional finance world and that complexity of the the the compliance related to that part and you can just focus on your dap and we handle that and your users can get crypto and really easily and then use your app which is what all of us want to do so to tell you all a bit more about us um yeah so we're we're used in over 100 different apps um so there's a bunch of wallets like metamask which i expect a lot of you are familiar with but also terra station trust wallet maya so across multiple different blockchains and and different ecosystems we're in games and nfts so zed run which i'll i'll give you a little demo of later decentraland splinterman's um crypto blades so you know classic mainstream users want to buy crypto and play a game but also d5 as well so we've got a bunch of d5 protocols um that are integrated with us and and we're adding more apps every single week so um and yeah and as i said anyone who's already done kyc through one of these with us they don't need to again when they use your app which is really exciting cool so yeah as metamask is the app that most people are familiar with um use it as a kind of quick case study so um obviously you know someone who signs up to metamask they need to kind of create a new wallet go through the seed phrase et cetera but of course the classic problem they have is well their wallet's empty they don't have any crypto how the hell do they start getting encrypted well what you can see there on on the screenshot of letter mask is a buy button so we have the receive button buy button send swap but yeah if you click that bend buy button you can do that now in the extension on the mobile app then um there'll be option to buy through transact so that pops up so metamask have added us into both their extension and within their mobile app and we'll talk more about the ways you can integrate later um and so when the user goes there clicks by transact our widget pops up so in this third screen that's um transacts user interface that you can add super easily into your own app and as you can see the user can choose which fiat currency they're going to pay in what payment method um what cryptocurrency that they want to buy um all of the information is up front they can see the fees they're going to pay all that stuff and then they can do the entire process of kyc of confirming the order doing the payment putting the card details all of that stuff is all done within that user interface and so um metamask has just added that embedded that user interface and that's all they need to do and so once users completed that purchase the crypto is sent to their wallet so well it's no longer empty and they can use you know one of the you know hundreds and hundreds of um daps that are out there that integrate with metamask wallet so nice and easy way that a user who's you know brand new to metamask can get some crypto in their wallet and start using with it so we had a question in the chat is it only with metamask no no this is just one of the examples to explain and so yeah we're in hundreds of different apps multiple different wallets so um it was just metamask as an example of a popular app that has integrated transact not at all cool so here's another app that's integrators and they're called zed run so this is a game they have like horse racing with horse and fts so if i jump across to yeah so this is to kind of show you uh what another integration could look like so yeah here's zed run um and you can you know connect up with your metamask wallet or any of the other wallets that um uh zed run support and so once you go here again you've got an empty wallet and they've got this button here which is top up and so if you click on that top up balance and you can see buy ethifier transact service with the credit card and if you click that then yeah tranzact's uh his inter face appears and so they've added us here they've added it as a nice little pop-up um and so then uh what you can see here is the user can go through the process here and choose what they want to do so i'm here in the uk so it's showing me pounds see here we're supporting a whole bunch of different assets on polygon but the user probably wants to buy with they can buy now and one nice thing they've done here is because their wallet's already integrated they've already filled in the user's wallet address and we'll talk more about a bunch of different ways you can do this but yeah this is kind of another example of how you can add transact to your widget cool so yeah a whole bunch of different use cases and you know you folks are the people who can come up with a fun exciting new use cases that we haven't even thought of but uh you know most of our end users let's be honest want to make some money or use a financial service i can exchange any kind of dap dax decks uh you know all the wonders of of decentralized finance but yeah player games so we've got all of those crypto games we've got there social activities and you know we've got this question mark because there's all the new stuff that happens in web 3 that no one's ever thought of before and it's coming out new stuff every week yeah so the different partner types we do so these are the main ones but you know you focus will think of new things we haven't thought of so we get a lot of wallets investment platforms uh crypto and token issuers um gaming web3 but yeah there's kind of no limits to the imagination anything where a user needs to buy crypto in order to use the dap we can hopefully help you there cool so yeah under the hood what do we do so we provide a widget user interface the user can um make the payments do the kyc do all that so we provide that user interface but as i said if you want you can skip most of those screens and and create your own user interface if you want to do that we handle the kyc so we have all the personal details of the user you don't need to know any of the personal details you know save that kind of compliance gdpr headache and we handle all of that we handle all the risk and compliance so um we risk assess the end users and make sure that they're not doing anything risky and their crypto isn't from a dodgy source but also they're you know they haven't got stolen money that they're paying with so we handle all of that we're responsible for it we're a regulated entity so we're regulated by the uk's financial conduct authority as a virtual asset service provider and in the us as money services business with fincen so we've got the licenses and and we we handle all of that so you don't need to worry about the free outside you just need to worry about the crypto side of course you know in the hackathon won't be so much a thing but any of your future apps um that would be super helpful yeah we handle the payments so we can offer all of our payment methods um you don't need to worry about any of that we're handling all of that integration with fiat payments and and taking that from the user uh the crypto payments are actually getting the crypto to the user's wallet we handle that um pricing liquidity so we we don't charge any slippage we basically take the market rate and we make our money by charging a fee on top of each transaction and so that's all clear in the user interface you can see the prices that we're charging the fees that we're charging um we're super transparent about all of that also just kind of for future reference um if you do go live with your data in future you can actually charge a little bit of revenue on top of that per transaction we prefer that as an option and so therefore that can be for some of uh the app to integrate an extra revenue source that you're basically charging a little bit extra on your users each time they top up their wallet through us yeah and so we've got the integration we'll explain more a bit how that happens and then we'll have a dashboard way you can you can see the orders you can see exactly what's going on and kind of control your integration with us so to give you a bit more of our vision um where we're heading is we want to be a complete developer toolkit on boarding normal people around the world into crypto so what that means is we're really trying to serve developers and and builders so all people like you who are you know building the future of web3 we want to help you we want to be uh tools to support you in in you know all the amazing things that web 3 will bring we want to deal with order the legal compliance to traditional finance complexity so as i said we can focus on that you can focus on building your your dap and we want to cover this entire journey of a normal person getting into crypto in blockchain app so we're going to be building more and more services to help you reach normal users we want to create a user experience that's like using the best website so you know you've got your google account or you know facebook or any of these kind of super popular really easy to use web 2 apps but and of course under the hit they will we want these apps to be powered by blockchain and so it's combining that kind of amazing ux that let's be honest a lot crypto doesn't yet have we're like taking that from web 2 and then having web3 under the hood but but building that as a beautiful music experience and global coverage so we're as i said we're constantly adding new countries new currencies we're already in um you know all of the major currencies um 125 countries so we're already based away there but that will keep on growing as well and our real dream is a single developer so you know a lot of folks like you you can build a whole compliant financial decentralized service within a few days and so hopefully we'll see some of those um coming up but uh yeah that's kind of our real dream is to empower that in the same way that you know um 20 years ago if you wanted to build a phone app or a website you had to get the servers you had to get the like there's so much you need to do now if you want to get an app into the app store and people's hands you can do that in a few days but we want to do that for kind of financial services all of these uh very regulated industries that now web 3 can do and and we can help set that up so all in all very exciting vision yeah so you know we're already in a bunch of these um apps as well but we really want to hope you folks are the next wave of entrepreneurs and and that's why we put you in we really believe that you know some of the projects that will be built um in the next few weeks will kind of could be the next next big thing so yeah on to kind of hackathon um we're offering a four thousand dollar prize pool so that's going to be divided among all teams that integrate transact into your solution so yeah all that's required is you know whatever that you're building you add uh transact you don't need to have the full production transact um because that requires an extra compliance process um you just need a staging integration kind of a demo integration with transact um and then um you know get that properly into your your user flow um integrate it properly and then that's all you need to do and then every every um project that's done that will get a share in in the four thousand dollar prize pool so yeah how do you go about integrating um so first step is you need to register as a partner and get a staging api key so um that's at dashboard.tranzact.com i will also um let me just point out that if you go to our tranzact's website there's also this button here partner dashboard so all you need to do is click on that and it will take you to this page enter your email address give a bunch of details don't worry about you know a company name there's a few things you know you won't have one yet that's fine um and then that will create an account for you and then you'll get a staging api key and that's all you need to start doing the integration so um you don't need to do any of the compliance process any of that no you just create an account uh logs you into the dashboard you get your api key and then you can start building it's as simple as that so we've got our integration dots at integrate transact.com and again if you go to transact.com website there's a button there docs so easy to find so uh again i'll in a second i'll talk you through those a bit more and give you some of the ideas of the things we can do with that but we've got lots of documentation there yeah and then all you need to do is um you know using documents work documentation work out how to integrate uh transact into your app test it in staging and so you can do um a staging transaction um um using you know your card but don't worry your card won't be charged there won't be any real real money involved um in the staging integration uh but as long as that's working um then you can submit your project of course we'll review and if it passes you'll get a share in that prize pool uh meanwhile if you do have any questions um on on the um hackathon we have two of our colleagues harshit and annie they'll be available and so um you can ask them questions also we have our own discord for developers and also a telegram group again uh focused on developers so you can ask uh questions directly there also um in a second i'll show you uh russia and my emails actually here it's very simple sam tranzact.com rotherhearttransact.com uh so you can also email us but i would recommend trying the discord first because um lots of people ask the same questions and um uh you you'll be quicker getting response there but yeah as i said if if not then we're also available by email yes and there's the discord in the chat thanks for wathia so i'm just gonna talk a bit about um the documentation just to kind of give you an idea of what that looks like um so um yeah here's our docs um to explain um we've got a little video again you'll see my face here sorry if you don't like seeing it you're gonna have to see it again that explains again a lot of what i've said today uh we've got our partner onboarding process now of course in your case you're not going live you don't need to go through our compliance process uh get production api key so you can accept real money but obviously in future if you do want to uh that's how you do it and you know hopefully some of the projects you build if you want to you know take them live you can totally do that and go through that process but yeah this is the bit you want to see which is the jump right in and start playing around so this is the explanation of how you create a partner account access dashboard and an example of setting up a quick demo integration and then we've got the the how to guides so testing integration and customization and getting help and support so again same links you've just seen there so um uh yeah so if you want to understand our coverage and capabilities here are all the different fiat uh currency country and payment methods so you can see the full coverage that we offer um also it's really great to spend some time looking at all the different ways you can integrate and customize i'll go through them quickly in a second but also you know we've got api all of that stuff so there's lots of cool things that you can do so in terms of integration options um we we're very flexible in that front so we have a browser integration you can literally have a url a button which opens a new window with url transact it can be as simple as that to get an integration with us so um uh that's that's the easiest way to do it or you know you can embed that in an iframe so what you saw with zed run that that's you know just a little web page that's embedded in the screen and they're just uh doing that in order to show the transact widget but if you have an app so if you're building something for phone we also have an sdk integration really easy to add we provide you know whichever kind of language you want to do really easy we can add the transact widget to your app as well so that's another option in terms of customization um we provide a whole bunch of different ways so pretty much everything you can see on the transact widget is customizable you can specify um uh the user journey you can control the fiat and crypto options for the user so for example if your app relies on a particular crypto you can make it so the users can only buy that crypto no others if it's on a particular blockchain you can say only on that blockchain and you can pass the information on behalf of the user so you know if you've already got the user's wallet address because they've connected their wallet you can pass that so they don't need to re-enter it if you get the users to sign up with an email address again you can pass that you can skip screens um all sorts of different things you can do we also have visual customization and you can choose what data is displayed so it's worth really worth reading that and thinking of ways that you could improve the user journey so that users you know it's not just clicking a button and then they have to work out what they're doing you know you can uh choose the right options already for the user and make it so that they're doing exactly the right thing they need to use your app also um if you want to um also do some clever stuff we have our api so um you can pull data on the countries currencies etc you can pull price quotes if you want to show that we take through uh you can check whether it uses a wallet address um won't be necessarily relevant for there but there's also kyc sharing we can do which is very clever um that's also you can pull all order data from users so you know if there's something where the users want to see their previous orders um that's something you could pull up but also you can track the user status so this um we have quite a few partners that use these web hooks or websocket and so that when the users finish their order uh you get an update on your um app so you know the users if they're waiting for the crypto to arrive you can track that you can say track user status so you know has the user actually completed kyc you can track all that and so uh these are nice ways that you can you know guide the user through the process or add extra stuff around uh the integration as you're doing it so yeah lots of stuff in the documentation lots of stuff api as i said pretty much anything you can think of to customize is available and also um if you have any feedback any things aren't clear we really love getting feedback on on how we can prove this because as they say we really care about supporting new developers and you know providing the best thing options that we can in order to integrate us and and create a really great experience for your users with that questions and so happy to answer any questions you have in the chat so please fire away oh leonard had a question around uh mandatory regulation i'm not sure if uh leonard you're referring to kyc cool so in terms of uh regulations so um in terms of the hackathon you don't need to worry about any of that stuff because we'll just be doing a test integration um in terms of um us because yeah because we're touching traditional finance we're touching you know dollars pounds etc we have to follow um regulations you know we are money services businesses so we have to be compliant in those areas or you know to be blunt we can go to prison so not so much political statement it's kind of a necessity um but yeah we we we take regulation very seriously um but yeah as we said we think there's real value in us us worrying about that part of the traditional finance world and you can focus on on the crypto side cool are we looking for android developers we have a careers page um so you can go on the transact website and uh look at the careers so um we've got positions open so apply um if any any of you spot them cool ah that's a really good question what's the added value of integrating transact when it's already on metamask great so one of the key things is if you've got users who you're telling them to go to better but you then need to tell them go to metamask and then buy a metamask well instead of doing that you can have a button which is buy which is basically i know it's recreating what's in metamouse but you don't need to explain anything to the user it's very easy to add and again you're just taking them through um and you know in your case you know metamask is allowing you to buy any erc20 if your app only works on one particular erc20 or let's say it only works on polygon whatever it is you can have it so that your user journey's fine tuned for that also you know metamask as i said there's lots of things where they're very generic whereas you might want to skip screens you can make a much better user experience and so for the user they're going through much quicker they're topping in the wallet and they're using your app straight away rather than telling them hey open metamask then click buy and also right you know what if you want to use another wallet right not every single wallet sadly has yet integrated us so why limit it to just those users who've got meta masks so yeah that was that was a great question um to that i would add like a they could if they already know their user's wallet they could even just preload their wallet inside the transact widget already and then they when they click buy that will be already there um is there a way to make the ui look like the user is just buying tokens so that it doesn't even feel like crypto things yes so we do have some options to hide some of the complexities so you can hide things like gas fees you can hide a lot of the crypto stuff so yeah you can make it look much more that they're they're just buying and some of that complexity is hidden yeah exactly the reason so yeah in the documentation we have a bit about visual customization that explains how you can choose what gets shown to the user awesome well i guess that's it for questions for now um yeah as the team said they are available um for immediate response on discord on their discord so definitely join their discord um if you have any questions about tranzact or your projects um and otherwise uh rocio and sam thank you so much for taking the time to do this workshop with our hackers um definitely very useful um very interesting and for the rest of you thank you so much for taking the time to tune in um the workshop is recorded and also on youtube for you to look back at at any point so if you need the resource definitely feel free to go look on youtube and otherwise we have some more workshops happening um soon so definitely hope to see all your faces there and otherwise have a great rest
