all right welcome everybody to zora workshop on how the zoro protocol is working uh we have brex dutch hill with us today that will be um running the workshop uh we'll just start with a quick reminder that you uh have to do your staking before the event starts so if you haven't taken yet um please go ahead and do that before the weekend um that's it i will let it on to uh you break for the workshop awesome are we ready to start yes we are cool um well hello everyone um my name is breck i'm an engineer at zora and i'm going to talk a little bit i guess for the next half an hour just about some of the motivations and some of the details of what we've built and i will preface it with my neighbors have just decided to demolition their house so periodically there's a bunch of noise please let me know in the chat or feel free to interrupt me if i'm not talking loud enough and also i want this to be pretty interactive slash casual so if you know if you have any questions please feel free also to just like jump in and interrupt me and you know we can address them you know as we go so cool we'll start off with a few slides about why we build zora i think there's no question or doubt that like platforms have sort of dictated the way that people interact with the internet online um they're everywhere they're omnipresent they have created um and this is like especially true for creators on the internet um i think you know we've seen large platforms that have created large social graphs and distribution mechanisms of distribution that have sort of forced creators to to play by their rules um that have um caused them to like forfeit a lot of their their like ownership and rights to the things that they that they create online um and so i think one of the the main reasons all of us are here and are interested in nfts is to sort of give the power back to you know the sovereign individuals or creators on the internet and take it away from these large platforms that you know do bad things on the internet uh and so erc erc721 uh that was built a few years ago was like this like really interesting standard api for the ownership of non-fungible assets on the ethereum blockchain and this created like what i would consider a step function improvement to how people can create and transfer the ownership of digital goods on the internet and so we've seen like some pretty fun projects with like cryptokitties um crypto punks hash masks and mike obviously the biggest headline these days is is the amount of money that peoples are going for um and sorry did i hear someone jump in maybe not um and er2 721s are great but around the time of mid to late 2020 um the zora team sort of gave an honest appraisal of how the state of infts was and i think it's fairly well represented by this chart of there were a number of you know marketplaces that sat on top of this like thin erc721 standard that defined the creation of you know this this non-fungible token that can be that that can be transferred from any account on the ethereum blockchain but there wasn't this like native monetization built into here to the erc721 standard and so marketplaces sort of were built in you know places like wearable super air open c etc that allow for the facilitation of of monetizing your nft or transferring ownership via another erc20 or via eth but but we noticed that a lot of these marketplaces have mechanisms of platform lock-in they have things such as like the exclusive they enforce exclusivity in creation um they have royalties that are proprietary to their marketplace or they have platform fees that when a sale is made on their platform um some of it must be kicked back to the platform right and i think it was a really interesting thing for us to see because we thought this was like we were being ushered into a new paradigm where erc 721s were giving power back to the creator where they had full ownership of the things that they created but these marketplaces were sort of building in many of the same lock-in mechanisms and like predatory economic models as existing um web 2 platforms and so it got us thinking like how can we make the protocol layer a little how can we improve upon erc 721 to have the value not accrued to marketplaces but to accrue to the owners of and creators of nfts and so this is a an image that i think was part of a a blog post by joel monegra back in 2017 called the fat layer or fat protocol thesis and if you think of the existing nft marketplaces with you know proprietary royalties and proprietary platform fees a lot of the value that's captured for the transfer or the exchange of nfts actually accrues to the marketplace and the protocol layer er6721 is actually very thin in definition and so i think you know uh taking joelman agros initial claim and applying an ft marketplace to it is a fairly accurate depiction of what things look like and so for us we were like how can we make that protocol layer a bit more thick and have the value accrue back to the creator or the owner of nft and not to these web to ask marketplaces that um that are providing services for nfcs and so that was the primary motivation for creating zora and the way that we did that was we unified what we call the media and the market or we we embedded a market inside of the actual token itself and i'm going to say this once that this is something that i think uh is very important to understand is that zora is not a marketplace zora is not a platform it is a protocol that pushes and makes that erc 721 standard um thicker or fatter in nature and so this is a a little diagram of like what what the zord protocol actually looks like basically all it does is it's an extension of the erc721 that embeds all of the uh like royalty logic and auction logic into a single contract that um are perpetual in nature and will like live with it with the nft as long as the nft exists um and so you can see like if you have the the existing erc721 behavior such as transfer burn token uri et cetera we also um added in like ask um remove bid set bid accept bid this sort of like very basic market behavior um to to embed that into the token itself and we've also sprinkled in a little bit of um stuff for for gasless transactions or eip 712 for meta transactions which i can talk to a little bit later um and so let's talk a little bit about what the xor market is the zord market is perpetual so unlike a lot of existing marketplaces where you have like a reserve price and it must be met and the highest bidder wins and the market closes at the end of the auction the zoro market is perpetual so if i create an nft on zora and someone wants to bid on it i can build up like a like an actual order book of bid liquidity and if i accept a single bid all of the bid liquidity will remain on on the uh piece of media unless the bidders remove it so you can think of um transferring ownership or accepting azore bin as the equivalent of transferring ownership of the order book as well which is a pretty interesting concept we think it's the zoro market is also multi-currency so any erc20 that conforms or any token that conforms to the er20 standard can be accepted as a bid on zora and so like if if you go to zoro.co today which which is our platform that's built on top of the protocol you'll see many mini bids are actually in a number of different currencies like wrapped eath we've seen bids in friends with benefits we've seen bids in same fame token ric usdc dye et cetera but but any erc 20 can be accepted as a bid on the zora market it's open so generally for auctions the highest bidder is the bid that's accepted at the end of you know the auction period but for zora the owner of the nft has full ownership over which bid to accept so there's an interesting question about bitter identity uh and the next concept of sell-on chair that that makes the open the openness of the market very interesting so a bidder is able to optionally create what's called a cell and chair as a part of their bed and this is something that's like generally used in uh professional soccer for transferring players where when when when you have a soccer team and you have a high profile player and you want to transfer them to another soccer team you can specify the transfer fee such that when that player leaves the other team you get kickback for for that future sale and so we've applied that to zora nft such that if i created an nft and um alice wants to buy it from me she could specify a 10 percent sell-on share and i would sell it to alice for the big currency in a mountain and then when alice sells it to bob i get 10 of that of that sale um and so that's another interesting um economic incentive that we've that we've built into the protocol to that i think is not used in other market protocols um the other bid share incentive is the creator chair and this is where the royalties come in so as a creator you can optionally specify a percentage of equity that you have perpetually on your nft um so if i if i create something and i specify 10 percent creator share every every bid or every yeah every bid that's finalized on the zora market or settled on the zora market i will get ten percent of that and this is they all baked into the zora market to smart contract and the last and most important thing about everything related to zora is that it's trustless um we we made the very specific decision to deploy zora as a as a smart contract that has zero um permissions and zero like admin ability it's very much like uniswap v1 where it's just code that lives on the blockchain and anyone can use so you don't have to be a specific whitelisted account to create or or bid on zora um cool and so we've made a number of other updates to erc721 that i'm happy to talk about but if anyone has any questions i will pause for a second i see some notifications in the chat let's see sorry i'm gonna go down in order uh question from youtube is zora the zoracles um no we are not zoricles i don't know too much about the project but i know they have a token with dollar sign zora as their symbol but we are different we are an nft protocol for individuals to create nfts with a market embedded into it question from youtube does zor support lazy minting so to my knowledge lazy minting is something that is used on openc where you can mint something and it doesn't actually get put onto the blockchain until after it's been minted we have not built that into zoro.co the product yet but we have definitely gotten that feature request and our thinking about ways that we could put that into the product experience let's see question from mark does the creator share only apply when sold on the zora market yes it does so this is something that we're actually seeing come up quite often so like anything all of the logic for zora is is built into code on a smart contract and so in order for the royalties to actually be upheld the the bids must be settled on the zora market to like invoke the code to split up that bid to either the creator or or for the cell on share and so if you um mint something on zora but then move to like open c or to wearable where they're actually listing zora nfts and opts to accept bids there you would not be upholding the creators here because they're not currently settling their bids on on the zora market we're actually working with them currently to try to get them to act to directly integrate with the zorro market so we don't have this trouble uh moving forward let's see what are your thoughts on standard for cross-market royalties um this is this is interesting question as well i think right now our answer is the easiest way to ensure cross-market royalties is directly make sure that your bids are settled on zora market contracts because that functionality exists it shouldn't be a problem i think right now it's just ensuring that if if people are listings or nfts making sure that in the uh if they're not settling on the door market that it's well it's it's well known because i think currently that's not happening and that's that's a problem let's see is it possible to create your own marketplace using zora protocol and get a list of nfts created through a given platform um yeah exactly so we've actually worked on building a bunch of developer tools um so that people can create their own platform on zoro so the zdk is is our javascript sdk and it provides full functionality in a javascript context to interact with with zora and we also have a subgraph implementation that gives you a graphql interface for pulling all the data that's indexed by the zora protocol and i think two good examples of platforms that are currently building marketplaces that leverage zora are mirror the blog writing project and then also catalog uh which is an audio only um project that's built on zorah see sorry there's a lot of questions um here i'm gonna what i'm gonna do right now because i i want to get through the rest of the presentation is i'm going to keep going through um and then i'll get to q a at the end i think i've got another 15 minutes so keep your questions till the end so uh a few other important updates that we've made uh to erc 721 aside from adding this market functionality are the decoupling of content and metadata allowing for updatable uris um uh it says my internet is bad but we'll keep we'll keep trucking can you all hear me by the way can i get a nod yes okay cool yeah we can hash integrity and then meta transaction cool um so in the existing erc 721 standard there's an optional metadata interface that that a token can can prescribe to and that includes a token uri uh and so so i think the best way to think about it is like ethereum is really bad at storing data so if you wanted to store like arbitrary digital content it would be prohibitively expensive and so most nfts are actually they just contain a reference to to some some content that actually lives elsewhere generally it's on ipfs but if you're unlucky it could be on a centralized server run by a minting platform and so when you look at most erc721s they just have a token uri and it contains a reference to some json like this is an example of the token uri for people's 5000 days so one would think that this token uri would actually point to the ipfs link to the actual content but it's really just a json blog that gives some some metadata information and somewhere in the metadata is the actual like link to the raw file uh and so like there's this weird coupling of metadata in the actual content and when we were going about writing zora we're like this felt really backwards to us it felt like it was pigeonholed um as a part of the original erc721 design uh so we actually took it out and we've like very cleanly split the content in uri and the token metadata uri um so we we we kept the existing token uri to not break um how people use zora and that points to like the actual content itself and we split out another uri for the metadata where you can have a pointer to uh to the metadata so they're very cleanly split and not part of the same uri so here's an example this is a zora nft it has a token uri that points to uh this ipfs hash which is where we'll call it people's 5000 days lives we have a metadata uri that points to another ipfs hash which has the json metadata about the nft um and so for many erc 721s once you specify the uri it actually can't be changed which is also problematic because um you know what happens if the ipfs link breaks um you need to have the ability to like update it otherwise the owner of the nft is sort of like screwed like that thing is worth nothing anymore so like let's say for example um this people's thing sold for 69 million dollars to to a bidder and as soon as the better gets it they try to access the uri but uh it's a dead link like now the nft is worth nothing because the thing that it points to doesn't actually exist um okay so let's add for the ability to add updateable uris right like people should be able to freely change where the content actually lives in a world where data storage is flexible and and it's updatable right well another problem arises what happens when the owner of people changes the uri to the rickroll video that's also problematic because now you're breaking the provenance of of the nft um and so we decided to uh this is what happens when you try to get too fancy with uh with him with your google slide animations so we decided to add uh the storage of content hashes for each of these things to allow for the uris to be updated so when you mint you up you actually provide a constant hash which is the hash of the uri for the thing that you're creating and a metadata hash which is the hash for the uri of your metadata and so anyone at any time during the life cycle of an nft can read the uri and check its content hash so in the case that people minted 5000 days with the correct ipfs hash and a content hash and then a future owner updated the token you arrived to the rickroll video anyone would be able to perform a verification and realize that the content hash and the uri do not match and that this thing is not worth what it should be worth but then they can also verify that the metadata hash matches its metadata and so i think this is a very powerful tool to allow for more flexible data storage of metadata for nfts but also still not sacrifice the verification and authenticity that the thing that you're buying is the thing that wasn't initially created by the owner or by the creator we've actually seen there's the animation we've actually seen some nice open source tools be built um sam i'm forgetting how to pronounce his last name uh built this thing called znft.v dot app that you can put in any token your uh or any token id on the zora protocol and see if it's content hash and metadata match up with with the existing uris in storage and the final thing about hashing and metadata and uris is that because we're actually storing the hash of um of each piece minted on zora we can now enforce constant uniqueness so if someone mints an nft that references a hash that hash can never be reused and can only minted one so now zora is this like unique media registry for things that are made on the internet and there's provably no copies no fakes which is a super powerful constraint that i think a lot of nft existing nft contracts do not take advantage of cool and so like you know this hackathon is going to be an incredible opportunity for people to hack and build on a ton of different things in the nft space xor is an open and permissionless protocol for nfts so anyone can build web 2 marketplaces and galleries and experience on top of zora anyone can build more smart contracts that directly compose with our media contract or our market contract and you know we're here to to help any of the builders that that are interested in building with us we have a lot of tools at zora engineering so the zdk and the subgraph that i mentioned all the documentation live of zordon engineering a bunch of our engineers will be available throughout the days of the hackathon to be able to provide any sort of help via office hours for anyone that wants to build and i think we have a sponsor zora um like channel on the discord where we're all available and here to answer any questions that you all have um so if anyone has any questions i will jump into the chat also feel free to like just say them out loud so i'm not like reading endlessly yeah thank you greg that was really great um i know you do have a tons of questions so uh feel free to pick and choose what you find is the most relevant and for anyone else who wants to keep this conversation going i mean we still have five minutes and it's uh we'll use all of it uh but yes do join the the discord channel there's a specific one for zoa and keep the conversation going there cool um yeah so i'll just start reading them down unless anyone interrupts me and and has a question live um so a question from bob is how many future share sales do the shares apply to all just one or uh or can that be specified or stacked by serial owners so the creator shares perpetual so when you meant and you specify a 10 creator share all future sales you will be given your 10 share the sell on shares however is only for the next sale so and that's not stacked or configurable so if i sell to alice and alice specifies a selling share of 10 as a part of her bid i will only get 10 of the sale from alice to bob not of the sale from bob to charlie et cetera um we thought about we thought it'd be really cool to have that be like perpetual as well like almost like recursive cell on chairs but um due to some constraints with the evm it's just like it's not possible to do uh and so we mixed that pretty quickly um cool so question from youtube which is a great one can i define my own market eg bonding curve dutch auction or is there a protocol confined to bids so because we've thought about zora as a primary primitive at the base layer of interacting with nfts we intentionally designed the market to be very flexible very unopinionated to give full ownership to the creator or in the owner um that being said though you can it's super trivial to um you know create any sort of uh open specific logic that you would want for a more interesting type of auction so if you wanted to build a dutch auction for example you could build a contract that composes directly with the zora market and has the dutch auction mechanism codified in a smart contract so we're actually seeing uh this happen right now um coldy auctions for example are very commonplace auction mechanism for for nfts where you provide a reserve price and once the reserve price is met it kicks off a timer and every single time a new highest bid is is is made then the timer resets uh and mirror protocol is building um a periphery smart contract for zora that they'll be using in their product to allow for culti so the short answer is zora is ultimately flexible and unopinionated but if you want to have specific auction logic then you need to build your own contract that composes with sora and we'll see this happen over time when more and more people start to see the power of being open and composable um let's see so what is zora's business model of not a marketplace zora does not have a business model we are open source software anyone can use our open contracts that are deployed on the blockchain anyone can use our open source tooling uh and we're currently using we've built a product but there's no uh platform fees or anything built into that we're we're for creators to use we're here to help empower people uh to fight platforms let's see does zora support multiple copies of entities like erc-1155 um so no zora is opinionated in that we only are an extension of er2721 um which means that all zora nfts are one of one for those of you who are not aware erc-1155 allows for um like almost like additions uh so you can specify uh a new thing that's made and then there can be multiple owners or multiple like sub token ids for that thing but you're but we're just an erc721 extension um let's see um so question from alexander by composable do you mean inheriting from zora media or market contracts um no i mean so in in solidity land uh when you're writing a contract you can invoke a contract function on any other contract so anyway you know it's similar to how like uh in traditional programming if you like import uh you know something from node you can like call those functions um so what you would do is to compose with azure contracts would write your own contract that directly calls functionality on zora media or azure market another question from youtube which is actually a great one is can't you defeat the selling chair by selling to yourself before selling it for real so like most of the incentive mechanisms in zora are are somewhat um like not defendable right so you're exactly right i could specify a selling share as a bidder and then totally screw over the previous owner by by selling it to somebody else for super cheap price or or negotiating terms outside of the zora market we are of the belief that bitter identity is a super important mechanism to combat like predatory behavior like this so as an owner of an nft you have complete ownership over to who you actually sell it to and so if you sell it to someone who has shown that they skirt out of the zora market in the past it's probably not a good idea to sell to them but if you you know if you see a bidder from someone if you see a bid from someone who has shown that they traditionally do things on the azure market like you'll get your your creator share by by selling to them uh then generally that's someone that you should be um accepting bids from so i think we'll see like a social graph slash identity be built on top of our protocol for collectors and creators who to make the right decision on who to accept bids from and you know and and things like that question from youtube could someone make an erc721 version of zora absolutely i mean zora again is open source anyone can grab the code anyone can take the market constructs and build it into erc1155 i don't know enough about erc11155 to know how trivial or non-trivial that would be but by all means like anyone can grab from our ideas and do the same thing to rephrase is there a way to extend zora to cover other nft types erc1155 erc998 i'm not familiar enough with either of those two eips to be able to give a straight answer but i'm happy to discuss more on the discord i think we're actually a bit over time but there's a lot of questions that i didn't answer and i'm definitely available in the chat along with some other people from zora and we'll be happy to provide any any answers to anyone there thank you so much yes uh exactly so um really huge thank you for the presentation uh that was great there's also a lot of questions everybody on youtube and on zoom uh again go to the channel if you um if you can and uh thanks for attending the best thank you thanks everyone
