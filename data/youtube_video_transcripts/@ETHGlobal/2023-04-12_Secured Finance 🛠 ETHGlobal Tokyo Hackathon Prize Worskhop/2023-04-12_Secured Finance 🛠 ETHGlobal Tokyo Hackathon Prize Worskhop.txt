foreign [Applause] [Music] to explain the price uh what kind of price we're gonna issue and before um go to the price let's share my screen and introduce what is secure Finance yeah guys nice to meet you everyone my name is timoley community lead at secure finance and today we have a friends Reuben could you explain uh introduce yourself yeah of course thank you Tima uh hello everyone so I'm Ruben Abu clear I'm director of engineering at second Finance I'm basically leading the um the development team for second Finance great yeah secure Finance actually born from East Global hackathon it was back to 2020 the first tech FS um you know um our founder and the CEO Masa joined the heck FS as a hacker in 2020 that was the first file coin and This Global hackathon and we won the best price of D5 from first collapse is it a foundation so after two years or two or three years we come back to the hackathon you know we sponsored hacks on the hack FS hack money that was online and this is first time you know and we are sponsoring East Global Tokyo hackathon in Japan so um quick introduced to secure Finance platform and all our Solutions we are building the audiobook based Landing Market it means uh you're wearing ear to based lending Market by having yield curve we can build a FX forward market and we can provide a heading solutions for Traders for for users and the ultimate goal is to build the derivatives Market in the cryptocurrency space if this is decentralized derivatives Market what we don't see in the cryptocurrency space yet yeah um so you see my screen and this is the secure Finance lending platform UI so currently we are at the test net stage and we have been implemented this interest lending and the borrowing solution for major four currencies now Bitcoin ether falcoin and the stablecoin usdc um so the current platform is audible based lending solution and we provide the zero coupon loan markets we also provide the feature of a smart contract clearing control body and altered Redemption rolling so Ruben would like to explain more about these four features yes of course so those saw features are really what the differentiators on other D5 protocol um the audio boost order book based Landing means that we we use a older book system for Price Discovery uh contrary to something a pool system like Ave for instance we let user place order at the rates they want or the price they want and when we have someone who want to accept this order we have a match and the order is taken we this is basically what is used in the traditional Finance world it's it's what is happening when you buy a stock online for instance the zero coupon loan Market is um indicates that our products are a simple fixed term loan so for instance you see here June 2023 in our screenshots of our UI it means that at this date this is the the maturity of the products so you will need if you borrow at this date you we need to pay back what you borrowed at exactly at these days uh the smart contract clearing contact party is what's make a D5 protocol a D5 protocol um we um uh we creating this security uh where the users need to deposit collateral before borrowing and our smart contract is checking that this collateral is still enough and if it's not it's going to clear the user position and finally the auto reduction running means that when your term is finished it's automatically automatically roll into a new term so you can basically lend or borrow and forget and it will accrue your interests great yeah thank you let's go to the next page yeah I think for hackers and developers or programmers who is joining is global Toko hackathon and we provide some user for links like landing page on the landing page you can check out the take your Finance vision and the mission and the short intro to the team members and like links to many and like like trading platform or blogs and the most important the test net is the staging environment we implement we deployed on the goalie Network so yeah you should check out the staging Network and file set so yeah we provide the like lending solution for four major currencies Bitcoin ether Falcon and stablecoin usdc you can meet the test point test token on the file set network and the GitHub so check out the GitHub you can see the intro to the secret Finance protocol and smart contract some documentations and API sdks if you want to read more like articles about SQL Finance go to medium and if you want to receive the the latest updates and please follow the secure Finance Twitter yeah we issued uh three price top D5 best DUI and the ux and excellent Finance Awards so three prices um the first two top D5 and the ux UI is the engineering topic so it means you should submit code you should Implement some features by programming and the third one it could be non-engineering submission so you can submit some research analysis and like documentations yeah let's deep dive into the three price and uh like uh potential topics top 35 hours we issue 2 000 US dollar price um so you can build on top of secret Finance protocol and uh yeah we provide uh like SDK protocol apis and through these apis you can interact with the SQL Finance protocol um and you also can propose um Falcon is freezing solution um so I see Community is building the filecoin is freezing Solutions but um of course if you have better idea of Bridging the cross chains you can propose some solutions about that and the liquidation bot using existing smart contract so Reuben would you like to explain more about the first price yeah sure so uh the basically did this first price is to build on top of all existing protocol so as you said we provide those ABI spy so the the you can uh you can interact with the smart contract I think a good example here is the liquidation but we have all the functions on the smart contracts to check if users are also the limit and to do the liquidation itself but we need um something around this to to uh to be able to trigger this liquidation so that that would be really a good example um Yep this is the the top defy yeah sounds good and for the second part is the best UI and the ux awards we issue 100 1500 and the goal of this price is to improve the trading experience on our platform and so uh what we are missing is um the historical yield curve so as hacker you can propose and Implement a historical Earl Kirk and I think third one for the composition interface so if you are available if you know if you have understanding of um like other book based trading platform and you can propose a character trade strategy so Reuben I would like to explain more about the second price yeah so as you said this one is really to improve the training experience so we will show you or you already saw a screenshot but we will show you uh the staging environment we have with our current interface uh what we are interested here is something a bit more complicated than what we offer for instance the project composition interface is how can we how can you make it uh easy and user friendly to do two trades at the same time so borrowing six months and ending three months for instance it's called an interest rate carry trade uh it's not easy to make it user friendly and uh we provide those bricks the borrow of six months and the lead of three months in the smart contract obviously but yeah that that's what would be interesting same with the the yield curve uh right now we provide on a website on the application only the current yield curve but we would be very interested to see an historical lead code sounds good yeah and the third one as we mentioned before is could be non-engineering submission and so you can you know propose any kind of financial uh new ideas like financial data analysis and if you are familiar with trading and or like Quant trading you can propose a trading system modeling or new strategy is welcome and some Market data research so please provide your insights your expertise and the Professional Knowledge about the trading system especially so please um like submit some like Financial Innovations to the our platform yeah yeah since we since since we are order book based system you can basically apply things which are already done in the traditional Finance into the the crypto world and so maybe you have ideas of trading strategy of a possible Arbitrage all of this can be very helpful so yeah please submit your ideas great yeah please keep in your mind these three topics and now let's go to the uh eoi I think uh Reuben prepared the lab demo on the staging environment so we will then please share your screen and the next I think we can explain a little bit about the documentation and the protocol SDK and we call it the blockchain API Uber yeah share a screen please yes all right so this is our staging environment and you have the address in the slide is sdg.secure.finance and this is how it looks uh we recently deployed this changing environment for for our users and we are very excited for you to to try it and to see it so first of all when you arrive you need to connect your wallet um you connect your wallet it is on go early this network so you really need to be on Google or it won't work it is deployed there and you arrive on this page this is our what we call our simple lending and borrowing experience you are able here to place a board or Landing order uh a market order meaning that you will accept any rates and you will be able to fill your order like this so for instance here let's sell our two borrow then fine call here I'll come here I click on then here I'll borrow I confirm my order my metamask is popping I hope you can see it click the gas fees are quite expensive today but um same thing and the order should be placed once the transaction is validated just bear with me few seconds here so you have the other validated here success click on OK and I actually borrowed 10 Falcon um you could see yeah but I'd add a lot of Falcons so you can't really see I had 10 more but I I did more uh so as I say born on land here you have a advanced experience this expands show the other book we talked about it a lot the other book and it allows you to place a limit order the limit order it's another when you place uh you choose the the price you want so here let's say we want 92 um I will be in the in this order I will leave my order into the order book with the price of 92 and if someone wants to be boring to land that 92 the order will be done asynchronously um so I'm not gonna go through all the different features here I just wanted to show you a quick look uh you can find on our medium articles um several article explaining or user again explaining or how to use the application and we're happy for you to to read those um however I want to mention one point uh is the faucet so here you have the faucet we also gave you the link uh before his first set allows you to Mint or test token so we have a test tube filecoin that's usdc and a test by Bitcoin and you mean them you're gonna add them automatically to your wallet and you will be able to land and borrow and I say that because my protocol right now in this environment is using only those tokens so if you need to interact with those tokens you need sorry if you need to interact with our smart contracts for you this um when you do some development you need those token so you will need to come and get those okay yeah Reuben keep crashing here relates to the second price EO IU x square and like historical yield curve uh like a product composition interface so for Packers what do you think they can propose to the current platform or improve the current platform user experience so what we need right now is a a way to do this so we're not opening our code of our interface right now uh we're not ready for that yeah not live yet uh but you can see uh our interface and what we are able to see so for instance here you have the current yield curve by a different currency it's the rates but those are the current rate so if some hacker have an ideas or we could display historical rate so historical income lettuce B great same with the advanced mode yeah a CEO are able only to borrow for one product but what if I want to land December 23 and borrow September 23 and uh this must be very good ways and and user experience to do that and this is the kind of contribution we're looking for uh some kind of user experience to do these kind of things yeah makes sense great Reuben let's jump to the monkey top yes okay so right now as I said we open source oh um or abis in the smart contract so we have here when you arrive to the secured Finance GitHub page which is already also in the in the slide you can see our SF smart contracts in this file you have the deployments files which are the apis which gives you all the information to interact with the smart contract so those are also the apis about stitching environments so those contracts here we you were interacting are the same one here so you have the deployment files and then um we also added all documentation so this documentation gives you insights of all the methods we have in the smart contract for instance I'll go to The Lending Market controller description and you have the functions and the arguments and what they do so this is can be very useful for you to understand our smart contract and to be able to call the right function on what you need to do uh yes and and that's it this is here in the asset smart contract as I said uh this is right now the only open source repository we have um I'm not yet uh in a place where we can open source the rest but uh it should arrive soon but after the racket yes yeah um so by like showing the staging environment platform and the GitHub I think we explained the first and the second price uh possibilities right top D5 and the best UI ux especially for third one like uh excellent Finance or I think uh hackers can go to the medium article or landing page and to discover more about the what we are building so there is more useful documentations uh please check out the medium blog and the landing page and the proposed your like financial data analysis or some trading strategy so yeah you can of course you can write a you can do modeling using Python program language or it could it could be non-engineering non-uh programming submission so we hope everyone can enjoy the time in Tokyo uh hackathon um and lastly I would like to say to hackers please come to the workshop Workshop um uh like space in the venue they're going to be a workshop space and we will be there and we want to talk to you interact with you and also learn from you guys so let's uh meet in Tokyo yeah and if you have any questions there Technical and the help we will be here also too to help engage you yeah as you can see uh the like GitHub open source ratio is a little bit low because we deployed the test net last month so we are doing our best so if you want to learn more about the like protocol please come to us in the workshop space thank you great thank you very much thank you
