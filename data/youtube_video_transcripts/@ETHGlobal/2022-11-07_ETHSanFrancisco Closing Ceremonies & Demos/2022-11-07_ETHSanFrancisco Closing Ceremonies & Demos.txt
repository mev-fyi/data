fighting tonight [Music] [Music] thank you this is [Music] [Music] I know I should be [Music] here [Music] welcome [Music] GM eats San Francisco are you all excited welcome to eat San Francisco [Applause] if you're a developer and you've never been to a few hackathon before you're in retreat [Music] nervous but also okay I'm kind of relieved because I didn't sleep last night and I wanted to end [Music] welcome everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the closing ceremonies all right it's been a long weekend so let's get right into it this was a massive event 1700 people from 46 different countries 40 of them were new to web3 and not only is this our biggest event ever this is now officially the world's biggest wet 3 hackathon so please give that a big round of applause [Applause] for those of you who are watching us on the live stream I want to remind everybody that this is not a conference if Global events are hackathons and our focus is on Builders these are opportunities for you to learn get help and grow as an individual and we really believe showing is way more important than telling and that's what the next one and a half hour is going to be all about we kind of started this off in 2017 by running one event called eighth Waterloo it was the only thing that was out there in this space and over time this became what is known as Heath Global uh 26 18 was six events we ran six more in 2019 2020 was four because for obvious reasons 2021 19 and then this year we ramped up everything to do 16 hackathons around across the world and that's what eth Global became now we started with Buenos Aires in 18 we got some screenshots of India San Francisco from four years ago Singapore the Waterloo this is Cape Town in South Africa London Amsterdam earlier this year New York from this summer Mexico City from a couple weeks ago or months ago and eat Bogota Defcon just about two weeks ago all these things are some of the the communities we've kind of helped not only create but Inspire and you've kind of known us from doing two things hackathons and Summits but two weeks ago Eve Global turned five we've been around for five years and it's been an incredible past five years I want to take a moment to highlight all the amazing things that have come out of these events we've done 40 hackathons including this one 30 different summons that have just brought in educational content for everybody around the world they've brought in over 70 000 people into web3 we have seen 5300 projects come out of it we've given six million dollars in prizes to people from over 120 countries we've done 1400 talks all of them are on our YouTube people have learned about tutorials and interviews and everything in between and they have reached millions of people or millions of views and hundreds of thousands of people across the globe and this brings us all back to where we are today not only that so many companies have been founded so much money has been raised from people who've started as hackathon projects ecosystems bootstrapped so many jobs created we constantly get emails from people saying they've been able to get a job from kind of participating at hackathon you've met so many incredible people I know some of my closest friends from these events protocols have gotten so much feedback to improve of course the swac that you've all gotten and the pull apps we've all claimed just some of the immeasurable things that have come out of this and we wanted to extend more and get more developers into this ecosystem so I want to quickly talk about two new things that we have launched over the past couple weeks and you've kind of seen a glimpse of that already from your hacker dashboard the first one is guys and the second one is jobs guides came out last week for us these are ways for you to learn how to get into web3 on your own pace you can learn how different protocols work you can learn how to code over time and catch up on all the things that are happening in this space these are going to be curated tutorials that are interactive that you can check out on ethglobal.com and if you submitted a project today you also got early access to the youth Global job board if you are looking to actually change your careers and get into web 3 and switch roles or get interesting other opportunities you can sign up for being part of our job board on your hacker dashboard and we'll be reaching out to you over the next couple weeks to talk about how all that is structured so we have four more things coming or four things in total coming including guides and jobs and this is just the beginning we're going to do a lot more here to bring up hundreds of thousands of more devs but the reason I'm talking about all of this thing is that five years is not a lot of time and we really want web3 to win at a global and I want to take a moment here before we go into all the demos and the prizes to really thank everybody that's been here all the hackers the mentors the partners the speakers everybody who's ever been a judge or volunteer I really really want to thank all of you for being part of this amazing community and we are really grateful on the global team so please give yourselves and everybody a big round of applause because we would not be here without you thank you all right let's get to the stuff that all of you've been waiting for eat San Francisco this is a massive hackathon we had 284 projects come out of it and we spent the entire morning judging all of these projects on the other end of this building and with that I'm super proud to talk to you about all the things that we're going to show on stage and I want to quickly thank everybody that made this happen so especially all of our judges who've been here the entire morning talking to all of you giving feedback and really appreciating all the things that have come out so please join me in giving a big round of applause to all of our amazing judges we have Eric Julian Liam Brian Elena my Scott Justin will Alexis Howard asked Joseph Dimitri Devon Casey Abram Sam Eleni Jeff Omar Evan Catherine Linda Sarah Tomo and Nikki they've been here this entire morning there are some of them are right now in the audience too and I want to thank you so much for giving all this amazing feedback to hundreds of teams and not only that there are a lot of our men our amazing partners that are on uh in the building that you've talked to them you've you're going to be winning a lot of their prizes so uh to give them also an appreciation from us please give them a even bigger round of applause I want to thank ipfs filecoin openc optimism polygon scale World coin cartesi ens lens protocol unit swap Foundation Uma xmtp the graph hyperlane eya push protocol live beer luo zero X apcoin near San Jose fuel tenderly teller tune analytics unlock quick note gnosis chain empiric Network evmos findora midpoint triangle covalent Samsung next and Pull and swing all these companies and partners are bringing in so many uh prizes and we're going to talk about all that soon so 284 projects I'll stop talking because I'm going to I want to get to the stuff that all of you've been waiting for we did four hours of judging we paralyzed everything in 13 tracks and through that we got 13 amazing finalists what's going to happen next for the next 60 minutes is we're going to bring him on they're going to demo what they built these are some of our our favorite 13 teams that came from the main judging process and without further ado I want to bring them on actually you know there's more we'll bring them on here one by one and then after that we're going to talk about all the prizes that you've been waiting for so please give a big round of applause to our 13 finalists we have Mundo fieldscape BB3 beeper Dow consensus mellow Vault orc 3 Unix ZK section 9 decentral couch Cambria swallow project peekaboo and snap chain these are the teams that are going to be coming on and setting up and before we go into our very first demo I want to take a quick second to thank the 271 other teams that are listed here and on the next slide just because you're not one of these 13 teams does not mean we're not good enough or there's something wrong with it these are just some of the themes that our judges were excited to uh to Showcase and I want to give my sincere thanks to all of you for submitting a project demoing it and so many of you who are doing this thing for the first time kind of having to follow that through for the whole weekend and being able to show that and learn from everything that you figured out this weekend is no small thing so please give yourselves a round of applause for being one of the 284 teams that presented and submitted a project and if any of you want to learn about all the rest of the list is and or follow up on any of the details you can all head over to eat global.com showcase and you can see all the projects that came out of today's event and all the details from those projects all right I'll stop talking now let's welcome our very first demo that is Project Mundo foreign all right all right so we built a project called Mundo that enables cross-chain utility for refi that is regenerative finance and tokenized carbon credits my name is Doug and this is Luis I worked on the back end and he worked on the front end and yeah dynamic duo team over here um before I get into it for anyone that's not familiar there is a growing movement in web 3 called regenerative Finance also known as refi um yeah there we go let's hear it for refi um it's really awesome and it's basically looking at web 3 as um you know a new technology and incentive model for solving the climate crisis amongst other things and so a big part of that is actually looking at the existing problems in the carbon markets and there's a lot of projects that are tokenizing carbon credits bring them on chain and plugging them into the liquidity that exists in D5 and solving some of the problems there um some of the biggest projects today um have launched they launched about a year ago um they're on polygon and most of the liquidity uh is concentrated on polygon for these tokenized carbon credits um and that means that it's really really hard if you're on any other chain to interact with these assets right um and at the same time um there's sort of a trade-off they don't really have reasons to bridge it to other chains because that only further fragments the liquidity of an already really low volume asset and that's kind of the the whole point of bringing it on chain um and there's also a lot of risks of individuals bridging those assets and managing that themselves so we saw those as sort of big bottlenecks and scaling refi and the on-ching carbon markets um and so that's why we built Mundo and Luis is going to walk through uh what the what the product looks like so I'll walk through a quick live demo here so if you navigate to Mundo you'll see this is our home page we tried to make it as simple as possible with this three-step experience so step one is just like finding out what any given wallet address has as their emissions so for this demo I'm going to use uh Doug's ens here so let's find out this wallet now uh as you can see we use etherscan to see how many transactions this wallet has made and with a variety of factors like uh uh the time when the transactions are made and things like this we can calculate the tons of CO2 that this wallet has emitted but that's not all right now that you know that let's do something about it so step two is kind of seeing all of the projects that you can buy to offset these tons of CO2 and so you can explore here we use a two-can subgraph which is indexing all of these projects around the world so let's go to Brazil for example and navigate there that's where your impact would be heading and you can actually see the the projects ourselves so we select this one we can see this one can has 25 000 credits that you can actually buy or I should say 250 000 and this is the actual uh what the credit actually represents so let's go ahead and check out here and actually offset so I'm going to connect with my wallet and like Doug said all of this happens the settlement happens on polygon but let's go ahead and pay with solo because that's what my wallet has this is also a really cool use case where I can offset for someone else so let's go ahead and do that and I'll confirm the transaction here while you're waiting for solo to confirm the blocks the the block let's go ahead and just navigate around here and when this offsets you'll see the transaction on solo we can also see the pending on on a polygon so here let's go ahead and navigate there so this is the transaction that just finished and if I go to hyperlanes block Explorer we can see that this is the transaction that's pending and as you can see it went from Sello over to polygon and when that confirms you'll see the actual certification yeah there you go this is the transaction on polygons block Explorer with all the steps that we did and if you remember this is the actual project that you bought so yeah that's how the project works I'll go back to the slides all right yeah so it works today across cello poly uh sorry optimism and uh polygon and this is just a really quick architecture overview um basically it plugs into any evm chain that's supported through hyperlane today and we sort of designed the smart contracts we sort of thought of them as like payment terminals you know like like you would when you're checking out with like a Square Terminal so it accepts payments from all these chains um and it Bridges through hyperlane not only the value of those assets but also uh the parameters for for offsetting as well if you want to retire on behalf of of of a beneficiary all that metadata is available and pass through polygon where there's a usdc terminal that accepts those payments and interacts with sushi Swap and swaps into NCT and redeems the underlying credits and all that is indexed and then resurfaced back through the graph yeah just really quickly some future work that we want to do we really think that there's like social potential for this um both in terms of me offsetting for someone else but also maybe like integrating with lens protocol and having some kind of like virality there um there's also the issue of cross chain liquidity and thinking about this so that it's a lot easier to go from any chain any token to the actual offsetting because we want to make that as seamless as possible um and yeah and yeah we spent all our time uh thinking about refi thinking about how web3 can be leveraged to make you know drive real world impact so if you're curious about how money can work together with plants and you're bullish on Plants then come talk to us thank you amazing amazing well please give a round of applause for Mundo and up next we have fuelscape please welcome them on stage tried that one should we just go to the next one this of course would not be a hackathon if Murphy's Law doesn't kick in so uh we'll give it a few more seconds and then get this going if not uh we'll swap the teams out and then have them come on again cool hey everyone this is our front end uh this is where you can actually go to right now uh it's fuelscape.gg and generate a there we go now I'm using the mic uh you can generate a wallet and a private key on fuel so now we're generating a private key and then you can link a player name inside of that text input box like example name and then you can link your wallet once you've linked your wallet uh that name cannot be linked to any other wallet and that wallet cannot be linked to any other name uh you can always reset your wallet and spin up a new wallet if you need to but if anybody wants to go to the mobile site fuelscape.gg forward slash uh items you can uh do forward slash example and follow along with the gameplay but this is where you would see all of your items uh we're minting every item in RuneScape as an nft that you can trade lend borrow sell and grow with all right shame for the great video but we're going right into the live demo then just in case this isn't clear or what we're trying to do we were very excited about the idea of creating a video game web3 we know that the adoption for those type of games is sometimes quite different so we try to build something on top of a game that already exists such as RuneScape I don't know if there's any Gamers out here that have ever played it yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about so the perfect way to do it was to build it on fuel which is a super fast um uh virtual machine that allows us to do these transactions uh on uh live so every time you're doing something in the game those assets are being minted into field virtual machine as uh real game assets so yeah let's go through it so you can see him playing and on login it actually loaded all of these items from the on-chain state not from the server of the game and if you go to fuelscape.gg items slash CC you can also follow on your phone the inventory in real time so with this Postman query he just added an nft outside of the game to the wallet of the player and now as he logs in again it appeared in the inventory as the blue party hat Yeah so basically we're enhancing the possibilities of playing RuneScape on chain making this game uh a little bit more fun and uh yeah I hope some of you guys are interested in joining this team and fieldscape is gonna go live soon so if you're interested definitely show us your interest and we'll show you the video um we wanted to see we want you to see the trailer of this video let's try give it a shot so on the front end you see the inventory but this is not connecting to the game server at all that's basically just loading from on chain and the server itself is also just communicating with the chain so there's no communication between the game oh it's working let's do the video then many years ago [Music] hundreds of soldiers would gather virtually stop cigarette from destroying kylan oil now in 2022 sunrake has heard of the blockchain and his planning to attack this is a call for all suffering citizens to protect Kylie on chain RuneScape on chain how's that even possible [Music] foreign step one enter fuelscape dot GG step two create a fuel wallet three export your private key [Music] continue making progress every time something happens in Game API calls will be sent to Fuels virtual machine so we can keep track of your progress [Music] so keep chopping wood and get exclusive nft Rewards [Music] upgrade sell trade or use your nfts to experience RuneScape at maximum fear world thank you well this demo this demo eventually did work but please give fuelscape a big round of applause that's the best thing about web3 gaming you get to Port all the old ones back in with web 3 Primitives all right next up is BB3 beeper please welcome team hello it's San Francisco we are Future Primitive and our project is BB3 beeper my name is Jaden I'm one of the devs on the team my name is Benny I was part of the 2017 East Waterloo lot launch cryptic Kitty so good to be back hey guys I'm Ray I'm uh Dev on the team hi my name is druzy I'm a front-end developer so we came to East San Francisco with the goal of getting every single one of you onboarded to decentralized messaging protocols and we did that by launching an nft what you were looking at here is the BB3 beeper a retro 90 style pager nft that we have airdropped to more than 100 of you here at the hackathon over the weekend this nft was launched live on ethereum mainnet to many of you and this is what it looks like now it might look pretty simple just like a pager but if you click into it you can see all of the messages that everyone on the Beeper network has sent over the course of the hackathon displayed in real time in the nft artwork and you can scroll through it now this is deceptively simple what you're seeing under the hood here is xmtp messages sent and broadcast onto lens and then sent via SMS notification to all of the people who have applied for the airdrop so that's a lot of people if you would like to get your hands on one of these BB3 beepers this is how it works there's a giant QR code on the right hand side of the screen if you scan it with your camera and hit the send button send us your ens we will gaslessly AirDrop you this BB3 beeper to your wallet once you've got it in your wallet the interface looks like this you can see the same list of messages that everyone has sent there we go there are the messages that you guys have sent over the weekend if I want to send a message to everybody I can say hello from the stage and hit send signed a message with my wallet and this message will be broadcast to everybody who holds one of these beeper nfts in the audience many of your phones will probably be vibrating right now getting a you have new beeps SMS and this message has been sent out over the xmtp network posted onto lens and broadcast onto all of your devices so not only can you send broadcast messages via this decentralized messaging client you can also send direct messages so if I go here I can send a direct message to druzy hit send and send it we launched this on ethereum mainnet we've airdropped it over 100 people at the conference so far we would love to get everybody on board with us our goal has been to onboard you all into this decentralized messaging future that's it that's the BB3 beeper oh yes and then true hackathon Silicon Valley style one more thing if you remember having a beeper from the old days of having beeper you know that sometimes you would just get a phone number and you would have to call it to see what's going on so if you call the number that this QR code sends you to you'll hear all of the the top three messages that have been broadcast on the Beeper Network relayed to you over the phone just like you would have if you had an actual beaver so that's it that's BB3 beeper thank you all amazing a working live demo that uses audience this is awesome well thank you so much and with that we are ready for our next demo and that is team Dao census they just went down you come back on you're good to go please welcome Dallas answers on stage I'm here hi I'm Batiste and we're from Paris France we didn't we didn't sleep during two days but we were really happy to be there in San Francisco so we're presenting you those answers for dubset it's adapt update framework for those so some context there is a huge growth of doubts recently and they need to to monitor the adapts and to upgrade them over the time many key features are missing [Music] now so and the tools that exist have some issues that we need to fix um what one of them is concerns decentralization that's front-end for example are most of the times controlled by a few admins that can change the front end so it's not secure and can lead to front-end attacks so what we want to do what we built is an update process for dubs making it easy secured and decentralized for the dowels to to do that so we're sharing the update process between stakeholders based on acceptance and we will have a certification that uses the front-end version of your ring has been accepted by the Dow some key features of our product we are allowing a decentralized front-end hosting which has been validated by the Dow members on train and we also have a browser extension to verify the front-end reliability so basically what we're doing is that firstly The Proposal is going to have to again get identificated reward coin so that we can prove that it's not about easily and human being and then uh here if he has a front end that he wants to to deploy he's going to use a flick we choose ens and uh he'll deploy it on ipfs and then he'll be able to propose a snapshot um after that the snapshot is voted uh we're going to call the umal record so that uh we can bring this this result on chain and then uh if the result is positive we're going to the the Dao can upload the uh can can deploy this front end and then we can check it the user can check if the user is in if the front end is indeed accepted with the the plugin so to jump into the demo now so so we're connecting a uh with wordcon what we're doing now is a human verification to ensure that um any humans are able to do it to avoid spams on the Dow tools and when it's confirmed we're going to Mint an nft that will enable us to do snapshot okay so so this is done the nft has been minted and we can uh do the proposal on snapshots uh so we didn't have the snapshot open um so once uh uh one snapshot is done we're going to do a request on a Uma so we're going to uh request the ipff hash so if this is a test we'll do the okay then uh it's gonna be on a Uma uh we're going to um vote for it takes a bit of time and so if if this is accepted we're going to call the function to settle it and then the devil can I can deploy the the front end thank you it was thousands [Applause] awesome all right next up we have melovald so please welcome mellow Vault on stage um hi everyone I'm Tina um we have created a platform for on-chain anonymous anonymous voting using zero knowledge proofs Anonymous meaning we conceal which address it came from and zero knowledge in the sense that we can prove that you have the number of votes without reeling without relaying uh who voted for what um so our project kind of consists of like two things here so we kind of limited the scope for now to being able to like vote within a specific nft collection so if you're part if you have an nft all the holders of the nft can create a multi-sig which we've called like a vault here and you can create proposals for that vault so I'm going to go through kind of like a flow here so I'm going to create a vault call bind you want to type in these things so we're going to create a vault here so we can put in the vault title and then we're also going to specify like which nft collection um this ball is going to be associated with um here we have like a test nft collection on gorily that we've created for this hackathon but in practice it can be any nft collection and it's waiting okay now we've submitted the transaction and now it's doing gorily things cool okay so uh while the vault is being created maybe you can jump back um into the home page here or or yes vaults okay so here's what um our interface contains like a list of all the votes that are available um some of these are associated with nfts that you might own or or not um we are using the graph to host this data shout out to the graph please don't deprecate your hosted service um okay okay while we're waiting for girly to confirm we can show like a previously created Vault so here we have a a vault that's associated to this nft collection called suspicious strawberry here you can see there's like a little uh already a list of proposals here um and then we can create a new proposal so the way proposals work is you can specify like basically a list of transactions that you want to execute if you reach the number of votes needed for the interface we kind of simplified it and made it so that it's just a you can only specify like transfer to transactions oh you can see now that our boat that we just created is now here we're going to put a very cool description here um so this description is going to be hosted on ipfs everything else will live on chain and let's say this proposal is going to send .005 eth to that address provided and so what's going to happen is we're going to create a proposal that's going to live on chain and then once that proposal is live then anyone who is associated with or a holds the suspicious strawberry nft can go vote on it and maybe we can go to a previously created proposal to see what that looks like so let's look at this existing proposal here so we have a proposal to buy Brian coffee for all the hard work he's done for this hackathon if you're a holder of this of uh the specific nft then you can vote and voting is basically signing a personal assigned message and it lives off chain um it's going to live off chain until it reaches the number of votes needed and then we plug in all the personal sign messages into a zero knowledge verifier and then the proof that you've reached the number of like messages needed as well as the fact that all the signers of the message hold an nft at that block cache that you specified so we'll plug in that proof and then that will go on chain and if it passes The Proposal will be executed and so here we can see on the interface that we've reached the number of votes needed for that specific proposal here we have sorry what oh that's the proposal we just created yay okay um yeah we're gonna show an example of voting here um great vote submitted amazing now we have one of three votes um yeah uh any any other vote in okay so we have two out of three votes here so that's Quorum it does just a simple majority based on the total supply of the collection uh there's only three holders of this nft you're looking at them and so now once we have two we can execute a proposal and so this should go through uh hopefully this fault still has enough in it um but what it's doing now is it is calling the API that is off chain but has all the signatures that's generating a proof and then the proof will be sent with the transaction to the blockchain so that it can be verified uh at which point assuming it's valid uh the proposal will pass transactional execute um and it could be anything like theoretically this could uh like handle all sorts of different transactions our front end is just dealing with simple sends for now to keep things scoped but yeah we hope this helps you govern whether it's like it could scale to a 10 000 uh member pfp Community it could be just you and your friends who have uh some token that you gave out and yeah we think it should be easier to like deal with own and uh send money run a community run a group chat on the box okay thanks bye amazing well please give them a big round of applause next up we have org3 please welcome them on stage [Applause] um um hello everyone I'm Julie uh this is Jason this is Harry we're all from USC so fight on is there anyone also from UIC yeah okay so um so today we want to present you an ens set domain based organization management tool so a quick background right now there are a lot of web3 community or like Dao they are using um web 2 solutions for sharing resources like Google docs on Dropbox and you know something something else and there are people that start adopting uh you know access control system that's for Webster community so for example the tokengated assets control but when we look at the targeted Access Control there are two downsides for organization management first is that it's pretty inconvenient and expensive right you need to have the contrast deploy the smart contract into um uh send you know the token to the right person and that's kind of hard and the other thing is security so say if um Jason who are in my community and I'm the unmanned and but later on he leave how am I going to take back the token there's no way that we can take that token I can Blacklist them but Jason secretly send the token to Harry and oh Harry now is not Blackness anymore and he has the access to all of our resources that we share so ens can solve this problem and we'll see why so first a quick recap the ens of domain system looks like this it's basically a tree-like structures you guys are all hackers I definitely know you guys know how this works so there are three advantages first is that it's really intuitive organization structure right so for a man they can interact with actually our website that you know just drag and draw make some changes on the access control and that that's it and the second is that it decouple wallet address and mean control and access control say the next time if I'm using sub domain name as its control and Json leave my community what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna burn his wallet address from from the ens he's you know that ens subdomain that he belongs to Mike and he has no more control on it and the very last it's so cheap thanks for ens um I use their smart contract it's only one dollars for for all the things that I've talked about so there are some tech details um but since um we want to do you know showing more than telling so I will leave it to Jason and those are our amazing sponsors they help us a lot thank you guys yeah so right now I'm under um org3.e so aux3.if is a company of uh holding by us and I'm the admin of the um ox3.if domain so I can now go ahead and create uh maybe add a intern under julie.product.org.e so maybe like lastly and then we can uh get a wallet address for it so I'm gonna just go ahead and call the ens smart contract right now we are on the magnet so um it costs a little bit of gas but as truly talked it's just only one dollar so yeah so we see the smart contracts running right now and after that I have to set the new sub domain to the address that I just this third and while this is running I want to show you the other part of our project it's the file sharing system so each file is shared in the organization but every file has its own access like granted to um some ens domain for example this ethereum white paper is only granted access to the tag team and I'm under detecting and I will be able to view the file but if I want to access if.png which is under product team I will have no access to it now let's go back to the um organization tree and hit refresh well we can see a new sub domain is created under Julie thank you so much amazing please give them a big round of applause next up we have eunuch please welcome the unique team on stage [Applause] hi guys so we made a nft minting platform and the unique thing about us is that we make nft scannable because we want intrinsic value in the nft assets itself so let me show you I'm gonna make a collection choose a cover photo and just write a description and it's gonna mint and polygon this is realmatic you all owe me a can of Coke for this let's just wait until it meets the nft it's going to take a while it's just pending there we go so the contract here is minted and we're now going to create the nfts same nft we're going to add some assets which are scannable and once you scan them it's going to verify them as nfts so just a small signature and we're ready to Mint now I'm going to show you uh the laptop and how it's scannable and I'm gonna just uh move on to my partner and he's gonna just do a quick presentation is is it connected oh okay so hi what's up it's Seth my name is Philip and what we wanted to build here is to link nft and assets and it's like the most trendiest thing on webview right now except nobody has any idea how to do it well this is our solution scan to verify and what I'm about to show you next is something revolutionary and I'm confident that it might change the role of nft in the world are you ready I can't hear one more time are you ready okay two identical punks I see a lot of you're disappointed and some of you are probably wondering what in the world is a Chinese Chinese kid doing up there so let me explain first I'm Korean not Chinese and I know we look identical but we're actually different and that's actually the fundamental core of our solution because here the on your left is a raw image but we have the technology called invisible signature which is pretty much like invisible QR code and one on the right is scannable for verification and we do that by using dots by dots that and we make it blend to the original image that human eye cannot recognize but however our phone our application can detect very easily and so what we built in the end is a platform where creators can easily mint signature nfts that can be scanned for verification and I'll show you what that means hi all right so as you see this is our app if you click on the pig does it and just scan over it it's going to show you the nft it's the same nft verified and uh could you just zoom into the laptop here please so uh let's try again um it doesn't scan anywhere just uh doesn't scan anywhere notice this image has no QR code there's nothing okay it has no QR codes the the app doesn't scan anywhere but if you just move it over to our asset it scans and verifies that it's an nft and it doesn't scan any other asset the image of the same nft that we got from a website it doesn't scan and it doesn't scan but um the one that we minted will verify itself as an nft and it'll also show you the owner foreign it can be moved on to any other device such as mobile phone so you can see that it doesn't scan right but the one that we just minted if you just scan over it it scans perfectly and the cool thing is if you print this on maybe a t-shirt or a hoodie or any of your physical assets it also scans so we just want to give opportunities for nft projects or artists to create retail Brands where they can sell products using their nfts and we want to get rid of the counterfeit Market because once the product is there there's a signature and it's Unique even if there's a similar looking hoodie or similar looking products that one won't scan and if someone tries to steal your unique nft hoodie then nobody can really do it because you're the owner and the nft owner would have to change what that means for retail creators is uh it also allows for resell Revenue because the nft now has to be traded when a product gets traded as well so that's one of the problems that we wanted to solve in the nft space is that nfts don't really have like a intrinsic value so we just wanted to give utility for all these nfts out there and for us as well thank you that was genuinely amazing thank you so much and congratulations all right next up is ZK section nine please welcome the next team on stage [Applause] hi everybody uh my name is King I'm an artist and a first of introduction I'm now the first and the only crypto artist in the world collected by a nationalism and this morning when I was queuing up for the main judge I received the mail and they told me that I want New York International female Awards with my Nifty thank you and it's generated by AIS so that's why we're doing a project like that suddenly I realized can I earn my more and more greater people my friends with AI power is a tool that I was so familiar with over the past few years so that's why we have the project we delivered today actually section 9 is from Ghost in the show it's a group of people who are keeping save the world so that's my teammate tokunbo he's gonna introduce more second part of our project and that brings us to the topic of today so um zero knowledge machine learning for AI generator content so here's what we did we first trained the machine learning model to produce AI generated content then encoded that generation process into a zika star approver directly on chain and created a novel nft based protocol incorporating the verifier that essentially allows AI artists to uniquely mint and certify the creations and finally we open source the generalized tool and framework behind everything that is capable of converting almost any machine learning algorithms into zero knowledge proofs that are easily integrable with the blockchain and why is that significant you know a Arts is taking over with films winning major International Awards to the right and we really want to bring that to my free community and properly assign credits to our creators owners and suppliers and why is it hard you know machine learning models are huge normally you can't run down a blockchain because these are essentially millions of floating Point operations which you know blockchains to natively support well and zero knowledge proofs are very hard to integrate and operate and what I think is the most important part is that the three key stakeholders here don't really talk to each other at the moment you have machine learning Engineers not understanding the tooling requirements to convert an algorithm to a blockchain friendly format you have zkp developers lacking visibility into the capabilities of aigc models and the gaps and creators lacking guidance and support so I'll introduce our three main contributions we first train a tiny machine learning model that's blockchain friendly for AGC this represents a typical workflow for Creator leveraging AI model and then we created a novel method that rewrites all 14 point operations model into integer only operations which made it a very blockchain and ZK viable and secondly we generate a whole approach into a compiler that translates a model written in pytorch in the circle which essentially Bridges CK and machine learning it is capable of you know with hundreds of components of neural networks and millions of parameters and we open sourced it there's infinite room for imagination what we've shown here is aigc but it can also be used for chatbot writing assistant fraud detection record resistance and so on and here's a circuit generation in action it will show a live demo right after this and then um this is a circum circuit extra for AGC model all automatically generated and our third contribution is that we bootstrap the classic erc721 protocol to incorporate ML and secret capabilities to give artists and creators more control over the generator content so the data is directly rendered on Chang which increases data availability and the ZK approval oversees that the image is indeed generated by Machine learning model only the holder of the machine learning algorithm is able to Mint the model and the broader implications is that converting machine learning models to zero knowledge groups have profound implications for expanding the capabilities of blockchains which enable people in underdeveloped countries during incomes with you know on-chain igc or zkml enhanced trusses freelancing and the second point I want to make here is that governance Tech and consensus is quite tricky our tool can enhance existing approaches involting civil resistance by allowing ml based Edition you know imagining a self-evolving Dell smart contract powered by neural network and then I'll show a live demo now which is our compiling action so this is quite a simple front end and then imagine you have a newer Network which is essentially encoded as a tax representation of all the operators in a graph and then if you supply that around with you know the parameters which is using a binary file and then uh our compiler is able to quickly generate all the required constructs to essentially compile that into a xenologic circuit which you know with the circum construct we're using are very easily uh converted into a smart contract run chain and then this is the entirety of the huge circuit all automatically generated by our compiler um I think there are infinite rooms for imagination here right like we can use neural networks to detect wash trading to enable a self-adapted all smart contracts and so on thank you very much amazing all right next up is Project decentral couch please welcome the decentral couch team on stage hi we're decentral couch a decentralized Airbnb to help crypto natives like all of us to find and pay for crash pads when traveling for hackathons and conferences decentralization actually provides many feature enhancements so portable trust and reviews no strict need to develop a reputation a reputation that is specific to a platform it's all interoperable sensitive info can be masked with ZK using a polygon ID and there's no middlemen fee and finally direct peer-to-peer communication and transaction via xmtp so Ubuntu demo now before we start has anybody heard of the concept of a couch friend raise your hands okay I guess it's not that common uh so a couch friend is a friend who has stayed on your couch before who sat on your couch and the idea is that your real friends have sat on your couch uh and so we take our business really seriously because having people stay over uh your place is is a big deal and requires a lot of trust so uh on the central couch we have two primary ways of verifying trust we have uh on-chain reputation and we have off-chain reputation uh we're going to highlight today two ways to book a listing on decentral couch uh one that uses on-chain reputation and we'll see that shortly and one that uses uh polygon ID to verify off chain reputation so here we see the uh the central Couch website uh We've entered some criteria for listings that we want to see and we click search and uh bam through ipfs we've pulled up a bunch of listings and we can see that there's a bunch of on-chain reputation uh in in all the listings such as a number of lens files you have and also like like vouches that are just digital signatures from various addresses and also just notice that we have this instant book button that is currently disabled because we have not done any ZK related things to allow for instant books so cool we're going to just book a listing now so we've requested to uh have a booking and on the left side you see uh guest on the right side you see a host um a message has been sent from the guest the host uh with metadata about the listing uh and the the ask for the stay and now on the host side uh we can accept that request and we can generate a digital signature that we then pass back to the guest and with that digital signature the guest can finally finalize that booking and uh initiate an on-chain transaction so that the booking is is done and notice that there was no gas spent until this last step which is a feature of of using xmtp and being able to exchange digital signatures and cool we see here that uh the listing is booked and uh this is on polygon and we're just gonna have to wait for that transaction to go through the sake of time we can probably uh move on to the next next way of doing these cool uh so the next way is uh verifying off-chain information and uh in our demo we're going to verify that somebody has a passport and this is going to allow some guests to immediately book a listing for the sake of time we're not going to go through the process of obtaining a polygon ID claim we're simply going to assume that in your polygon ID app you already have a claim and once you have this claim you can mince and nft which is essentially a like a token uh like a access token for being able to instantly book a listing and you can send it to any address cool so we're going to use the polygon ID Wallet app to initiate this CK proof cool and then you could choose the wallet that you want to use connecting the wallet now the ZK proof is being generated and cool we're going to Mint the nft now and again this is to an undocked wallet so privacy is preserved and uh now we can finally uh do an instant booking yep so see that the instant book button is no longer disabled we can click it and Bam the transaction submitted and we just instantly booked um booked a listing without any uh trusted uh exchanges necessary awesome I think I know billy.eath uh congratulations four more demos to go and up next is Cambria please oh please welcome Cambria on stage foreign [Applause] what's up uh I'm will hey I'm Ben and our project is Cambria and all right we have another uh teammate Kevin but he couldn't be here so we built a cross chain oh there you go cross chain uh one to one sort of representation of on-chain activity mirrored inside of a game so basically all the avatars you see currently in the game are real people interacting with on-chain applications the apps and protocols we picked four of the the most popular diops as you can see here we're navigating inside the game um we have ens sort of resolution I don't know if anybody recognizes any of the eth names here but probably more than likely and so yeah we're basically just like logging events directly from the from the chain like from our PC nodes um and yeah just it's basically a real-time feed so yeah if you do any on-chain action it's like transformed and basically translated into in in-game like state so yeah it's pretty cool you can uh basically bring the chain State into your game yeah as you can see at the bottom um you have filled orders uh from openc uh a lot of people uh at uniswap apparently um and more than I expected at uh Ave repay so that's cool awesome search bike so why do we build this um we think that web uh web apps are single player by default and that's more boring than needs to be if you go to the next slide if you currently go to openc uh it kind of looks like Google Images um you really don't know whether there's one person on the site or one million and we we think that social uh nft trading is a big reason why nfts are valuable and they're fun and we really want to change that if you go the next slide so we're building Cambria and on chain uh a game that basically ingests all of on-chain data to make it easy to trade hop into game uh and hop in a clan chat with your friends um hobby tune protocols uh trade peer-to-peer Swap and do other stuff in game I think somebody stole my RuneScape from there earlier but awesome we're launching soon uh play Cambria if you want to follow us uh give us a like on Twitter thanks so much incredible all right three more demos to go so next up swallow please welcome them on stage oh hello everyone uh your swallow and this is our team uh we are our hackers and we came from South Korea to participate in this acrotone and we are very nice to meet you so uh do you ever ever use the Apple shortcuts Apple Circus uh uh we are trying to build a Webster version of shortcuts so users can register their shortcuts so it's basically swallow or transaction in Webster application so in the screen you can see that uh the user registered to buy shortcuts so whenever the user wants to buy token the user doesn't need to like go to the device or like send rejection by himself or just enter the swallow and just click the button so this is a swallow overview and we are trying to build a layer between developers and users so developers use gerox API or Dune or other tools and register shortcut to swallow contract and then users can download shortcuts and make some custom shortcuts and pay for the shortcuts so solo is like a app store it's a platform for shortcuts so these are the problems we found so basically non-engineer users are hard to execute complicated transaction or query data on chain and there are so many sites or services or change so to solve the problems we made the swallow so in swallow users can build their own TX shortcut TX query or TX alert and and solo is a plan to build uh as a Chrome extension is very accessible so for example users can monitor their deposit pools current API or like what happens the in in the poor deposits so I'll show you the right demo so this is a sign-in page so you can enter your nickname that is mapped with your wallet account so I'm gonna enter my name so this is the main page where you can add shortcut and this is a template with already built and as I said developers can add freely uh the templates so I'm gonna add Buy shortcuts so in the swallow page users can select which token to buy I'm going to say I'm going to buy ethereum like this amount and by selling mapping so it's basically swap so I'm going to add shortcuts and that's it the shortcut is registered in your page and whenever you want to swap the tokens you just click the button and it automatically sends transactions so I'm gonna send transaction and it needs some time so uh it uses 0x API swab API behind the scene but user doesn't have to know what it is or how to use it or how to send transaction they just have to click the buttons swallow and just send transaction and also I'm gonna add one more shortcut that shows the current apy of a protocol so I'm I want to see die and ethereum and add shortcuts and it shows the currency API so it uses the the graphs of graph behind the scene but the same the user doesn't have to know what the sub grab is or how to build the cell graph how to deploy the stock graph the swallow does do the other thing so uh I explained all the things the so our future works is to build the Builder economy where developers can build shortcuts and build a builder so Builder can earn money by selling shortcut and user can purchase shortcut so swallow as a platform or the layer we take the platform fee between Builder and normal user thank you and if you're interested in the project please contact to this email thank you that was amazing can't wait to use it myself all right second last demo of the day please welcome team peekaboo [Music] hi everyone my name is Greg heisen and hello I'm John Johnson I do smart contract r d and uh yeah I I I've been awake since 7am yesterday so this is sort of me and my sleepiest form and I'm gonna do my best to to describe this I'm very excited about what we've done here uh so so we're peek-a-boo and we did a blind nft auction with verifiable delay functions so a quick little recap on just how existing blind nft auctions work uh such as the ones that they used to do with the ens names uh the bitterwood hash uh their bid along with some salt they'd commit that hash on chain and then sometime later they would reveal the pre-image and show their bid uh the downside of this is that there's a lot of transactions that have to happen uh so what's better about peek-a-boo we have fewer transactions only the winning bid is revealed on chain so this results in a lower amortized gas cost and also makes the whole system more scalable additionally all the seal bids are revealed simultaneously so instead of the bidders trickling in and revealing one bit at a time they all get revealed at once so it makes a better user experience and then it also mitigates grouping so super cool and I I want to mention that this is made possible by the 2021 tired encryption scheme which we adapted to ethereum by putting part of this encryption scheme in smart contracts and so that's what that's what we've been up to for the past hours we have a we're gonna do a live demo before that demo I also want to mention that we have peekaboo decks uh on on GitHub and so you can go and you can check out all the code here and there's a whole summary of how it works so I'm not going to go through all the slides doing that now and then and yeah we're going to try to do a live demo here uh okay okay start auction all right so what we're going to do here is we're gonna cool yeah all right so so yeah we're gonna start an auction here and then we're gonna have some uh a python script in the background that's going to make a bunch of bids so what's happening here when we when we uh first create an auction is is constructing two things it's constructing a puzzle and a public key and the puzzle is a vdf and when this vdf is solved it's going to produce a secret key and then that secret key is going to be able to uh is going to be used to decrypt all the bids so we are doing this uh this demo on the Gourley test net and our internet is a bit slow here so we're a bit limited um oh yeah all right perfect so the auction has been created so right now we're gonna see some bids populate over time and the way that bidding works is simply a bidder takes the the public key and encrypts their bid and submits it on chain so instead of the traditional commit reveal where you're hashing it with some salt you just encrypt it put it on chain so we should see some bids coming in here shortly uh some some fun anecdotes while we wait our designer was not able to make it here so he's the dolly AI to generate our logo here and I think it turned out pretty well um all right we have our first vid coming in so we're gonna have four bids come in and so as you can see uh the event that's submitted it's a sealed bid it's encrypted and we can go over here and uh refresh and ether scan to see them coming in similar to existing commit reveal schemes you send in an obfuscated amount of eth so that's the actual bid and then just some plus amount some amount to throw people off and then that obfuscation amount will be returned at the end of the bid all right we've got our second big coming in I should have lowered the number of bits for the demo but we're gonna have four of these coming in um yeah all right we've got three coming in so a bit about the tide encryption protocol it's very cool so it combines I believe uh the RSA encryption scheme so it's uh asymmetric you have a public and a private key and then I believe they use the the T squarings vdf to uh to there we go we go four okay cool all right yeah so all four and okay so what's happening right now in the background is the puzzle is being solved and as soon as that puzzle is solved it's going to reveal uh the bid okay so it's now able to close the auction because the puzzle has been solved and soon enough we're going to see the transaction come through and this is this is the cool part just wait so the what I was mentioning earlier the cool part about about this scheme is that all of the bids are revealed simultaneously so instead of seeing them trickle in you get them all at once much better ux for everyone the demo Works we're all gonna go to bed now thank you very much awesome all right with that we are ready for our last demo of the day so without further Ado let's welcome Snapchat [Applause] hello are you San Francisco thank you for taking the time here to learn more about Snapchat we're building a decentralized infrastructure for ephemeral apps and use cases so the problem that inspired us to create Snapchat in the first place is that existing smart contract blockchains cannot be deleted certain data on ethereum blockchain exists indefinitely dead contracts still eat up resources and we need to get rid of them so here at snapchain our team's mission is to rid web 3 of such contracts to provide a more conducive environment for new and exciting contracts of what snap chain is we are a permissionless peer-to-peer Network to seamlessly create and manage your federal uh blockchains using our solution users can spin up blockchains with one click uh to indicate a desired time to live that destroys itself at expiration and to best suit the blockchain use case and application to save costs processing power and storage capacity and let's get right into the product demo definitely all right uh so now we are starting our P2P Network and this is built from scratch using the live P2P library and this is that works for the informal blockchains I'm going to start two PDP nodes connect to each other from different servers and this is the first note candy started and now we start the second one using the multi-address from the first node and then you can see they are connecting and while waiting for the node to connect we can see this is the existing chance so we already have two chains on the Node so on both node you can see those are the two different directories and uh and now let's see all right oh wait a second oh okay let me see sorry oh no sorry sorry there's some issues okay server sorry I'll wait some seconds sorry to all right that's oh oh okay let me copy this is oh okay I think okay okay now it's uh discovered the first note and we are waiting for them to connect so hopefully this will work okay they are now connected to each other and I will hand over to the front end so once once the user's metamask is connected to our solution uh the there does access a dashboard where they can see all the blockchains that they created to create a new blockchain they simply create click create new chain and from here they indicate the desired time to live the network name the currency and sign off this transaction over onto the metamask uh once this happens the front end then deposits tokens into the optimism contract the contract will then send out a receipt back to the front end the front end then takes uh and makes an RPC call to the snap change peer-to-peer Network and each of these peer-to-peer network node spin-ups are evm node and broadcast some matches throughout the network against me move on move on and yep you'll see it populate yep so with these newly created blockchains you can see uh one that's alive if it serves use you can go ahead and uh delete it which then stops the creation of the blockchain of the blocks uh and it will refund for the time that's remaining once uh a block or a blockchain is stopped is manually stopped or uh expires there's a mandatory seven-day grace period for uh auditing and security purposes and after those Grace periods it's done the chain has been destroyed awesome yeah so uh we have a lot more that we want to add to the to the road map so just some immediate things that we want to bridge assets to other evm chains we want to add an in-carg blockchain Explorer um some future iterations get as much custom customizability as possible to the chain so that's including I'll add you more time to live changing the chain size and adding a kill switch on the bridge um in general we think the best use cases for SNAP chain will be for uh any uh so any uh any any application looking to launch a test net very easily this is the easiest way to launch a test net uh if you're if you're a web 3 game and you care about uh only the final transactions or any uh this is the great way to save space on clients and most excitedly we think we can be a design space for the next generation of web 3 social media and web messaging apps so if you're trying to build the next Snapchat trying to build the next be real come talk to us we think you can use our service thank you
