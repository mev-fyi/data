all right so it looks like our judging session is open so i'm gonna start the intro hey everybody welcome to hack fest we're really excited to see your projects um that this year we had 650 hackers from 61 countries and 18 different time zones so yeah a really diverse group of people this year and we're really excited to see your different perspectives on what you guys chose to do with um like fs and stuff like that so our judging format includes four minutes per demo three minutes for questions and a 10 minute break for every six to eight teams and the judging criteria include technicality originality practicality ui ux and dx and wow factor but we want to stress that this is not a competition um oh sorry people are here to learn and explore and we're not all aiming to launch our projects into businesses we're mostly here to get and give feedback so yeah we really want to promote a really healthy collaborative environment in the ethereum ecosystem um and yeah so here we have our judges so we have harsh from epns and evan from weekend ethereum uh would you guys like to give a little bit of an intro starting with harsh sure excited to be here guys uh uh via epns ethereum push notification service for short uh we are building the communication there uh for ethereum uh and then later for l2s and other blockchain uh for communication layers simply and smart contracts can send notifications using us a year back and at global that's how we started and excited to come back over here and see all the cool projects now that's really awesome thanks so much for helping us out today harsh uh how about you evan i'm evan i'm from texas i have a newsletter called weekend ethereum news which can be found at weekend ethereumnews.com although uh now andrew really does all of it if you think it's good and i have a few kids who will be coming in here and interrupting me as much as possible and probably streaming their heads off there we go on cue alrighty so now we're gonna go straight into our demos uh i'll leave it to anton here's our mc for today's judging session uh to kind of start introducing people perfect thank you nisha for that so we can get straight into it so we up first we have team get it so if you guys could raise your hands our admin will make you panelists and we can go from there would the real get it please stand up please stand up all right howdy welcome hello hi hi hey guys hello good uh good morning and good evening to everyone here all right let's see let's all right um it's my entire team here let's see are we missing one oh wait everyone's here all right great uh do we just start presenting or how does this go all right cool schools one second everyone we're at five last chickens and today we're presenting to you our take on a decentralized social network the hack idea is brought about by a need to create a social platform free of censorship but also at the same time protect users data by reinventing the model in which revenue is earned for both the platform as well as its users via the use of ethereum and ipfs it's undeniable that for most of us social media plays an important role in our daily lives it's typically used for social interactions but also as a platform in which people share create and consume content however the means of which most of these platforms are kept free concerns us and it's a large reason behind our idea for a decentralized social media these concerns include data privacy issues such as when companies collect and sell its user data to third parties the thought of data being stored and leveraged by companies is one that would sicken a lay person if they had any idea that their interactions on a seemingly harmless platform is actually being monitored hence a solution is to create a transparent platform that utilizes blockchain technology and eliminates the need of a central authority through the use of cryptography above and beyond that our platform looks to reinvent the business model of current day social networks by incentivizing the users for the quality of their content that they post the main idea here is to provide a platform for users to have ownership over their data and switch the model in which revenue is earned by the platform when we initially came up with the idea we worry that our platform may not be that much different from a pre-existing platform but upon further research we think it's safe to say that there are tons of reasons that would differ our social network and these are a few of them in the essence of time we decided to make a summarized origin story for our product concept so here is a quick product concept flow for your producer and finally introducing our product to you called get it a decentralized social network utilizing the arterium block lane platform and ipfs that incentivize its uses for your contents posted the name and logo is still to be desired in a nutshell get it works a solution to the pre-existing problem of current day social networks its features include the ability to join groups of like-minded people and discuss topics without the worries of censorship get it coin which is a mode of transaction the platform that users use to make posts that can be directly monetized to the platform via our to post function we've also added some slides that elaborate on the functions in more detail for your producer there are four different backend application designs for get it such as check if users exist create ping posts update post as well as eth tracks actions each task will trigger a different smart contract to retrieve or upload data to the blockchain or ipfs so now for a quick demo of our dummy prototype when a user visits our page for the first time they can choose to sign up using a meta mask or any other method provided with an ethereum public key they'll then be redirected to join groups that they might be interested in once done they can click finish and this will redirect them to the main page of get it on the main page users can choose whether to view or create premium posts or casual post a user will need to use ether to publish premium post while requiring get it coin to publish casual posts here you can see that the user can top up either with a few payment methods after submitting a confirmation message will then pop up users can upload posts or comments like this and they can also tip the order we eat them users can also check on the author's profile in which they will show their post and users can also choose to follow or even tip them for the final feature users can click on the reward section in which a user can redeem get it coins by logging in daily the basis of incentivizing the user is to encourage them to create quality content for them to earn directly to the platform without third-party involvement and ultimately to keep the platform running that is all for our presentation on get it the decentralized social network thank you for your time great thank you guys so we can now move on to three minutes of dna so what's on change what's on chain like like uh i mean what are you putting in ethereum what are you putting on ipfs like what's the architecture basically if you're talking you're muted uh sorry what what was the question again sorry yeah so what's like what's on chain with ethereum like what like i'm just kind of curious of the general architecture because if it was in the slides i missed it oh uh actually we we didn't come up with the actual program yet that everything is on figma right now so we are we are totally new to programming all this stuff so it doesn't have enough time to uh make the source code for this project so yeah we also kind of have uh not enough time to learn everything so we just come up with ideas but uh more on uh the front-end stuff like the back-end stuff we are yeah totally lack of experience on blockchains and yeah ethereum stuff that's that's totally cool i'm do you have plans of like what you're going to put on on chain like i assume you're not going to put every like you know sub get it that i did i join uh no um yeah so at the moment i would assume like because we didn't really have too much experience right we we thought that initially what would happen is we would be putting initially was like every single post but then we realized the transaction to be a bit too high after speaking to a different team and that's where like i think we came into a different problem right because like aside from having uh close to no technical background uh we realized that the challenge of transactions would be something that's way bigger and so we just got stuck there honestly yeah it's cool i mean it's a neat idea i mean it's certainly a big space that is is going to someone's going to to do it guys as a band said uh uh really cool idea uh i would uh i would love to know the game theory behind it like uh uh i know that your incentivizing users to visit uh but uh uh why would someone have to afford uh and voice against it uh so the the idea is um how it's supposed to work is when someone um let's say uploads a post right uh the whole idea is that you are also getting a piece of the share when you upload a post so let's say um that post is let's say okay so there are two reports one is a premium post and one is a casual post right so the premium post is where you can kind of earn from them uh so when you upload a post um you're also getting a bit back we haven't like done the entire calculation on it but the idea is to incentivize people not just to create posts but as well as when people upload post um they're also like helping to check the validity of this post so the posts are not just specific to like making like simple content or something so let's say you're in a group we're sharing about cats or dogs and you want to share um certain information that is like vital for other dog lovers or cat lovers to know right so you're sharing this post and when you upload this um you're also like verifying its credibility the initial idea came from this this want to need uh to verify sauce information but then we realized that that'll be a bit of a trouble because there could be like you know people just uploading for no reason just hoping to get a piece of the pie and there's there are other technicalities on the on that end so we focus more on like making it for any kind of content because we don't want to really put the hard word saying that you know we can verify content using this method uh because again people could simply upload stuff and it could have them like all like sharing something without truly having proper verifications but yeah the the whole idea came from the need for verification cool keep building guys thank you looks great welcome to the space thank you team i got it that was great um so you guys can now uh turn off your cameras and feel free to um stay on the call or hop off whatever you prefer and uh now we move on to this presentation and we have team namdaemun marketplace perfect and again you guys have four minutes for your demo and then three minutes for the q a hi thank you hi everyone this is etude uh achieved survivor uh i am uh presenting namdaemun market uh as as we know the namdaemun market is the oldest and largest uh traditional market in uh south korea so like starting from 1414 so with that popular concept of every people visiting the real market like it's similar to the farmer's market here uh in u.s so uh over here uh like as we as we see uh the buyer and seller they can seller can list their used second second-hand products and buyers can make a purchase using a browser and metamax wallet so we are using a polygon which is like which has a very high transaction like 64 000 transaction uh per second so uh that's the benefit of using polygon uh framework as well as supports uh is uh compare uh in in the ecosystem of ethereum we can like tie up with other all the ethereum uh blockchains so as we see here uh like the buyer just bought the item right now just for the example we just have the picture uh that was being sold so the transaction is being recorded and it will be in the polygon chain uh right that instant so over here uh the the product uh the quality of the product is validated as uh the lot of uh as the same product might be going through a lot of transaction so it will be recorded in the polygon chain uh yeah and it will be uh validated like who bought what so all those will be tracked and captured as well as all the reviews of the buyer seller the product will be recorded and they will be immutable in the blockchain so and regarding uh the tool uh we kind of like started in the local host with ganas in the beginning with ethereum uh ganas and on the truffle all those uh like and then we went to the polygon uh chain use the mumbai uh test test net and uh we are using the react front front-end back-end i mean the blockchain is a polygon chain we we use the heroku cloud to deploy it so yeah basically it's and like just to talk about some numbers here so in 20 in 2020 the uh used car market was uh 250 billion uh the 27 billion was just the apparel market size in 2020 so and also like as we know uh we have this uh regarding the second hand like phone market it went from like just uh 49 billion in 2016 to uh 52 billion in 2020 so it's the market is growing and everybody wants to get the lower price but with the help of blockchain we'll be able to uh sell i mean a facilitate provider platform for a quality used product secondhand product thank you so i have the same same question i had on the last one which is what's on chain like are you just using matic for the payment or are you also putting on the ipfs is in uh like the images are the in the ipfs and their transaction uh is in the uh blockchain uh the medic right so yeah we have the we where everything that was executed when it's being submitted uh it's it has a smart contract okay so every you deploy a new contract for every item uh no no we don't deploy it we just uh like we just use the mavic magic token so if if i sell something um that's an on-chain transaction that's my question basically uh when you list it your profile and the product will be in the on-chain got it and similarly after making the purchase the buyer can put the review that will be on chain uh and yeah and also like maybe second third phase we are planning to have like shipment the tracking of the shipment of the item that will also be in on change so we will have a smart contract for that as well so these are some of the points we will we will have smart contract and place it in on chain and that's where you're gonna you're probably gonna build out a reputation system of some sort as well in there uh you mean the rating of the products users i mean buyers and sellers right right correct me yeah thank you and we are like i'm watching and with my team member dave from i'm from here us my team member from canada dave and uh swat from nepal so i got it uh i should uh one more question uh uh let's say i'm a seller so uh how do we um how do we create uh this uh item listing uh yeah item listing uh as of now we have like uh like at the end we saw like uh we just used back end and then we we were just using the contract but like uh yeah we need to like make a user-friendly interface for that as well so i will have to write uh like after that i interface it will call the contact function in the smart contract so like we need to like incorporate uh ethereum as well so we we are trying to because we wanted to use polygon uh for the medic for at least for the demo but like our underlying uh would be like ethereum on on top of ethereum the smart contract will be there as well so yeah we still need to figure it out got it and and the data uh we are used to bringing uh the data and image and the description uh image is in ipfs uh we need to like uh like just normal uh uh like other data like we haven't used much data so it's in the code base hard coded in the uh heroku cloud like we will pull the github code thanks thanks richard you're welcome thank you thanks for the opportunity thank you team now damon marketplace i was great uh so up next um we're gonna have team foctola if you guys are ready to go should i start showing my screen now yep go ahead [Music] hi we are from 42kl and our project is called fotola a decentralized platform made for creators our target audience includes photographers artists designers as well as fans who want to support their work our objective is to create a decentralized platform for creators to share their art as well as provide creators a platform to potentially earn money from their work we have introduced a tipping function on our platform where supporters and creators alike are able to tip the artworks that they like using tokens that hold real monetary value our project is built using react node.js ipfs as well as truffle here we have an example roadmap of how photola works when a user uploads an image to fotola the image will be sent to ipfs a hash will be returned to fotola and the hash will be sent to metamask where a webshoot transaction will be triggered and the image will be saved into the blockchain these are one of the few references that we use during our project we will now move on to the demonstration of our project here we have the home page of fotola as you can see on the top right the hash of the metamask account will always be shown we will continue by first creating an account as you can see when you sign up it will prompt a transaction all the users that have signed up for photo line will be listed on the left if you click into one of their profiles you will be able to view all their works as you can see there's a tip button fans will be able to support the artists of their favorite artworks by tipping them tokens that utilizes the blockchain we would like to possibly introduce methods for users of fotolar to be able to earn tokens in the future up next we'll be demonstrating how a creator can upload their artwork after selecting their output all they need to do is add a description the user will then be asked to confirm the transaction the artwork will be uploaded in a few moments and now the artists can easily receive any tips from their supporting fans that is all for our demonstration video thank you for watching okay so now we can move on to the three minutes of q a got it uh let me go first uh so guys uh uh neat ui uh uh great uh tech stack uh i would say uh go for hard hat uh instead of truffle now but yeah that's just the feedback uh coming back to the question i'm let's say uh the ipfs hash is uploaded uh how are you ensuring uh that the image is not wiped up from the ipfs cache got it so uh when you upload the image to ipfs uh do you guys uh how do you make sure that the image remains over there uh so for this question we haven't talked about that so because we are coming from the 42k network where we are really new to coding we just started to try to experiment with the idea of uploading image ibfs and we save the hash to the blockchain got it got it i mean it's it's really awesome uh i do yes this is more of an advanced question uh keep on building uh it looks like a great project uh on to um yeah it looked nice i'm kind of curious what made you decide to to build a photo sharing app this is small tours like currently in like unless a lot of people always present in the social media environment there's a lot of censorship registration so we would like to create a platform where the creator can prevent analytics and they will still receive support from their supporter like they look at the teach system because they are registered they are through the website through the metamask itself so that they are not necessarily have to reveal what who they are and they are still able to receive doctrine or crypto from their supporter and then since everything is on the battery it's totally decentralized their creativity can be unrestricted so this is what we'll talk about cool neat yeah welcome to the ecosystem thank you much thanks for watching good to meet you great the judges don't have any more questions um great job um team photo that was great i'm just going to ask you to turn off your cameras and mics and feel free to stay for the rest or pop off the call whatever you prefer and so up next we have team d beats if you guys are ready you can start sharing your screen is it tim uh sorry yeah yeah perfect so is a live streaming video streaming and audio streaming platform what it does is it features audios uh audio from audios platform decentralized way through using the audios api also it allows user to upload their own audio if there is no audio present on d bits the user can switch to audios if he wants to play audios or audio from the audience okay so let's see i want to upload i can upload nfts videos and music on the platform let's see let's say i want to upload some music right now i can switch to the upload page i can connect my wallet to the matic mumbai testnet then i can feel all the details here it will show that my wallet is connected and it's wallet id i'll fill in all the details uh here i'm putting some details like the tax genre mode track irc track is wc and say i want to make the nfd of the audio i am uploading right now i'll take this mint nft button and i'll say upload audio this audio will be uploaded uploaded to the ipfs i'll get a hash for the ipfs then it will ask me to pay some gas fees to maintain the nft for the same as soon as the transaction goes through my nft will be minted it's on the polygon blockchain and we are using zora for this okay uh on going to the nft section i'll fetch all the nfts which i have uploaded using the account which i'm connected to the uh metamask through the metamask so here is the song which i uploaded right now from the upload section of the music the nft is minted for that wrong user can play the song right now uh i have not implemented the buying option here but just we are listing the minted nfts okay so uh i'll continue with the live streaming part uh we are using live pier for decentralized live streaming so i'll go to the uh live streaming page where i can see if someone is lying live streaming right now i can just go to what watches stream uh what live streaming uh live peer does is i'm using the beta live streaming api what it does it restreams the audio directly from d bits to another uh streaming platforms like twitch facebook youtube so what i have to do is just start streaming on d bits and automatically d bits will stream to your um preferred streaming platforms like youtube either or either twitch or all of them together so the same stream which i am streaming on debates is also visible on my twitch account uh see here you can see the live page and the stream is visible also this the same stream is on debate okay so as a user i can just watch the string all the playback videos are also available at the bottom these are the recorded streams so for example how can i create a stream i'll just give a name to the stream and say start streaming this will make a call to the audience api i'll get the stream key stream id playback url and the stream name so say i want to also stream to the uh twitch so what i'll do is enter this secret key of this twitch api in the enter secretary key option here and say start multi-streaming but for the demo purpose i'll enter the streaming key in my obs and say start streaming so in the home page here is the stream visible with the same name demo stream and you can see the timer is going uh increasing like it was 12 second and it's 16 second and as a user i can say watch the same also i have implemented convo space it is an decentralized commenting platform so for every command the user makes he has to sign a signature before sending command okay so that was it for the presentation and also i would like to mention one point here that due to its unique uh feature on zora uh maintaining nfts on zora is like creating an unique copy of your version like uh zora doesn't allow youtube sorry zora doesn't allow to create multiple versions of the nfts with same ci id so in in turn preventing multiple copies of the same nft is being minted so every copy or every nft on zora is unique so due to this if anyone tries to upload the same song or same video on our debates he will be shown a notification that uh this song or video has been already uploaded okay that was it from my side thank you thank you for that the judges can now start with the q a should i stop this green shirt well i'm a messy fan too so if you want to keep the psg thing up that's cool by may um so you stitch a lot of things together i'm sort of curious as to like uh you know what was your most your biggest learning like what was the most surprising part of of hacking all that stuff together yeah for me it was like the zora part where i implemented the nft and i realized that zora is one of the unique platform which provides royalties to the nft mentors like the user can just put in how much amount he wants to earn if someone in the future sells resales is the nft for example i uploaded my nft with a royalty of 10 every time someone buys my nft i'll be getting a 10 that's like an excellent breakthrough in it so providing these two d bits that's an excellent point so it sounds like basically nothing surprised you too much about stitching you know a bunch of these different services together like you found it relatively straightforward yeah that's that's good that means about three tooling has gone a long way yeah the documentation all stuff was like easy to go everything's handed over to us that's fantastic that's that's progress yeah yeah that's definitely good you know uh so uh rowan uh what are the next steps for the beats uh what do you plan to do next uh the next part like we are trying to do is we are trying to mint nfts live during uh what we say during the live stream like if someone wants to build an nft of an ongoing stream like i say i uh during playing a game on the live stream i what i did was a kill five of my enemies with an headshot and at that moment i want to mean the nfd of the last 30 seconds of my video and just put an nft of that so my audience can buy this uh nfd live on the stream so that's what i'm planning to do next like it would be uh one of its platform where the user can create a live nft within a second and the watchers the viewers they are they can buy the nft like there are hundreds of thousands of you viewers viewing someone one one of the professional gamers right now so even one or two of the people start buying the nft the price would go high and the everyone would start buying like the nft will go so viral the moment they make awesome you need to see it you need episode for twitch streamers oh sorry okay sorry i stepped on you no is it evan um i was actually going to say then we can meet in the ft of iran playing a cool song so right back at you definitely definitely awesome um really cool project uh seems uh very nice uh keep on building and that's it from my end yeah yeah great thank you team db that was great and now we're going to be moving on to our next presentation thank you so much no worries no worries um so we're gonna go on to our next presentation now and i'd like to welcome up team the mango jelly hey hi everyone hi you can just go ahead and share your screen and yeah howdy hello welcome to our demo uh we are the team the mango jelly and our product is earning patches of income with your nfp so about the manufacturing various options outsourcing platform for autumn uh we are helping creators with the future of financial freedom the team is the devops here and kasha creators are always looking for additional monetization schemes so that they can move towards their goal of financial freedom so we are suggesting that you can use your nfcs to earn passive income um which is recurring in return so you can create and mint your nfp via our solution and also sell it as merchandise uh so like t-shirts uh caps um key chains backpacks and so on which can ship globally and the creator has no inventory management presently nfcs are monetized by selling them either ones and it also depends a lot on uh the artist's popularity uh the uniqueness of the art and if they can be discovered among a field of collection of a lot of nfl in the marketplace and also there can be some revenue from secondary phase if a set buyer often an ftp sells it further a creator can also earn a royalty on firstly we are suggesting to sell merchandise or where the nfc is uh created and uh uh if you look at global cod sales uh good designs can sell uh to up to 10k plus mark unit uh in the lifetime setting a good stream of patches income participation the inventory management is sustainable in nature uh any piece of merchandise say a t-shirt or the merc is only sent for printing and shipping when an order is received from a customer the artist can happily focus on their art and they can work on polishing their graph while all the behind the scenes uh procurement manufacturing uh inventory management fulfillment fulfillment uh and so on are handled by our end-to-end solution this is the tech stack which we used let's see so now i'm going to upload an image for creating its nifty and so let's just select an image and it will be uploaded maintain some details for the image and click on mint to make pnfe for this image so that token has been minted and we will first have a look at the token so we are seeing that the token has been assigned so now we are going to view our nft we enter the nft id the nft is now loaded and we click on sell as mark button so what this button will do is this will upload the nft to our front on demand integration so once you decide to sell your mark using uh dnftr it is received in the file library of your print on demand integration this design can then be used uh for any kind of modern day uh the creator can decide on which kind of merchandise it looks over here we have an example with the eth global logo for a backpack similarly uh other products can also be created by linking your the nfc to cell monk so for example we have a few t-shirts um laptops reviews and so on uh which is dependent on the creator how they want to show it to the world so this is the landing page which is live for the access alpha program and we also are planning some upcoming features uh for more passive income generation using nfcs so you can also fetch your own nfcs from connected wallets and connect them with cod and also sales and profit analysis dashboards for every nfp and then an nfp acquisition marketplace for such nfcs sold via pod so you said it was an end-to-end solution so you have so it's you have a manufacturing and supply chain for just everything and shipping for everything that you list on there no so we integrated with an existing pod solution so we used flintful for this and for the storefront we used shopify so we integrated shopify with blendful and there are uh several pod uh fulfillment partners uh across the globe which uh cater to different countries uh so uh what we are doing is that we are directly integrating with such went on demand uh of platforms and uh then they can uh eventually uh you know handle everything from renting to shipment uh that goes to the print on demand and it is only done when a customer places an order so the creator does not have to handle inventory management so that you you don't have to stock let's say t-shirts in five sizes and thousand units you do not have to care about that you are only caring about the design which you are creating and everything else is handled by the pure department got it cool yeah i i messed that in the slides before i was asking well can you tell me about the name uh like how does mango jelly and uh nft in real life go together yeah so um this is our start of the manga delhi uh we are building this in the create and fashion economy space so the name uh uh does not have a great story but uh the founders we uh me and we really have a great love for micros and uh we uh one day we just had mango with delhi and we were just brainstorming some names and we just named it magnetary and we decided to go ahead with that and uh during hacker fest we were exploring about nfts and blockchain this is the first quarter into blockchain development and so we thought about like how people are thinking about passive income and what are other things that they're exploring in this domain so we decided to build something for them uh using nft and went on demand so that they can have recurring passive income thanks for the question awesome uh yeah so i i love how uh aw i love how uh mango jelly uh name um is very aligned to the nfd's we usually they're really cool my question uh is based around the fact like uh uh okay i i get the experience so it's very very cool uh i have nfp and uh through my virtually i can uh monetize it uh but uh uh when i choose to monetize this uh the back end uh who controls the back and like i told you guys that this is an fp when i uploaded it uh then uh do you guys control the back end to ensure that the nft i'm uh putting out for sale or merchandise uh that is added uh through your back end to beauty so how does data go yes so we are the uh taking care of minting as well as connecting to the pod partner so like for example we have right now done thankful as a partner but you want to give creators an option to choose the cod partner also so say somebody is in the u.s or somebody is in india or somebody is in japan and they have a pod partner of choice they can uh choose to sell murk via that theory partner and uh uh our the nft integration would work with that uh purely partners api to send uh into their file libraries awesome great thank you team mango jelly that was great um so we now be moving on to our next presentation from team block map so you guys can go ahead and share your screen as well as your audio the hell so let's share the video and play it hello everyone i'm so excited to be here to present my hackathon project so this project is trying to solve a problem about discovery in defined world as we know there are so many platforms and services coming out every month and for a new user it feels so overwhelming when entering the defined world users often have to document everything sometimes forget how to transfer tokens in optimal ways from which wallet to which services so i had this idea and developed this application to help users visualize and map out everything so that the user can see a bigger picture about the file landscape and the tools that they are using user can start by logging in with metamask and in this tool currently user uh can do different things like edit a new box each box um each box can be an exchange a wallet or a service so then a user can connect from one box to another box by dragging and dropping the error and then give it a name user can also look at other people's diagram to discover services that other people are using to learn more information about the pools or form apr how to transfer token um efficiently across those services so later on we can also automate to have the initial diagram layout by acquiring a user's wallet address to get more data about access balance transactions connections between addresses similar to the way that zappa or team network work but supporting network only shows balance not the whole diagram like this i think this application is useful in many scenarios like exploring or discovering what service that people are really using can be used in education or tutorial about different services how to transfer tokens across those services or visualize user portfolios to see balance assets or transaction flows or to document them so in the next version i will integrate with more services for querying and visualizing more data to make it more useful uh coming to the q a thanks for your time and your feedbacks so as a user and i mean as the user not like the the end user that's getting information i mean the like the user who is populating this like um why am i am i just doing this to like help educate people is there anything else uh yeah let's say that you have like 20 different wallets and exchange shows that you're using right right now i think most people you know doc money somewhere and this is the way that i visualize the the service that i'm using and how i transfer the tokens from my exchanges to the wireless and to the services at least for my personal use and i can also educate other people like okay this is how you transfer stock and for example from cubecoin to metamask harmony network and then do sushi watch for example that could be one new screen so basically i'm just filling it out because i want like either for myself and then other people can see it like to remember what i like to see what i use or um yeah you can also share that with the other people uh like in the uh public share uh dashboard you can see everybody's diagrams let's say we undress that right when we want to share like okay this is how i use define applications and we can share that also cool sounds like you scratch your own edge yeah i hope that that makes sense uh later i plan to add more like the price connected to chain link to get a real-time price and the balance uh next to each boxes click on this one may show more information transaction and assets or something like that uh so yeah um i mean uh one feedback or an idea i have is you can convert this to a crowd sourcing and uh instead of user coming and adding things manually just ask them to connect their wallet and uh join your own discovery and that with the user will not probably have to add things again and again uh moving to the question uh so uh uh all all these connections and all these information where are you studying them and how are you storing it uh right now this is just a list of uh json um it's a metadata list of boxes and connections that i plan to store it in using textile on ipms and then we can also export the whole thing as a png or canvas svg and then store it on ipfs also got it and uh what's the advantage of having different boxes uh like let's say evan has one box and i have one box i mean uh what's the advantage of having two boxes um the other difference is uh the metadata like um it can be like the type is exchange or type is a wallet right laser nut we can do more query for example using the graph and then we can get more metadata for each box awesome sounds good yeah thank you for this great thank you team block math that was great um and now quickly before we do continue um we'd like to take a quick 10 minute break um so feel free to get up go for a little walk grab a glass of water whatever you you'd like and um yeah we'll be back in like 10 minutes thank you okay everyone welcome back um and if we can just get straight into it again so i'd like to welcome up um the first team back on the break uh team blockchain robotics hello hi there let me uh start sharing hello and welcome to my haccafs 2021 project demo blockchain robotics a framework for integrating internet of things devices and blockchain technologies so first a quick definition on what an internet of things device actually is it's basically just an internet connected device that's gonna collect and share data over the internet sometimes they might also have like an actuator that would also be able to be controlled over the internet so an example of this might be a heater that you buy and has like a smartphone app and from the smartphone app you might be able to monitor the temperature of the room that it's installed in and you might also be able to [Music] have it turn on or off or just have the ability to automatically maintain a specific temperature so internet of things devices will produce large volumes of data and it's typically stored and managed in a centralized cloud service and one of the new developments in blockchain and protocol labs has been making decentralized tools that provide a decentralized blockchain alternative to these existing centralized cloud services which potentially has the ability to give a user much greater control over their own data so specifically what is blockchain robotics uh well really it's two tools one is nasa's core flight system uh which is a middleware for recording data and supporting other activities uh on an internet of things device as well as protocol labs is web 3 storage which was used to store recorded data so a little bit more about cfs it's an open source middleware toolset so it has the ability for data acquisition processing control and communication it's very lightweight it's coded in c it's been used in satellite missions it's well for it's well equipped for cubesat missions and things where computation and storage comes at a premium it's also very modular hence the usage of it in a framework and then also we're using web3 storage for storing of data now on to the demo all right and then i just had like a really quick 30 second live demo here uh so i'm in cfs right now um i'm in this is where we determine like the properties of the file we're creating so right now um it's pretty default stuff it's just telling it about itself you can change the size and stuff like that there's ways to get like a gui um i didn't implement that um but you can you would have like see it was actually living on your device like your uh like an arpai or something like that and uh then uh yeah you would uh be able to produce the data so right now i'm just running the executable then this is like in the build uh and it's gonna start making like a file specific to that so it will pop up like a new file in there uh so this one has like time stamps notice i have one with like sequence counts um but yeah that's uh that's watching robotics so what what inspired this like do you work in aerospace do you just love nasa what's the yeah um i recently started a job i graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering um and started getting more into computer science and got a minor and recently started a job where we've been doing some robotics research um and so uh this was a new thing that was uh um around so um i was interested in using it for like a blockchain and i think a lot of times the philosophy overlaps with blockchain where you need to have code that works you need to have it be very optimized because your processing and storage comes at a premium so a lot of the philosophies kind of align i think pretty well with stuff that happens in blockchain um but yeah that's overview so are you planning to like make this get this used like keep developing it or is this just something to like play around and see if they like could mesh together it at all i mean i guess you probably figured out you already knew that they could i guess yeah i think it's something that um is is interesting because i i don't think there's a whole lot of like um use of like real world like embedded devices and blockchain integrated like i'm not aware of too many projects that do that um but something that's done a lot in cfs particularly um the reason it came to be came into existence is because the guys at nasa realized that they were writing the same code like over and over and over again for just all the satellite missions because they had to have you know very similar functionality so what they did was they made this very modular and tried to make it like as operating system agnostic uh code as possible so it also has like um the ability to work on like a vx works um i've tried to get it to work on uh open right before um but i have not had success with that um but yeah it's it's it's something that i think is interesting and actually getting um real world data onto the blockchain and setting up kind of like a framework for that uh so i also have like a like a demo in the description where i kind of walk through like a more uh detailed of how you would actually set this up if you had like a rpi or something and you would have to still like configure it to get your sensor data onto cfs but you would be able to use like the modular app system and then be able to like share and publish and work with the gui so i think it's a i think it's pretty interesting with how it could work with something like a blockchain great thank you team blockchain robotics that was great uh we're gonna move right on to the next presentation and i'd like to welcome up team web3 comics um feel free to start sharing your screen and you can get right into it bienvenidos welcome to web3 comics a web 3 application where comic creators can publish content page by page and readers can support their favorite authors by purchasing and collecting nfts of their publications i currently have my metamask setup to use polygons destnet mumbai however i don't need to be connected just yet to read through the available comics let's login first before publishing a comic when logging in the user will be prompted to authenticate to ceramic and idx if the user doesn't have a profile then they will be redirected to create one all images in this app are being stored in ipfs and filecon using either web3.storage or nft.storage when the profile is created for the first time the ceramic tid will be stored on chain so that users can see comics or comments from anyone else using this app let's publish our first comic the app uses ceramic to keep track of all publications and users comments but as mentioned before the images themselves are stored using web3.storage now let's add some pages to our comic each page can be mint as nft when a reader buys it for the price specified here we also take some information from here to create the erc721 metadata some other information like the thumbnail and outdoor tid will be stored in ipfs and ceramic streams for display purposes now that we publish our first page let's bring another user to add some comments and buy it readers can support their favorite authors by purchasing and collecting their publications we believe that using web3 technologies will allow a better interaction between content creators and consumers comic authors will receive a fair compensation for the efforts and consumers will receive a collectible piece of their favorite comics in the form of nfts thanks for watching our demo so so why comics i mean i you know it's sort of like a marketplace um you just felt like nobody had done comics yet and you're a comic fan so yeah well kind of uh we actually have two reasons why we wanted to go this way and uh one reason is that we are actually trying to make our own comic and uh but we didn't felt like like there was an um a website already there that suit our need needs for this because we wanted to use blockchain and decentralized technologies uh for this but uh we didn't quite like the ones that were there so we wanted to create our own and the other reason was that uh well although my teammate is an illustrator and as well as as although there are too many illustrators and digital artists uh very talented people and i think that using this platform together with web3 technologies allow us to explore uh different ways to to to support digital artists and content creators in general and also the audience uh there are different choices for them to to support this this uh these people so it sounds like this was the beginning of like uh of a project that is going to continue that's right and uh it's actually the very first step we really have to too many ambitions for this and uh and the comic is the first the first step nate what's what's what's what else is there well actually the the original idea was to create a trading card game using also blockchain but we actually have already designed the mechanics and some of the illustrators illustrations sorry um we actually presented this on on a local convention and everything but uh for for purpose of having a not too much complicated project for someone who doesn't have any trajectory we want us to go a little bit as a step back backwards to start with something a little bit simpler so we can uh have something on on our name and we can present to to investors and have a better chance of succeed cool awesome uh advent uh last question from my end uh i mean uh what do you plan to do with ceramic idx uh do you mean for the for the future or or what i mean now and also for the future yeah well right now uh we use ceramic and idx almost for everything uh i mean all the images are of course on on on the ipfs and filepoint but we keep track of the profiles user comments and also we divide each comic and all the publications that belong to each of these comics we keep them on on ceramic streams not uh making sense so and yeah good call uh doing this let me see you can even connect multiple products to a single donor so yeah thanks great thank you team web 3 comics and um thank you and um now we're going to move on to our next team and i'd like to welcome up team phil scan okay let me show my screen yeah yes my name is rita from tuscan team i'm so glad to be here to presenting about a file scan first can is aimed to build the falcon detail analysis center by providing furcon econ system service data visualization and one stop statement service crosstalk i don't think i'm the only person to check the revenue from here let me get back and start again developing quick i think we got it yes my name is rita from tuscan team uh i'm so glad to be here to presenting about if our skin i think we were able to see it before like on the so you can hear my sound but you cannot see the scream right no no we we can't see it now uh you can sit mac scream okay can i say the presentation right now sure okay yes my name is rita from tuscan team uh i'm so glad to be here to presenting about the first scan first scan is aimed to build the falcon data analysis center by per one difficult economy can't just see my peeped here or you can just see my myself here uh you can see your youtube uh you can see my youtube right it's working just start the video okay system service data virtualization and one step data service across japan as you can see you can check the revenue study from here and you also can look up to the data of the helena work from here we'll lay out all the important ambulance here especially um our western storage providers most interesting is about network storage power and velocity for 24 hours power growth you can see from here is almost over 50 heavy bags and about this graphic you can look up to the trend about the baseline and the storage power we lay out a different timeline so you can check in the 30-day spirit or a year period as you can see here after the appropriations of the hepdrag the growth is slightly higher than before and about the base three variations is also very important for and storage providers because it's quite related to guest consumptions so we also look up to from the different timeline now we're just calling the 30 days this is quite a difference compared before and since the habitual aggregations is increasingly very lower and below this is two tablets about the current kings and the large amount transfer which is very friendly and also very useful for their investors to look out through the marketing figures and just the track from the figures note or the figures from the power groups also can save the cash flow from the transactions to get insight about the market trend all right um i also want to say now this the girls at other node is significantly going very fast so you can just easy and look up to the whole other word girls and trend from the mat so we're going to introduce our very gracious functions and the data monitoring panel so once you get into the panel sections here you can just easily to create a note in different of the name and also put the note you want to monitor it here so taking an instance of 18 pound here once according to the note you can get all the relevant revenues and confusions here in order to prevent storage announcing management due to insufficient wallet balance especially to set the notifications functions here so the users can just choose in different of the way to reach them once they hit the bottom of the balance and under the below here users also can screen the timeline here to get all the history's reward and the pre-works against consumption as well as as what i say just tell on besides the data about the consumption revenues the users also can see the video chart to predict of the girls after the note if they want to get the data paper they can also can just easily hit the download about it to get a relevant exam please feel free to reach us by sending an email i'll leave a message on the github thanks for watching got it that was pretty awesome i just want to ask uh i mean um uh for sort of everybody thanks for having me yeah it's very great to be here to tell you guys more about the business center program actually we just launched this program together with the fargo foundation and also with us the venus team because we want more small manners to join this network together with us let me tell you guys more about the network stickers currently as we get the data from the first gun we can check about the network service that is over seven eip right now or you know uh all right so i just wanted to know uh is there a service like this that exists on uh file scan right now or uh you created everything uh from the straps uh because this performance matrix is uh something i think uh five one can really use so yeah yeah actually we bring the bronzer from this crash because we have a team about the five persons so including the pm and then also f devs together so since we get wanted to solve the problem for the storage provider shipping management and i also get easily together real-time uh database so this is uh the fresh ideas this is the original idea we wanted to build a few scan got it [Music] really really impressive on you evan uh you should try it further giant from fight coin as well sorry uh go for the grand uh with five going as well uh this is really impressive keep on building and uh uh ivan uh uh what do you know um go ahead yeah sure you can go ahead sorry yeah i was gonna say it's impressive you you said like there's a bigger team than like you because you built this all i mean you can't even sync a file coin node during this hackathon right uh yeah we have a thing about five right so uh in the beginning of that we just peeled the note uh into two together so uh easy for the story provider or investor just to check the nailed the database regarding the guest conceptions single key conceptions or thunder revenues in the way also to provide a visibility database regarding and to providing the trends of the node house this is girl thing so as we just in the show just now you can see the trends how is the going consumptions this is significantly different between the happy drive on the first half of july yeah so uh once the story produced all the econ participations they wanted to get inside of the footprint ecosystem so they're very easy to just look at true and get no insight of how the ecosystem is going from from our bronzers great thank you so if the judges do not have any more questions we can move on to uh i actually have one more uh so rita what part of the entire text tag you build during the hackathon uh next time we're going to upgrade our functions so uh besides we just get a new fresh uh update uh regarding the monetary panels so uh we're going to put the more details by like which is one of the importance is between the database like every 30 minutes they gather new blocks so how to uh the story providers can gather feedback and get the new information and database in real time this is the heat thing so we have to solve currently also have to do be faster than our competitions so this is the first thing i was thinking about they're going to do next and the second is about the monetary panel so we're going to put a more uh minor functions like set fractions how do they get the alarm or remainder before uh certain uh sorry uh 100 minutes before they hit the bottom of the finished conceptions of the gas consumption right so in order to now be punishment by the network all right thanks vito thank you thank you thank you to your team phil scan so we're going to move on to our uh next team and i'd like to welcome up team ipfs notebook and you guys can go ahead and share your screen and audio and get straight to it hi everyone and welcome to the demo of our ipfs notebook which we built for hackfest 2021 i'm going to walk you through the core features of our app let's start by adding a new note we can give the node a title and we can write down some information that we want to store sometimes we might want to include sensitive content in our notes we can use a custom encryption key such as key to encrypt our note if we keep the same key saved we can easily decrypt our notepad again if we have the incorrect key we won't be able to decrypt our note once we're ready to save our node we can easily click save and our note will be stored on ipfs we'll receive a cid in return that will allow us to retrieve the note back again hopefully you've saved that encryption key one feature that we've incorporated for added convenience for our users is connect with metamask this will pull all of the users saved cids in bulk so they don't have to store them themselves and then here comes my list of safety ids this is a note i had saved previously thank you for watching all right i'm dumb how does the meta mask save your cids so it's a it's a little bit of a hack but basically there's a uh a postgres database sitting on aws that stores all the users cids we wanted to go for a decentralized storage method but couldn't couldn't hack it together in time the the content of the cid itself is stored on ipfs it's just an added convenience for the users they don't have to save their own cids so there's like something that there's like a api call or something that you can do like that's not in the ui on metamask that will let you just store a cid well so all we do all our database is is just a mapping of an ethereum public address to a list of cids that's all it is and metamask will save that for you no our front end is just pulling out the ethereum address of the connected metamask account that's it oh okay so you're saving it and using the metamask to pull it yeah exactly okay okay sorry that would make sense i was i was lost yeah yeah okay that makes total sense i thought you were like somehow like metamask was saving this for you and i was getting lost there no no i mean we wanted to do it that way but putting everyone putting each cid on the ethereum blockchain would be very very expensive for a simple uh simple note-taking app yeah cool it's neat awesome um so yeah uh uh actually evan's question was my question as well how you guys are doing it uh but yeah thanks for the explanation versus uh you might want to look into ceramic uh they can essentially do the same thing but in a decentralized way uh for uh storing all the cids uh coming from the encryption part um you know what sort of encryption are you guys uh using uh it uses aes okay uh it's cool uh but if you're using aes uh how are you oh so you are uh getting the key got it uh you can even look into ecc algorithm and click take curve algorithm and that way you can essentially save the user another step uh essentially the key can be encrypted using the ecc algorithm and the public private key of the wallet can be used to decrypt the note uh so just look into it but uh really cool uh feature hopefully it becomes uh the notebook of the future cool craig do the judges have any more questions i mean are you did are you planning to develop this further or is it something that you did just since you wanted to hack around with like ipfs i don't know we didn't really have a a game plan this was kind of nick's brainchild um and uh i think we really ended up liking the way it came out um so i don't know we'll probably have to circle up and decide what to do next yeah we're hoping some of the we had a lot of trouble finding the good like decentralized storage to use and hopefully we can maybe figure that out you know we worked a lot with ceramic and idx um but couldn't really hack it together in the end so that would be something next is to get that off of aws cool makes sense great thank you guys so we're going to be moving on to um the next team and i'd like to welcome team file dag hi guys i'll show my screen yeah hello everyone this is laura from feldrage welcome to the demo video of our project failed that about our team belgium we have always defined us as uh two developers and infrastructure builders in fulcrum community from 2019 we focus on technique called solutions and development based on ipfs protocol and physical network and do our best to make contributions to the community over 80 percent of our team are qualified engineers and half of them have over 10 year development experience in mutual industry including communications the internet and blockchain since last year we have participated in slingshot computation become one of the top teams and stored over 5 pb useful data from public data sites to filcon network to contribute to the field community we developed an open source data prep tool graph split and the field complex project dashboard field plus the info fieldtech is a decentralized storage solution based on ffs it will prove high quality and efficient fsp service and customize the network service based on our customer requirements an easy to use front-end ui and more developer friendly api service will minimize the technical search hold and make ffs usable the sdk will be available shortly soon with the website the users can update fields under 10 gigabytes or ffcid to pin data they need for developers who wants to use field decks api trooping data they just need to create an api key and then use api to enjoy their pin service all files can be managed in the file management center with small actions such as unkindling identity make data or pin policy and deleting data from users account besides field that can be regarded as one of the necessary technical components for the fulcrum retrieval market and a part of storage infrastructure for website a refilling buy field that could be stored as a backup onto field coins through web3 storage and the user's choice in a future release the users can just select what file they want to store all filcon in their file management center and field tag will automatically complete the next operations the gold datastore cluster is one of the most significant part of field that which aims to guide field decks this uh distributed values data store into a booster to increase the function of data state and include the management of data in key value data store is the storage layer of field deck and here is the roommate our team will update its development progress on a cd hubble repository in certain scenarios users want to store a large data size of ipfs and backup of few copies of filcon at this point graph solid is a component of a field that could be the right tools used for selecting large data size into graphs slaves fit for making deals on fuelco network which will stimulate data retrieval we will keep improving too much field that's a function better to summarize field tech is the platform with multiple layers and components during the hacksaw our team will continue to focus on code development thank you for watching our demo that's my demo video of our platform fill that awesome i mean one question uh from my end is uh uh what's the difference between uh field egg and uh pinata uh it's more like uh the field that is more like we do it better feed for asian users especially users in china since they have the chinese version here and we do consider about uh how data transfer from one region to another region so as to pinata it's also provide a high quality ips pin service but however people in asia they can not use pinata as uh their tools for their dabs really well so we consider about this needs and actually our technical architecture is quite different from pinata like we have our own design the architecture of the data store cluster is quite different from fps cluster awesome sound sunscreen uh another question uh uh what's what's the next step for fieldtech uh what do you see building uh next okay uh next that we want to like we want uh the field that becomes the platform to connect your users to ipfs network and to filcon network and users can like they only need to use the website we provide to do the whole things they uh like they store data on both fps and fuel content do not need to learn much technology on technological knowledge to know how to use they're just using this that's all right and we will like uh in some uh actually when we use ffs or filcon we like they have to become two part we need to crack uh them through some applications but we want to make this hosting together they only need to choose what they uh the services they want uh pin service ipvs all the data backup of fuelcon they just need to choose on the ui uh ui website is that's all right so we wanted to like satisfy more users needs and consider about what they want to like like them to finish their job more better and flexible got it sounds good so are you live today to pin uh we have already launched the alpha uh version right now you can uh just you use already to have the uh from the like the basic uh functions are can all use the renault cool great great so if um the judges do not have any more questions we can move on to the next presentation and this will be our last one for this event um so i'd like to welcome up team paste pin hi let's start sharing my screen right away yep great probably everyone has come across pastebin before it's a site that allows you to share raw text with others using a link but the data is stored in a centralized way so you never know when your data will be taken down and that's why i've built pastebin which is a site that allows you to share text and files on a decentralized network it uses web3.storage under the hood which basically uploads and prints your files on the ipfs network and let's do a demo uh i'm just gonna paste in here the placeholder and look at the preview looks pretty good i'm gonna give it a title and actually i forgot that i also want to attach a few files but only one is enough because the upload time could take otherwise more so yeah let's preview it and now i have two options either to publish it anonymously or publish it with that signature i'm gonna go with option b now that's previewer message in here okay looks pretty good let's sign it and now my data will be uploaded and afterwards i will be redirected to this new url that i can share with others and uh the first request will take more because these uh site is statically generated and they'll be cached afterwards so they'll load more quickly afterwards and here can look at some of the details so i can see that it's verified and this was the address that published it and everyone can verify this because this is dumb client side and it was created a minute ago i can also download my file here and let's look at some of more some of the other details in here i can see the file size of the pin and the number of pins and deals in here which will probably go up in the future and there's also a direct link to an ipfs gateway where i can inspect my files in here let's look at pastepin.json where all the paste bin related data is stored so there's the content the title and because we published it with our signature we can also see that here and the associated address that goes with that and yeah this was payspin i hope you like it and thanks for watching neat uh really really uh cool uh uh piece of software hand on uh love the chair love the play on wood so uh so my only question is uh i mean first the feedback i love the minimal ui uh it looks very very cool uh and uh the question is uh what uh what happens if i want to post anonymously uh i do think i know the answer but yeah uh i guess you guys will not upload the signature and post it yeah i'm going to sleep yeah yeah the same thing will happen except your signature and your uh address won't be provided and it won't be stored in the pastebin.json file and you will need to sign it you just get a link got it awesome uh and what's the text stack uh you guys have used um the web framework i'm used as a next gs and uh yeah as i mentioned i used that 3. storage for the pinning it was super easy actually awesome looks very very good guys so uh i would love to use basement in the future yeah thanks and so if you did like make this into a thing you basically like have to serve ads in order to pay for the pins um um well that three dot storage is free so i think if that remains free then facebook.json can also remain free i'm not sure how the business plan for that will work in the future but i guess this project is kind of dependent on that one right on you said it takes a while the first time how long does that generally take i think around maybe five to 15 seconds or so is that dependent on the file size or is that just whatever you're generating on the pinning side uh i'm not sure i mean yeah definitely i think the file size depends more on how much uh are you uploading and then it depends on the web three that storage service or like the ipfs notes uh like how long they take till you uh get a response from them or like the time of the first query cool neat yeah it's a nice ui and that it legit works and it's uh yeah you can try it out worse than web 2. yeah i tried to work on the ux more to make it seem less kind of i guess that was the biggest challenge on this to make it as fast as like a web 2 service would be what did you do to make it faster anything in particular uh yeah i try to make the states uh kind of seem seamless to do stuff in a background or show stuff until it's uploading and then the static generation i think is the bigger one that if you send your link then you don't have to wait always for it to query it but it's already uh generated uh beforehand and uh the user just gets uh the html and this might be a dumb question but why do i sign it like why do i like i don't know maybe i don't use paceman a lot but like is there an advantage to not being a non like i want people to know that like i did it so there's like some reputation i guess that's just the account okay maybe that makes sense yeah it might look very i think in most cases you want to publish it anonymously because it's not that important maybe if you want to make sure that yeah this message is coming from me then you can provide a signature i mean i guess it sort of functions like you know if you were creating a reputation as a whistleblower blower or something and you wanted to people to you know yeah that kind of makes sense you know like a series of leaks about something yeah i want people to know that it's all from you yeah i think there were a few cases where people wanted to take something down from paste bin so maybe for those edge cases this would already be better because you can't take it down that easily i mean if satoshi nakamoto wanted to sign a message i would be up for that but yeah i i just wanted great so thank you team pace pin so i know i said that was the last team but i just got a message that we have one more team left um i'm not sure if they are here yet but just give me a second oh yeah hey this is b from east global um do you see nathan in the waiting room yep nathan is an attendee so uh promote him and he's our he's our last team his team append that is an appropriate name barry hey um i don't have a camera on this pc but i'll share my screen this isn't on my scoresheet and it's a drag and drop website builder for ipfs sites uh or decentralized websites rather and you can get the content hash for it and even one click publish to a domain you have like an ens or an unstoppable domain and just update the content hash all within the app uh or you can save it without actually publishing the hash to a network and you can also see like the history of all the hashes you've published so let's jump in um i'm gonna i have like elements here i can add to the page like i can just block a text um i can uh you know i can make it red if i want to you know i can really there should be a color picker here but whatever um i can uh make this a little bigger um i can go ahead and change the alignment uh the font the you know whether it's bold or not and uh things like that so i can also delete it um it's cut off but there's a little delete button right here and the bottom right there um and i can delete it i'm just going to delete all these uh clean things up and um i'm gonna add another header i don't know you can just play around with it um you can add some emojis um yeah so we have like pages here um i can create a page give it a title get a description i can upload a page that's still under construction i could create a redirect like if i want to redirect uh a page to another page on the site or maybe just like a totally different domain altogether um i can maybe add products later i'm still deciding uh like how that'll work if i'll implement that um i can upload files from my computer and even strip the image metadata for like privacy um i can change the fonts scroll bars things like that and plugins is also something that's definitely on the roadmap um this is something i've been wanting to build for a while by the way it's like the hackathon just happened to be like during kind of the time i started working on it so i just started working on it for the hackathon but um i'll be working on it after as well um i can add custom css you know you don't have to know how to code i mean ideally it's like intuitive that anyone can do it just by dragging and dropping but you know if you want for for a little bit more control you can you know add your own thing like i'll just add like a border for example um and uh you know it'll it'll work with all your other styles you can add any styles here you want and it'll just all work um so whenever you like save export or publish your site it'll um uh it'll all like get minified and bundled and just you'll get a tiny static site um you can do whatever you want with so there's three options here that i'll just lastly go over um i can save it i can just like save my progress to web3.storage which is maintained by protocol labs um but eventually you know get rid of all the centralized intermediaries um at some point but for now it's a prototype so it's fine um yeah i can export that'll just like give me a zip folder of my site um i can also publish it and publishing it i can enter in like my domain here and then uh oh my wallet's already connected but there would normally be connect wall button and then it'll like resolve the domains you have and you can publish directly to your domain i just published a to nathan.eth except it doesn't work right now because um there was a technical difficulty before recording this but i'll publish it just to ipfs like you don't have to do two domain uh just to show you uh so we'll take a moment but uh i just clicked it there um that's weird i'm gonna reopen the modal up there we go okay so i have my content hash here um and that's the content hashing my site the date of publication and there it is there's my site it's on i don't know if you can see here but i'm on the ipfs gateway um you can use really any um any gateway you want um but that's kind of the one that's currently set up but anyway uh yeah thanks for time i hope i hope you enjoy so i thought you were i'm just judging noting questions i thought there's only one thing on our spreadsheet that isn't filled in yet and it's generate dexr but i don't think that's you i did for a second no but that's not me yeah okay all right now that that's ever um that's that's cool it's cool i think this is like a nicer looking blogging platform than i don't know anything i've used in the last 20 years so that's that's pretty good the export button was just downloaded the file if i want to take it and publish it myself somewhere else or something yup it gives you a zip folder with all your pages and everything so you can do whatever you want with it yep so just if i'm moving my site somewhere else or something yep okay cool what's what's next you said like plugins and whatnot yeah uh maybe like plugins e-commerce products um just other components and better exporting um maybe a more modern ui um and uh yeah it's something i don't want to work on for a while but it's uh this hackathon kind of gave me an excuse to start building a prototype so yeah it's been fun got it i mean um it's very good nathan uh uh what happens uh when i update uh or edit the site out uh uh do i uh create another transaction uh to my uh ens name or how to start work yeah so you can save a site without publishing it to a network um if you just want to make like a small change and whenever you want to update it on your domain you can click the publish button and uh enter in like an ens or unstoppable domain and it'll just update the content hash you got to do a transaction um but uh yeah and you can do it on any network not just mainnet um yeah i mean uh really cool i would recommend checking out ipns uh which is a fee by which you can publish uh files on ipfs without changing the content hash so uh the users would probably uh get a better experience they won't have to uh spend on the gas fee again anything but yeah just a small feedback this looks really really cool yeah i can definitely add ips support yeah you said you wanted a more modern ui but i really like it the way it is what do you mean um yeah i just felt like it kind of looked kind of old like i just threw it together i was just more focused on like the actual core utility of that but um yeah i can kind of keep the way it is too i mean i guess i'm an old-school kind of form over function form over sorry function over form kind of guy so yep looks great to me yeah well thanks for all your feedback yeah very neat thank you yep great thank you and so that was um the last presentation of the night and i'm pretty sure now um if you refresh your page you should be able to see team append on there um but yeah i'd just like to take a quick second to thank all the teams
