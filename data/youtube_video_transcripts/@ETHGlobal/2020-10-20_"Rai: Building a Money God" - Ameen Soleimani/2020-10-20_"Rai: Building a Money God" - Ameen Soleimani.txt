next up we have amin uh soleimani who is going to be talking about arai and rai is a ethereum backstable coin uh for the d5 ecosystem and i'll uh i'll let him sort of introduce uh how he got started with this project and uh how rai works so please welcome amin is it working you can see everything properly yeah cool great uh thanks for having me um yeah so my name is uh amin solomani i'm here to present rai uh building a money god um the co-founder of reflex lab says thanks for having us equivalent so today i'm going to give an introduction about the project i'm going to talk a little bit about what i mean by money gods we're going to talk about control theory i'm going to explain the reflex index which is the what rye is it's a new kind of defy asset and i'll talk about our forthcoming proto-rye in demo launch i want to start with why decentralization matters and it matters because some things are more important than countries so blockchain networks are global public utilities uh bitcoin is a it's a story value vending machine for the world eth is a globally neutral financial system uh we we want to keep them this way uh there's there's a reason uh we we build on eth um and it's uh because we we believe that it's going to be uh resilient and and decentralization is a tactical decision maybe even a formation something like a phalanx where you eliminate the dependency on centralized leadership to reduce the payoff matrix for an adversary to attack you know if there's one guy who can topple the whole thing and it's like super worth going after them but if there isn't and then it might not be worth going after anybody at all so the long story short if you want your financial infrastructure or any infrastructure to outlast your country you should think about decentralizing it so what is rye rye is a new eth-backed defy asset it's stable coin-ish because it's a reflex index it's not quite a stable coin it is volatility dampened index of its collateral so it's designed to resist sudden price movements but it can drift over longer timeframes it is a fork of maker dow's multi-collateral die we thought that was a great place to start because it's been formally verified doesn't have external dependencies has a network of experts that understand it in depth the system is governance minimized so we're trying to remove governance as much as possible uh over the system we want to have ungovernance meetings where you know the point is to stop having the meetings and and figure out fully automating the system so it can run itself one of the things that we have figured out how to automate is the interest rate so we automatically uh set the interest rate that keeps the rye asset stable and the asset is optimized to be defy collateral so it'll be low volatility and we think that because it doesn't have the same counterparty risk that say usdc or usdt have or even die if you think about the maker governance system as your counterparty might be helpful so rye is being developed by reflexer labs the ceo is a charming young man named stefan ionescu it's a 22 year old solidity wizard in in the uk uh the team is five devs including stefan i'm a part-time contributor i just work here we also have nikolai uh the technical co-founder of maker as our advisor and we've raised 1.6 million dollars from metacartel ventures and paradigm standard crypto variant and robert rai was born of frustrations with multi-collateral dye so single collateral dye in 2018 was pretty great it had eth as its only form of collateral the governments didn't really do anything except set the stability fee and uh the project cared deeply about decentralization i'm gonna play a little time capsule blast from the past um but anyway so the thing about this this entire model as whole i don't think that it's possible for this model to scale at all in the same in the same way that the dye can make or hand right because they're not decentralized so like it's just like a different product essentially because let's say for instance you're building a debt if you build it on top of something like tether to usd it's no longer that right it just became an app because you're actually building it on top of the bank and underneath your product like your product there is a bank that is essentially the the platform you're building on because they're the ones who in a sense they have to agree to everything you're doing and if they don't you're in trouble because they will actually i mean they can and they will seize your funds uh freeze them or whatever right like um yeah so uh that was in 2018 uh and now it seems that uh you know with uh makers and die by extension has sort of become more of an app than it than adap because more of the collateral backing die at this point is usdc than than eve and and the governance has extended its reach to to do a lot i love this meme of of mariano slapping all the tokens into into maker so uh uh oh yeah one more thing i mean also note like uh spanx had like 400 000 of the die at the time like we liked it because it was you know cypherpunk money and then uh now it's a little harder to explain what it is and and justify it but so talk about uh moneygod thesis so the idea is of the money god is that it is possible to build a system that transcends human intervention and is thus treated with a sort of divine reverence so to speak uh you know you you have faith in in the system and so um one of the things that you have to have is a a perception of control as liability uh and so if you eliminate these points of control you you can reduce the possibility that uh insiders will exploit the system or outsiders will will try to damage it or attack it through even regulation and this increases its resilience and then through minimum governance you get social scalability so instead of needing to trust some group of people to make the right decisions about what the interest rates should be or or you know the risk tolerance for various things you sort of just trust that the algorithm will continue to operate as it was programmed and maybe it's less flexible but you don't have to worry about the black swan risk of the humans failing you you certainly can worry about the technical risk but um the the the bet is that it's easier to um to scale and and you can see this with bitcoin right bitcoiners are willing to stake their lives on bitcoin because they trust the system not to change on them unexpectedly there's no group of people that can go and just change bitcoin unilaterally and they all basically enforce that norm another thing is to break the dependency on usd uh usd is losing its purchasing power and it might go away entirely it doesn't seem wise for a god to tether itself to such uh mortal uh mortal systems uh and and the last is is longevity uh because you you want to design the system to outlast its creators and have that kind of framework when you're when you're thinking about uh the design um and the idea is that if you do all these things like people interact with the system differently than they otherwise wouldn't and you get people to buy in and commit uh to uh helping you know grow the system because they they know that the rules can't be changed by anybody and and you can see this alexa fan too um so talk about control theory uh control theory is is everywhere it's the science of maintaining stability in this context the reason that we're interested in control theory is because we want to remove the control of governance over the system so if we want the to not have people voting on what the interest rates are we have to have an algorithm that sets it and we have to design the algorithm that it can sufficiently handle you know crazy black swan events and your sort of day-to-day without needing too much uh human intervention uh ideally they're they're get to a point where there's none so a control system works like this it has some output that you're trying to get to some desired state it has some input that you're manipulating and you sort of measure the output and then you manipulate the input my favorite example of this for beginners is like a shower right you get into the shower you know how hot you want the water to be you you have the input which is the knob and you're sort of twisting the knob to make sure that the shower eventually gets to be the right temperature if you if you move the knob too fast uh if your if your controller is too sensitive then you're gonna overshoot and you're gonna get hot water and then have to you know turn it all the way back and then uh you know repeat the process and so the whole science of control theory is to um try to optimize the system to quickly achieve uh the desired target but without overshooting too much the most common form of a controller is the pid controller and the way the pid controller works is it combines these three terms all derived from the error the the difference between what we want the system to be at and what it is currently at so the proportional term is directly proportional to the current error so if if the temperature that we want the water is like 100 and the temperature is currently you know 105 that's if it was 110 then that term would be like twice as big so uh that just points in in the direction of uh what the error is that uh and and you can think of that as like the sort of standard okay well if it's hot then i should oppose it if it's cold i should yeah the integral is different the integral it accumulates the error over time and it's typically used to deal with steady state errors so if there's a slow a small amount of error that the proportional term isn't quite sensitive enough to pick up it'll build and build and build over time until uh it you know it's large enough that the integral uh term grows and responds to it and so you can think of this in the context of like cruise control maybe your car is good at uh if you have the set point to 80 miles an hour you know if it's like one mile per hour lower and and it's staying there for a while then there's something that'll eventually bring it back up to 80. the the derivative is based on how fast you are approaching or moving away from the equilibrium i'm not going to talk too much about that it's not as relevant for this but it's another way to quantify quantify there it's typically used for uh more more fast responses um so when when we're building this algorithm we're essentially tuning a controller and so each of these terms has a constant associated with it called the gain there's a kp the ki or kd so there's proportional gain and integral gain and our objective is to determine what these parameters should be so that the interest rate responds and and keeps rye stable and we're gonna take a little field trip it's gonna be a few minute video of watching a man stabilize his robot so yeah let's uh start again and uh look at just proportional control and how to pick the uh gain and uh and what it looks like if you go too high or too low all right so i've uh got the robot laying on its back right now and i took the uh if you look at the bottom the bottom three charts i took the integral and derivative part uh the games and zeroed them out so they're basically not having effect we now just have a proportional uh control feedback loop and let's take a look at how that performs so because it has the gain that i chose earlier it's actually balancing right but let me uh try to get this all in frame so you can see a little better let's see if i can get that this is the kind of thing we do at uh reflected all in frame yeah so that's stable it's not as good as i can get okay so if i um if you look at the bottom left chart the p scalar or p gain chart um well first of all we drive it around i guess so you can kind of see that it balances okay but not very well you can see whenever i get an input it kind of it kind of oscillates a little bit and that's even with the proportional gain set pretty well if you set it um much lower so you can kind of see now on the on the tv we've got the game set at about 5000 and now it just really doesn't want to uh to balance i have to uh i have to kind of constantly i have to kind of manually balance it it's just kind of all over the place so yeah if your proportional gain is set too low it's just going to drift it isn't going to hold its position very well and it might even flip over okay so if you uh if you raise the gain so we're going to bring it up towards about 12 000 which is where it was you can see that it'll work all right it still drips quite a bit but now it can i get that in frame uh now it can you know reasonably well on its own um perform but it still drifts a lot and then if you set the gain way too high so you can kind of see right there the gain is set to 24 000. um it balances a little bit better but then it'll oscillate and uh you can even see in the the graph um yeah so that's one thing you gotta be careful with if you set it too high it's uh it'll get kind of ridiculous so for my particular robot uh proportional gain uh cool yeah that was it um so so the point of that is that that that is actually uh what what we are doing uh except instead of uh keeping a money uh a robot uh up we're keeping uh the the price stable and uh we're not fighting gravity and and whatnot we're fighting market forces um and we our tuning process and uh what we'll try to accomplish with our mainnet demo and and uh building the system over time is understanding the dynamics of the market so properly change the parameters so that this thing can be stable in a variety of conditions one of the interesting things that i learned in the process of this was that central banks actually sort of run on control theory they just don't know it yet so they have these these policy rules of thumbs uh most of them derive from this taylor rule where you've got this inflation gap pi and the output gap y and they determine the federal funds rate the interest rate r um and uh you know some of them have historical terms like the integral and so forth and if you break down many of these policy rules they're actually all fit into the same terms that a pid controller would have in terms of forward-looking and backward-looking adjustments so let's talk about what rye is as a reflex index so the to understand where i is you need to understand these these concepts so the concept of the redemption price uh it's different than in something like maker because in maker the redemption price is sort of always one die equals one dollar uh that's the the meaning of it having a peg uh in this case uh the value the redemption prices uh the the value of right internal to the system used for the collateralization ratio same as maker but it's in dynamic equilibrium with the market price so the redemption price can change over time and it gets set by the the redemption rate and so the redemption rate is the current rate of change of the redemption price and the redemption price doesn't really matter what what it starts at it can be sort of arbitrary so the the redemption rate feedback mechanism is what updates the redemption rate in response to uh differences between the redemption price and the market price in order to make those two reach equilibrium and keep the ultimately redemption uh the price of rye uh stable so here's the the two sort of loops so if the price of rai goes up people start buying rai then the redemption rate of rai goes negative which means the redemption price of rye starts to drop and so if you are a holder of rye at that point you are effectively getting a negative interest rate you are you are essentially paying to hold rye and so some of those holders might want to sell in order to avoid that negative interest rate and in which case rye would return to its its equilibrium and i say new here because uh when the redemption uh price starts to drop like it'll go the the it'll continue uh to change until the market price reaches it uh it won't go to what it originally was it'll it'll uh end up you know having drifted some from its original set point um and and the same happens in reverse if the ride price goes down then the redemption rate goes positive uh suddenly uh if i'm holding ry i'm being paid to hold right and if i'm borrowing rai then i'm i'm paying extra interest on my loan uh the redemption price starts to increase and so rye borrowers who don't want to face that interest buy back ride pay their loan and then rye returns to the equilibrium i got a message in the chat how do i check that oh cool um right so uh this is like what that looks like in practice so this is uh on the right and on the left this is the same uh chart the 2016 data science that maker dow did to to try and simulate how the trfm as they called it target rate feedback mechanism would have worked the market price the terminology is a little bit different so on we renamed target uh price to redemption price and uh deflation rate to redemption rate but ultimately it's sort of the same you can see that this system introduces a shock between uh days five and fifteen it's on day five market price spikes uh and you can see it up here too and in response to that the interest rate uh drops a lot and uh it keeps going until the market price uh reaches equilibrium and uh once it does then the two sort of remain in equilibrium for another several days until the shock wears off and at which point the market price rebounds so the interest rate then rebounds in the opposite direction until it reaches equilibrium again and note that the final redemption price given that this redemption rate has sort of been between one and three it's positive this whole time it's slightly positive and so it is not pegged to anything it's it is actually increasing um so yeah the behavior of the reflex index so when you think about this in terms of a financial product uh what do you expect it to do well you expect it to resist sudden price movements uh and it's essentially using these interest rate based incentives to counter that and create its own little gravity well um but on the long term the the price should follow the demand for each leverage with the assumption being that the sorry demand for eat leverage with the assumption being that youth leverage is also correlated to eth price so on the long term we expect this to sort of follow the eve price um and the mechanism for that is when people are leveraging if they they leverage ethrize so they borrow rye they sell the rye they buy more eat they borrow right you know keep doing that and this pushes up the price of rye but then over the longer term this pushes the redemption rate uh i'm sorry pushes the price up right down which pushes the redemption rate positive and over time increases the redemption price so you could see that um equilibrium uh will shift over time and then the other thing is we want to optimize rye in terms of shock recovery time how long does it take the system to reach stability again minimize overshooting and add an amount of manipulation resistance and so that's like how expensive is it to somebody to introduce instability into the system by for example you know messing with the controller buying a lot pushing the controller one way and then selling and moving it the opposite way and and essentially doing oracle manipulation uh and another goal is of course to maximize for rye liquidity which would reduce slippage to make it cheaper to enter and exit into uh rye as a system so our progress thus far we've been pretty busy we converted multi-collateral dye to english so it doesn't have weird names anymore built all the smart contracts including the control system built the subgraph the keeper liquidation bots typescript libraries developer docs did the historical data analysis on maker we calibrated our cad cut sims and we are now preparing for our mainnet demo this is what it looks like to calibrate our uh simulations with our solidity codes at the top you can see the python uh at the bottom you can see our solidity and they look pretty much the same so the the left you can see is uh the y-axis is the target um price and on the right you can see that's a interest rate that's the redemption rate that's being set this is important because if if they didn't match then our simulations would produce parameters that were not super helpful in production on unreal ethereum we've also made schematics like this in building this if this kind of thing turns you on please proceed to our documentation i'd love to work with you um proto-rye so we are launching our first mainnet demo in four weeks there's going to be a 10 200 pry remit limit uh it's about two bucks so like 20 20 000 ish total um it's just meant to be a game to see how people interact with it we try to leverage long you thrive and try to mess with the controller and and test out our system so if that sounds fun to you please come and join that uh and if you're a control freak uh please uh join us and help us taking blockchain control theory from zero to one we're proud to be working with block science with michael zargham who made cadcad or sim software uh and we are interested in working with anybody else who's who's interested in this as well so yep that's all i got amazing um thank you so much i mean that was a great um it was a great lesson not just for rise but also a good refresher on control theory uh that definitely takes me back to some of my college courses um there are a handful of questions that have come up and and uh what i'll do is i'll kind of ask you a couple of them here uh but uh just to kind of keep everything moving along on time i'll encourage you to kind of join the chat after this if you have time and just answer those people directly but uh the kind of the first question that i have is actually for me and that is um there's a lot of reinforcement uh and and kind of uh information you need to do and kind of improve on for the control systems to work so i'm actually just curious are there any limitations on what you can do on smart contracts with respect to designing a perfect control system or feedback loop here uh and like is there anything that's not possible uh or like is everything just fine and works really well in kind of how you're envisioning right to be yeah that's a good question um so we're fortunate that most of the even like more sophisticated control systems are mathematically efficient uh so they're relatively easy to build on smart contracts uh there is like you know gas thinking to do because you have to think about how often you update the system and how expensive it is too often to update it often and uh if you can for example you know update it less often and and but there's always a trade-off when you're when you're doing that right so awesome um and uh the second question we have from our chat and i'll just say this verbatim um what is the incentive to redeem rye when the redemption rates go negative uh shouldn't they just wait until it rebalances on its own or when they are ready to redeem uh what is the incentive to redeem right uh so if if the rate's going negative so that means there's a lot uh the price of ride goes up so the rate goes negative um i mean uh the like part part of it is arbitrage i mean you know why do people redeem die when the price is up uh part of it is that uh you if if the price is currently like i don't know let's say 1.1 relative to its starting position uh and the interest rate is negative 10 then you know you know that uh it's going down so you want to get ahead of that interest rate you know if if you that doesn't bother you then you can hold anybody who that bothers can take that action no i hope uh this clarifies that question for the person who asked us on the chat um so thank you so much i mean uh we uh we have posted i mean slides on our chat so if anybody's interested in looking at the deck uh you can just click the link there and uh for any other questions that you have for me and uh we'll relay them to him directly or he'll join the chat and answer them directly to you so uh thanks so much and thanks again for your time thanks for having me that i'd like to in
