[Music] this summer is about untrained activity [Music] you are able to Showcase your passion to many people this is one of my favorite moments [Music] good evening everybody my name is Carson well one of the co-founders of being Global and welcome to East Global Paris all this ecosystem with the actors we have here are working hard to make Paris the spot of global Innovation especially foreign good afternoon everybody are you all excited yeah my name is car tech one of the co-founders of Eve Global and let's get the show going this is already our biggest event in Europe yeah I am tired too but we're gonna have to clap a lot today 1400 attendees were here this entire weekend 965 Hackers from 67 different countries and 22 percent of them were brand new to web 3. so many people came from all across the world and of course so many cities from Europe and as you all know this is a hackathon which means the next hour and a half is about focusing on all of our Builders and showcasing everything that came out of this weekend so let's get started this hackathon blew my mind 965 hackers submitted 321 different projects this is the most we've ever seen in a long time and we spent all of morning going through all these amazing projects I want to thank first of all all of our judges who took the time to talk to so many of these teams so please join me in thanking Frankie Espy Shin Patrick Hari Scott bernit Ben summary Liam Alex Rahul Maria Adrian David Tebow Linda Ahmed sure simao Yuri Yoni friend John and Guillaume and on top of that we have 4 41 of our amazing partners are going to be talking about all the prizes that they're giving out so stay tuned until we get to all of those prizes so with that I want to thank all of our amazing Partners too and you know the drill the faster you collapse the faster I'll talk so LaPlace causes Shane falcoin maker mirror Mass Mina protocol a polygon won't coin wallet Connect Air sack apcoin by economy cartesi cello chain link EAS ethereum Foundation hyperlane until Mass near neon evm save sis most Dark Knight the graph Uma unlimited xmtpz guessing ZK Bob Zeta chain Aragon XLR dfns flashbot slit now it's now push protocol at quick node [Applause] all right let's get to these 321 projects we spend all of the last five hours going through so many of these actually all of them that's our partners that's our judges all of you you were running up and down and from all of that this is what happened we picked 13 teams that are going to come on here as our finalists we're going to bring these teams on they're going to demo live what they built and after that we're going to get to all the prizes so without further Ado actually let's join me in welcoming our 13 finalist team so we have Bubble Zeke and microphone GL swap Twitter campaign typhoon cash ax kinetics Harpo state garden sniper deposited Bob to solver voice sends Community bound and on-chain messaging aggregator all these teams are going to come on one by one we're going to do 13 quick demos and then we'll talk about all the prizes but before we go into our uh first demo when I just take a few seconds to talk about a couple of things first of all there are so many incredible projects I'm going to move out of the view so you can take a good photo 300 of the eight of these projects just because you were not one of those 13 finalists does not mean you were not good enough there are so many amazing things that were built all throughout this hackathon and I want to congratulate all of you for spending the weekend building something that you were excited about and shipping it and showing it to everybody else so they can also share that enjoyment please give yourselves a massive Round of Applause for building this and shipping everything in the last two days and for anybody watching online on the live stream or all of you you can check out everything else that came out of this by heading over to youth global.com showcase all 300 plus projects are listed there you can see all the details the demos including all of our finalists and you can catch up on all that directly online but before we get to the first demo a really really important note from from me this is a task on all of your dashboards please take two minutes whether it's on your phone right now when you go home tomorrow morning but hopefully soon so you actually remember a lot of stuff and just answer some of the basic questions we have about just rate how the food was how the Wi-Fi was how the projects were everything else I know some of you have really really valuable things that you brought us already on Discord we kind of collected that but it just helps us really make the next one even better so just take two minutes and just answer those six or seven questions your simple questions too and make our lives better so we can make the next one even better for the next thousand people and also we're going to be giving out a hoodie five of these for anybody who fills out no no no no no not anybody a raffle from everybody who fills out there's five randomly selected teams will people will get at the city so that's another incentive for us to put on but even without that I would really appreciate if you can just tell us how your experience was this weekend enough talking for me let's welcome our very first demo for today and that is team bubbles give them a big round of applause [Applause] okay cool hey guys I am Greg and I'm limonia and this weekend we built bubbles voice chats for your favorite on-chain communities and importantly that's Unchained without the dash so I'm going to go ahead and sign in with ethereum sign a message proving that I am who I am um and right away I'm going to press explore live bubbles so here you can see live right now all of the bubbles and I guess just in context um this is basically think a clubhouse or a Twitter spaces but all based on ethereum available from any device so no longer do you need an IOS app um to join a Twitter space and have decent audio um cool so the first thing I'm going to do is join a space that is token gated to something I don't have access to and that is these lemons unfortunately I don't have any little lemon friends but yeah I have plenty of them again I mean um and cool so you can see that these are all token gated by erc20s any type of nft and also a sismo group which we'll get into later but first i'm going to create a new bubble so this is going to be called launch um and you can see the getting options here are a bunch of them so you can do it open you can require a far Caster account you can require different types of nfts and so on for example if I were to choose an erc20 I can type a contract address and the amount of tokens that you'd need to listen to this level and participate right but for now just for demo sake I'm going to go open here I have a place to enter a forecaster cast and forecaster is a decentralized social protocol and you can see in a second how it's going to aggregate all the posts from there into my bubble so I'm going to press create and go live and here we go I have a new bubble called launch with the Creator being Greg scroll.eath my on chain identity right and on the right you see that I have this forecaster these replies on firecaster I'm going to join this space and you can see that now I'm basically speaking and lemonade is going to try and join as well and say something but in the meantime if I go and reply on firecaster we're presenting right now then in a second it should show up here and I'm going to turn up my volume hey Greg do you hear me we're in a bubble man oh my God uh [Applause] there we go so yeah you can see I can mute I can unmute I'm not going to do that to cause a bunch of echo right now but if I leave the space and I go back here then I have an open Bubble that anybody could join and chat away but one other thing I'm going to show that I think is a little bit cooler than some of the other token getting stuff is sismo so um token getting we use airstock to check all the tokens that you might have and we use sismo if you want to do that in a privacy preserving way so if I go to ens owners and I want to prove that I have an ens name but don't reveal which one it is or who I am I can sign in with sismo to do exactly that so I'm going to generate a proof saying that I own an ens domain this should send me back the website and in a second give me access to this space there we go so there's nobody in it but you can see I can join and similar to before anybody else who does this proof would be able to join and chat with all the same functionality as before and just to show you that the forecaster thing hopefully worked I'm going to go back to launch and you can see my other post right here representing live right now at youth global.tv so we had a great time this weekend bubbles is live the bubbles.xyz feel free to use it we have some things that we want to improve obviously but please give us feedback we had a great time and excited for the next global thank you awesome thank you that was our first ever demo for each Global Paris 2023 next up is ZK microphone please welcome them on stage hi everyone we have a hardware hike for you this is ZK microphone but before we tell you about that I'm going to invite our wonderful host back on stage to say a few words Karthik if you could come in and try out our microphone sure events uh even was amazing so let me formally introduce ourselves we are ZK microphone we are fighting deep fakes with Hyper optimize ZK we're a team from Homedale deep fakes are a state level threat to society which can threaten sort of the Fabrics of society and perhaps bring and democracy through misinformation campaigns and mass manipulation the naive solution to depex is a hardware signature that can cryptographically sign the audio to ensure Hardware verification uh using a secret key stored in the secure Enclave however this is a very naive solution because you it is extremely rigid and you cannot remove any background noise which could identify the audio you can't be Bell any confidential information nor can you compress the audio yes so that brings us to our solution so here you can see the two sides of our approach on the left we have our hardware and on the right we have the software on the left we have essentially a proof of non-deep fake which is essentially a secure Enclave that signs the content of our audio and then on the right we have our smirk which will actually attest and verify that we are doing a transformation is what we call it on the audio to essentially in our case do a bleeping of the audio we store the results of this transformation on ipfs which allows it to be decentralized anyone can access it and actually get the content of these messages and even further these are also available on our smart contracts which are then allow us to provide for composable Solutions and here we have a little bit more on our ipfs solution as well and now we'll go into a demo okay so the audio file that we uh just recorded at the start we're gonna uh take that from Telegram which manuj has just sent over and I'm gonna copy it over to our project and go back to our UI where uh we're going to select the file just make sure it's the right one nine one a open that and let's give it a play what do I think about the event uh it was amazing okay [Applause] so I'm gonna have to guess a bit whether uh where to live here I think it was around the last one yeah it was amazing yeah so let's let's try and bleed this out so uh We've covered where we want to bleep let's click bleep and what this is doing is it's actually transforming the audio file um through a set of verified Transformations as part of our zero knowledge circuit and uh that's complete so now we can upload the edited audio file to ipfs and um we can verify the proof uh on chain through our smart contract which will update um the mapping in the smart contract so we can see here that it submitted a transaction can view it on the Explorer it's pending right now uh will be concerned pretty soon and you can also see here like the list of all the files in ipfs um so yeah like uh onto I think onto ATO now yeah we can show the blipped audio ah yeah let's show you the the bleat audio to make sure that it worked yes today I think what do you think about the event uh there you go so it's not quite a bleep but it's uh it silences out the audio um at that point foreign I guess now I can take over like from a technical point of view one of the main issues is that uh we want to verify a lot of Transformations and if you just want to do it naively the circuit for like a 10 second video would take like 15 minutes well here you might have noticed that it just took like a few seconds if you so like the logs weren't that great but you might have like seen uh that we actually proved the whole thing so the way we did it is we give away a bit from the hash function and then we decide to just use a polynomial hash because like this enables you to do all the verification in hash space so essentially you can basically like uh you can do videos which are like I would say a few minutes in around five seconds so that's pretty nice and one of the nice things that we did was that uh essentially we just operate on buy data so you can use a similar technique in uh basically like for any like streams of data uh so like here we just given a example for how you do it for a microphone but you might as well just do it for a video that's like relatively short and you can basically have a snark that you have yeah I mean we have done some transformation on the audio yeah and so it has a lot of future directions that it can go to prevent deep fakes and this is already an act of area of research with video and photos um this is our Twitter and oh wait almost there oh we lost the thank you slide but yeah we would like to send our thanks to uh Honda quantstaff generative Ventures foresight X and the blockchain society thank you so much for listening congrats looks like I finally got on censored on chain um supposed to be the demo don't worry was planned I don't like to swear on stage unless it was planned demo number three GL swaps please give them a big round of applause [Applause] hey guys how's it going my name is Jamin and we were building GL swaps I have to thank the team firstly Lily and Andrew are currently traveling it's been a great hack and we've got a chance to work on geoswaps um so what is GL swaps Grandma leverage swaps um in defy we've seen spot markets take off this is the uni swap interface which you're probably pretty familiar with if you're in crypto and have been on chain and the real Market that hasn't been tapped into is derivatives in 2022 44 trillion was traded in centralized exchanges on derivative markets that's 75 of all trading volumes spot only counted for a quarter of that in defy it's just 1.5 percent are in derivative markets so this is completely set to grow and it's not for a lack of tooling as we have great platforms offering delivery derivatives now I'm going to show you an example of how we can trade from uni swap using Leverage so here we've got a swap lined up from ethereum to usdc we can swap you know 0.01 it's around 20 worth and this functions just as you're familiar with Master Mouse pops up and we can confirm spot we're also an arbitrum at the moment nice and simple you guys have seen that before so uh now what if we want to take this usdc that we've got on chain and we really want to get maximum value we can see that you know over here we enter uh usdc requirement and you know you might be thinking what is this third box here that you've never seen well um we're on the current uni swap app this is the actual uni swap interface itself and what we've plugged in is a browser extension which allows you to get leverage on your trades so now we can execute a 10x leverage trade getting you 100 on this swap so let's long this token I'm actually going to take you to GMX which is a derivatives platform which will allow us to see how this trade can go through you can see here that um BTC long has just gone through with a hundred dollars so you've actually traded on a perpetuous platform from unisoft itself we'll just wait for that to go through it will register on the front end over here as well so you can see that the size here is a hundred dollars and you only spend ten dollars doing that that's maximum capital efficiency and by the way we can juice up the leverage all the way to 50 times and go short on tokens as well so that's uh GL swaps um we kind of see uni swap as being the super app for on anything on chain really but they haven't tapped into D5 derivatives I think 45 of all volume goes through unisots front end which is actually routed through uni Swap and this is pretty crazy um you know there's so many other different markets you can tap into there's tons of D5 derivatives being built out there and this is just the start we want to make crypto so easy to use you hear the common expression my mom should be able to onboard and we're not quite ready for that but how about your grandma are your grandma's going to be playing around with leverage she's gonna be longing and shorting tokens in no time with GL swaps so thank you very much again thanks to the team as well thanks to the sozu house I really appreciate the opportunity [Applause] amazing thank you I I want to see grandmas doing leverage trading that's that's going to be a fun one I'm sure that's going to not sound weird when I say it again in my head but next up is our demo number four and that is Project Twitter campaign please give them a big round of applause [Applause] all right hey everyone my name is Matthew unitsen and I'm here to present you Twitter campaigns so what is Twitter campaigns and why did I build it essentially I wanted to make a dab that anybody could use someone who doesn't have a wallet doesn't even know what crypto is this is essentially like their Gateway into crypto so what I'm first going to do is log in and you can see the flow essentially you want to continue with Twitter I did not need to enter like an ethereum address or connect metamask I was already signed into Twitter so that's why I like kind of went through really quick all right now I'm authenticated so what exactly happened uh what happened was I used safe auth kit to verify my Twitter and essentially now I have you know a custom account abstracted wallet address my Twitter account the Twitter email associated with it my handle and all that got verified with a handshake in the back end that signed a message with an admin wallet back there so what can you do so first you know you can fund it with transact it doesn't really work on staging so we're not going to do that but you know you can continue with this flow to fund it and to off-ramp uh yeah exit that so to create a campaign you know you have to input Fields like the name the description a hashtag but you know we could also use AI to pre-fill for us so then we'll just ask open AI to do that and then as you can see it just created us a campaign you know it I guess I didn't really understand it in my prompt but there you go so you know you can fill in the funds you want to provide and there's a few requirements for you to be eligible to you know receive funds from a campaign so as a user you want to basically get likes and retweets on your Tweet and then this way you can earn tokens so we have a few example campaigns here and I'll show you how these work so for example we'll take the crypto Revolution takes over Paris campaign and you can see the Tweet must contain the hashtag eat globalparis so we'll go we'll say I love youth global hashtag Global Paris I'm just going to confirm that's how it's spelled all right so we send that to eat out and to claim your reward basically you know you take your Twitter ID for that tweet throw it in here click claim reward and this is a gasless transaction so again I didn't have to interact with any wallets as as you can see there's no rewards for the Tweet because there have hasn't been any likes or retweets on it so let's go ahead and give it a like ourselves to give ourselves money click claim again hopefully Twitter doesn't block my request there you go so I just got .0006 Matic and as you can see that's what one like is worth if you got you know multiple likes multiple retweets how that works is the Smart contract records what likes it previously awarded so you know if you farm some likes and let's say you have 10 and I already claimed one that means the difference will be nine for the next claim um and yeah and here you can see there's like a log of these rewards I got paid out and personally my favorite part about this is again as a user claiming rewards you don't even need a wallet and you can see they're social proof so as you create a campaign uh the smart contract gets your Twitter ID and it stores that and then once it's displayed it takes your username and shows that to everybody as well um and yeah that's it it's pretty simple but I think it's very effective in creating campaigns and where you can see this going in the future is essentially you know instead of just having likes and retweets you can have you know verified accounts only make it modular say you have to have a certain lifespan on your account and really put in whatever you want and the benefit is you know anybody can create a campaign yeah that's about it awesome thank you all right next up is demo number five typhoon cash X please welcome them on stage [Applause] good evening everybody so we would like you to introduce you to Typhoon cash X a bridge that allows you to transfer tokens from a chain to another in an anonymous fashion we like to think that we are an additional layer an additional Dimension to the mythical tornado cache protocol adding not only burying the link between departure and arrival address but also burying the link between departure and arrival chain so how do we work when a user wants to deposit funds on our Bridge you have to call a deposit function that will put its funds in the contract and there we will be holding instead of the contract a registry in order to put the user's address inside a sismo group so we will be using system groups in order to generate proofs proofs of membership of the bridge for future withdrawal when the user would want to redeem the funds on the other chain the user will need to submit a proof which will be generated off Chain by sismo along with a signature composed of well agreed uh gas amount to be spent and delegated to the relayer as well as the output address this proof once verified uh our exit smart contract will check that the user has not tried to withdraw funds already somewhere else this is a fundamental problem handling double spending with a single proof the user might want to withdraw the funds twice on two different chains so you have to handle this and so we have how do we handle this we check if the user's ID taken from the sismo group is already stored in the registry if it is it is reverted if it is not well it is added and then the user's ID is added to a pending registry so then once it's added on a registry on the source chain uh broadcast is sent to every chain uh with this user ID and it checks on every chain if the user is already withdrawn or I mean it shouldn't be able to happen but it checks if it's in the pending like waiting list if it's in the waiting list then we have a conflict to solve this conflict we need to compare the two chain IDs and we choose the lowest one to validate the transaction and cancel it on the other one so we have a deterministic way to choose only one chain even if there are three four five broadcasts at the same time and since we have a delay between redeem and withdraw which is twice the maximum estimated amount of our Bridge which is hyperlane to reach out to Every Chain we can't be in a state where a user has already withdrawn in some chain and has tried to withdrawn in another chain so then um using this technique we avoid double spending and we get an anonymous um sorry Anonymous pathway through the trains without revealing any address of destination [Applause] awesome thank you so much all right next up is kinetics like clients please welcome them on stage [Applause] hello everyone my name is diagram and I'm a co-founder of kinetics Network Miss Mike today we would like to talk about the white lions today we would like to make a presentation about like lines uh why we do it because when we when we want to move liquidity between L1 and L2 uh networks from from here for example or other networks usually we ask a bridge to do this and all the bridges they have a similar structure uh first we need to pay for each transaction to validate the proof because pull make a decision second we need to wait for this and uh this is not a really useful if we use for example like a chain with a decks and Bridge and also we need to trust like a group of validators uh uh to to prove this transaction and provide the proof of event between different chains but if we use a light clients we can use a batching system so basically so we can upload a bunch of transaction and approve them in one order so for example we have a any number of transactions and we have a different message protocols so we just like a pay for for one audio and we need to receive at least like two or three uh State the same between different message protocols to to to verify what's happening so let me show me exactly how we implemented in our protocol and how how we can use it in a like a real world situation for example as you can see here we can choose different tokens for example like we have Bitcoin and usdc between different networks and as we can see the gas is optimized very very high so it's like a two dollars will be cost transaction to move liquidity between different Networks and right now Mike he will explain it more detailed how this happened foreign uh hash Oracle aggregator so we implemented a couple of uh a couple of adapters uh connecting different blockchain question messaging protocols uh so what we do we just take a block hash function that returns recent blocks and transfer this hash to a couple of these protocols and this protocol should return the same answer that should be valid and stored on the another Network on our light client so that's how it works and uh if but we go this is in the basic view how it works uh but we go further and optimize it uh by implementing uh Merkel mountain or range structure so uh this idea was in this idea we were inspired by Axiom project it's it's like uh batching of black hashes so we don't need to store every black hash on storage we just need to make checkpoints and on top of these checkpoints we build metal trees and store these roots as a leaf of the whole Miracle mountain range and then we just take the peaks of this uh structure and store only them on the storage so it's a very very efficient way to store the data and it's a really exciting possibilities for multi and cross chain applications as we can see it on our example so soap is complete and if you open the transaction we can see that it takes just 66 K of gas units and this is a cross chain transaction it's a cross chain operation and it's very cheap in terms of the this context yeah and as you can see it's possible to move liquidity between different networks without like any kind of chain Bridges and the excess so there's uh one transaction and this transaction go through or always reward that's all yeah amazing well thank you so much and a lot of people now may not realize this thing but getting like lines to work efficiently on ethereum is a really big and really interesting problem it solves so many things that we actually need to get mainstream adoption ready because you don't have to think about running a validator and you can actually do a lot of things client side so this was an amazing amazing proof of concept all right next up is harpose please welcome them on stage [Applause] good afternoon everyone hi we are very humbled and honored to introduce to you help us is a platform allowing users to connect to network and to chat together without compromising any anonymity so we connect via sismo and our our use case for this demo will be I am Bob I have some money and I'm looking for an influenza with the same goes as I have GPS so I'm generating here my proof that I hold some USD token and let's say maximum because I have some continue we generate the proof a wallet is automatically created once we log in Via via sismo and this wallet will be protected by passphrase so only the user will have to will have access to it then here I can see my active conversations but you can go to search and set some criterias I'm looking for an influencer so let's say that I'm looking for someone that has a minimum followers of one thousand and let's see what's going on here so what are the holders that have one thousand followers here I can see all of their profiles let's see the first one that says these famous on Twitter this person decided to keep his anonymity I can see what language he speaks what he likes what he do what he does and if I decide so I can send him a message and the message feature is powered by xmtp and I can say to that guy hello allows us to Aggregate and verify web 3 and web 2 information some Wallet information some social information if I'm looking for a developer for for example I can have information that are proven from his GitHub account if I'm looking for an influencer for me his Twitter account if I'm looking for a designer I can connect to Italian player and have some proof that he has fulfilled some designing designer missions and we can then from we can then connect with people keeping full anonymity thank you so yes so once uh Bob um uh as as found like an influencer uh what's what is nice here is that we are like is one one 100 percent sure that's that the guy that just found is an influential thanks to his music a proof because with with the system that evolved uh like when uh when this when this influencers are connected to the to the platform uh like yeah yeah also to connect uh with like a zero oats uh to again uh so like the the so like his icon was connected to the Data Vault and as well as his followers so what is nice here is that Bob now is sure that uh that is that she's really talking to someone with 1000 followers and if it works for one thousand followers it can also work for 5000 uh five uh yeah 500 000 followers or like 1 million so this is a one of the power of the this music approve yeah and so then then like uh so our friend Bob was somebody and uh as like a philanthropist project once once he has found uh the influencer he wants to talk to then he can uh he is so to promote his project then he needs to to build a project so so he can search a Dev a Dev as a my colleague Arnold here just showed up before uh some so now keeping the full anonymity these two persons can start chatting start building together and uh thank you for your attention that was harpos amazing composable communities congrats all right next up is state garden please give them a big round of applause [Applause] today right before star would like to ask you who is doing any sort of stake in here raise your hand okay okay okay so this is gonna be really introduce you uh and interesting for you guys so let us introduce State guarding okay uh what is stakeholden wait I need to take a deep breath of this let's take out there is a self-made liquid token portfolio practical uh we do you can take an amount of ease and get a dailies taking rewards as you do on when you do not mistaking uh but before we get into details let's go to what is uh liquid staking in particular so liquid staking allows you it's usually a protocol that allows you to stay your it in a way you get a token back that you can use across any D5 platform or lay to or whatever you want to so you can lock your eth on the Node operators but you still have the liquidity through these wrap tokens so one of the there are many protocols to do liquid is taking like rocket pole Lido and many others but the thing is you can go and purchase their staking liquids taking token but then you will be having 100 risk on their infrastructure only then there is a second layer of protocols that do indexes of these protocols where you can have a basket of them to diversify the risk the other problem with these kind of protocols is the the diversification is on the company is third party managed you cannot choose the weights of each individual liquid sticking token so the solution we build with state garden is lets you choose your own risk and your own diversification for your personal needs so essentially what the our protocol and app lets you do is to create a tokenized vault that will have will contain 100 collateralized liquids token liquid tokens or assets so essentially you through this UI you choose a token symbol and choose the weights you're gonna have on each individual token depending on your needs or or your own research to what's best for you so you still have the diversification of an index but you can manage it yourself uh another of the cool features of these protocols is because it's permissionless if I create a vault and my friends one likes my research and my risk management portfolio they can also mint my uh within my Vault and they don't have to ask me for any permissions or there is no commissions within this and I'm the one managing it and it rebalances the whole token the whole talk old sorry portfolio uh so well then join us on cultivate your financial growth in the ever expanding world of decentralized Finance so we're gonna do a live demo now of overdap let me I'm gonna hand you to Leo that's gonna go through you can use it yeah so let's connect our wallet first we are using the metamask SDK oh sorry yeah just a second so yeah there you go we connect using metanas SDK we are using under the hood because this can only work on ethereum because of the ethereum liquid is taking tokens are there so we're using a tenderly Fork to run this demo uh but yeah so here we we have a list of the portfolios that exist um there is info like the percentage uh variable variable API totally so we need right now let's create a portfolio let's call it in this case at the bottom you can only choose two tokens but that's for the purpose of the yeah that should be 50. yeah so for the purpose of the hackathon but the pro the underlying protocol allows you to choose an amount of of tokens so that's creating a transaction yeah cool I think it's yeah yeah so here is the created portfolio so that's our own vaults that's deployed on our ethereum fork and now we can what we can do is we can send if directly to to that uh token and what's going to happen under the hood is leveraging the one inch router a aggregator router it's gonna take a risk and look at the diversification you choose and swap each a part of those if you're sending to each of these liquid second tokens in the same transactions it's going to live through them and do every single Swap that's needed and once that's done those tokens are deposited into the Vault and you get minted a new token that the present the representation of your stake in that bot and you can always either you can always take that token and burn it and it will send you the underlying assets back to your wallet if you want to cancel your position there but as long as you have that token you'll always be able to rebalance it like when let's say you change your mind and you were like 10 in legal and and 90 in rocket pool you want to do more like 50 50 you go to the UI you choose 50 50 you click rebalance and that's going to do all the necessary swaps to within the Vault swap every collateral to each other to take it to the to the percentage you you want and that's it thank you thank you so much [Music] Global for organizing such an amazing event thanks to the partners they thank you for listening and thanks for the team you're amazing an amazing project a basket of steak teeth all right next up we only got a few more demos to go so please welcome Cipher deposit on stage [Applause] hello everyone my name is Adam and I'm really glad to introduce you to Cipher deposit so right now in our ecosystem we have put aside privacy for too long and I want to emphasize this problem with Alice Alice is an exchange users and she wants to withdraw her coins without compromising her ADHD so she has two options the first option is to keep her assets on the stacks and risking exchange hacks downtime or withdrawal withdrawal restrictions and option two is to withdraw her assets on her personal address exposing her personal information and transaction history a time for deposit we offer a third option with private crypto withdrawals Anonymous transactions private RPC endpoints how does it work so let's say we have others Alice uses our platform and she generates a burner address from that burner address she's going to go on the sex she's going to put the burner address and the funds are going to be transferred from the sex to the burner address then our platform manages to transfer the funds from the burner address to the zika address that was created through the the platform and then this can go on zkbub and withdraw her assets safely without compromising her privacy so this is the technology stack we use this is our team members and time for demo hi I'm NATO and I'm a simple user exchange exchange user and I want to withdraw my phones safely and privately so first of all I'm going to create a border account which is encrypted on my computer so I'm gonna set the passwords whatever it is and click on generates now I got a private key which is stored and encrypted in my in my computer and the new a new address that I'm going to use to restore my phones so for now I'm going to use metamask but it is exactly the same way as you would do it with an exchange so I'm going to sign in one no no to God is no we just have to wait for the transaction to succeed but in the meantime I can generate my easy Kebab address so yeah I'm logged in I can generate the address which will be used for the direct deposits and the mnemonic that I use just later this transaction is confirmed so now I can direct deposits we just have to wait a few seconds for the transaction to succeed and basically we are not using any RPC we are using a private one based on upper I don't know if you know this solution but it allows you kind of lecture to stay private anyway I got the transaction hash so now I can go only scan and look for the transactions I can see that the deposit has been done and it's a direct deposit so we're all good now I'm going to copy the mnemonic from the kebab and retrieve my funds on their website accounts I have physical account and a secret phrase I can just paste it here and restore my accounts we just have to wait for a few seconds and I got something in my story it worked thank you we really want to put privacy at the core of our ecosystem we hope we can help with that thank you very much for listening that was an awesome live demo congrats all right without further Ado please welcome our 10th finalists for this weekend Bob the solver the solver hi guys uh this is hot nice to meet you thank you for being here so I'm yeah basically Bob the solver which is basically an infrastructure for intent based transaction uh we leverage account abstraction uh the demo can take a little time so I'll just and this is a demo that's running this infrastructure it is a UI chat based UI but I'll just execute it for now and then we can come back to this later on uh so how many of you know what intents are it's a buzzword that's kind of going around right now okay a few so so what are intents intents are basically desired outcomes that you want like these are just what's for example you want to buy an nft on polygon uh while transactions the current Paradigm through which we interact with blockchain is how exact actions that need to be performed to uh execute and intent for example let's say you want to buy and Paul an nft on polygon but you have assets on ethereum you might have to do a swap then a bridge then a swab and then you buy you have to construct all of these four transactions as a user now constructing transactions as a user can be complicated you need to know about all protocols you need to know about wallet management uh you need to understand what transactions how transactions happen and even if you do so uh you might get front run or attack Mev attack so it's all in all it's like time taking and frustrating what is the solution the solution here is that the Outsource the transaction creation process and enable transaction execution through account and account obstruction wallet so you still have control of the assets but you are kind of delegating the difficult part uh so what is Bob Bob is an intent solver you have built-in solver which which basically picks up intents generates transactions through them and then execute it executes it uh so with this we get a paradigm where we get better ux and efficiency uh okay it's still loading uh so what what's basically happening in the demo here is uh based on this intent we are creating a set of transactions that would be required to implement uh this particular uh this particular intent uh let's move on till then uh okay so we are also leveraging uh an account obstruction wallet called banana SDK uh we are leveraging it for transaction bundling gasless and gasless payments when it's required on a different chain so as of now we are showing you an example of nft but then it could also be like swapping or a swap combination of bridge and swap a combination of bridge and stake and whatnot okay we have this uh we have the authentication from that like this is the transaction that we'll have to be doing and this will be the cost so as soon as I authenticate it uh it will ask me for my Touch ID on this laptop it would have been face ID if it if it was my phone uh and that's for a second factor of authentication again powered by account obstruction and I think okay it does that sometimes so we should probably have yeah the transaction is successful and then we should probably see the transaction on polygon scan in some time but but I'll move on so but like how does this work like how what's what's basically Happening Here uh we take the intent uh we have an MN classifier which is a basically an LNM which is fine-tuned on crypto data and then from this model we generate the exact steps that are required to execute a transaction we then pass it through an optimization layer where we basically check like what kind of how can we make this transaction more efficient uh which protocols to use what not to use and after that we basically build the transactions and once the transactions are built we do a small simulation where we basically check that okay if these are the three transactions that are the output is it meeting that intent or not if not it will go back uh llm can do these things so yeah uh then we have the uh exact transactions which then goes to an account obstruction wallet the transaction gets bundled uh paymaster comes into picture when required and then the transaction is executed so all of this is being powered by uh banana SDK uh I think we should I think the transaction was already successful so let's just uh see if it's there yeah okay so it was a ERC 721 transaction and we see that there was a transaction that that was like one minute ago so pretty much accurate yeah uh uh so what needs to improve from here so uh here we have very high trust assumptions on this kind of uh system which might not be appropriate so we need a world where we'll have like multiple solvers and each of them will be validating each other's uh solving process and then that could tackle centralization we got to also make the like the mlbase classifier and the transaction Creator uh run locally so yeah that's pretty much it thank you for your time I hope you liked intense feel free to connect uh and talk about intents thank you awesome all right we're gonna need a few seconds to set this one up so we'll welcome the next team on stage and we couple more to goes please welcome voice sense [Applause] hello hi everyone hello hi my name is Nico and together with Daniel we are very delighted to present to you our project voice sense now in a nutshell you know sometimes when people ask us to go what's voice search how we describe it in two ways I would say well it's zero 4x3 but actually it's a Serial poetry with a special Mission actually we believe in inclusion for everyone especially for those who might have some difficulties uh getting aboard it to web3 in at the same Pace as the others for example due to some visual impairments or learning difficulties reading difficulties and this is one of the goals that voice sense tries to address on the other hand we also are achieving a goal of providing Universal accessibility to blockchain for people who might have limited commands of the English language uh how are we doing this let's get straight to the things out work so wait Nico do you want to say something to Our obligation oh yes I do send one ethereum to vitalik dot e t h okay I don't know what I said but then it will still relate to what's going on in the meantime let's have a look at the diagram uh basically have voice sense Works uh we submitting audio uh from the user on the front end so that's been recorded encode it and sent to a categy Smart contract that is running on the base layer now basically then we have our cartesia Dash specific layer our execution layer where we would receive the encoded over here and pass it on to a virtual machine where we'll run a machine learning computation to process the text pass all the fields and generate a transaction data which we will then in form of a QR code pass on to the user's front end now let's quickly have a look at what technology we're using so we're using verifiable automatic speech recognition module now a very important thing here is yes we're using something uh that is also available in web 2 but this is verifiable and this is like uh one of the main things that we're trying to achieve is to make voice recognition decentralized especially for those who are vulnerable and need extra trust with digitalization we're providing this for them uh optionally we have we can get speech translation we're recording audio into a flag format and in our nvp we're using virtual model library to connect to wallet connect and we're using capacity roles framework to make it all happen so here's a quick slide of the high level architecture so we have our front end we have the cartesia Roll-Ups with the input box this is the Smart contracts on chain and the categic Machine where we have all these machine learning implementation happening and that will then send this conscription to the front end once it is ready it's a very very quick demo just how it works is this is recorded and yeah so right now this is the last one exactly we have um the results of our the results of our competition you can see here on the screen um agent it has generated QR code with all the transaction data it did the transaction data needed to be read by a world provider so you could also verify that we first parsed if it can be seen we pass uh the ens and we also have the amount and everything we said we you can see here same one ethereum to vitalik.if so for the first time we're running a full machine learning module uh on a virtual machine running on chain thanks to categy thank you so much wow thank you very much [Applause] that was awesome all right two more demos to go so without further Ado let's welcome our second last finalist of the day Community bound [Applause] hello everyone we are Community bound and we have Sharaf on the front end uh shustoff he had to leave unfortunately but he wrote the smart contracts and myself on a product design so the problem that we were tackling was uh the way communities endows manage governance and reputation is still not very optimal for many cases if not to say completely broken so governance goes from either like one token one vote which is what most dollars do to one Member One vote for example like what the nouns Dao does and reputation goes mostly with badges which is only qualitative mostly it's very hard to make a quantitative comparison between members and this can be done with coordinate for example but it's a bit case specific and unscalable so we decided to create Community bound tokens this can be seen as reputation based governance or member engagement points or maybe even a community credit system or score and the contract that we wrote is actually quite simple um it's basically a modification of an erc20 token where you define a community based on for example a safe or nft collection and those addresses that hold the nft are part of the safe get whitelisted and um those are the only ones that can interact with this token so be it Own It mint it or transfer it as I mentioned like some use cases are around reputation and governance but I think like it opens the doors for uh some interesting coordination games or an obtain community credit score for example for under collateralized loans for trusted circle of people and also meritocratic permissions within uh safes or communities or daos and this is really only uh the 0.1 let's call it but we want to make community-bound tokens a lot more customizable so that different communities can choose the way they design their own in a way and what actions and permissions they attach to to the reputation and maybe also add some other Dynamics like negative reputation in the foremost of social slashing we of course want to make some like ux improvements and so on um and for this specific hackathon um we built a fork of safe with a social layer on top where you can see on the right like the members and the reputation and it works kind of like a feed where you can see like what people are proposing and you can approve it from there and we also added a sort of um reputation and actions Creator where you can decide like which actions receive how much reputation so like the proposer receives a certain amount of RP or reputation points uh and yeah well Shafi if you wanna do the demo yes yes yes thank you uh I'm gonna walk through our uh social layer right now so as you can see this is our uh safe and we found out like hey a safe in itself is a multic wallet that is incense a community you have multiple members in that uh wallet so we did here is uh we have a feed and the admin of this group chat is the multi-seek itself and the members are people in this chat and they can communicate with each other they can send Haze and you can say uh transaction proposals they have seen sent to each other so let me just show the flow when someone shows a proposal and what that should look like so I'm gonna send some tokens to someone uh let's say why not myself so what I'm going to do is I will propose some token transfer 0.01 and for now we just propose it I'll sign it off so you'll see two things happening now uh one is uh the proposal being signed and sent and the other one is me signing uh the message for push protocol where I say hey this proposes just be sent it will show up in the feed like hey we want to send this amount to this person uh check it out uh you will also find the proposal right now here so let's sign the proposal and let's get me some RP execute uh so right now execute I can submit this proposal can say hey this okay and also here a few things are happening under the hood one is obviously sending the proposal uh second thing that's happening here is I'm adding the members to the whitelist uh so all the members in the multisig and the last thing that's happening is uh here we say um what are we doing Danny um oh yeah geez excuse me I had like four hours of sleep the last two days so I lost it a bit uh so here we mint the token to the person that uh signed the transaction initiated it uh so yeah you can see transaction was successful that was done we go back to dashboard and you'll find our state of the art confetti and uh it will load uh the feed again it will load the members it will see that I had got some extra RP uh got some more reputation here and uh I think that's it thank you very much and a little shout out to shows Wells amazing wow all right our last finalist demo for the day please welcome munching messaging aggregator [Applause] okay good afternoon everybody my name is Kai uh this is Anthony Nico and Rafael and today we will be presenting our project send your all-in-one web3 messaging app so there has been quite a lot of talk about web free messaging lately with big names like coinbase integrating xmtp into their coinbase wallet and this is for good reason web3 messaging enables a lot of promising use cases you could reach out and recruit developers based on contracts they have deployed on chain you could contact your user base on chain you could contact a potential user base negotiate OTC deals Etc so there's a lot of exciting use cases for web free messaging but with that said I'd like to ask you a quick question how many of you actually use web free messaging protocols on a somewhat regular basis okay I think I've seen about three hands raised yeah that's it um interesting so it seems like the interest is pretty high but we feel like the adoption is kind of low and a little bit fragmented it seems like nobody really knows how to use every protocol and nobody knows the best approach to do so so um the problem is right now is like we have a lot of solutions and we created send for you guys to reach out on-chain users using every single protocol at the same time and all that combined with something we call a trust layer so that you have a way a unique way of getting your messages to be more heard and also never ever ever again miss a message on your wallet and on your app so we can then head to the demo of the app and we can start just by connecting our regular metamask wallet now we can go to the chat app and here we will see some recent conversations and by default we will load any messages you've received through native ethereum transactions with utf-8 encoded transaction data some people still communicate on the blockchain using this but if you go to your dashboard you can choose to add apps more messaging protocols we can add push and xmtp and we basically sign the the signatures here to basically create secure channels for these messaging protocols and we can then head back to our chat app which is just a very simple aggregated telegram style chat app that basically combines all of these protocols into one View so we have a filter at the top where we basically have every single protocol enabled right now but we can also filter to just show messages that we've sent on push or xmtp and we have little icons below the messages that indicate where that message has actually been broadcasted now we can also choose to broadcast a message ourselves and currently we have everything selected which means by default the bot the message will be broadcasted on every single layer every single protocol to maximize the chance of getting that message through to that individual um so we've already submitted uh behind the scenes we've broadcasted xmtp and push message but we're also signing an on-chain transaction with utf-8 encoded data with our message as well and uh currently these are popping up as individual transactions but we'll merge that together with the three icons indicating that they've been on all three uh layers okay so that's how you send a transaction if you want to reach out to someone we make it quite easy you just select the address and you can type a message hit send and it'll just broadcast with every layer but we also have a little recommendation feature where we want to recommend you potential contacts based on on-chain conditions we've chosen to use polyps for this and basically we can see here we have some poapps and it just recommends a few people that have the same pull-ups that we have so vitality.if has also attended um one Denver 2023 and there's another address which has attended another pop-up event we've been to so we have kind of a recommendation algorithm based on real proximity here to reach out to people and friends on chain so we can now move on to our security and Trust layer so here we have like the filter of the app that gonna allow us to filter any message to avoid any spam so if we get like any like user who just tried to spam us we can just add a verification if we have some ethereum if he had done some transaction on chain if you have any nfts and we're gonna try it to the app and here we're gonna see a list of message that that is already filtered so we just have Anthony who is here who has his eyes who has been scanned by the war coin and also we can see he have some internet money and we're gonna come back so how we do the verification so we have two things the first one is the war coin so you just get verified and we can prove that you are human you're gonna have the verification badge that you can have for free instead of paying eight Dollar on Twitter and here uh you can like also add the signing with sismo and you can prove that you have any asset so personally I don't have all my assets on my ens I don't have my bank or whatever so I can just add a proof a ZK proof to my send app to prove that I have some nft that I have some ethereum that I have done some transaction so I can have some Badge of verification so this is going to allow us to filter and avoid any like spam that is really annoying on this kind of messages thank you [Applause] congratulations all right well those

everybody's Source codes do not make your repos private we're gonna walk through everything and make sure that everybody follows the same rules and then we're going to finalize these prize and that's what you're going to get in your inbox and only after that is when you will be receiving them the timeline for all of that is August 11th so it'll happen by or before August 11th and this also applies to your stake returns and this also means that in case we end up finding somebody cheated or somebody gets disqualified and they were a pool price recipient things will change so these numbers may be different than what the what was just announced will notify all of this to all of you and all that information will also be directly reflected on your dashboards so stay tight and just watch out for that email for the next couple weeks so before we close everything off I want to get into making sure that we say thank you to everybody who made this event happen uh this is the moment where I want to close everything in the next five minutes because I am also equally tired and we'll follow the same rule the more you Clap the faster I go through the slides no yeah you gotta take a break no no all right well we want to say some thank you to everybody who made this event possible there's so many people that do all this behind the scenes but I want to start off with all of you hackers thank

least the rest of the youth Global team who you are not seeing here on stage because they're making sure everything goes well so Shari Andrew Maggie Nunu Fred Polly Rory Chloe Kevin hoochie Minnie and I'm always Emily Andrew and Jacob they're the people you want to really thank because they do actually all the work all right that was where the Clapping now we can take a break but we saw 13 teams here and we called them our finalists because we want to do things a little bit different than all the other events we see these events are not meant to be competition our goal is to make sure first web3 survives as a space and two that if we're excited about something everybody else should know about it too and that's why there's no first second third for any of our hackathons and when we call somebody a finalist it effectively means that they came in first so all 13 of those teams are actually our first place winners for this hackathon and as part of being a finalist in addition to any prize that they may have won from any of our partners if Global will be giving 500 uscc to every team member on top for being an amazing finalist so congratulations but that's not all there's a lot
