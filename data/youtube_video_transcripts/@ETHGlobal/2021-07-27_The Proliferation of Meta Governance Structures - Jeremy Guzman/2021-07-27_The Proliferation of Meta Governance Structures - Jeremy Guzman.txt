right so i'm jeremy guzman uh and i'm here to talk about uh proliferation of meta-governance structures so i'm really excited so quick introduction of who i am uh at the moment i'm a director of tech over at blockchain education network also the founder of mass adoption and the potential governance champion over at uniswap which is extremely exciting stuff that we're doing both um at the ben end and on uh the unisoft band something that i'll touch on later on in the in the presentation so ultimately the bigger question here right as we've been seeing throughout all d5 is this emerging conversation of governance meta governance how can the community be more involved or earn participation merits things of that nature and ultimately this goes down to the simple question of what is governance right so the the concept of governance has basically evolved to have like an array of definitions right and i think we could consolidate them into three pretty basic fundamental uh rules right so number one is organizational organizational frameworks um that rely on the use of mechanisms individuals or basically both to carry out a set of rules policies and processes right the second definition or second principle if you will is governance is the coordination of an organization's resources and actions to the use of contracts explicitly and implicitly something very interesting that we'll see as you transition into meta governance structures and lastly is the execution of all decisions and actions in transparent fashion right and is to ensure the accountability of all participants and stakeholders while while affirming organizational legitimacy um and overarching vision right so it's pretty basic uh pretty streamlined uh tenants right but now what begets of this is what it what determines or what dictates good governance right and that's something by and large that has been in the conversation or circulating conversation within the crypto space for quite some time now now good governance tends to abide by five precepts right one is legitimacy and voice basically what this means is that the organization um in question uh decides or should be should be reached and uh decisions should be reached excuse me by broad consensus right and this is done through open frictionless communication or opportunities of communication uh to further stimulate uh participation within uh by the stakeholders or other participants within the community uh two is the direction of the organization or direction of this said entity right so everyone needs to be all hands on deck right in terms of understanding the organization or entities culture um there's the social complexities that lie within um short and long-term goals etc right so decisions um have to be made with the overarching objectives in mind as well as the anticipated road map and future objectives in line are envisioned as well and thirdly is the performance right so efficiency and effectiveness in the name uh in the name of the organization is basically the name of the game right so participants and stakeholders they have to utilize any available resources uh to execute uh fruitful developments that will benefit the the protocol organizations at hand right and this trickles down into the fourth precept of the trade which is uh transparency right so there has to be an internal and external exhibition of accountability that's further reinforced by a democratic uh process whether that be in voting or that be a reaching consensus of some sort transparency by and large is uh the the key to efficient performance right or efficient understanding uh and then lastly is just to be fair right good governance is to be fair in which organizations need to be steered by a rule-based decisions not not of discretion discretion-based decision ultimately uh stimulates or provokes uh misunderstanding or misconstruement of certain um proposed concepts it really isn't um a good way to to organize or coordinate an organization right so this in turn produces equity and equality for all participants and stakeholders so as organizations grow we've seen that internal structures begin to consolidate or kind of constrict into these hierarchical shapes or structures right and participants begin reporting to a higher up of some sort what the president administrator ceo we've all seen in traditional um business or financial architectures right now the issue with these traditional structures is that as they grow or as they start becoming more hierarchical um the bottom base or the foundation begins to decay or starts to carry the brunt of majority of the work or the responsibility and by and large have limited growth opportunity um or organizational equity right so that's a big problem and it's it's no bueno right so let's go ahead and transition into the meta structure which i think capitalizes and if not improves this this archaic hierarchical approach to governance right so basically um as you can see here it's a participation for all kind of um ideation or idea right so meta governance aims to alleviate or potentially solve this problem of of a centralized governance uh concept right so unlike a traditional counterpart uh meta governance tends to adhere to like a flat structure right so as we saw before is a high article it's a top down or up down whichever way you want to really label it but meta governance kind of eliminates that structure and just levels it for a fair participatory uh capacity for everyone to be uh have an equal voice right so meta governance again um tends to adhere to this flat structure where stakeholders consist of uh governance uh token holders uh who actually have a genuine interest in the growth and uh improvement of the of the underlying uh protocol or product at hand right so since these uh tokens are available in the open market right uh gaining an equitable stake in is fairly feasible by and large right you could go on unit swap and go on any really decentralized exchange at this point and acquire a governance token and begin participating in in votes or the open conversation whatever that may be right so by holding these tokens right participants that have the ability to manage protocol resources in the form of let's say a treasury or and determine collective protocol parameters whether that be mining rewards or grants as we've seen in basically all protocols at this point interest rates the list goes on and on right so they have an active role in the community and this virtually eliminates again this high apertal structure and creates a community driven bottom up or top down structure where governance power is widely accumulated and further disseminated into the protocol that allows for further implementation integration and overall adoption of this set protocol right so with this being said um ben has created this this sort of governance structure and let's let's go ahead and dive into what we've been up to over on the bedside so uh again with this being said over at ben we've embraced this exponential growth of metal governance and we really think that it resonates with our vision and our 10-10 goal right we want to grow within 10 years and have over a set amount of members within our uh with an organization member-wise membership-wise and we think that this governance structure will be the next step towards towards getting to that goal so basically how this governance structure works is within each meta delegate community or committee which i'll get into in the next slide our members hold monthly to buy monthly calls to further scrutinize and maybe deliberate on forum discussions or proposals temperature checks consensus checks virtually anything that's going on in that said protocol and based on whatever decision is made or whatever uh topic of conversation really piques their interest uh the committee at hand will then execute an internal vote right so by this internal vote uh we'll kind of gauge the sentiment that's what we call as the sentiment check and we get to see where the committee lies for this particular proposal right so varying on the leaning of this of this vote um and if the proposal at hand that's being uh discussed upon it goes to a snapshot vote then from that internal vote it will transfer over to that snapshot vote so we'll vote on that particular leaning um if that snapshot vote proceeds to become an on-chain uh proposal or an on-team vote then the committee will reconvene and you know re-uh discuss the proposal at hand they'll re-initiate another uh internal vote and then they'll proceed to uh to submit the on-chain from all with the on-chain vote excuse me and we're not just limited to voting um we also assist any emerging collegiate club um virtually anywhere that want to become their own delegate to attain a voting power right so let's say by example i was the president and founder of mount st mary's uh blockchain club myself and some of my colleagues and let's say we wanted to delegate ourselves as a as a delegate on uniswap right but we don't unfortunately don't have the capital to uh acquire a substantial amount of uni to really have any real voice or voting power within the community so we'll reach out to let's say to the ben uh unison meta delegate and submit a proposal saying hey um we need some voting power because we not only would like to participate in proposals and voting and things and the open discussion but potentially later down the line we'll also like to submit our own proposal um that will benefit the unit swap community right and then on the ben meta delegate side uh the commit the community or the committee at hand will review this proposal um will talk to us over at mount st mary's side and say hey we're going to allocate x amount of voting power to you and we'll help them establish a delegate that they that they wish to to create which has been um very well up to this point and as of now we have about five uh meta delegate structures and we'll continue continuing to grow in fact we might come out with with an announcement later today or later on this weekend um but obviously the more uh pronounced metal delegate as of now is is uniswap it's our community is very lively is very proactive within the uni swap forums as well as uh just within the internal chats as well we're always creating new ideas and new proposals and stimulating the conversation on how can unit swap as a protocol improve to benefit not only the users but to also um stimulate further growth to uh improve our overarching experience right um we lately our our latest meta-delegate announcement was with uh the meta steward with bitcoin and we're super pumped because with this meta steward we aim to uh support any entrepreneurial endeavors that maybe our student members may have and it aligns perfectly with bitcoin's vision as well so it's a very nice synergy that we've established with that meta delegate again and we're growing almost on a weekly on a weekly basis at this point um but with that being said that's that's basically it that's my presentation um i appreciate everybody for showing up and i'm hoping for any questions
