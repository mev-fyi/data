i think we're going to get started um i think evan might be able to join in a few minutes here um but fortunately we have a backup judge in liam horn um so without any further ado then let's get started um the first half we're gonna see is space dx uh james dawson we're going to bring you on the call um for you to dummy your video and then do a few minutes of q a with our illustrious judging panel welcome james hello i'll just share my screen now for you great cool hey james huh it's your screen there we are sure actually i need to share with signs one second share computer science sure cool right i'll just start this hello my name is james and this is my submission for the hackathon space dx space dx is a high risk token economic warfare game it is built with solidity and utilizes matic for a fast-paced gaming experience the game itself is currently comprised of three separate tokens solar an erc20 the main currency of the galaxy solar is used not only to buy goods in the economy but it is used as fuel itself to travel throughout our universe solar is mined from the cores of planets which leads us on to our next token planets planets are erc 721 tokens that represent the ownership of planets in the galaxy each planet randomly generates trades the most important being its yield the yield is essentially the interest that you will be paid if you stake solar against your planet yep we jumped on the nft staking bandwagon but there is a unique selling point coming up i promise this brings us on to our last token an erc-1155 called ships and technology or sats for short sats essentially make up your fleet as space is a very dangerous place and you'll need to protect yourself each set has randomly generated attributes that determine the strength and health of your fleet in battle which leads us on to our unique selling point battling using your fleet you're able to attack any planet if you're successful in the attack on that planet you will then be granted the access to the reward pool that has been staked against that planet and vice versa anyone can attack your planets with their fleet and try and take your rewards and this is why you need to collect sats to protect your planets as they mine the solar to make you profit the last part of the game i will go over in this tutorial is exploring as users move throughout the cosmos they build up the world map each unexplored system triggers a random event when a user moves there these can be anything from discovering some insanely high profitable planets finding the rare ships and technology to getting attacked by space pirates and losing everything the front end that you've seen throughout this video shows my current progress throughout the project i have not finished all the logic that i had initially planned but i'm really happy with the progress that i've made so far my first ever solidity project and i really think the project will come together when it's fully integrated with matic overly i've had an absolute blast working on this and i'd like to say thanks to all the youth online folk for organizing everything this has been an extremely rewarding experience and i've learned so much so thank you again bye bye and that is it awesome thanks james um turn over for the judges for comments and questions super cool james uh yeah no it was uh it was like that slightly asmr video with with the music it definitely kept me intrigued uh no so great job um first did how far did you get kind of in the development did you actually deploy contracts to matic or have some something compiling which is something that i'm still working on um i'm in contact with the guys at maddox so uh i developed all of the smart contracts for staking against planets and kind of battling planets and the rewards system like minting their solar um and but i kind of struggled with a completing the front end in time to actually showcase all of that like so it's just mostly contracts and contract testing so far cool yeah no i mean i i had the idea i was thinking like uh you you could like hide different rewards like it hashes so you would have to do like i don't know like almost like proof of work calculations to like uncover like hidden planets or something like that yeah yeah yeah you could have fun with it uh yeah no it was a it was an interesting idea i think you know as far as attacking goes and things like that people would people could definitely have fun with it so oh yeah yeah yeah i really i really like the uh the the idea it's it's kind of uh you have a bit of like d5 and nfts together and uh it's it's pretty interesting like the the exploring uh that you kind of like build the world i i really love that that idea uh what was the uh there's some yields there so it comes from this kind of like a minting uh functionality is that yield in form of a token or uh how does it come the so the planets themselves are actually smart contracts this so the erc 721 is essentially uh a key to the planet itself um so then the uh it'll deploy like proxy planets um so and in that smart contract is a yield number that's just stored there um so it's kind of randomly generated and then when the planet's created uh i'll store the yields with other kind of arbitrary information about the planet but in its own smart contract so when you uh when you take up when you during a battle and you win the battle you'll transfer we will transfer the erc 721 to the other person so then they'll have access they'll actually own the planet they will take the planet from somebody else um in this kind of conflict fighting thing that makes sense yeah yeah how do you make new planets would you would you like i guess like in the the world of decentralization would this be something that you envision being decentralized in any way or would it be like you know you run the front end and deploy all the planets and everything and the planets are are generated um through further discovery so that the main the main aspect of the game would be the exploring so when you go and explore and you land somewhere uh it's random events that happen during on each block um and hey so you'll go you'll go you'll go explore and then you'll randomly discover so say um you went somewhere and it's like you just go it'll be like you discovered uh a high-yield planet system we will print mint you an erc721 and send that to you from using the explore function while also building up the world so that that erc 721 is locked to that position in the world map and but you also have ownership of the say 721 um and if that makes sense so so all yields are predetermined at the time of the world map being generated by you guys you guys generate the world map no where the world map is um generated by people just moving through it but the the size of the world map is generated by us if that makes sense so um there's four different sections there's a quadra quadrants sectors districts and then stars so currently there's four quadrants 20 sectors seven districts and a thousand stars in each one of those now not every star can be a star location can be a planet it can be other things um like different events that can be triggered there like uh one that i wanted to have was a market place system you know you'll have to travel to that star location and then you'll have access to the functionality so you you have to be at the certain star position to have access to that functionality so in traveling that's like an on-chain call right to travel yeah so like basically you would be able to measure whether or not like the reward from traveling and developing new things is greater than the gas cost of which to just spam the matic network with transactions to travel uh yeah yeah yeah matic would love you guys that is the end of the time for q a uh so thank you james that was awesome and we're going to move on to the next project thank you very much guys and good luck thanks james bye all right next up is yield scam um is it just uh just you joining us or there's three of them they should be here in another five seconds okay welcome all to the call um and we'll let you take over and show us your demo yeah sure thank you um so hi um this is uh the yield scan team uh it's uh young lone and me uh astri that have created this uh and um so yield scan sams for sustainable yields through stable credits on uh amms uh and um we've applied this idea first to uma's yield dollars uh uusd uh where we have identified that uh having uh maturities for each of these uh token contracts is going to be problematic for liquidity terms uh for liquidity uh so uh without further ado let me just uh share my screen and show the uh demo uh yep uh so uh first off you know i just wanted to showcase that we have this online um so you can access yield scam crew or ens just type your ens connect with metamask and right now it's deployed on rink by testnet and we're going to first show you like the pooling feature so you could start uh pooling right away of course you need to approve the different maturing um yield dollars so to just showcase here we've um we've deployed usd for you know october maturity usd for november maturity and usd for december maturity of course you need to approve all three token contracts but once you're done you can start adding liquidity to the pool and here we're just adding liquidity right now and uh once that liquidity has been added on the chain you can see that uh you receive lp tokens uh we're calling this usd right now um and so uh we're showcasing how you can now swap from one maturing yield dollar uh to another maturing yield dollar and through this process of course there's fees collected on the amms that are uh being distributed directly to the lp token holders um through rebases uh and you could see now we're trying to swap from november maturing uh yield dollars to december material dollars and similarly once the swap has uh gone through uh lp token holders are automatically receiving the fees through a rebase uh similarly over here for uh you know transferring from a yield dollar uh maturing in december to uh october and yeah uh so the whole idea is that lp token orders are constantly winning real time uh drew rebases uh whenever anyone is uh trying to swap uh their different uh maturing yield to uh yield dollars uh and here we're just uh magnifying this to show you that you know lp tokens are hoke holders are actually earning something through rebases yeah and so uh we just wanted to showcase this uh one of the things that we weren't able to do in time was that um of course the question is what happens to any of these yielders that actually mature while they're in the amm the idea is we're going to automatically um claim the uh collateral on uma right away and then we're going to swap that for usdc and then we're going to deposit that into a reserve contract and then we're gonna use uh we're gonna wrap them into either ave um ausdc or uh compound c uh cus dc so that we're earning yields on that as well and then providing that additional yield to the lp token holders uh yeah and so that's uh concludes our demo uh and i'm happy to take any questions i i really love the idea uh this is this is pretty amazing so so kind of like you can you can practically swap uh swap maturity if i if i correctly understood and and yield so you know this could be a interesting to create different kinds of you know even like portfolios you know when there's like a uh token sets for uh you know long positions there could be portfolios on different maturities and you kind of create this uh very interesting you know uh money markets in in in that sense uh i don't know if that's impossible but what i understood from what you guys are doing yes so uh definitely i totally agree uh there's definitely we lack sort of the financial knowledge to actually try to explain this in a financial way but we do believe there's like very interesting things you could start doing especially from a portfolio management perspective uh but at least for now we just try to show that it works and that this idea is is doable yeah and the the rapping to let's say to to a tokens like you know ausdc and and c token that's that's pretty cool way to to also compound a bit of uh yield so i i i could actually imagine this becoming very interesting pro like it's it's practically yeah it's practically become you know not just swapping facility but portfolio management so pretty good work thank you yeah i mean this would be so that a lot of etfs kind of manage themselves this way with futures contracts if you guys know they whenever the maturity of the underlying assets comes through exploration they the main fund managers have to kind of roll it over you guys would i guess if you just had it automated here you guys would just be i guess always sort of taking the risk of of a role and kind of automating that you know i would say like um yeah no it's a super cool idea i think for for creating this because i don't think these kind of markets exist um for creating these things probably just because the demand isn't quite there yet um yeah i mean besides kind of the uma tokens and the expirations are there any other assets that you guys have thought about putting in here yeah so our idea will be applicable to any uh non-fungible tokens with different contracts to token contracts of the same asset class uh that's sort of how we're approaching this uh process where you know essentially the way it's designed is the same but the only different fact is that it has different maturities that's all uh and so we're trying to apply this to like for example like perhaps option tokens um you know that's one and then of course obviously other future tokens that mature have different uh you know maturing futures so uh we see this being applicable to any you know future uh d5 products that come out yeah no i think it would be uh it would be cool because i'm sure you guys saw like the so the big sort of failure to roll over maturities happened in the oil markets earlier this year whenever oil went negative because nobody wanted to hold the front month contracts and then you know like i now you guys are basically making it well now they actually have a place to dump you would just like so like they would be able to dump their front month contracts but now now you would just tank the entire am so well yeah you know because like when the real world it went the prices went negative but i'm guessing you guys can't actually go negative like you wouldn't have like a negative nft price would you and the beauty of it is that we have the reserve um contract so you know you have we have the usdc that always like has that like you know peg at the at the end of the day that like saves the entire system so you would actually peg the keep keep them hold the peg so in that like there's the usdc and the reserve contract that could always be paid out to lp token holders so it wouldn't technically fall down below that value yeah no i'd be curious to see because like maybe there's a reason that it would you know like say you're doing this for regulatory arbitrage and can't crash out of usdc and you don't it's sort of useless to you um so no but great job guys um it was thank you cool thank you thank you yeah did you guys get it deployed though it's up and running on rank pi yes uh of course you know on mainnet we definitely needed a bit more work but yes uh so far on tesla it seems to work fine cool awesome okay well thank you so much you'll scam um really appreciate you joining us for the hackathon and great work um okay we're gonna move on to the next hack uh next up is looking glass um so we're gonna promote you um on to the uh call here um and we're also joined by our uh judge evan van ness i was gonna take over for liam uh thank you evan for being with us um okay jeff i'll turn over to you to start your presentation thanks was just looking for the zoom window ah hi everybody okay let me share my screen okay here we go uh so the whole idea behind looking glass is that this is a centralized or mostly centralized way to move digital assets between two different blockchain networks and you know with with um i think everybody's very aware of and concerned of the gas fees on maine and ethereum at this point in time um and there are other completely you know 100 compatible ethereum networks such as uh xdi finance smart chain and then other layer two networks uh like omg um i'm the co-founder of curvegrid we're a tokyo-based blockchain company uh the product that we work on is multivas and those are the blockchains that we currently support so that's why i'm talking about this uh but certainly there's lots of other applications that this could be used with uh very quickly multibass is a blockchain middleware um that uh basically makes it very easy to interact with the blockchain and so you know we're building this we're building looking glass or prototyping looking glass on top of that uh because it's it's easy for us but um you know there's there'd be other ways to approach this as well so basically you've got some sort of digital asset erc20 721 or eleven fifty five uh what you do is you transfer that to a looking glass address which is essentially controlled by an enterprise wallet or hsm in a future iterations could be a smart contract but um that's that's what we're using for this demo um the idea is that that transfer trigger is an event which we're monitoring for it says multibatch here but really the looking glass uh would sit on top of multibass uh that uh then triggers uh the signing of a burning transaction on the source blockchain and a minting transaction on the target blockchain um and and that's pretty much it there's lots of other possibilities uh for this um i guess you could compare it to something like a token bridge the difference being there's no um there's no sort of decentralized set of validators this is completely centralized solution so you have to trust the people that are running it but it could work very well in the case of uh game uh let's say blockchain based games or if you're tracking logistic items or something that's more of a centralized or semi-centralized use case and it can always be expanded uh in the future so the demo uh the code is basically a very uh kind of non-existent at this point but uh if we run this uh all that we got uh we only got as far as um you know essentially pulling events off the blockchain so this is more of uh you know interested in feedback on this idea rather than having a lot to show at this point uh and that's it thank you very much awesome thanks jeff uh turn over the judges for questions and comments yeah great project jeff um i've yeah so or using it's kind of like you guys are acting as an oracle bridge between two different blockchains um so it's you know a lot of projects are kind of setting it up like if you've seen a lot of projects have started doing these kind of things and i think setting yourself up as like a centralized oracle to do these kind of things is is a great step did you did you kind of pull from anybody's code to to get it done or look at any of the the current designs there as far as when you were building it yeah we certainly took inspiration from it i think the the the thing that we noticed is a lot of the current so you know you either take like token bridge or there's one for solana that got released recently right uh wormhole um a lot of the complexity there is in the validator network right which is sort of like you're almost building a blockchain on top of a blockchain right because you have to make sure the validators are doing the the right thing and we basically just done away with that complexity by keeping it centralized so it's it's uh you know not we don't want to use that as a dirty word it's more to say if you're doing something like an online game logistics application you know could be document management that might be a much more efficient use case uh most of the work i mean all the hard work is being done uh on uh uh blockchain in terms of uh there's there's another piece that we're envisioning which is basically like a state machine smart contract to kind of manage it but we certainly took inspiration inspiration from those um you know to kind of start to put this together yeah no very nice i think i think the design the design space can continue to go because i think a lot of them are basically doing the exact same thing as you are right here sure um sure they just kind of add in some complexity so is it actually like you said that it was centralized but uh you could actually like have a network right of kind of like this this validators that are posting a a bond or like like a bail submitting transactions and and so forth right more or less yeah absolutely that's like that that's the next step right we start with this and then uh you know do do that um uh yeah the the you know and and it's going to be the other thing that we want to do is we wanted to be able to support blockchains that aren't quite uh like they don't have full smart contracts so i don't know like ethereum to stellar or something like that or x died to stellar yeah so you know then like it's it's hard on day one to kind of think about how you're going to support validation or or certain network of validators um but yeah that would be a future direction go ahead standing sorry yeah sorry is the idea also kind of like make it more uh general purpose so that it's not just about asset transfer but let's say that there is a uh some functionality for example in ava we have this uh governance process now that uh you vote of chain and and then you can you can basically do this blue validation but you need to call someone and probably there will be a lot of functions in the future that someone needs to call and and this could be like uh you know general purpose uh you know off-chain vehicle that could be some extent even decentralized at some point that you can just use it on many functionalities yeah exactly so out of the box something like token bridge supports erc20 right but there's no erc721 or 1155 or you want to do something like you know stack multi-stack like gnosis safes or gnosis multi-sig smart contracts together like how do you compose that transaction in an efficient way on chain with the validators so you know to your point what ave is doing around your governance protocol and doing that off chain computing and off chain and then basically forklifting on the chain exactly like we want to support more than just erc20 right we want to be able to you want to move it's almost like like a looking glass like you're moving arbitrary data from one chain to another but doing so with the compu with computation attached to it yeah cool i don't really have much to add to be honest with you um is the thought that like you'll have some enterprises like that'll use it or uh yeah or or people that are building things that aren't necessarily d5 right like you wanted do you want to do i don't know maybe it's nfts or maybe it's a smart contract that doesn't you know you could be doing i don't know like open law or something like that right signing documents moving those signatures in that process or the red line markup between blockchains with it but it's not erc20 i think a lot of the the the cross chain um uh solutions today are really focusing on the nft or sorry the the fungible token or maybe non-functional token space we wanted to to simplify the validation piece so we can focus more on you know enabling more more use cases but we're not very far yet so i appreciate your all of your feedback today thank you cool thanks jeff thanks jeff that is the end of the time for q a thanks again for being part of youth online um and we'll move on to the next project so next up we have crescendo um we're gonna bring you on the call and then i'll uh let you take it away i understand that we're gonna play your videos i think so yeah so i'm going to play the video fun fact i i just downloaded the video using uh youtube dl which yesterday got dmc takedowned by the government but i have a copy on my laptop thankfully okay so let's try this and the crescendo contracts first oh sorry sorry second in this video i will be presenting crescendo a meta transaction tool which wraps high volume d5 protocols such as uniswap or tether and provides a gasless experience while simultaneously reducing overall gas consumption by eliminating repeated operations and unnecessary overhead as a simple example let's see crescendo processing a single erc20 transaction in a builder test network the test network has been deployed with opengsn portions of the balancer protocol some dummy tokens and the crescendo contracts first i select my wallet then pick my transfer token as usual i specify a destination address or ens name and the number of tokens let's say three since crescendo is a gas optimizing proxy it utilizes erc20 token apis in unique ways one of which is by manipulating the allowance value to specify the options for the meta transaction in order to fit an address in the uint256 field used by an allowance it must be mapped to a smaller integer type that is why we must click register destination the transaction is gasless and paid for by the crescendo automated treasury it is not possible to execute a meta transaction to set an allowance due to restrictions with the we contract so for this demo i will simply be using a regular approved transaction if the token supported opengsn or the permit function this whole flow would be gasless at this point all we have done is approve the transfer now the transaction must be minted on other machines mentors are watching for approved events directed towards the crescendo contract as more time passes the contract will offer a greater reward from the treasury to cover gas expenses as the rate becomes profitable versus the gas price a bot will submit a transaction to complete the actual transfer for the purposes of this demo i will just run a command to execute the transaction immediately as the transfer executes take note of the wallet balance changing as expected users can be confident that their transfer will be processed within a suitable time frame since the contract will offer increasingly compelling rates as time passes this demo showed the sending of a single token transfer but crescendo can be used for other heavier protocols such as uniswap by combining multiple transactions such as those of a single batched uniswap operation crescendo can reduce the overall gas consumption after combining just four trades uniswap tends to have large liquidity pools so additional slippage incurred will be minimal compared to the gas savings in order to receive funds in usdc while paying them out in eath for either opengsn or mint rewards a separate treasury contract is deployed the treasury uses a balancer pool with extended functionality for opengsn and functions to allow crescendo to unconditionally deposit or withdraw at any time this makes it easy and cheap to continuously convert from usdc to weth since arbitraters will be correcting the balance this demonstration barely scratched the surface of how crescendo can be utilized though the project is still in its early technical stages it's already showing practical potential which will aid in the move to l2 ethereum great thank you over to the judges for questions and comments super cool uh yeah no great job um so the idea i guess is that you would have this you'd batch all of the transactions off-chain and then submit them and then you have your own do you have your own token or no no there's uh no custom tokens in this protocol it just wraps other protocols so then how does the the fee i guess increase as time goes on um so uh the contract will keep track of the earliest uh known approval transaction and uh as more time passes uh it'll count the number of blocks in between and offer a greater reward that way if the gas prices start spiking or something like that the miner will event a miners will eventually have a profitable rate that they can mine at so like suppose if we set the target time period to like 600 seconds let's say and figure out how many blocks that is um and if the gas price is double let's just say um then it will offer uh a linearly increasing reward over time so at some point the transactions will be processed because uh it'll be a profitable transaction do you know like what those times would be during like some of the crazy gas periods uh well it will automatically increase the rate of uh reward uh based on uh how previous uh terms have gone so if it took 20 minutes and the target time is 10 minutes previously then uh it will uh it will offer a higher slope of rewards uh kind of like how the the difficulty will increase in the ethereum mining if if necessary and you said there's a parameter so i can pick that right so that the reward for the blocking or you said like there's a number number of seconds or something like yes because if i'm batching units well so yeah that is uh one of the downsides of this protocol is that if the unit swap price changes within the next 10 minutes either up or down uh that's the rate you get so but on the upside it can put a lot of transactions together and save gas in the process and statistically the price could go up or down so really it's just a little bit of unpredictability is what you're getting well you could even you could maybe add in some way to do like limit orders almost just on unit swap with this to where like only execute if say it's a given price on uniswap and then and then do the trade and then you could have like that sorry yeah that is true and that's one of the nice things about this protocol is that you can specify different strategies to take um for for the purposes of the current unit swap strategy i've written it just tries to put uh transactions together and then execute them within 10 minutes but another strategy could be created that is like i only want to do this uh i only want to execute this allowance if uh it reaches this price uh if it's this price or more favorable so yeah limits could definitely be done in that way yeah well and then i guess have you thought at all about kind of minor front running here because i think like that would be one of the big issues would be like now you're basically posting all of your orders for everyone to front run and you know yeah yeah yeah uh i've considered the possibility of it but i haven't really been able to work out the practicality of such an attack yet um obviously if uh since it's known that a miner will probably process the transaction with every within every 10 minutes and if you know that the crescendo transaction is coming within like the impending blocks that you could do a little bit of manipulation on the unit swap exchange to push the price in an unfavorable direction at the expense of the uh of the users but uh but so that that's something that we'd have to be careful of and this this is a tool that'd be intended for smaller traders people who are trading much smaller amounts of funds and that would be limited to prevent because otherwise you'd get high slippage also so uh there's multiple considerations there well you can so somebody would have to grab it and put it in the transaction right you could maybe like have the reward like really high if it's like the miner themselves so like almost incentivize miners to pull pull it themselves you know and then and then you could maybe get around it i don't know yeah maybe but uh i again it's designed for smaller traders and uh it's hard to verify that the miners themselves are doing it i think i don't think we have access to the minor information from within the smart contract it would be like post yeah you could keep yeah but anyway that was great project all right thank you um we're gonna one of the next the next team that's all the time we have the q a thanks again for a great project okay next up is juicer protocol um we've got you on the the call now so please go ahead and show us your demo hello guys my name is mikhail lazarev and i am so proud to present you juicer protocol today let's talk about the file credit market i took real prices from other market for die coin and you can see there is 2.5 percent gap between deposit and borrow api and this gap exists because lenders put more than 10 million dollars into protocol which obviously do not work juicier protocol solves this utilization problem and offer better rates for both lenders and borrowers and let's check how it works the lender wants to invest 100 usd coins and juicer protocol used best rate strategy and found that avo provides the best one which is 3.47 so it takes lenders money and put them into our protocol you can see that lender goes the best market rate now the borrower will come to seeing and we also use the best market strategy and offer 4.85 percent rate for borrower to provide these 100 usd coins we take money from our and provide them to borrower and let's consider this step by step at first we took 100 usd coins from lander and after that we provide them to pour over 4.85 as you could see there is a 1.38 extra which could be distributed to three parts by issuing vitamin tokens the 40 percent will be delivered for lenders and borrowers to motivate them to use juicer protocol and the last 20 person would be invested for further protocol development what happens when utilization would be not optimal and user protocol would have less borrowers than lenders let's start from point that both lenders and borrowers has the best market rates furthermore borrowers get vitamins tokens which dramatically reduce their rates lenders whose assets were used for loans also get vitamins tokens which really increase their rates all other renders stay in the queue juicer protocol connects with z5 market leaders to provide the best market rates for its customers thank you very much and let's check how it works in real life go to gcf.finance and you can see this landing page and you can found that deposit and borrow rates with vitamins is much better and more interesting so i press enter it's all markets i go to deposit for example and i want to put my money on die deposit and get more than fifty 0.59 it's one point eighty if someone take my money press deposit i entered one thousand and now press here done you can check market size oh now my thousand my 1000 die is available for borrowing thank you very much it was juicer protocol especially for s online great thank you mikhail yes thank you very much yeah quite quite interesting i i think like this kind of like a uh you know uh lending or yield aggregation is becoming quite uh widely usable and it's it's it's interesting to see because like when we build the the object protocol and you know there's the the compound and kind of those baseline light protocols uh practically now we see kind of like a new layer of aggregators and you know this kind of like uh uh googles of finance uh are becoming more more uh quite interesting way uh yeah i really like the the the presentation what was the uh in the presentation when you deposit funds uh what was the reason of borrowing those funds as well in terms of deposits i think their idea we use of and does protocol like liquidity pools and stores our money on these protocols until the one guy come from market and ask us to borrow money and when someone want to take money we found the bet the worst rates for example if you put money for our three person and to compound for two person we took money from the protocol with less rate and provide them to borrow directly so we work on two things the first we want to put money for best interest rate into different protocols and they when another borrower come to my juicer protocol we take money from this protocol and it's like peer-to-peer we connect one lender with one borrower and we take some extra and share between them got it good okay so that's the innovation nice so uh probably the idea i talked with some person and they said oh if you start this one it means that probably the other or some protocols start to use your protocol because you we provide usually the best rates when we connect to person directly but my answer is it's not same because you can found a different market race on different protocol and it works like arbitrage in my point of view so it helps for better asset utilization but this protocol can't exist without other compound and other activities providers who could provide a lot of liquidity of the moment so i think it's a good way how we could create a one huge liquidity pool for all borrowers and provide the better utilization of every assets you said you used wi-fi or at least you had the logo do you is that like a future a future plan to yes it's future plan use ufi because as i said it's it's more about strategy and i know ufi is more about strategy and i take news so when i plan the protocol i have some idea how we could be connected together to use my protocol is the best utilization uh thing with zero risk because uh u5 protocol could be connected and if it would put money to juicer protocol it would has the best rates all the time between different protocols so it could save guys and it would provide much more better returns great okay that is all the time we have a q a but thank you hail thank you juicy protocol i'm going to move on to the next demo uh that's the next step very cool thanks thanks so next up we have uh cameo i will leave it to you stanley to take over and show us your demo yeah thank you just shouting this week hey everyone this is stanley and i'm here to talk about cameo a portable diy for the ceramic network just a quick introduction i'm stanley and my teammate matthew we both software developers and we work to create the cameo project so what is cameo the most simple explanation it's a meta mask to manage it's a meta mask like extension to manage your did and your identity on the ceramic network so just like how metamask lets you create an account and send transactions and sign transactions and view balances ceramic is i mean cameo is equivalent for the ceramic network you can create a new tid you can add new details to your profile and you can log in to any d app that supports the ceramic network login and you can manage completely manage your d id through the cameo extension so how does it work uh camareo connects to ceramic networks using idx and the ceramic libraries to create a did and manage it in the background it injects that object on to the chrome runtime so that the ned app that wants to use this information can access it all the keys are stored locally and it's not shared with any of the apps that you interact with what is the benefit of it uh of using cameo for the developers it leads to better ux and easier on-boarding no longer you have to show the user a random hex address you can you can you can show profile pictures and you can read them first name last name kind of just like how our user would expect in an application for the users uh the it's a portable identity of ceramic network your identity is not locked into any platform you don't have to fill any forms yeah so let's jump into a quick demo here uh i have the cameo extension loaded on my chrome browser right now uh since this is the first time that i'm loading it my d id is not i have to create a new did so it takes whatever my udid is created right now and the next time i load it should remember me let me just quickly fetch my guitar profile picture so i can complete my profile add my image update my profile okay then my profiles updated and i can add my ethereum address as well so i'm just going to copy my testnet address and paste it onto my profile so my profile should now have my name uh an image and my ethereum address so as soon as the image is updated uh we show the user the user's avatar in the extension so just to we've created a application that can make use of this so let's just ensure that this is loaded so uh for any d app that wants to log in so just like how you would log in with metamasker connect metamocks to your account any d app can log in with cameo so logging in with cameo will give the user access to all the fields that are saved in the profile so its name a profile picture and the did and the ethereum account in any of those so that was the demo and our future plans is to add custom support for custom documents support multiple accounts and support more browsers right so it's only chromes if you plan to extend it to firefox as well so thank you thanks sally uh over to the judges for questions and comments yeah very very cool what what motivated you to to work on this just like really interested in decentralized identity space or yeah uh the decentralized identity and the fact that you know like uh anytime you log into any defy app or anything it's just a hex address that's showing you so maybe what if like you can show a more personalized experience like you know profile picture and a name something like that okay extension for that so like if i if i was in a defy app then i would have to have two browser extensions basically for that for that to work right uh yeah yeah in this present form yeah you're right but uh maybe we can add like some sort of signing to the application to this extension then you can solve it with one yeah you're right yeah that was kind of my question would you want to add kind of meta mask functionality to it you know like as far as like you you could just be like metamask with a name and an identity sort of yeah yeah so it's a bit of a stretch but probably sure well i mean if you're dreaming big here you can you can pick what you're doing you know and that's what i'm i'm actually not very familiar with the ceramic network in general um what had kind of picked why did you kind of go that route for the decentralized identity so ceramic is it's basically like a library that just allows us to like easily interact with iprs so all of these documents all of these pids and images and everything are routed to the ipfs like internally so idx and ceramic uh i mean it's much more easier experience to use it okay cool and then i guess did you get it everything's deployed are you you're like live already or is it still test nets oh it's still that's nice okay actually ceramic is still tested so i mean ceramic itself is not into production so yeah awesome how much um like did you consider forking metamask and and like you know adding adding like like your stuff in there um that seems like a more just like i'm i'm going back to the two browser extensions thing right like it seems like you would potentially have a great like add-on there that would be um yeah yeah now that the eye is above yeah now that you say it it sounds like a great idea but we've never thought of it i mean we actually referred to metamorph code because we had some issues with actually injecting the variable to the browser so but that sounds like a good idea yeah yeah now that you've done a lot of the work no and then i for yeah what what are your thoughts kind of on the privacy factor of it too you know like i know that's a big issue kind of in ethereum and browser plug-ins like is there any you know i think this is going the route of anti-privacy um but i guess just keeping your your decentralized identity private in any way whenever you're accessing these apps with these apps all kind of have access to some of your information uh yeah so the ipl scenario like in future would be to have some sort of selective sharing like so you don't have to show your name or image and everything so you can just share whatever fields that you want to choose like your profile can have like seven to eight deals but you are fully willing to share two of those so that's something we have planned at first awesome great okay thank you very much stanley um really appreciate you being part of it online and great work um and we're gonna call up the next hack after this so the next project is uh sales together uh so we'll get uh kevin and team on the call and please take it away show us your demo hello yes i will present my screen now so is there supposed to be audio damien just want to check oh sorry sorry i didn't i forget to share the audio so yeah no hi my name is dan he's okay now and today we present our application called cells together merchandise first we will talk about the context in the business to business sales industry then i will show how our application is working and finally we will see a demo so in the business venus industry we know that sellers always are looking for buying signals that means information that indicates that an entity has the propensity to purchase contain products or services this information can gain from different data sources as websites blogs or magazines all can be provided for another server our application want to incentivize to another size to share this information to do so we will allow to the owner of the campaign to to create a campaign the owner can deposit some interiors to mean some c tokens on the compound finance users can start to see the open campaigns and and share the signals and the owner can check for this signal and he considered that this is valuable he can pay for that to reveal the full signal so the signal provider will receive the c tokens we think that this one is the best workflow because we are the very sentimental people to participate and share information but they are not only receiving tokens they are using the tokens that are generating interest over the time so finally we will see a demo so in our demo the first thing that we need to do is create a campaign to let you know to the resource the user so we are looking for segments we have the details of the campaign and we put the amount of hit that we will pay for each good signal until we resign proceed so we configure transaction and create the campaign after our campaign is created we can go and add money to the campaign so we can contribute the campaign with one ethereum check that i am in the manager account confirm the transaction so after con after add money to to the campaign we can return and see the details now this will say the amount of money that we add into the campaign and the c tokens that we meet so another user now can go and provide signals in this case motivate this user you will add some information [Music] we'll provide a signal confirm the transaction so after the assassin confirmer now the manager of the account can go and approve the signal they will send money to this account and we can see here now we can see here when the user received the compensation in c tokens this is all our demo thank you so much for your attention so are you familiar with erasure bay from from numerai no okay it's it's fairly similar um they but um one thing that they have is a um uh if you're not happy with the quality of information that you receive you can burn uh like some of your money and some of their money or maybe it's both of you earn all of your money and all of their money was that in the in there no can you share with me the name of the person it's called erasure bay uh i'll type it in the chat yeah uh it's it's fairly similar um very similar oh okay no we didn't know that yeah it's neat what did inspire you to work on this so for us i am working in a business awareness company and all the time we are looking to get some information about companies that are looking for some products so i i am working with sellers and in general this information is collected manually or the sellers are looking for information on checking twitter or on our social networks and with we think that for example you can create a community and start to share information that could be valuable and then to incentivize your community we can share tokens on that and we were thinking that if we connect this application with a protocol in defi or like aveo compost this will be more interesting to everybody to participate and at the same time this is just the demo but actually the idea the original idea came from for example if you think in subscription so create a subscription modify in the same way when you can pay but undesigned engineering interests and the payments so the original idea came from there i didn't know about this application that you share with me yeah it's it's similar i mean it sounds like you actually have a real use case and like you know are in this market every day so like you know if you if you get this to the point where you go live i mean i can see it you know being successful in a different market or niche or whatever um but yeah i mean the basic functionality is relatively similar yeah i mean it might be worth looking through what they've done in terms of um you know what happens if you get bad information because you could you know you might like to draw inspiration or you might dislike it and you know have a different twist or whatever no we were thinking we can use of off-chain solutions for that so for example one idea that we don't have the time to finish but one idea was a create like ranking for the people that are sharing the signals so you as a as the guy who's the owner of the campaign you will pay only for people that has a good ranking and this one is like generating some identity inside the application now i would be curious to see how you would handle like almost fake signals like in your system yeah uh to where like just one guy just continuously deposits money into ave getting you know i guess signals from himself ah sure but actually we were and then and the demo we we blamed that the owner can create one campaign and he can request for signal but after we we think an idea maybe the best solution is everybody can participate and well actually it's a it's a very good question but we i just in this case the idea only was try to to test and see how the application can work with a smart contract we see a weakness is is the thing that you are saying with the signals uh because actually when when we was deploying the contract everybody can now when when you pay everybody can see the signal already so that loss the that is losing the the value for for use the application right on the side yeah it's great no you you could do it like with partnership announcements too like all the d5 projects can just pay each other to do partnership announcements and it can be a fun time yeah yeah no but our our original idea or our global concept is try to apply smart contracts for marketing and see how we can incentivize to the people to participate or even when you create a marketing campaign or you want to you want to sell your product you can use another strategies then the the the thing that we have already and useful great job big props are using interest bearing tokens i mean those are very good things to pay i mean they usually increase in balance or value so that's nice thanks okay i think that's all the time we got for q a uh thank you very much for a great project um okay next up uh we've got tweeter um i'll let you guys take it away and show us your demo awesome for sure hey how's it going everybody uh and just fyi i'm not eligible for the uh the chain link uh prizes just just so that we're clear so uh cool can we jump right in everybody my name is patrick collins i partnered up with alex rohn and we created twether the governance twitter protocol uh we are democratizing tweets and democratizing communication uh basically the way it works is as you see in front of here we have an on-chain tweet or governance contract uh and it all works and revolves around uh the chain link oracle and the chain link node so the way it works is users fund the contract with link in return they get twee uh they can then use this tweeter to propose and vote on tweets after enough votes have come through for a tweet the chain link node kick the smart contract kicks off a request to the changing note which promptly sends out the tweet this is the ui for now uh you can see only has a couple of things it has the current tweet that you're selected these are the tweets that are in the queue how many votes it currently has so the more tweets the more tweeter that is distributed uh the more it costs to pass a tweet so there's actually a lot of math involved um when it comes to this governance contract because only tweeter gets sent out when link gets funded so we can see a couple of the different uh tweets that are currently in the queue there's nothing there a couple of the tweets and we can see what the current votes are for that tweet um so clearly this one doesn't have a way um all is is down one vote from actually running uh we can actually mint tweet like so here we go we can see uh we get the tweet token and this is what we can use to actually vote on um proposals we can also even propose a tweet here something like like this global rules let's propose that great yes let's do this and once it actually confirms it'll come back with you know something like this or actually this one oh that was what i actually did so as you can see we're really close to be able to pass here so let's add three more and it looks like we added a whole bunch more uh we should be able to see that because of so many um so many votes it actually it's kicking off a chain link job it's using the twitter external adapter and it's going to actually send the tweet to our twitter account let's see we see that a minute ago it actually tweeted out in addition we didn't have this on our ui we don't have time to add this in but in addition if you send the winning tweet if you are the voter who pushes the tweet over the edge and actually sends it you get what's called an nf tweet uh which is an nft token um basically signifying the information uh of the tweet or giving you a a unique token saying i sent this tweet at this time uh you can see some different um [Music] uh some of the different parameters this is a one-click down really cool way to kind of just like see the functions of uh of tweets really easily um we can get zero and this returns all the destruct of that tweet uh that was sent so this is the this is the first week through the twitter government it's our throne patrick obviously we see all the information associated with this nf tweet uh which is really cool um there's a number of really interesting things in the tweet their contract as well um you know burning the tweeter checking the vote count uh creating the laos proposing a tweet unvoting um so thank you this is tweeter signing off what kind of tweets do you think the chain link community would push through uh i cannot say i do not know all right well i have an idea but uh yeah very very happy positive friendly yeah the nft idea is is pretty awesome i mean like you know you basically uh uh reward for for some action you know and and you know time and place and everything all the time exactly i i think it's a it's it's a nice nice idea is that just like an nfd or is there some sort of like a uh visuals included or maybe that could be even created in the future yeah so that was uh on our to-do list uh we had a number of things i wanted to do so we didn't get to um yeah adding the having the visual wouldn't be very difficult um i was actually taking some time looking into open c uh to do that and it's it seems it seems like it would be pretty easy cool what was the inspiration here like what what the idea yeah so so we kind of wanted to we wanted to do something fun um you know we uh i'm a developer advocate on chain link and alex is uh is uh integration engineer slash technical writer um so the solidity part was was actually the easier part we wanted to tr and working with oracle's we wanted to try you know playing with nfts you know maybe instead of getting data we would send data from a smart contract um and we got to you know really go into a governance protocol so the inspiration really was like okay how can we do something that's really fun um and that can kind of do a little bit more than what we used to uh neither one well i decided i also wanted to you know try to work on a front end which uh didn't go so great as you saw but um yeah the inspiration was was really just to kind of branch out and try working with some new things that we hadn't worked with before how uh how much gas does all this cost it's not very it's surprisingly not very gas expensive actually um and actually part of the uh inspiration for the nf3 was when um the the vote hits the threshold to get over um a little bit extra gas uh you have to do a little bit of extra gas to actually you know send the send the request to the chain link node so we said okay cool well they're gonna be spending a little bit of extra gas anyways we might as well also mint them in the center of tweet to be like yeah you're gonna you know be doing a little extra gas but you're gonna get this uh as well i don't know the exact numbers of gas but it's not as bad as you'd think well like would you want to do something i guess kind of like the snapshot so where you're just signing off chain with your twee balances and then chain link can just go pull the the result of the vote themselves say that again well because you would want to do something i guess so that way people don't have to submit gas to vote on tweets right oh yeah yeah that would be cool um that would probably be like a phase two type thing yeah yeah are you gonna go live with this next hackathon we'll see we'll see we'll see okay cool well if you do let us know sorry go ahead i was gonna say it would be kind of fun if you you know you start getting a bunch of at each global is amazing um from uh from the twitter account just because that's all it would be right now because i think i think you'd want to make it a protocol so then all the different token projects could have it and then you could like have them tweet at each other [Laughter] and then it could be a little bit more fun uh that does sound fun but it also sounds maybe toxic i don't know if i want to i don't know what we want to promote danny's got some spicy tweets lined up already oh yeah maybe we'll just give this to daddy and let him uh him be the benevolent dictator i should try it out uh all right well on that note that's all the time we have for q a thanks patrick uh great project thank you guys so much okay moving on the next hack next up we have uh unipear um so i'll let you guys jump on the call and share yeah hi everyone so i believe someone from ith global was supposed to play my video because i had this problem at my yeah sure um liam are you able to pull up the video and share it yeah i don't have a note for that but um my internet's pretty fast so if you guys will just uh give me a moment to download the video so that it'll it'll be played with high quality image second liam's whereas juarez skills coming up big once again fifty percent done okay okay you guys can see the quick time uh yeah all good sweet okay i'm going to play it hello everyone this is charlie from unipear unipa is a scalable non-custodial p2p fiat on ram it's scalable because we're using open banking apis to initiate payments between buyers and sellers and using those same open banking apis we are able to get this transaction stages whether the payment the fiat payment has gone through or not so over here i have a demo running so this is a live demo running at demo.unipear.exchange that can try out for yourself so i'm going to walk you through the user flows for both buying and selling so over here i've already connected to my metamask account which is running on the koban network now to buy the first thing i need to do is specify the amount of ethereum that i want to buy so over here i enter 0.18 here and immediately shows me the amount i need to pay in inr i know is the fiat currency of india next thing i need to do is enter my uk id through which i will be making the payment up id is a payment identifier that is linked to my bank account but over here since we're not using the live banking apis we're using a sandbox environment so i'm going to enter a dummy uk id which will automatically accept the request for any amount of inr that it gets a request and next i just click pay now that creates an ethereum transaction to initiate the payment request at this up id so i'm just going to go and go ahead and confirm so we can take a look at the ethereum transaction we can see that the ethernet transaction is confirmed and this is the address from which i create the transaction we go to the address we can see that i have received the 0.1 amount of ether that i have initiate the payment form if you're a seller who wants to sell some ethereum for fiat currency all you have to do is go to the sell tab and enter your uk id where you would like to receive the fiat payment [Music] as well as some initial amount of ethereum that you want to sell when i click this create escrow button it will create an escrow contract with this initial amount of ethereum and this seller payment id where you will receive the fiat payment over here the sellers can see the deployed escrow accounts and they can either withdraw the deposited amounts or deposit additional ethereum that you want to sell great okay and over to the judges for questions and comments that's that's quite quite quite interesting i mean um there's a lot of things i mean obviously like on ramping into into the um ethereum ecosystem is pretty interesting to get more adoption and users there's always issue when dealing with uh fiat currencies with with regulation that kind of stuff so probably it will come come up but uh from technical standard point is it's quite interesting to how you develop but what's your inspiration on this uh product like what what do you want to achieve uh yes sure so uh definitely the inspiration is just making it easier for anyone to like buy the first uh cryptocurrency and and mainly towards like new users who want to try out d5 applications but they're kind of for them it's going through an exchange and you know uh doing uh like going through the whole trading interface it's too intimidating for them to just offer a very simple on-ramp that they can just buy some national ethereum uh and start using the file apps yeah super cool project i mean is there like a max that you're like allowing just from the regulatory side or from there from the app side yeah sure definitely so if we have given that a third and we definitely have some kind of initial like we since we're targeting like new users and not people who are like traders or something so we'll just have very low limits just to make sure that we don't get into any regulatory issues and uh yeah that's that that should serve the purpose of letting new users just buy their initial crypto and start using these apps cool so have you had any friends could use it yet or is this uh no are you gonna get somebody too no uh since it's like we don't have we actually haven't deployed it on the main net and as like we haven't even we're using a sandbox environment for the api so yeah we definitely have plans to uh launch it on mainnet but yeah hopefully we'll we'll do that in a few weeks or something like that i think you're muted evan not muted but we can't hear him i mean if you want to type your question into the chat uh we can just read it out uh i was just saying what are the blockers for deploying the magnet um so yeah since it's uh like since we're having escrow contracts and basically we need to just make sure like uh we get the initial audits or something like that done and make sure it's like there's no huge bugs in the contract and yeah i mean it's basically completely centralized because you guys would rightfully own the api keys right yeah so we're actually using chain link oracles and we have a chain link node running that is connected to these apis through an external adapter so that that pass is centralized like yeah so it's an oracle so there's some kind of centralization over there but everything else is uh running through the contracts and the contracts called the chain lick oracle contract do you know initiate that payment and get back the status whether the uh transaction has gone through or not so we get that back through the oracle as well with the contracts okay so you wouldn't want to centralize it on your part it would be like as long as you're okay with the chain link centralization piece of the apis then it should be trustless right yeah like we're trying to bring uh like we're trying to bring as much functionality we can on chain and like not have everything of change besides just the escrow so we are we also plan to kind of have the auto matching on chain so that you know in the demo we had to specify the escrow address but eventually we plan to have a automatic matching between the users super cool yeah great job great okay thank you um we're just going to take a a six minute break here we've got a few projects left after you appear next up after the break will be syndicate we just want to give the judges a chance to refill their coffee so hold on and we'll be back in just a few minutes okay folks we'll be getting started just back in a few minutes here as the judges follow back in uh next up is going to be syndicate and so just you're just you're ready to go okay all the judges are back great leave if you want to get syndicate on the call they can show us their demo hi this is my demo for syndicate so what is syndicates i think it is a platform for web3 communities what is it right now it's basically a web3 discord um so let's jump straight into the demo here so to um access syndicate simply call it this url you see here so here we go and you'll be prompted to unlock your wallet which is your identity for entering this website so simply unlock your metamask wallet to access so as soon as you join this should look very familiar if you ever used apps such as discord or slack which i assume all of you have um this essentially is a web 3 version of that and here you see that the members of this web app their identities are their web 3 wallet identities um and just like discord you can create channels um send messages and send the amps to members so direct messaging um what makes uh this unique compared to this chord or telegram is that it it can bring web3 features that are not possible um natively in traditional web 2 chat apps for example i can make a permission chat that only allows people to meet certain requirements to enter here i have a comp governance channel or survey rather where the users must hold at least 0.5 comps to enter so when i try to join it will not allow me because currently i do not meet such requirement however if i were to switch to a wallet that meet the requirements it will so i'll just quickly switch my wallet here there we go and then verify my signature sign here this wallet i do own 0.5 com tokens so it will allow me to access so i can click join and there i'm in all right let's do government very cool and you can see that notifications are here as well and that's kind of a very basic demo of my app but feel free to try it out so how's this built let's build out firebase mongodb and react and for web 3s and police simply use web3j.js and what's next so the opportunity here is that almost all crypto communities live on chats um that uses web 2 as a platform and since all the communities live on web 3 it's kind of a bit surprising that um we still use web 2 chats to host these communities and there's just a lot of exciting possibilities down the road snapshot is very cool i hope to implement kind of pseudo lightweight governance features down the line for this project there's just a lot of cool possibilities and currently i'm looking for just feedback on my work so far and looking for people to work with so if you are curious or interested send me a dm at glitch on twitter thank you this is cool um i mean obviously like you said it's decentralized it's like sort of yeah i mean it's it's it's all it's centralized it's just using you know your web 3ks your eth keys um but like you can build a lot on that there there have been like some attempts to do this here and there um are you familiar with any of those or you just wanted to do this and it looks good by the way looks great awesome thank you um yeah i think i'm aware of a few projects like this as well um i think status used to be the popular one um but i definitely started just like not uh really i'm really stuck too deep uh into the alternatives i kind of just wanted to build something um and i'm aware so you had this like in mind because you felt like why doesn't this exist i just haven't read that kind of thing totally cool yeah i really love this uh this is quite quite good like i i love what you know the web3 capabilities uh bring you you know for example the ability to have some sort of balance before um entering into a room i'm personally i'm against that like balances but um for the the functionality that it brings you know let's say you have a certain nft then you can belong into a club uh or or something like a discussion board and you know it's kind of like you you can create permissions uh permission discussions and and so forth so i i think as i idea this is pretty cool this could be actually something that um uh like the the other community could definitely use i see a lot of value added my question is um where's the data stored now can you run your own server how does it work yeah totally so currently almost everything is centralized besides the fact that wallets are ethereum identities which is decentralized um but in terms of like messaging and servers um i think it's just for the ease of implementation currently they're all like i i i own the database and um yeah i was thinking uh sorry yes just quickly that if you have uh if you have now kind of like the the uh anonymities behind of the the uh addresses uh there are situations where maybe you want to express like like who you are and there's questions like uh will that that data be stored there forever can can you remove it and now it's in centralized database but uh maybe you think a bit about uh what could be like a long-term solution uh should those groups be some sort of like signal type of like you know encryption between the the group members uh that when they they join uh some sort of like a solution that is uh less centralized that could be pretty interesting and i i think uh the value added on discord is exactly the having owned server so that could be like big uh feature but i think you could go even further and thinking like how you could use cryptography uh to make all of whatever exists now like signal uh and discord a bit better this this could be very interesting project and to see like to evolve really happy yeah no great job though it's uh first off super pretty um just a really really well designed front end uh from here to most projects so good job on that you know i think one of the things you should kind of think about that we've run into whenever you're talking about using this is say like a governance platform whether it's any of them you know like a lot of the people who are some of the most active members saying in like the chat rooms for whatever reason they still hold all of their coins on finance or or on one of these centralized exchanges which has no access to any of these wallets and um you know it's still like great to have them as part of the discussion though um because they are active parts of the community and even if they can't vote on things it's it's cool that they're part of it um so have you thought about how it might work or or just trying to force people off of centralized exchanges um for that part you can't you don't have to make permission chats you can also just make regular chats and i think for the future like you can maybe make a server which certain channels are permissioned and some are not um to just be inclusive everyone in that community how much how much would it cost like um yeah i mean you said you're in but like if i i spin up my server or whatever as discord calls them i mean how fast does this like spiral out of control for you and you have to yeah so i haven't i'm actually on like the cheapest tier of firebase right now but i imagine as if it actually has usage i would just have to be like spammed based on the api amount like api calls so i imagine so i've really thought about scaling it but i think it could get expensive there's like a lot of users uh i think that's something i won't have to worry about i mean i might be wrong but i think if you like literally put this out there you would have a lot of people like youth projects that would use it quickly yeah certainly it would get expensive yeah i i definitely would be happy to just like let that happen uh and then they worry about that afterwards yeah you know it's probably not that much money that you couldn't get it covered by like bitcoin grants or whatever like if um yeah right cool neat thanks so much bill i think that's the whole time we got for q a uh great project okay so next up we just got two teams left today and next up is whirlpool so let's get whirlpool on the call and please take it away with your demo hey sorry one of our teammates soon crashed so give us one second i'm sorry no problem but we are here hey nicole great hey pretty much standard for zoom it only crash it it only works when you don't need it yeah okay um yeah whenever whenever you're ready um please go ahead i won't start the time or anything until until you're able to start forrest's background is kind of one of those like is it zoom or not backgrounds i can't tell if it's virtual or not i think i see a clipping suggested this mine is completely real by the way this is a customer in my head built up i think it's going to crash again because like the box i don't know if you guys can see the box has like no you can't hover over the box um yeah would your other team may be able to dial unless one of you guys have the video downloaded oh maybe it works i think he's back oh yeah i'm back sorry maya zoom crash uh i guess i'll present nate or do you want to present he's always fine with me i'll take it away okay as society drifts away from fiat currencies we're left facing a global privacy crisis will corporations stop using stolen data to exploit our every behavior can we rely on the government from the pockets of lobbyists to provide regulations and do we accept this future of surveillance capitalism our team says hell no that's why we've created a way for customers to make anonymous purchases using a unique burner wallet generated every month among users some people really care about their privacy and other people just don't give a about that but boy do they love winning money so why not have a system that attracts both these groups by gamifying anonymous purchases our two-pronged system combines the privacy of tornado cache and the incentive structure of pool together to bring you whirlpool world whirlpool how does whirlpool work the user sets an amount of dye to pre-load onto their burner wallet at the start of each month users deposit dye into a mixer and the dye is stored as a dye or avedai this allows interest to be generated towards the prize pool which you'll hear about more shortly the users themselves are then pooled this pooled mixing event anonymizes all the funds and distributes them appropriately into anonymized burner wallets additionally every time funds are deposited users stand to win a reward as part of the mixing lottery this no loss lottery system incentivizes greater user participation because the larger the pool for mixing the more robust the anonymization at the end of the mixing one or more lucky participants are randomly selected to win the interest from all deposits as a reward and each of the participants receives a unique burner wallet for on-demand spending in dye whirlpool makes participation in pooled anonymization fun because if banks can offer spending incentives so can the decentralized future whirlpool improves customer privacy because we think companies who secretly mine user data and circumvent customer privacy laws should go fl buy a kite whirlpool tornado cache and pool together for the best of both worlds you definitely win best video so far that's uh without a doubt thank you um can can you like walk me through the architecture exactly like is this on is the idea that it goes on main net and it's like um it's a mashup of uh tornado and uh and pull together and then like like how do you how how is i if i give put put money into the contract do i get my burner wallets back like hey do you want to take that one yeah so the idea um mainly is that yes this would ideally be on main net um but yeah um so as far as like technically besides the wallet and the video it's basically yeah taking tornado cash and pool together and kind of mixing them up so that you have the mixing capabilities of tornado cache you know being able to send transactions and then withdraw that transaction later from an unconnected address but also the pull together lottery based system in order to incentivize um since obviously the more people you have using the tornado cash pool the greater the anonymity set um so the lottery part is yeah that would be with the funds are pulled in tornado cash just from people you know trying to mix their funds you also have a chance to win um a pull together style lottery um and the burner well part would be you would withdraw this to your burner wallet um just for extra privacy if you wanted but yeah the idea would that would be a pretty much just like on tornado cache with a similar sort of user flow but along with the capabilities to you know everything pull together can do start award complete award award the prizes to winners all that good stuff okay i got it so the burner wallet is just a reference to you assume that i'm i am doing that into the burner wallet it's just the normal withdrawal process yeah we would like to build this into if you know we were pushing this production making this like a production yet we would like to put build that into the site so that it's just automatically handled for you so that you don't have to handle like setting up another address where that kind of generates it for you got it and so if um putting into production does mean that you have to like make some hard decisions about you know what you know liquidity you need to get the liquidity so the idea is that it would be like 1 8 per month or something or um any any thoughts there like like like tornado has like whatever they have now like 24 options or whatever like between assets and deposit sizes so i assume you'd probably have to concentrate on on a few yeah we would have to do something similar since yeah we want the deposits to be the same um so we'd probably like set up a pool for like 100 or a thousand died but yeah there is issues where like if someone's trying to mix a lot of things you know tornado cash it's nice because you can just create new pools and you have that liquidity to go through um this does kind of segment it to it um i guess you could look into the possibility of setting up different deposit sizes and then merging all the different deposit pools the different tornado caches that you have um mixing not mixing those all together but merging that into a stream one of the reasons why we looked at using ave is because they have capabilities for like redirecting that interest interest stream um so we actually use that at one point in our architecture i think there could be some things you could do with that in order to keep the different deposit sizes while still not sacrificing too much of segmenting all of that right and in pull together you can kind of generate multiple tickets based on your single deposit right so you can scale that your reward back based on your deposit sizes so you can basically pull uh all the uh rewards together across multiple tornado cash contracts that's that's yeah i think this was pretty cool like uh all the hacks related to you know privacy i mean we just need them more and this is exactly what uh what the ethereum community needs uh regarding with the uh a tokens i think that was a smart decision uh to do uh not just because i was looking for ava but also like i'm always wondering about the liquidity thing on the uh uh tornado cash system because like in in one way uh you could even practically use something like like credit credit delegation and pull liquidity without a collateral from from ave and use it somehow in in this system in tornado uh with the possibility of actually not having credit risk in that sense so you could uh provide huge amounts of liquidity for for uh creating this this privacy and there's no issue with with collaterals because it's a kind of like closed loop systems from inside of smart contracts and this is probably something that will become in the future more easier with the credit delegation because now you need to create an external world for that and let people to put a die or like any a token but in the future it's kind of like borrow behalf function that you could you could use but i i think what you guys did mixing like creating the ability to show privately uh like the the idea behind it and and the objective was is fantastic it's just pretty nice thank you thank you great job guys any way to cut down on gas i know that's like my big gripe with all these things [Laughter] uh east 2.0 question mark um yeah we that would be something we would have to think of you know using gas token just kind of the what people are doing to cut down on gas but um yeah there it is kind of an open question since it would be very because you're merging two already complex protocols into three if you ave um into one protocol so yeah gas cost would definitely be something we'd have to think about how to manage that cool okay thank you so much whirlpool uh great project thanks to presentation uh that song is gonna be stuck in my head for the rest of the day uh okay moving on to our last uh project of the day um we've got eat them all so we'll get them on the call and i'll let you take it away and show us your demo hi everyone my name is nemo i'm in front of edam all team we're a team of five people from france and serbia a mix of blockchain engineers web technology developers and designers the main idea for us behind this hackathon was looking at the d5 space and how fast it grew in the last couple of years we saw a need that there is like a lack of education understanding what you can do with the different platforms and protocols and not just the education is a problem but also making experience fun and exciting so we decided to make a platform that is helping people to learn how to use the different protocols by unlocking different achievements and badges through the experience of using these projects and these badges and achievements are represented by non-transferable nfts and nfts so for the sake of the hackathon we used three projects as examples ave compound and uniswap and for each project user can do a particular set of tasks which represents achievements in the case of a compound here we use the deposit borrow depositing more than three or six tokens and also if a user get liquidated for the unislap example we used if the user is liquidity provider for less than one percent of the liquidity pool between one and ten percent and uh ten 10 and more so let's see how it looks like when the user is meeting a token so once the user connects the wallet to the project they can mean particular badge for the different projects so here we are minting a deposit badge same goes for chad badge for the uniswap that represents more than 10 percent of the liquidity providing for a pool and also depositing three or more tokens for the compound pool all of these representations are now stored on the blockchain and these are non-transferable nfts that are tied to the user wallet so for the next steps what we plan to do is add a quest like experience for user in order to get education much higher level we believe that by adding the quest like experience users will have a flow and better learning for different platforms and the projects also when i mention projects what is on the roadmap is adding a lot of other projects as we all know these are just three examples and there is much more d5 projects that are really interesting and needs a better education for the users of course everybody are asking about the fees we are also thinking for the future what are the options to use different l2 solutions to fix those issues and also what is interesting for us to explore is uh potentially a partnership with all of these projects and protocols where a set of these badges would represent a kind of like verification or let's call it social token uh that is giving people access or particular privileges if they achieved something and uh but in our opinion that's only possible in being interested if we manage to partner up with the different protocols thank you for your time and thank you for the opportunity to present in front of you so maybe i missed it is there an like an education piece like is there like tutorials in in there or is that like something you haven't built or yeah we didn't build it so basically the idea for us was like uh just because of the sake of time and everything uh we focused on just giving the example how it would look like but that's next step on the roadmap which is kind of as i said like quest like experience like if you're just starting to you go to the i don't know page and basically they're like explanation roadmap how you can actually do some achievements and unlock different badges for it and in the example there are like non-transferable nfts we didn't do with nfts basically had a huge discussion to do that later it's kind of like what should be a representation of nft that is like transferable and people can sell should we mean for everything or we should kind of like build the rarity between like uh different things that person does on the project yeah so do you i guess that's like my question is do you think of this in the end as more of an educational thing or more of a um like a a badge tracking um i guess like my question in particular is because i feel like people have sort of done like badge tracking whereas like the educational piece is probably harder and probably that's why less people have done it yeah i definitely agree with you like uh two years ago i started with kudos on the git coin and like just learning through that process and that was one of the interesting facts that i believe people are not spending enough time which is more the educational side but i think it's really open to like a huge discussion as i said like with verifications and what you can actually do if you have a wallet that you have a some kind of like a verification of like what person did with a certain protocol which is giving like we saw in syndicate and we were discussing here that like they have like if you're on compound server you can join only if you have like uh the certain asset inside of your wallet and here like i believe that these things can be used by different projects uh to write an api or something that can build on top of these things so i would say education and education and open mind for verification and uh god knows what yeah i mean i was thinking it would be cool for like hiring purposes you could like you know like have you actually done like played around with dpi apps in in real life and it could be cool but yeah i mean and it looks uh it looks cool so great job guys thank you it's fun and i i think like education is really really important in in especially like in dfi uh otherwise the value will be never understood so this is very very cool thing and i i think if you look at one of uh projects in the the uh ava ecosystem arbigachi it's kind of doing this like an ftd fight thing so they're trying to educate actually uh uh people to save uh kind of like funds and the more you save you you kind of unlock your nfds and i can i can definitely see that there's like a lot of value in this and and it's not just like in d5 but in other uh other kinds of like on chain uh functionality yeah it's pretty cool and i think you definitely should go after those kind of like partnerships you know i think d5 protocols are very interested in in education uh there is you know like things like coinbase ernie is doing uh now and trying to educate wider at mass but i think what you guys are trying to achieve is is more valuable yeah thank you great okay well thank you ethamol i think with that we'll wrap the q a and wrap this uh session of judging so appreciate it great project thank you to all the projects that presented for us today thank you to our judges who took time out of their saturday uh to come and give feedback and and look at all your awesome projects so cheers everybody um that is it um of course tune in next friday for the finale and i'm sure we'll be in touch with all the hackers in the discord as well awesome thanks josh thanks everyone bye guys thank you
