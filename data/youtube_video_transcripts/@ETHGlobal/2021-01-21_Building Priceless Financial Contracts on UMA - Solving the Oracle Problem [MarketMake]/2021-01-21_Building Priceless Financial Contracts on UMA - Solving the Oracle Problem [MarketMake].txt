market make week one so i'm glad to have everybody here this session is specifically for uma if you're not familiar with it um it's a way to do well we're gonna learn exactly what it's about but uh you can build synthetics um fon chain [Music] and it's a really interesting protocol so uh hopefully you're here to learn and we have chandler handler decock uh with us and he's gonna be walking us through specifics chandler you want to intro yourself and then um dive into whatever you want to do yeah thank you very much um also thanks for everyone who's joining um uma is really excited to be part of the uh the market make hackathon um we were actually at the previous one last time um and it you know we really enjoyed the experience um a little bit about myself so i'm actually a fairly new member of the um team um my kind of role at the team is meant to try and get um in front of as many people as possible as many developers help grow the ecosystem um and kind of help make sure that we kind of push what we think is a really um like elegant solution to a couple of the problems um that we're seeing in in terms of like the whole defy space so for today quite specifically um are we talking on how to build financial contracts with uma um i'll talk a little bit about our oracle problem and how we solve it um i'll also kind of really dive into some of the aspects of what uma's um like what resources we can give to you to the the hackers um and then a little bit about like how what um is up to um outside of just this hackathon and what you can look forward to from from that perspective um this workshop's not really going to be so much of a heavy demo although we do have some pre-recorded demos that that are still uh really useful for anyone that wants to get into the more technical side of things and also quite like quite open to everyone um just popping questions in in the chat um i've got it up here and we'll kind of you know if if i say something that that uh like quite a uh an interesting question from you please pop it into the chat and i'll we'll get to that as as the kind of presentation comes along uh i do want to um let everyone know that this presentation will also not be the full hour um and so there'll be a lot of time for questions for for me to also kind of point you in the right direction and kind of give um some thoughts on on kind of uh some of the questions that get asked so without like too much uh further ado i'll jump right in so at umo we're trying to build uh these priceless financial contracts uh with what we are calling an optimistic oracle for those who know what ume kind of does um you would have heard us talk about this before but for those who haven't it'll be quite a an interesting experience like let you know a little bit about how how that works um in terms of the new like or just in terms of the d5 space in general um a little bit about the actual presentation itself uh so we just went through the introductions um we'll kind of run through the risk of oracles and d5 anyone any veteran of the d5 space would know this uh problem uh we'll kind of introduce the idea of uma's priceless financial contract design um and then kind of give from that point on how to work on humor so the resources to use some of the processes that that um kind of implement in its governance process and also how you can develop on uma if you are looking for some help where to go how to go and how to go about um you know solving some of those problems that you have if you if you you know get stuck somewhere i've been at multiple hackathons myself where i i just didn't know what to do next when when i found a bug or couldn't figure out something out and and so the idea of that is to kind of help you guys with that and then also some useful bits of information about the space that um finds itself in and what we're busy with at the moment then we'll also talk about prizes and at the end of the the presentation mainly left for you to kind of ask as many questions as possible the overall objective that i'm trying to get across is that um at the end of this presentation you should be set on your path to start developing on uma and and kind of get your get your your hack going along with what you want to build on uma or something that you you're building on some other protocol at the moment at least be somewhat inspired to pull on uma at the moment right so to kind of start um the the idea of of d5 always depends on on what everyone's known as this corruptable um oracle um you know this is our off-chain data uh and kind of the the most like heavily um or the biggest weakest point on on a d5 contract is is these other price feeds or this outside data source and in most of the financial contracts that we build and whether you're building synthetics uh which which we kind of had do most of the time at uma this really makes a big difference in in how your contracts behave and and the the idea of trusting this uh oracle is is kind of the fundamental point of what we're trying to do um at uber and and solve it so the price feed is ultimately um what what many of the the pricing of certain positions in and contracts to have and also what um what the what the amount of collateral that you end up having and how your contracts behave these price feeds typically in in other small contract implementations need like a constant stream of data to be pushed to the contracts to make sure that these contracts are solvable or solvent and and really um make sure that they're of you know sufficient collateral or liquidity and all it really takes is just one bad kind of oracle price and and your position is basically wrecked it also makes it a lot more harder to to build products that are quite sustainable due to price fluctuations maybe it's a short dip maybe it's a it's a power outage or or a kind of an error with a with a price feed multiple of these errors can happen and and there needs to be some sort of remediation process around that um i mean we've seen multiple examples of this in the d5 space um throughout kind of it's it's it's kind of like formulation and and the idea here is to make sure that we can ensure that that there is some sort of dispute resolution mechanism or um what we kind of want to term at um um a data verification mechanism so we can actually verify the data in a more succinct way one of the kind of points that i alluded to was also the this idea of of corrupting the the data source or the oracle and i mean articles have always been the point of weakness and the we we kind of think of it as like what will it cost to actually corrupt this uh um this article and the notion around corrupting the oracle is is is there is a there's a cost around it so we call it the cost of corruption so in in this kind of like image that i've got here it's a bribe to the oracle providers to kind of manipulate the data or or kind of give false data or or yeah whatever it be just kind of uh game the system in their favor the the profit for com from corruption is the p the penalty that ultimately happens as a result of that that that bribe or the or kind of whatever the mechanism that you use and one of the like fundamental points on what uma is trying to do is ensure that through our dispute our data verification mechanism and our optimistic oracle service is that we always make sure that one inequality always holds is that the cost of corruption will always be greater than the profit from corruption we do this through the uma token and the governance structure where the oracle calls are minimized um to to uh specific disputes uh i'll get into that slightly a bit in in kind of a later um slide but but the the kind of the inequality that it always hold is to make sure that the cost of corruption is higher than the proof of corruption so that that's all good and well so the idea of us having um oracle calls for every price dispute won't won't really solve the the d5 problem by having hundreds and hundreds of of these kind of voting um rounds on figuring on what the price of a certain um price feed is and the truth is we don't actually even need that 99 percent or even 99.9 percent of these of the time these price feeds um work in in as intended and as they were meant to be and aren't corrupted and so the the the idea of having to call or push these feeds onto chain um as often as possible is is really an inefficient mechanism and ultimately what we what we've decided to kind of build on with the uma protocol is is this idea of a of a of a a dispute process where someone can dispute their um their their liquidation or or an action on on on the on their contract and it only be escalated in those occasions where clear manipulations happened um and so so if a kind of to give a concrete example and how it particularly works on uma is that if we have a contract i have let's say i'm minting um y dollar with with some weave and i've got a 1.25 collateral ratio and i got liquidated at 2 four 1.244 nine nine nine nine nine and it's it was so close that it's almost um negligible whether whether that was a it was a valid dispute or not and i can then dispute that and then that would be escalated to the dmv or the data verification mechanism and with using the on-chain data as well as the price feed and and kind of the voting structure of the uma token holders we can ultimately resolve whether that dispute was sufficient or not but in terms of like the normal course of business ultimately all the the oracle calls should be minimized to only the ones that actually have a tangible value for being corrupted the the real kicker here is to kind of really minimize the oracle usage because the true fact is that most of the oracle services even though that they're not fully decentralized operate with the idea of being a reliable source of information so what do we mean by the idea of a priceless contract and why do we think that that's more performant is that the these price fees are not the only source of information that that a a contract can use it obviously uses the dispute uh the the data verification mechanism as a true source of data but then there's this proxy of the price feed meaning that ultimately the value of the contract isn't being determined by the price feed and we we then can use the dmv to resolve any issues as a result of it actually then making the contract in itself priceless and that's kind of where we call um why we call the idea of contracts priceless and also why we call the the data verification mechanism an optimistic article it's based on the optimism that that the uma token holders vote in the best interest for keeping the contract secured in the correct way and that ultimately forms forms part of like the the game theoretic argument on why the cost of corruption um must always be great sorry the yeah the cost of corruption has always be greater than the proof of corruption um if those terms that i'm mentioning and kind of the the the the game theory mechanics behind that is something that you guys are quite interested in knowing more about um happy to have that chat uh with with anyone that's interested on our discord um i personally find it really really interesting um to kind of go through um but but i kind of breezed through that fairly quickly so so that's a little bit about like what um is trying to do um and and now i just want to kind of like take a second um just to dive into uh how to work on um for the hack specifically um and and what what kind of what you can expect from from the uma team going forward um so obviously you know you've got to come up with a project idea that's on you um i think the the the most common thing for for the dev to do next is is really read the docs um kind of that's step number two it should actually be step number one um i often you know start with step two and then get the idea for the project post that but that's really um up to the team um when you get started with your project i've always noticed that you inevitably hit a roadblock and that's that's ultimately where you need some help or somebody that's a bit more familiar with the protocol and kind of piecing it together in your particular hack and that's where you really get to chat with us and so i'll kind of like give you some some starting um resources but also if you want to have a more like direct conversation with the uma team like we will kind of run through how how that typically works all right so way to chat with us um we obviously on the youth um global discord that's uh on the we sponsor on the channel so a couple people have been chatting with us on their ideas from of of their ideas on that channel that's a really great um spot uh also heads uma's discord we have our very own discord where uh actual developers that are developing on uma have um built their own kind of contracts um and are kind of running with with a lot of projects there also the um team hang out there quite a lot so it's a very uh useful place to get like developer-centric questions uh in there and the specific channel there is the developer question um also if you if you if you're not so much of a developing but you're more of an eye you know idea you're the ideas um person um but you think that your question might make you look silly because it's very very obvious um we also actually got you covered on that one and there's some there's a channel there called no stupid questions and that's specifically tailored to the uh to the person that thinks that their their question might make them look silly actually we you know we we think um all questions are welcome and ultimately like you know wall better ask one super question at some point um and then lastly i think the the important part for us to kind of like convey to to all the hackers is that we really want to help you like it's in our best interest to help you and it's in your best interest to ask questions for us and then ultimately the idea is to grow grow the ecosystem um of of kind of like just you know making sure that you you guys as hackers really understand what you want to build on uma and also what we can do for you guys it's a it's a two-way learning street kind of and i've always really been keen to to like cure what ideas people come up with in these hackathons um right so some of the the resources that are available um uh the dark side as i mentioned uh it gets an idea on what um is uh it's quite comprehensive taking you through kind of the starting points of what i mentioned earlier in the chat around what uma is trying to achieve what we call priceless contracts what we're calling our optimistic oracle there is also development guides there there's a tutorial um the tutorial we can kind of represent you in two ways so there is a getting started tutorial with sean um this is specifically a linked video to the previous um hackathons tutorial where we went through a tech demo i felt that that was a really useful demo that's still pertinent for today and so we can um kind of use that demo uh as well and i'll share by the way all these slides and links will be shared in the channel afterwards for anyone that's that's wanting to make use of these um these resources uh recommendations start that video ten minutes in um that tutorial that sean runs through is the exact same tutorial that we have uh set up on our doc sites and if you're a bit more technical and really want to get into the weeds and the the github channel or the github um repo for for uma is is the place to go all right and things i kind of want to like maybe just point people to to specifically uh part of this is really to make sure that you get um the the kind of the most in in terms of like the first steps into um getting your hacks in a space that that's quite like elegant first one is that development guide so so the development guide starts off with the tutorial it's it's very basic um getting you started with a test network where you can make use of our contracts and also our contract templates and also you you can make your own synthetic um at the end of that tutorial which is quite useful it takes roughly 20 minutes to set up um if you've never done a kind of if you're hacking from a from a very beginner level it might take 30 to 40 minutes but somebody that's done this can actually even get it set up in five minutes so so really great start to get um done kind of like get the ball rolling from that perspective and the other one that's really important for people to to kind of get their head around is is how to interface with our data verification mechanism um once you feel comfortable with the idea of how the priceless contracts work and kind of understand conceptually what the optimistic article is uh the data verification mechanism is actually how how the optimistic article has been implemented and so this link here is is to kind of really push you down um that avenue um and how how you would actually ultimately interface with that um well i also add added here that understand economics of the optimistic article why does this inequality of of the cost of corruption always being greater than the proof of the the profit from corruption being like so fundamental to to um how the contracts on uma are secured and then also there's a a a list of um price ids i'll get into uh what a price id is is later but ultimately um has done a lot of um kind of approved price ids that people can use for for the contracts or for any synthetic they want to create on us all right so that's kind of like some of the resources that you can make use from the hack um again the links will be shared so you can kind of take um you can take the the slides from from today and use that but but also i kind of want to let people know about what what are the processes to know for for after the hack and and how how do you want to work with with uma after the hack um there are some it's not really valuable for the hack but there are some really interesting nuances on how the dmv works with the liquidator and disputer bots um those are designed to secure the system i'll run into a bit more on what that means um an umap for for price ids i'll run into that slightly as well how the voting works and and like one of the things that i'm personally really excited about is is the developer mining um initiative at uma so liquidator and disputers are are basically just bots that that scan contracts scan people scan the um the positions in these contracts and decide based on the parameters of the contract if these contracts are liquid enough or not and ultimately the the liquidator will then liquidate a position if it believes that that position is liquidatable um if it's below the collateralization ratio and if it's not then the the disputed bot can then dispute that and that if the disputed bot it has like sufficient proof um which is fairly easy to do if in the calculations uh that that gets escalated to the data verification mechanism and ultimately the uma token holders will vote on that um but this the interplay between the liquidator bots and the disputer bots is fundamental to securing the the contracts on um on the dmv and also this interplay is what we've done um to kind of minimize the number of oracle calls in total um we also actually run interestingly enough purposeful liquidation opportunities on on contracts and these are done for for many two reasons one is to test that these contracts get liquidated uh often enough and are actually being monitored by a bot um and we also want to incentivize more people to run bots it's not really a very secure system if one company or the the owner of the contract is the only bot runner um we we need to sufficiently secure them these contracts by having third parties and and ultimately more people running bots on these contracts uh specifically if they hold a lot of of um blocked value in them uh the uma improvement proposal uh which is what we call an umap um this is basically just a a stock standard proposal for you to put forward to the uma team to improve something in the ecosystem uh not really uh too much in terms of of of like brainpower to think about that um the the most common type of umip is a price feed id um i mentioned that earlier a price feed id is just what what you decide that your contracts price feed would be um we've got a list of approved ones already and the the uma process can be whatever you decide to be obviously a price id is a very um standardized aspect so that will be kind of done in a template fashion but if you want to create something weird and wonderful and we've had a few interesting umebs that come around on on the uma protocol on whatever financial derivative that you you think is is going to be quite interesting um you can work with the team and and kind of put forth this boomer to to have the data verification mechanism uh secure that contract um the process is really just a draft a last call um on on on the details uh once it's been finalized will be put forward for a vote and then approved obviously because there is a vote there are unsuccessful states and most of the time it's either abandoned or rejected um but but most of the time the uh the the umips that are of high quality are really the only ones that that passed the draft stage voting the this is a really important part um all the um um um and dmv calls are sent to uma token holders to vote uh if you are an owner of an uh token uh of a uma token um you have the privilege of um having your tokens come towards the the the votes that that ultimately help secure the disputes and also help improve the process um that that governs the the uma contracts it's done through a two key contract um i've added a link here for anyone that's interested in perhaps you know if they have um tokens and are keen to to start um voting i've also added here it's a bit more of an ancillary ad but um and but ultimately the the the dmv enforces the the outcome of the vote to the contract in itself um and the value of the the voting tokens in um in the uma protocol is the what we were calling the cost of corruption meaning you have to earn more than 51 of all uma tokens uh to be able to effectively gain control of the voting structure um i i see there's two questions on the on the chat around the the discord channels i'll i'll actually add them to the chat at the end of it um but just to kind of let those two people know is um the channel on the uh global [Music] discord is the uma sponsor channel feel free to chat there and then also if you go to um the uma project uh home page you'll be able to get a link to uma's discord on that discord in developer questions is the place to ask any developer rated questions and if you have any other type of question that that kind of relates to to some of the stuff um that i've been talking about there is the no stupid questions um part of it which is really designed to um kind of let people ask what they think might be an obvious statement but but you know you for the life of you can't figure that out cool all right developer mining i think this is part of the thing that i'm most excited to talk about today personally um so we if you if you're familiar with the d5 space liquidity mining has been uh kind of the top running way of of phrasing um how to get more liquidity into the d5 space and so we use this term to to kind of just change it up and kind of find ways to attract developers and really it's about giving them capital so um the link here is to the article that announces it it's on our medium channel um but ultimately what it what it boils down to is that we're giving away 50 000 um tokens weekly um i put a you know a loable figure of eight dollars per token um i think it's currently trading at around 10. um but average you know over the lifetime of movements roughly around eight and these go to the developers that ultimately build contracts and and have these contracts secured by the dmv um this benefits us by having more developers uh developing on on uma uh it also uh increases the total locked value um that is also the key metric on on how we measure the contracts that get built um and and we we then kind of like work with these teams to to kind of get their contracts deployed in in wonderful ways i've also got a link later on where you can see who some of uma's partners are and what contracts are being uh secured by the dmv at the moment and um optimistic oracle so you know after looking at the slide you kind of want to know how to get started uh the discord channel is is kind of the first one um first place to kind of just pop a question saying hey i'm interested in developer mining there is a specific channel on on the on the discord for developer mining uh we normally just send you a quick like google form link that that you then populate just giving us a rough idea of what it is you're trying to build uh we we kind of talked to you about it and we really take it from there um and then we kind of do what we can to help support you um in kind of getting more uh locked value i really suspect that that some of the ideas that are coming out of the the hackathon are prime candidates for for kind of this developed mining and many of the ideas that quite a few of um of the teams they've been chatting to me about would like really do well in terms of this um kind of uh program that that um is running so we are going to be running this uh virtually for as long as we you know we we realistically can um handing out the ume token to more people also helps with the voting process that i mentioned earlier helps decentralize the the token and also because your contract is being secured by the uma token there is this positive reinforcement effect from the people that are developing on uma um some other useful information on some of the stuff that we've been doing um ulabs is a is a an idea um generator obviously the um the the uma protocol obviously has to be quite like thorough and and kind of you know well executed and and but the uma team also come up with like their own weird and wonderful ideas and so we spun out this idea called ulabs uh where we created the ugas token um what we what we kind of want to use this kind of this branding of this idea is an idea generator uh people can come to us with their ideas we can we can kind of create our ideas as well but we really want to make sure that that process of getting those ideas into the real world works through a community uh focus and and so um the idea of ulabs is to kind of help generate more ideas of different types of financial products that are not just a synthetic or not just a derivative but they kind of really push the creativity on some of the interesting ideas that can happen um some of the ideas have come out of uma themselves the idea of us um hedging gas we call it ugas the link that i've added here really helps how to kind of like give a description of what we did uh to build a you guys product we also have a series of developer bounties so if you enjoy kind of uh looking deep into our code and trying to kind of break it we encourage that with some developer bounties and ultimately we don't want any more um dial hacks we also have a series of partners so these are some of the people that have already received developer mining rewards uh they have created their own contracts and their own um services on uma i really encourage you to go see some of their ideas maybe it inspires one of uh or two of yours and then there's also the uh just like what we're kind of kind of just branding named tbd but ultimately it's this bounties program where we want to help the community create uh tools that help the ecosystem so whether it be um a kind of a total value lock dashboard or a um kind of dashboard of all the opportunities that are present on uma contracts whatever it be but that ultimately helped like the community to kind of create more tools on that uh we have a bounty's channel on discord where we're exploring a couple cool ideas so if you think you can create a cool like like useful tool or a script that that kind of um helps not just the uma team but the kind of community in its health in itself we're really excited to hear about that so um feel free to pop some messages there um if you're interested in kind of exploring some creative ideas cool then more specifically to the to the eth um on sorry the the mega um market make hackathon um and we'll be awarding a three thousand dollar award uh for all uh for the best hack um uh it's not just uma that will be selecting this we'll actually be using the the the um um token holders to to kind of help um sorry two community members to help with this so if you're a part of that community feel free to to vote for yourself with your idea uh and and kind of um we want to make sure that the umo community really kind of appreciate some of the cool ideas that that will be generated out of this hackathon a link to this will also come out closer to the time uh i hope you got kind of a quick and like you know reasonable overview of what um is trying to do um i think it's very very focused around collaboration community driven um approach which is kind of really really important for us to make sure that we we we acknowledge all the the awesome ideas that come out of it um so kind of best place to kind of chat with us for the hack specifically would be the umo sponsor channel um we do have a two twitter accounts one for the uma protocol specifically so that's the cool things that we develop then also if you are um token holder you can um we have a uma uh governance twitter account um which will kind of you know give you tweeted reminders to vote and and let you know the outcomes of the votes um our website's pretty um has just recently been revamped so um go check out some of the cool updated uh products or that have launched on um uh the dark side kind of mentioned that a couple of times and then github is is where we also kind of like spend quite a lot of our times if you're more developer centric just to let you kind of know a little bit about the team that you'll be chatting to um on these various discord sites um and kind of some of the support that you'll be getting uh we've got matt in our engineering team uh dave nick and chris are all engineers that you know kind of help build the uma protocol um and then from from the community uh team perspective we have clayton shawn tom and henry uh they kind of answer more of the questions that are are you know designed for for the idea generation kind of bouncing ideas off people um and then for the more technically savvy obviously the engineering team cool so that's that's my kind of chat um hope you guys took something away from that um i'd like to obviously encourage anyone to ask a bunch of questions if they have any um and yeah really excited about being here great yeah that was an excellent overview some a few things that i wasn't aware of but good to learn um yeah like chandler said there's time for questions i don't see any new ones from the ones you've already addressed but if anybody real quick wants to bring that up if not obviously the discord is is where we'll head next if you have questions about integrating it for your project or something you can't really figure out um and i think you you mentioned chandler that these slides with all their links will be available you'll put that in there yeah so i'll post this uh this slide deck in the um the sponsor channel and i'll um i'll also share in the in the uma discord i see a question on um what's my discord name it's chandler you should see that on both the uma sponsor group and also the um uma discord so uh nothing too fancy in terms of my name you if you can spell it like you did you can find me on discord um and then uh the next question is could you walk through an example of the project using uma and the value uma added to this project um yeah great idea so so the the degenerative finance guys really like like the idea of you gas so i'll use you guys as an example um because it came out of you lab so it'll just kind of give an overview of how this process worked so we wanted to create a synthetic that that tracked gas prices ultimately giving the person a um a a useful way to hedge um the gas prices so that you know you can kind of help with whatever um you needed gas price you know whatever your use case was um so we came up with the synthetic and do to do that and uh it was kind of our idea and because it was our first one out of ulad we also did quite a lot of the development around that and obviously it was secured by by the the dmv um the guys that generally really liked the idea and we then took um they kind of took over it and and kind of adopted it will kind of take control of the contracts and and really run with with that process so that was one project that got used uh they use the ulabs kind of like incubator idea incubator another one is um synthetic bitcoin cash through through the mario cache guys um and then we've got quite a few other ones um if you if you want anything more specific than that i'll more than happily um answer that um in in the discord um also it's a great place to kind of also get to chat with some of the people that are actually developing on um um another question around do we have the link presentation uh not right now but i'll share that link with with everyone on the discord after this oh great um i think this is any last minute questions we can probably wrap here a few logistics things um let's see so this was the the last uh sponsor workshop that we have scheduled for market make so kudos to everybody who showed up to a bunch of them throughout the week hopefully they were helpful um all the recordings for any of the sessions including this one will be available and are currently on the youth global youtube channel so if you missed something or you want to go back and and you know re-listen to a segment that you didn't quite uh get you can go back at any time and catch the videos there tomorrow is our first feedback session so what we do for the hackathon is we run weekly sessions where teams can come and present to uh in for market make we have the ave team and a few other people so come sign up for that session you should have gotten an invite a few days ago and this week is going to be idea validation so if you haven't settled on an idea or you want feedback on the structure of your project please come to that it's at 10 a.m eastern and that's the time we're going to stick with for the next few weeks next week will be i believe a demo feedback and then the final week will be pitch feedback so really great opportunity for you to get some external perspective from people who aren't your team members or other hackers highly recommend coming up to those um i think that should be it thank you chandler this was really great like i said um and you will be available in the discord for anything that wasn't covered and any questions that that need to be further discussed cool thank you very much guys see
