c c so so c welcome everybody my name is kartik and i'm luke and we're going to be your mcs today for the storage providers summit we couldn't be happier to have all you with us in attendance today so we're watching all of this at on equable.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is what we're going to be using for all of today's talks and we encourage all of you to log in and engage with all of our speakers you'll be able to ask any questions here and we'll be able to relate those questions directly to all of our talks for everybody who also logs in and engages we're also giving out a pull up nft token so be sure to uh say hi to us the speakers and the global team so this summit is part of hack fs and hack fs is a month-long event which is a hackathon in a few summits for the hackathon we have over 650 developers from 61 different countries spending 18 different time zones building the latest and the greatest on ipfs and falcoin and just whatever creative things that are possible now with web3 and also part of this hackathon we're doing two summits highlighting the incredible things happening in the protocol labs ecosystem last friday uh the sixth we did our builder's day summit and today we're going to be focusing on storage providers and talking about that side of the ecosystem so let's get into what today is all about we have some amazing talks for the next few hours and we're super excited to share what we're going to cover we're going to kick the day off by talking about what the business opportunities are on the storage side and we're going to do a panel covering different different aspects of being a storage provider then we're going to have another panel about what does it mean to invest in 203 startups and what do investors think about when they are looking to uh build and fund companies then we'll have zx talk about what does it mean to bridge with falcoin and all the new things that are possible with that three then we'll have michelle cover how you can actually take advantage of the grants opportunities in the ipfs and alcohol and ecosystem and further along your projects uh in a non-dilutive way and lastly we'll have deep and gail and talk about falcoin plus they have some amazing announcements planned for for you today um and i can't wait for everybody to share the amazing things that they want so with that let's jump right into our very first talk uh this panel is designed to or just it's titled business opportunities and storage site and we have charles stewart kevin and neo as our panelists and moderating this chat will be stefan and uh i'll let stefan and all of our panelists introduce themselves um now so without further ado please welcome all of our panelists so i'll ask all of you to turn your videos on and we'll go right into our talk perfect thank you so much cardik uh before we start today first of all welcome i'm very excited to discuss a little bit more in detail of the business opportunities on the storage provider side i want to talk about like how i look at the falcon ecosystem two weeks ago um i had the opportunity to look at the sky with one of my friends who's an astronomer and you know when you live in a city like myself here in san francisco can be foggy it can be really hard because of light pollution to actually see the stars in the sky we were kind of wandering through the sky with this new telescope and uh we kind of landed on this really cool region called omega nebula and as i'm trying to explain to him what falcone is and what we do here every day day in day out and he's trying to explain to me all the different galaxies and the cool stuff that he's working on as an astronomer we kind of landed on omega nebula as being like that you know that place where we connected because if you look at this region it's one of the most brightest and massive star-forming regions uh closest to our galaxy that we that we are that we know of today and it creates all these new stars and so when it's looking at it and i was like hey what what is this call he's like well it's omega nebula it's a nursery of stars and i'm like wow that's exactly how i look at falcon right what we're doing here at hackafast what we're doing with the whole ecosystem is exactly this we're building new companies uh we're building new stars and you know i thought it was really cool uh and also we had a long conversation on how he should be storing all these images because actually this is a real image from that telescope here in my backyard uh two weeks ago how he should be storing it on falcon of course so that's uh the next conversation we'll have with his engineers so uh today what do we want to focus on um as innovation happens across the universe within fall coin not just on the front side by creating new applications we also look at the storage provider side there's a lot of opportunity there the storage provider we have now more than 2 700 storage providers and growing every single day they thought it would be interesting to to bring a couple of providers to the table and have a uh a conversation around where innovation can happen there as well and so you know as you can look at this universe uh we'll talk a little bit more about infrastructure as a service onboarding of data data protection etc as we onboard more customers to our platform so let me uh welcome neo charles kevin and stuart to our panel session today and uh very happy to have you here so let's uh kick it off but a first question for uh neo um neo you're part of ipfs maine you have a ton of falcon power you've been adding a lot of falcon fiber to the network um what's interesting to me is like you know you've kind of started in china but can you tell us a little bit more about how bfs maine has reinvented itself since the start of mainnet and where you see opportunities for some of these newer startups yeah absolutely uh thank you so much stephen for the great introduction uh actually fun fact about myself when i was a little kid my dream job is to be in an external flying spaceship among the stars and that's very useful galaxies you're sharing there yeah um so just about myself just a brief intro i'm leo g from ipfs main we are one of the sponsors of hack fs 2021 and we sponsored this same hackathon last year as well the reason we like so much about haccfs is that we find it's a really great place to find new business opportunities of cyberspace both ipf ipfs main and myself invested projects from the hackerfest last year and we're planning to do the same thing this year as well well as a storage provider we used to call it a miner we started all the way from the beginning of five network and currently we are bearing over 300 petabyte capacity and looking to expand globally now we have over 90 percent of the capacity located in china and if you stand from the client's point of view it's not very good practice to have such centralized storage even though they are distributed between different data centers but it's still within one continent well most storage clients focus on availability and durability so we built a full set of customized lotus uh sealing algorithm optimization and storage solution to ensure that clients data is available when needed and protected against failures and errors but more importantly is that we start to shift our focus to support other regions like north america and europe and in spite of you know uh different crypto friendly or unfriendly policies i believe global expansion of faicoin storage providing service is inevitable in long term so we are happy and looking forward to working with local fico and storage provider groups in different continents with our expertise of bicoin storage providing services great thanks so that's fantastic to hear and i think you brought up a really good point is that it's a very strong community right um so you know multiple storage providers work together across multiple regions so when you design products or when you design solutions you have to keep that in mind because as you mentioned clients are looking at protecting their data across multiple regions multiple countries etc the other thing you mentioned which i want to comment to is that we call this the storage provider uh panel session because as you mentioned uh we prepared a proposal the community put a proposal together to rebrand the miners terminology to storage provider again to be closer to the end customer because that's really what all of you are doing which is providing a storage service and and then some cool yes next to the next i want to bring charles thank you so much ania charles the next question is for you um your company has been you know sort of evolved right from being a storage provider also to a solutions provider uh you know when you're working with enterprise companies you you kind of figured out that onboarding data um you know is not always that easy so you found ways to innovate and help your customers to bring data on board faster can you give us an example of what challenges you have seen to deliver a good storage service and what applications have you built please please educate us because you have some great stuff there yeah like first one is based in montreal canada we have well we were a storage provider before we provide about 10 nodes in north america for three different data for our clients so early this year we found that there are so many clients have big interest in fracking storage science with verified data fragrance can provide almost free for other clients they know this news and they feel excited about it but however that was barrier for them because those industrial customers during the time for example the big data processing or machine learning they have a large demand of data but however that existing structure was building on the centralized cloud platform like the amazon google cloud what is the one is that they their engineers wanted to migrate to freighton effortless so which means that they need uh some framework tools or platforms to help build migration give example of a local ai company for the clinton standard air train site ai they're doing algorithm they have a huge amount of data labeling on their network company storage on the aws spends about thousands of dollars per month then for street but when they migrated to fragrance the first question is that their data scientists have been getting used to using s3 as the framework so they upload download and there are lots of dual development based on i3 now the questions come to us that if they cannot doing this migration easily with a 10k solution for example one day we were being so afraid of doing that so what do we do is that we're building the entire solution for them we're building the cache layer for them to upload to the to access and read the data access from the storage to computing we're building the s3 compatible interface to us called the fs3 it is a gateway to make to migrate your existing data from aws to apis then through the bracket backup to fractal network without much human direction but also building the aging environment for them to secure data in a caching environment during encryption before they upload the private network with those i also provide them the api access because developers is getting used to api access is not like the normal under customers like they were using web interface so they want to have those kind of an awesome permission based access for some specific data so without all those help they'll be able to start migrating then we also help them to building some apply for some backgrounds while they are building the tools so they get a support from the private confrontation another interesting thing that they have company currently located in china which is using alicloud as a bridge to send the data from china to canada which is a great lot of cost when they're using that protocol for transport because icloud charge a large amount did um a large amount of money when you're doing the transportation across candidates with the freight one we have so many nodes over 3000 storage providers across the world and we have so much power in china so all of them most of them willing to provide those services for free so with this advantage they'll be able to downgrade their costs by 70 percent without uh impact over their business so that's why we see that this frank one and ffs are great to us but we really need us as solution providers to give them greater tools to accelerate their development excellent i i like you brought up a ton of good points here one is that you know what i'm hearing is that storage providers like yourself are also innovating right by bringing more interfaces and make it easier for customers to onboard so you know also um secondly is that you know the ingest of being sorry the egress right from existing cloud providers is expensive and anything that we can help with that making that easier um you know so that you know more data can be ingested in even different formats because one of the unique items of falcon here is that you have that you know unique id and you know it doesn't really matter if it came in through an s3 interface or of a virtual file system or or a custom sdk cool um thank you thank you for that charles so kevin uh kevin you're at picnic um you know one of the things i kind of mentioned already is that the provider community is very strong right very interconnected uh one thing that keeps me impressing is how you know how collaborative everyone is also for this panel session was so easy to like have the support from everyone to to communicate and sit on this panel um you for sure have been engaged with with onboarding and and data movement of some large customer data sets and petabyte scale can you give us some examples and uh educate the team on what you've seen there yeah certainly so um i wanted to acknowledge that over my years of participating in the blockchain space the falcon ecosystem is uh definitely one of the most collaborative open source communities um so first thanks to you stefan protocol and hack fest for inviting the picnic team to today's panel quick intro so picnic is a san diego headquartered cloud storage venture and our mission is to set the enterprise standard for web3 infrastructure so that you know all the blockchains of today they're not spinning up nodes and validating off of amazon web services and using centralized infrastructure so uh to your point you know picnic we are really lucky to be a part of numerous teams throughout the falcon ecosystem helping some of the coolest pioneers on board their data sets onto filecoin so the first example that comes to mind is starling lab which is a joint venture between the university of southern california showa foundation and the stanford department of engineering um and they aim to protect human history by leveraging filecoin as the archival layer to their data stack so my team and i have been supporting them and preparing among you know many various things the movement of their data sets the egress from where they are today you know starting from tape storage right when you have petabytes of data it's not easy to go digital especially if you're talking at that scale it's not easy to source the data of that scale it's not easy to get it to the multiple storage providers when we say 3000 on falcon how do you get it to them right across a blockchain network so that starling is able to enjoy decentralization and redundancy of copies but it's going to happen it's been happening it's it's been brilliant um so it's been a really exciting time for all of us in the fall point community um i can think of so many other other projects we're working on but i'll cut it there so that we can share some time with other folks on the panel yeah great great kevin so basically data management like you said right and and data onboarding just like in other cloud cloud offerings today when you're moving petabytes in capacity you can move it fast sometimes sneaker net is the fastest way to do it um but you know the whole management the data management aspect around that is where you know we see a lot of opportunity um i think you know that will sort of uh get disrupted as well all the traditional tools today by the way charge a ton of money like you know if you go to some of the traditional i don't want to make call out any names but um so i think there's a ton of opportunity there as well stu thank you so much kevin stu um you have been an early adopter of falcon right and have extensive security networking experience what recommend what recommendations do you have for the team here and for the audience when it comes to security networking in this space i think your own needs too somebody had to do that so hopefully everyone's heard that yesterday there was a large uh break-in to poly networks it's a defy provider and they uh there were 600 million dollars worth of uh their stuff taken and most of it's been returned it's an interesting story so the security stuff is always uh you know in the news lately um i do want to break it down to some of the pieces uh first of all if we start with the actual blockchain and and filecoin that's been well proven it's been wholly tested we don't see a security issue there so we don't worry about that but then we look at the different components such as storage providers like at picnic you know we have to be concerned about the physical security of the hardware we have to be concerned about um all the things that uh a normal provider be concerned about uh denial of service attacks um protecting that inbound p2p uh connections into the network through some kind of firewall uh of course you know your hardware os is you know you protect all the systems that you're running so that uh you know your your system's secure then the other component is on the client side and in our ecosystem the client is the one sending data into the file coin network to the storage provider so that has to be protected uh one of the big concerns we have and i think the poly network breach tells you about you know protecting your wallets so you have to do everything from making sure others can't access it proper use of the wallets where you store them and of course protect the keys and not losing the keys so everything like you would expect from a normal operation uh you know backups backup of those keys the um the wallets um and then on the network side as kevin mentioned you know we're talking large volumes of data so if we just look at having to transfer a pib of data a pebbite of data if you have a 10 gigabit connection to the internet that takes about nine days to move uh a pip and on the internal side the network requirements even higher you know we're typically looking at 40 to 100 gigabits per second internal connections because the massive amounts of data so hopefully that's a good overview thank you yeah no great stewart i think you know what you're highlighting is you know in every single stack every single layer every single step of uh implementing a a systems or a storage provider infrastructure you you see opportunity for um for improvement um let's let's go back to uh neo so neo um what are where do you think you know the web three future you know leads uh or leaders um should be focusing on in building out new businesses abroad and maybe like what's your view from ipfs means perspective um well technically there are two types of tools um application and infrastructure i believe both of them are are equally important to web 3 ecosystem and on the current fico network there are a lot more capacity than storage so it means that there is a huge amount of capacity basically for free for hackers to use if they choose to use a web 3 power network with the free storage or you know even potentially negatively priced storage well it's a fit proposal that allows storage providers to set negative prices for verified storage deals and that will unlock lots of innovative applications or smart contracts that built directly on top of filecoin network after you know as evm or other vms into vicod um as for the infrastructure aside from the data management uh kev i mentioned earlier i believe as more and more storage providers start to take real storage deals contract management tooling will become super handy especially for large-scale storage providers uh content content filtering system would be essential as well people will start to realize how important this is when the data is against local legislation you know lots of storage providers in china have this hesitation when they couldn't verify the data so they just don't take sort deals at all uh also like one mentioned earlier on the composer default could take market orders like a bids deals asks and leverage the dex decentralized exchange to to see how the market really values these orders and with this sort of ability the ecosystem will be able to begin come up with hardware futures you could do futures on hard drives sscs and gpus and so on or even space-time futures which is wild as you could actually do features on the storage contracts themselves i'm super excited to see what happens when that majors very cool yeah i know i think you brought up some really good points like filtering data qualifying data in an automated scalable way you know guaranteeing that certain data is legit etc and then optimization all the way on the back end stack as well like you know tuning for hardware definitely um lots of opportunity chip sets right customized chipsets all of that um will eventually help us get um ahead right and and provide more compute capabilities as well uh down the road um thank you so let's go back to uh charles so charles i mean one of the things that you know we kind of you you're a big you know uh proponent of this is um how you're building right this stack of services and and are able to compete against hyperscalers so any suggestions and opportunities of where i started to focus on in helping you know the falcon ecosystem and and competing against the hyperscalers that you have some very specific you know talking tracks there let's uh let's go through it yeah like we are very exciting to [Music] working with fragrant network because we see that there are huge opportunities in our fractal network uh in my opening practicum for now is not just as one of the biggest uh or even the biggest security network they also has numerous of computing resources as well memory gpu and the cpu they're all hyper performance servers so with those other resources we're actually not just building the one of the largest storage network we are also we become one of the largest computing network across the world which means that potentially like uh fragment error can competing with all the existing cloud systems like aws google and azure whatever there are so many limitations about those centralized cloud systems process their source code is all closed photos which means that you don't really know what they perform behind the scene do they take your data if they're using your privacy for business purpose it is the is your data really belongs to yourself we want to [Music] retrieve your data where you get it all those questions you don't know right but the refresh on everything open source you have any doubts you can trigger the code if you want to edit something you can write your own code and keep it on the network so with this one like uh also we have we said we currently have almost 700 nodes which is active on the network you can reach and the more than 200 node accepting data imagine how many data centers aws and google has just the 20 data centers across the world how many regions pregnant we which if you check the fest by today we cross the 18 time zone we have more than 600 teams and we have so many providers across the world we can build the largest decentralized storage and computer network so for the lots of startups who want to join this great network you can think about how can we change all the service current clusters provided are doing to our network for example live here they are doing the video live stream and transcoding right they can use the frag network to insert your mining but it was is ongoing like us we're doing the storage providers with the fx3 trying to replace the current s3 storage and we're also building the age computing framework to replace the aws snowboard snow family services and there are still thousands of opportunities there for example the city and services the cloudfront services cloud monitoring services and other services like uh loading balancer service all those opportunities which is currently provided at the blast or other cloud services we can do it on franklin world which is even better we have so many storage providers with verified data you get storage free can we get computing free as well in the future i would say that's possible we need a good economic model we have more potential beauty think about the decentralized which is driving by the community economic model compared to those four profit only companies there's a huge advantage and also trust will have more trust than them because we are open source code everybody the storage is really ground you did that is you didn't it's another data is aws yeah so those are the opportunities and the focus i think starts working on and growing the entire community under the network thank you thank you charles and one thing that i know you and i talked about this but um and you mentioned it already is the the infrastructure as a service that you're you know you're looking to build right over time as a storage provider so it's not just what we're seeing right now in the storage provided world is you're not just a falcon storage provider you're actually building extra services with other blockchains and so you could look at all of our storage providers as the future managed service providers of of the next decade that will have multiple stacks of blockchains collaboratively working in the same data center offering you know all sorts of services but it all starts with getting that data first because that's where all the magic happens right so bringing them the compute close to the data like you said um is quite interesting um the next question is for thank you thank you charles um very excited to see what your your team is working on and what you come up with what you will come out with next uh let's go to uh to kevin so what are some of the problems you're seeing kevin and what are some of the business opportunities that you would uh recommend teams to focus on yeah that's that's a really great question so i think like charles is saying the panelists performing it's about better integrations and architecting solutions that make sense to the market as it stands today i mean he fired off a lot of the big keywords that a lot of the big players hyperscalers i mean as part of the web3 trend thoughtline is decentralized um it has different technological requirements to work but there's this gap it's this void where here's here's your web 2 user today the folks who are used to using hyperscalers and then there are the web3 technologies like filecoin and you have to traverse them if you're one of those data generators or storage users when we we ourselves all of us in this call are used to these de facto cloud tools like s3 from amazon or from the view of today's i don't know thousands tens of thousands of storage architects this admins everywhere whether you're academic whether you're government or private i mean we all use the same data movers over and over the same few names you've got veeam backup restore you've got rclone rubric netbackup and it's that's it right there's so much business opportunity if an entrepreneur like one of you in the audience can bridge that gap that i mentioned so you can build the arsenal of tools that allow web2 users to not even notice that they've migrated to web3 they've gotten over that void because they're now on falcon it's just that seamless also on that note um another thing is knowing how to use or interface with filecling or any web3 technology if you're used to web2 they're proprietary but you're used to them it's you i mean the msps have gone out there the trainers the different big hyperscalers put out business development for training sessions for the different segments but with web3 with fileclone you have to understand wallet management token economics etc the list goes on an entrepreneurial idea would be to aggregate those new knowledge requirements into a new system role so that again the web 2 user doesn't even notice that they've migrated to what three they just know their data is decentralized they can pick us dollars fiat to the popcorn storage provider or et cetera to charles team uh who integrates many different things for fox part of the offerings um and that's an entirely separate role in the web3 ecosystem um and then i think the last thing i wanted to mention you said the word opportunity uh i think it's just tremendous i want to take a step back and really paint how big it storage is i'm sorry kevin kevin sorry sergeant rob you've heard a lot of static noise from the microphone not sure if uh you were on a roll there i love that by the way that's it i hate i hate to interrupt you because it's such a you're making such a uh great um you're making such a great topic there wait so can you check your microphone quickly and then we'll we'll try again yeah how's that how's this oh perfect awesome okay yes my apologies um i just wanted to make sure i made that point for all of you in the audience one of the most incredible opportunities just disaggregating into a new role the ability to put all the new knowledge requirements and supporting folks who go from web 2 to web 3 seamlessly i think that was the last point hopefully i made that uh clear um and then just step on i think my last point was um uh you mentioned the word opportunity uh coming from the traditional wall street world management consulting private equity i always think about market opportunity take just a really quick step back and really paint how big cloud storage of an opportunity that is okay so today's public government private clouds it's approximately a hundred thousand exabytes stored that's insane uh in four years that number's at least gonna double to two hundred thousand according to some of the key research groups like cyber security ventures allied market markets and markets i mean the estimates like in 2027 2028 cloud storage is gonna market through it's gonna pass the 300 billion dollar mark that's like a keger on the order of something 22 23 just think about that folks even if web 3 is slow to take off which it's not right you've heard neo and his team's been around for what a little over a year two years that since test net to main that they're at 2 300 petabytes the growth is incredible but even if it's slow to take off which it's not fall coin is just a small fraction of that which it's not the addressable market will still be a massive 100 billion opportunity for entrepreneurs who help web 2 move to web3 so i implore all of you just take a bite of that opportunity and seriously just pack away at it very cool very cool thank you thank you kevin couldn't agree more um next question uh is for stu uh people ask sometimes why you know does falcon not have built-in encryption in the stack what's your response to that because i'm sure you have an opinion on that yeah absolutely so i think the question's a little more complicated than people know when i hear the question like why don't you encrypt data well there's really four actors in this ecosystem you know there's the protocol itself right the file coin protocol and when you look at the purpose the purpose is you can store data in a decentralized manner around the world and then people can decentralize storage platform the other two actors though are the client and what i'll call the customer so the client is that uh that piece that accepts the customer data and then processes it and sends it to the storage provider and there's an opportunity there's a business opportunity in terms of managing those client relationships and expectations and so if you want to encrypt there that could be encrypted and sent to the storage miner as an encrypted blob right that we simply store and then they can manage their permissions in terms of uh you know who can access this who gets the key how do they get the key and finally the customer the ones that we've spoken to actually don't want to use encryption even though they do have sensitive data that they don't want to be publicly exposed because they're afraid of a single point of failure when something happens that key all of a sudden uh where's our data you know who's got the key oh you know it has to be managed properly so they don't want to take that chance so it's really up to the customer and the client to decide how to um how to negotiate those uh those requirements and then wear that encryption if it's to happen where it happens and how it gets managed yeah really cool yeah i think you know it's it's like you said right every every um there's an opportunity again in every stage and um even in you know different encryption technologies can be added on the front or in the back and i think you know again it's it's an example of how we think about the ecosystem how we believe you know innovation will happen over time and will change over time um across the ecosystem great i unfortunately were um we're at time here but you know i wanted to make sure if there's any questions in the chat we have a couple more questions lined up too but we're going to get ready for the next panel session anytime i'm going to pass it on to cardig who's going to look at some other questions that came in through the chat and i will be back with you in two minutes uh in the meantime cardiff take it away uh thanks everyone for joining uh at least on the final session and i'll i'll be back in two minutes oh that was a an incredible talk and so many amazing points here uh we'll we'll give uh anybody who has any questions on the chat feel free to uh kind of type them in we'll relay those questions to our speakers and i saw some really interesting points here and um i was gonna still ask you to kind of keep all your video on um so maybe one question for for everybody until we receive a few more questions here are just in terms of you kind of talked about you covered a lot of opportunities that are here whether it's on the opportunity of the space itself on storage or it can ancillary tools around it but uh what uh what specifically i guess keeps you up at night and what do you worry about and uh and maybe i'll start this with with charles and then we can go to kevin but what what kind of are things that you're concerned about as this ecosystem grows and uh and what matters on that side yeah for me like uh with the private network currently like uh let's let's remember that price point is mainland online just one one year not even one year yet so there was there are lots of tools like infrastructure protocol layers are still lost it keep on involving so when startups start their design and linear to can count about long term we kind of like we start project we expect that it's perfect then it will like make it uh looks as you thought so that's what i would like to see that for some young developers youngster darks they coming here very excited they said oh this is not really the pace those are gonna play this stars that expressed so what i see is that if you think something is not there you can do two things one thing is that you have buildings open sources building libraries from the core operators and uh open source to the others so we can make the network and the first evolve fast another thing that uh always thinking about long term like when you're writing code or you're doing this how about other diseases is this a real need or this is just because i like it i think they would be great but where's granny's always do some research before you start now this is something like i'm thinking another part is about security like when we're doing those applications we are aiming at uh for industry usage right industrial user accepts those solutions about security side i see there's a lot of competition is great but they don't think about security for example how to protect our customer data how about some legal things those things are really concerned about it kevin i see is an active engagement going on and in the chat here with you and then a few of our attendees so maybe uh i'll ask you here as well for the live stream uh what keeps you up at night yeah i don't know if you were reading the live stream and then ask the question so perfect the first one that comes to mind i mean just to make it clear for all of us who don't understand that saying it's generally a negative connotation what's keeping you up at night um we're all working so hard in the hacking community and so hard on the web3 community to make decentralization work for cloud storage or even more more aggressive goals cloud compute etc the existing infrastructure today when we colloquially call it web 2 that has had so much maturity from different legal jurisdictions from security and just it's not just about ethics of legislation there's also been so much work to functionally technically keep systems going in ways that provide the security and comfort to its users in the chat i mean uh i think vibe thanks for being so active uh i've mentioned role-based access management i mean our backs control that doesn't really exist today because we're packing so quickly we're building so quickly at least getting the capacity up but we also have to make sure that we're covering our bases it's not just a liability thing but to encourage users you have to protect them in their data and so what keeps me up at night and this a better spin on it would be what's the opportunity here would be for hackers in the community to see that there's a need to bring the same professionalism the same security standards um but somehow be creative and allow it to work on a decentralized platform like filecoin so i think that's my answer and that's that's a huge opportunity not my expertise but i'm sure someone in the audience uh would will be great for if not is already working at it absolutely and i think this sort of overlaps with what you just commented on stuart with an encryption um in this space so maybe i'll let you a comment as well and we'll go to neo and wrap it up sure uh comment on encryption or security it's music right here is everyone's talking about security either or uh the question still stays what keeps you up yeah so it's um i always try to understand the risks and balance them right so it's really about managing the risk so trying to understand what those risks are right now i'd say a lot of our attention is turning toward government regulations some of the hearings in the senate and the new amendments being proposed or passed those present of course the kind of risks that we need to be concerned about and how that affects us as opposed to you know kind of a traditional infrastructure and application type of risks uh that you know we always have to worry about so that would be my answers just uh you know what's out there what's coming and how's the environment uh constantly changing uh as somebody's worked a lot in the enterprise space you know i continue to uh evangelize the fact that the blockchain technology offers us far more security than you know the web two way of doing things uh i spend millions of dollars trying to protect what is in some ways unpredictable there's just so many rooms for uh for you to get hacked uh often at a social level not just a code level so uh you know seeing a protocol like file coin or other blockchains where the security is built into the protocol and you don't you know count on people you can trust right it's it's really a trustless system so um now we're looking outside the protocol right off chain problems absolutely and neo uh maybe close this off i'd love to hear your thoughts as well yes yes i i think you guys got almost everything covered um what keeps him up at night uh well that's that's actually a classic interview question uh uh one of the proper answer is aside from you know occasional nightmares about interviewing i worked so hard that i rarely have a difficult time speaking but when you ask that question to executives you might get answers like team dynamics talent issue corporate culture and and people related issues but for me the real answer is is how to achieve effective communication when our team is distributed in different regions with different time zones i i personally started working remotely uh from four years ago and way before the copy dynamic but still try to you know improve on high effective communication i think protocol lab seems really good at this and and ethereum global uh stephen or uh do you do you have any traits to share neo that's not me yes that's you yes uh jumping in tricks i think you know keep building the community as strong as possible i'm strong believer that you know innovation comes through you know throwing ideas um at each other and collaboratively working on and brainstorming on doing things in a new way and i feel like some of the greatest ideas just come drinking a beer or you know just you know when you're not really focused on brainstorming but when you're just like trying to make something work and and by really solving a problem i think you know that's why we're so huge on hackathons that's why we're so huge on accelerated programs um and and huge on building this together with the ecosystem so i want to thank you all for coming great conversation um again we should do more of these i hope this was helpful to the community and then um let's uh take it uh to the next panel session so thank you uh kevin charles uh uh stu and and neo for joining us this morning we're going to be introducing um some new panelists uh kartik yep there we go go ahead kartik yeah well yeah thanks you thank you uh so much for that amazing conversation i feel like there's still an active discussion going on on our chat on a global.tv so if there's more questions for our speakers i'll encourage all of our speakers to come say hi on the chat uh we're ready for our next panel and this is another one i'm super excited about and uh the panel is about just what our investors looking for and what three startups uh this covers all of what three not just ipf's and paul coin uh so uh without further ado i'd like to welcome isaac stefano blake gabriel um as our panelists and stephan will still be moderating this this chat as well so uh a lot of familiar faces here let's uh i want to say hi to all of you and uh let's get this started awesome all right thanks everyone great great conversation um so we thought about you know as as we're looking at and i know the rest of the team may have not seen the image i put this morning in front of the team here but i look at the universe right as a as a a falcon universe right as um a nursery of stars essentially right we're building the new the next gen uh msps but also new applications new projects are being born every single day and hack a fest is one of the you know big um nurseries i would say right that that where we're building these new projects so this conversation today what we wanted to do is talk a little bit more about what it would take to to move your project forward and either raise funds or participate in one of our accelerating our amazing accelerated programs so we have four um representatives of uh you know one from tech stars one from tachyon long hash and outlier ventures all four are either running uh or accelerated programs or are starting to run a new accelerate program so with me um we've got gabriel gabriel let's kick off the conversation you're very experienced web3 accelerator um obviously you're currently running a program um now you know compared to a year ago what trends have you seen and particularly in raising capital in the web 3 space and and what recommendations would you give to uh the new entrepreneurs uh to in raising capital today yeah yeah great question um so first uh super excited to be here i love coming to hack fast i love coming to these events uh it's always amazing to see all the incredible builders um i'm gabriel and the managing director of tachyon uh for those of you that don't know tachyon is a part of consensus mesh we've collectively incubated and invested in north of a hundred projects and companies within uh you know the ecosystem some that are some of the key pillars of the ethereum ecosystem companies like infura and metamask and three box and pegasus and truffles so on and so forth um tachyon is our accelerator which is uh uh where the most ambitious you know early stage webview founders come uh to join us for a 12-week sprint to really hone their value proposition uh test their assumptions with real customers and prepare for the next stage of investment and growth um and so i think uh you know at this stage you know i have um mentored advise north of 65 70 web 3 founders and companies many of which have gone on to successfully raise and or exit um and every time founders come through a cohort i think um the thing that hasn't changed is the good old-fashioned principles of how you go about building um a company how you go about building a startup right companies are built to solve problems and most startups never actually find a real or valuable problem to to solve so it doesn't matter if you're a web 2 startup or a web 3 startup the fundamentals are the same right the fundamentals are um you know have you honed in on a really good problem um what is that problem who has that problem what's the intensity of that problem how often do they have that problem um are you operating in a good market you know are you operating in a market that is large and or growing and moving fast have you figured out a you know um what your startup does in terms of being a different differentiated solution in the market um you know do you have an insight into the user or the the customers that you have and the problems that they have um you know investors are not investing in your vision quest right investors are investing in companies that in teams that have the ability to hone in on really good valuable problems um and solve those problems for real users um you know outside of that i think you know the other solid fundamentals would be uh you know show don't tell can you actually prove demand um you know do you do you have the ability to build a real product um you know can you are your early users or or customers um really interested in this you know can you prove traction can you prove demand these are the fundamentals of building any startup any company i've been a three-time founder two-time intrapreneur where i went in-house to build companies those things never change um in terms of the trends i think you know um and maybe some of the nuances of building a web3 startup i think um you know two of the uh most unfair competitive notes in terms of like web free startups are community and composability and a lot of the trends that we're seeing right now um for for what three companies that can really think about where they fit into the stack um and then can actually build a strong community around around their product um those are the ones that we always see that that break out um and in terms of some of the the trends that we're starting to see obviously we're like in nft summer um but we're really interested in we're really interested in we're starting to see more and more investors approach us about um this idea of composability and convergence so like as we start to see nfts converge with defy or nfts converge with daos and dow tooling or nfts can converge with uh social gaming metaverse type of plays i think those are really really kind of like the interesting plays um you know in terms of like what we're starting to see in in that investor activity um but the fundamentals are the fundamentals of like how you go about building a company and i think my other esteemed panelists here i think would 100 agree with me in terms of like what they see in terms of successful companies that's awesome yeah i know some great great great great ideas there i mean there's like um you know nfts you you mentioned nft i just want to jump in on that i mean it's definitely a hot season but you know my take and my take is that eventually all data that we store create right will eventually stored as sort of like an nf in an nft type of format do you agree with that or do you see that the web 2 world is starting to see that um i think we're always starting to see too early i think we're always starting to see some of those primitives and i'll tell you like gen 1 of nft so i was building my startups back when social media platforms were the big thing like i've seen this meta trend already play out like i know how this this plays out back when companies first started getting on to some of the social platforms they tried to take their shitty print publication and slap it on the facebook page and call it a day they weren't actually hacking around the nuances of the actual platform and i think we're seeing the same thing within with nfts right like don't get me wrong i'm all about aping into the board apes and the crypto punks and i like i think it's fun and it's great but i'm really interested to see like gen 2 gen 3 versions of nfts um and how you start to hack around composability and use nfts and their composability to continue the consumer journey and experience and i think that's why we're starting to see like nfts converge with other uh trends like d5 like um you know data dows and dow tooling um so yeah i couldn't agree with you more and uh and you're gonna start to see new and interesting use cases of nfps um as they map to like extending the consumer journey awesome awesome love it um moving on to isaac isaac uh techstars is uh recently new to the falcon ecosystem you guys are starting a new acceleration program uh what's your um you know what is techsource looking for when when when recruiting web three founders yeah uh well stefan thanks for uh thanks for inviting me to to join this awesome panel um so i am isaac i'm the managing director of the uh new uh filecoin techstars accelerator um i'm a serial entrepreneur uh and a long time early stage tech investor so i've started two companies i've run three i've raised a couple hundred million dollars in equity in debt capital and i've had a couple of good exits um i was also a vc for about a decade uh most recently with general catalyst partners and i'm a longtime angel investor uh so i'm super excited to be spinning up the new filecoin techstars accelerator it's quite a mouthful but it'll run next year from march 21st through mid-june and um if you don't know techstars is the global network that helps entrepreneurs succeed we have roughly 50 accelerators in the in the global network um collectively our our founders have raised uh over 15 billion dollars of capital they're i think now 15 unicorns and we have a collective market cap of about 52 billion dollars and you know really notably on the point of trying to help founders find success of the 2700 companies that have gone through a tech stars accelerator uh 86 of them are still in business or have exited and our our blockchain and crypto alums include folks like chain analysis and trading view and and r weave and my own crypto journey starts uh in 2013 when i brought the first bitcoin miners to iceland so i built the first large-scale data center in iceland and uh and i and i and i stumbled across bitcoin miners who were sort of a perfect customer for us to bring to iceland and they ultimately composed about 50 of our business i think i think in like late 2014 we estimated that 5 of global mining capacity for bitcoin was was actually in our facility so wow so that was a that was a fun and wild ride um so to get to your question what do we look for in terms of founders so i mean we first and foremost the first lens we ever look at at a company at our prospective applicant is the founder we care first and foremost about founder quality in their dna so um regardless of whether you're doing web3 or something more traditional we certainly want to see people with a big vision and they desire to make a very big positive impact on the world we want to see brilliance and capability execution really really matters uh you know one one thing that uh that i look for specifically is founder market fit so i wanna i wanna i want teams or solo founders who have really really deep insight into the problem that they're trying to solve they're not just sort of tourists uh trying something cool out but they they they've thought about this problem for a while maybe they've experienced it themselves and maybe they have an earned secret maybe they've figured something out that nobody else has figured out and particularly how to apply web3 infrastructures and methodologies to the problem they're trying to solve um i look for people who have evidence that they're rapid learners and iterators i think the the sole competitive advantage that most companies have at these very very early stages is just how quickly you can move and you've got to be you know humble enough to learn and get feedback quickly and make quick changes and and implement them so that matters and then specifically for web3 founders i'm gonna i'm gonna completely echo uh one of the themes that uh gabriel mentioned uh which is that uh you know we want people who understand not just the the tech stacks and the web3 and token infras you know infrastructures and mechanics that they're using but you know how they apply to real world problems um uh that that they're trying to solve because you know at the end of the day um while i firmly believe that decentralized infrastructures should provide meaningfully better solutions to a lot of the problems out there um we're still ultimately trying to you know solve a customer's pain point or fulfill their desires if it's a consumer application and it's it's just not enough to build cool you gotta build cool that other people care about so um we are you know i'll say the exact same thing we want people who who understand how to take the web 3 world and make a fundamental difference to solving a problem or fulfilling a desire a desire cool you you gotta create cool that our people care about that's that a tagline i'm gonna start using um awesome um maybe let's move to outlier ventures blake uh you know outlier ventures just closed their application round um this will be your first uh cohort and you've been investing in open data economy for the last seven years right what type of projects are you looking for where where do you experience the most value and and what do you think uh you know um new starters should be focusing on great question stefan and allow me to start by thanking for the opportunity to be here i'm always honored and humbled to be in front of hackathons and i truly believe there will be a lot of great projects coming out of it uh i'm blake lezenski i'm the program manager of the falcon base combat outlaw avengers quickly about our organization we started in 2013 and one of the probably first european web free focused investors probably still one of the biggest globally in terms of number of deals then around 2016-17 we started investing on a venture scale in seed and precede deals but around 2019 we understood that with the expertise and people we have on board the optimal value we can deliver to founders and teams is actually through an acceleration program and that's how base camp came to life and as you mentioned stefan this is the first time we were teaming up with an external organization and i'm super glad it's protocol labs to deliver a version of basecamp that is dedicated to a specific technology stack um so in terms of projects we're looking for i'm very keen to see projects that have a token in their future and are crypto heavy i believe this is where we as outlier ventures can add maximum value we accept solar founders and teams um my perfect sort of mindset to come to the program with would be to be great on the technicalities but also appreciate the value of go to market i would also like to see projects that see the value of protocol lab stack beyond just simple storage capacity and many other implications that come out from the technology um we would like to dedicate the program mostly to the middleware layer and the infrastructure we think this is the key to the persistence of the metaverse and making it truly open um as well as introduce an optimal user experience to nfts as as you mentioned we have a lot of experience investing in the new data economy maybe to some extent longer than anybody else and we have a full supply chain from data to compute in our portfolio ocean protocol that allows users to create a decentralized marketplace for data secret network which is the first blockchain with data privacy by default fetch ai and open access tokenize the central lane machine learning network as well as kudos the centralized compute network and enabling blockchain scalability um so where can we add the most value we are extremely commercially minded hence my point about amazing technical minds coming to us we always put emphasis on fundraising and tokenomics in the last 12 months of base camp we helped raise 130 million of seed capital for our projects since 2019 the combined value of the basecamp portfolio is one billion dollars at the peak of the bull run it was closer to three billion dollars and we have several billion dollar networks including opposing protocol and dia data we also work with a network of 1 500 co-investors from world leading investors in west and east from tier 1 vcs all the way down to community pools so we truly can help you find capital anywhere so we look for technical teams that want to create a scalable business and attract capital um that understand there is a gap between creating a great mvp to hit the market and actually bringing it to that market and commercializing it successfully and this is where we can help also including hiring of commercial people and custom go to market strategies um we rely on our huge network of partners including large enterprise organizations and finally we have a very complementary alumni stack around data economy uh data marketplaces compute and multi-party computation cool and you're um just uh that's great by the way you're calling in from from the uk or somewhere in europe right so i'm currently calling in from ibiza uh just to get some stuff for the program place i want to be at right now yeah that'd be cool you know yeah poor guy uh because one thing i wanted to call out is that you know we have four great partners here on the table but all of them are calling in from different areas right we have representation in europe asia uh and the us um and that brings me to the next uh partner uh stefano uh maybe you can tell us where are you based today i'm also based in an island uh but i'm in singapore i'm in singapore oh there you go pretty much on the other side of the world yeah so welcome so you you uh long hash you're from longhouse ventures you close your recent application window as well um very familiar with the web 3 world how are investors differentiating themselves um particularly particularly in a bull market condition yeah well first of all also super excited to be here today uh you know thanks a lot for for having me uh you know very glad to be able to to speak to everyone uh so i'm stephanie berry i'm the program lead at longhouse ventures and i'll just give a quick intro to uh to our organization uh so we're web 3 investment fund and we're also asia's leading web 3 accelerator program uh for those of you who haven't uh you know heard of us before don't know us so we've accelerated over 40 projects for the last about three three and a half years and we've helped them raise over 100 billion dollars in funding and earlier this year we launched a 20 million dollar d5 focused uh and and to an nft focus now uh fund uh where we've invested in over 30 companies uh including you know the likes of insadap sapper mintable and alchemy nft uh and uh yeah as you mentioned we just closed up locations uh i think a couple of weeks ago for our next cohort which will have a file contract so it's the second time that we partner with protocol labs to run the filecoin frontier accelerator super excited uh so some great applications and and we're in the process of of reviewing them in the next few weeks i think um i think then to your question around um you know how investors are differentiating uh themselves uh and especially in in the past you know 12 or 16 months where we've been in uh a pretty strong bull market i think that um first of all of course you see you know a lot of capital available uh for projects uh and i think as investors you even see some notable investors that are really you know almost like like fighting to actually be able to get into funding rounds and so i think um you know if you go back you know a few more years or even a decade or more uh where where capital and the network was was all you needed as an investor to bring to the table uh that's definitely not the case uh and it definitely hasn't been the case over the past a year i think that investors really need to put forward um you know their value proposition beyond money and network uh to their portfolio companies and um and and those you know whether you're you're meeting investors through an accelerator program or or through other channels i think that investors you know have to get their hands dirty uh they really need to help the startups with you know developing the product the the strategy scaling uh and and even to continue to innovate right particularly in web3 where um you know you see protocols you know they launch a b1 then there's a v2 and so on and so forth and i think the investors need to uh be part of of that development in one way uh or another and i think investors really have to become venture builders right i mean capital's not enough and as a matter of fact we started out as an accelerator uh and then we we launched the fund but we decided to keep the accelerator uh because for us it's it's it's a way a structured way for us to be able to help uh uh our projects and i think um particularly when it comes to web three uh you need investors that are also knowledgeable about the space right so it's not just the the web 2 topics like you know they go to market the business model etc but it's really around you know designing the tokenomics uh helping the projects uh you know decide which decentralized governance model they go for uh you know things like that i think you bring up some good points to find it's like the token sale is definitely auto economics in general is definitely new to a lot of traditional investors too so uh maybe a question for gabriel would love to get your perspective on what's you know what sort of the recommendations you give to startups when it comes to token sales yeah and raising capital around that right yeah 100 i think you know the introduction of tokens is uh it is unique to web3 um and so uh you know it's it's definitely um in terms of building like your startup it's definitely an unfair competitive advantage uh compared to like you know those of us who built our companies in the web 2 era um but i i see a lot of founders and a lot of teams rush to launch a token um before they've actually built utility and and or a community around that token and i think that's a that's a big miss um you know shout out to uh to jesse walden from variant formerly of a16z the goat um he wrote a piece a long time ago called progressive decentralization which um i i've all it has always been kind of like the framework our mental model for how we think about companies and how we think about startups and how they should think about launching a token which is you've got to find utility and function first and you should really really really spend a lot of time focused on your community especially the early early stages of the of the community launching a token is just like launching a product or just like launching a company it is that hard and trying to do both before you've actually found utility or function or product market fit with your startup is a big miss and what i see is i see a lot of investors who push startups to try to launch a token that has more to do about optionality and liquidity for the investor than it actually does does it make sense for that particular project in that particular startup so for startups who actually find utility and function find product market fit who find you know early use cases and then can rally their community it's a massive unfair competitive advantage as they go into market essentially your community are both your users and your and and your investors in some cases uh in that case which i think for a lot of startups is the holy grail uh but but i really would uh i always have founders step back and make sure that they that they act their token has real utility has real use has has a real function and it's not just about trying to create um liquidity um and i think it's really really important for founders to to focus on that uh first first and foremost cool yeah i know i couldn't create more i couldn't agree more with you um it's definitely a topic that that's coming up a lot more often now uh as as startups are investing and sorry raising capital um you know it's definitely in a bull market some of the startups you know question like hey why should i join an accelerated program so maybe isaac would love to get your perspective on like you know why should they you know join an accelerate program and when they when they choose a program of course we you know we have four programs here at the table and we're going to create more um you know which you know what should should they be looking at right when they select one of the accelerators what's your take on that yeah well you have you have four terrific options right here uh and i always when when i'm talking to founders about hey why should i why should i come into your accelerator let it let alone i need to any accelerator what i always say is look the the our value proposition boils down to we will dramatically increase your chances of success in your entrepreneurial pursuits it's as simple as that if you don't think that we're gonna like you know 10x the probability of your succeeding you shouldn't come because you're going to give up a decent chunk of equity for you know most cases not a ton of money but what you're getting is an incredible basket of of goodies that will you know really help you to find success and and certainly you know the tech stars numbers and it sounds like colleagues numbers really play that out if you go to a high quality accelerator so you know to to disaggregate that a bit what should you be looking for um for sure you want to find a place that will dramatically expand your network um i don't i mean we it's in it's in our tagline we are that we are the global network that helps entrepreneurs succeed and i think everybody else here would agree with with that but you should you should be sure that by coming into an accelerator you're going to just explode your network by orders of magnitude and then oftentimes that's the most valuable thing that you'll get whether it's access to investors or customers or prospective hires ecosystem partners mentors you you should you know what what we often do is get people who maybe have been toying away and quiet but are not necessarily national networkers all of a sudden they have access to people they never could have dreamed of and so i think network's a big part of what you should be evaluating um certainly closely tied to that is access to capital if you're going to come into an accelerator we should really be able to help you to raise money and i think you know everyone here is quite good at that but um you know you want to make sure that you look at look at our track records and see have you been able to help the companies that have gone through the accelerator raise money um certainly again in the case of techstars we have a global network of uh 15 000 early-stage investors as well as the very strong personal uh networks that each entity like like like like i have um and again we have a great track record but make sure you're going to actually get people who will help you raise capital it's still on you you're the founder you ultimately have to you know you have to bring your your a game to do it but we can help a lot on that front um mentorship and expertise i think that's just super super critical mentorship uh is part of the core experience at techstars it matter in fact it matters so much that we take uh you know two of the first weeks in program doing mentor speed dating to help you find three to five lead mentors who will who are dedicated to spending time with you while you're in program but also that kind of leads to the next point like make sure that you're going to get long-term support from an accelerator um you know we do not say okay you've been through your 13 weeks and then you know kick you out the door and say goodbye um we're here for the long haul we're we're investors in your company we have a ton of incentive to see you succeed uh and again we we put a lot of effort not just at the md level but at the techstars global network level to ensure that there is long-term support for our alums in the form of portfolio services so that when you get on to the next thing you're trying to raise you're trying to build your team you're trying to find the right you're moving into a new sector whatever you can usually find it throughout techstars not just you know while you're in program but for hopefully years after um and i i think the last thing is you everything always still kind of boils down to people so spend time with the mds and the and the program teams the programs you're evaluating make sure you like them i know i i can't speak for the others but i know at techstars most founders tell me look i experienced techstars through the lens of the managing director like and and so make sure that you like the md because you're going to be spending a lot of time with them make sure they're accessible make sure they actually uh you know have some some value to impart and wisdom to impart and uh and those are i think those are the high level things that i would i would evaluate there there are plenty others but those are maybe the most important in my mind yeah people do business with people right yeah whatever you sell you're selling to to human beings um thanks thanks uh isaac so two a week ago i was actually talking to one of my friends who pitched an idea of uh startup he's tuned his own startup and he was pitching to a a vc and and the response he got was like love the idea can you add crypto to that i thought it was funny uh because then i can you know so they again um you know it was sort of an indicator that you know there's a lot more momentum there too and this is a traditional uh visa i'm not gonna bring out their name but anyway stefano uh at hedge ventures you know what what are some of the use cases that you're seeing uh that are gaining the most traction with investors i was gonna say before i answer that question you reminded me i think this was in 2017 there was an iced tea company in new york if i'm not mistaken that that put blockchain or crypto in their name um and their stock went up like i don't know how much but anyway um hopefully not a top signal um look i think in terms of winning cases i think gabriel said it earlier uh you know if last year we had d5 summer this year we definitely have nft suburb and i think we're right in the midst of it um i think um i i think obviously there's a lot of you know there's some hype there's there's a lot of noise there's a lot of things to bottle through um we as an investor do come across a lot of nfd platforms and i think eventually we have invested in some of the earlier ones um but i think also to to link it to gabriel's pointer is really around utility and and some of the winning nft models going forward around utility uh we've seen it with um you know with gaming of course actually infiniti is the most uh i would say famous or well-known example but there's plenty others um we are seeing it with um you know some of these like social dows and and launching uh nfts that have some utility linked to it uh and um and uh and yeah and even we're seeing it in in the metaverse in the form of real estate right so so beneversal real estate if you will uh i was hearing i think yesterday uh some fairly well known media houses from asia buying uh land in the metaverse uh and and then you know looking at uh at launching nfts that have utility around having events i mean we're basically now used to like you know being on on zoom for these kind of events and while i guess a lot of us are probably itching to to meet up in person but there will be still be a form of this uh virtual in the future and and how can we actually make it a better experience by by leveraging this kind of technology so i think i think that's one um emerging let's call it a use case of nfcs that i think are starting to get some traction among investors and i think i think the other one is um you know d5 is still really big and i think uh you know we we believe that we're just getting started right i think in the past 12 or 16 months um you know we we saw uh you know d5 explode right uh and i think what we're starting to see now is that we're going beyond the um the the you know simple for lack of a better word uh applications of tradify coming into define starting to see the more sophisticated products coming in so things like um you know derivatives structured products all these more sophisticated uh uh financial instruments uh starting to to crop up as you know the d5 version of it which is very exciting because i think for one is that you know we we see more momentum in this space but then second i also believe that this is one of the ways that we can at some point in the future start to link with with you know the traditional financial system yeah i think you know it's great to see all these new products i see it on the lending side you know as well it's sort of like an iteration right you have the first program high interest rates high collateralized collateral requirements and slowly on they start to implement what is what currently exists in the traditional financing world and starting to improve on it so it's amazing to see all the innovation you did mention something that i want to pick up on is that the metaverse i want i want blake's view on that because outlier ventures has been like very uh vocal about you know and very engaged in on bringing a metaverse right in different verticals and uh so what's your uh what's your take on that blake you know where do you see web3 storage startups and trends uh in this whole new metaverse uh evolve and and uh do we have blake yeah so thank you for bringing up the metaverse operating system probably organizationally one of our favorite things to talk about and allow me to start by saying that at all adventures we consider ourselves an evergreen investor so looking into the future we invest and support startups throughout the bull market and bear market actually some of our best investments were made in the deep dark freeze of the crypto winter so in the context of the metaverse operating system and trends we try to look beyond the web itself up until the point when digital becomes undistinguished from virtu from real in context of social media you can also see it happening with gaming virtual roads so from the perspective of trends that means the world will become more automated and it's important how data is permissioned and controlled it has to be user-centric the difference would be the user is in control of the data and they can give permissions and commoditize that asset they can participate in the value that is generated from data in combination with things like falcoid and ipfs access to other protocols that when combined enhance privacy preserving computation commodification of data in data marketplaces and institutional buyouts you need data for ai and machine learning and we have those complete projects in our portfolio and can accelerate startups working with the centralized cloud in its totality um other aspects of the metaverse operating system pieces that this is touching i believe is financialization of data the user centricity based on the principles of sovereignty which is very close to most close to my heart personally and i truly believe you know expense currently you need expensive hardware to access the metaverse um so those kind of technologies uh can increase performance and can offset some of the costs by renting out the capacity and in turn turning um cryptocurrencies and joining the virtual world economy um so i think you need data for ai and machine learning as i mentioned and i truly believe falcon and ipfs is the key to solve that and make the metaverse truly open persistent and interoperable awesome yeah thank you yeah any um any players uh any axe infinity players on this panel because i just installed it like two weeks ago i'm still trying to get my uh my right team together now any recommendations of what combination i should go for no anyway put it in the chat uh all right well we got one check we have one question from uh the audience uh kartik can you maybe take that question and absolutely wrap it up it was a really awesome discussion um i think uh this question uh oh rephrase the question but it's been answered in parts but maybe we'll kind of ask this more concretely but you have any frameworks around how do you how should you think about performing a legal entity or launching your company if you have a token and obviously this question is going to differ based on where you are but um for all of you here any comments advice or frameworks that you like to talked about would be great who wants to wade into this one it's a very hard question yeah i'll take a shot at it and then uh but i'm i'm sure like stefano i know you guys have worked with a bunch of decoy projects uh blick as well uh i'm sure isaac you guys are working with them as well um i guess first and foremost i i'm not an attorney i don't play one on uh tv or hackathons etc so this is not legal advice for anybody um but uh yeah we've worked with a number of projects uh who have launched tokens you know uh paid out i love that finance uh secured finance power loom so many great companies um um i would say and i know our legal counsel would love this first and foremost get really good competent counsel um do not skirt this uh do do do not skirt this you want to find council who is uh extremely competent in both web3 and and has done this before so like you know don't get your brother-in-law because you know he practices law on the side don't do that whole thing in terms of jurisdictions that you're looking for it really depends on the nature of your project and the nature of your token um what we have seen uh historically is um a number of different structures and setups you know we've seen a delaware c-corp parent and then a child that sits in bvi or cayman island something like that something with friendly jurisdictions um this again this is not legal advice here's what i would tell you like if you have even a single customer even a user who's using a vpn who's based in in in the states you're not going to skirt the sec um so you know don't even think about it um so we've seen a number of um jurisdictions that are friendly to d5 that are friendly to tokens um you know i named a couple singapore shout out singapore you know as has great jurisdictions for token and token based projects uh but um but i cannot stress this enough please please please go get really good competent counsel if you are thinking about launching a token it will more than pay for itself in spades in saving you a whole bunch of headaches and potentially ending up in an orange jumpsuit um so yeah yeah i i will just add to that and i will also give the disclaimer that i am also not a lawyer and and this is definitely not legal advice but um i think uh i think the jurisdictions are important and so we are quite lucky that uh that we're based in singapore and i mean generally when you're you're at the really early stage before you've launched the token before you've decentralized into a dial of course um you know a lot of our accelerates would have incorporated in singapore it's super easy and it's like also super cheap and very fast um so so that's an option and it's a very i think globally it's one of the most uh crypto friendly uh uh technocratic jurisdictions uh but uh yeah so so that's usually a starting point but i echo what gabriel said just get a really good lawyer there's not that many that understand crypto but but you know we can introduce i'm sure all the other guys here can also introduce it depending where you are and and speaking to a good lawyer on this is critical thank you it sounds like that the legal environment um could use some innovation there as well and you know um maybe we should do a session around that at some point anyway great great conversation i really appreciate everyone's uh active participation and um uh thank you again we'll hope to do more of these uh the next session i want to thank all of you isaac gabriel stefano and blake um because i know for some of you it's really late out there so i appreciate to do that on a friday afternoon or friday evening or friday night um and with that we're going to move on to the next topic kartik i'll give it back to you thanks everyone have a good rest of hakka fast thanks everybody youtube on for monitoring it moderating an amazing chat uh so next step we have our next talk by zx zx leads at the crypto econ lab and drives stuff up when ecosystem growth at protocol labs um he'll be talking about bridging the falcoin bridging with fall coin um and just uh the new franchise in what three this is a talk that uh i've had a a sneak peek into so i'm super excited about it so without further ado i'll welcome him on stage and uh he'll let him kick off with the talk great thank you paddy i'm just giving you one moment everything is great all right thank you hi everyone welcome to hack fs storage provider summit my name is zx i work on crypto economics lab and ecosystem growth and protocol apps today i'm very excited to talk about uh bridge with falcoin new frontiers and web three and i think we really represent a lot of tremendous um growth and building opportunities for both lab builders and and entrepreneurs in the ecosystem and the hackfest the perfect place to get started and then like i'm pretty sure all ideas adventure does not end here there's lots of amazing program like the accelerator program that we just saw really help us take our ideas and businesses to the next level great let's get started let's do a recap what is falcoin um this is a uh this is the island economy analogy that we often use right so falcon is like an island on the island there are different kinds of participants you have researchers building the protocol and the algorithms then you have developers building tooling experiences application and products or even layer to protocols and then you have token holders providing liquidity um and facilitating transactions or providing collateral and then you have miners amassing all these physical and capital resources to produce uh storage related goods and services and then we exchange that with uh storage clients through valcoin and the overall goal of everyone in the ecosystem is to really bring in more participants and use cases and clients into the network and there are many lenses to look at valcoin just like any other blockchain network it's a utility token it's a platform a protocol a blockchain network a community an economy ecosystem and evolutionary system and we are there are different stages to the economy so we are kind of moved past the capacity building stage uh we're now coming close to nine extra bit of storage with 50 petabytes coming online every single day um and uh there's a very recent upgrade that really lower uh that makes the train more scalable and really lower the transaction cost and kind of increase the transaction throughput of the filecoin network and that that paves the way for more adoption more applications more deals more transaction on the falcon network and i think the collective goal of everyone is really bringing us to the um so-called stage three where we have a really strong brand around falcon a flu serial product very diverse market we think of output as an airbnb for cloud services um and then like falcon itself can be a sustainable economy and so falcon has a layer one is really unique right it's unique in a sense it's um it's well positioned to support both web q and w3 use cases and then we will explore more of these later today um so today's talk we talked about bridging with firecoin so a lot of that really is like building bridges uh to really use the storage um use all this tap into the potential tap into the compute tab into all these um different um different aspects of the falcon protocol because it's a falcon because falcon is a layering protocol so it cares about the very basic thing which is um is the miner are the miners storing your data good and then do you have a periodic proof that they are storing it so then you saw people building bridges in various forms with like different ecosystems uh or with like different web 2 companies and industries and these are not just the traditional like token bridges that we might be familiar with in web 3. i think these are storage bridges data bridges and value bridges so and also just to talk about some of the web 2 opportunities when using storage on file coin because falcon is a protocol it's it's somewhat different from like a traditional web to a product where you expect to see like one way of how things work right storage is provided uh on file coin in the form of sectors right like it gets proven uh the protocol checks on it every 24 hours and then using storage on falcon really is to use the storage provided by storage providers on the firepower network so also the features are all possible like redundancy encryption indexing fast retrieval many teams are building on better indexing um to enable fast retrieval services and then falcon is a layer one so it's designed to be to enable emergence so there's lots of room for layer two uh protocols that can emerge on dial point and while the cost of storage is very competitive today on falco and many miners are offering free stores for uh free storage for clients some are even offering like negative prices um but falcon storage is not just about cost right just like airbnb for cloud services should be about the experience and we will talk a lot more about that so there are many examples of like kind of abstract bridges of like application that makes uh using storage and falcon easy right you have nft door storage chain safe files there's also a textile bucket of webtoodle storage estuary many of these tools are popping up i encourage you guys to try it out during hackathon and build amazing product and experience with it and another big opportunity here would be like client minor right now they're close to 3 000 uh storage providers on the fireplace network right as a client coming to the protocol uh which one which one do we choose right like so there's lots of room here of improving the ux of the clients i think some of the tools that i mentioned earlier are great examples and then there's also space for like geo-matching platform kind of like airbnbs or dropboxes on the falcon network and we started to see many of this uh emerging and then like reputation system will come into key and then that will also extends into like credit and other ratings and then that also give us the opportunity to define grades of storage services which is standard become a precursor to commoditized cloud storage which is something that we have never really done before and we talked about d-file a lot but it's also entirely possible to have exchanges whether it's centralized or decentralized or even new form of exchanges based on new structures uh on cloud services and as we mentioned like there's lots of compute gpu sitting around storage this collocation of search and compute represents tremendous opportunities i think we hear uh from one of the large storage providers later today to talk about um different opportunities at uh us the falcon storage providers and then you can run analytics algorithms and then offer stock gpu as a service we all know that the metaverse would likely require lots of both storage and compute resources the file code network will be a perfect place for that and then like people also researching and building caching and retrieval services um there's also given that you need like collateral for uh file uh to become a search provider on file coin there's also token price volatility which doesn't have to be performed by either the miners or the client there's actually lots of opportunity for financial services on filepoint it could be really useful to help with like managing risk providing liquidity and reducing uncertainty and that everyone can benefit with a more predictable kind of financial situation and then data services will become increasingly important as the level activities increases on foul point when you understand what's the risk profile both for the storage and the search provider and the clients and then that that enable participant to make more informed decisions we start to see like mining return calculators more and more sophisticated um analytics with lenders and strong network analytics really paved the way for more sophisticated products on firecoin so we talked a lot about like web 2 star interactions i also want to emphasize falcon really brings a unique and new building block to web3 and we use this like diagram to really illustrate right we call that the dataverse and this is what we call a data supply chain it's very common in web 2 world right you have like production of data many times these data are actually public right then you have refinery um can you my insight can you clean up data and then you do curation you package it in the format that people want and then deliver value or satisfy some kind of desire right and then you generate value and then potentially attribution except that in the traditional web 2 world many of the attribution really happened in the last stage right but in the case of like web 3 you really have this network structure and i think this is where the whole content address web of ipfs really come in you have this network of nodes and edges how do you define them that is like a full-on protocol of defining what is it what is an edge and there's lots of research on this from the traditional network science literature um but ipfs later gives you this network structure and enable us to define the structure over it and then what the falcon layer really brings to the table i think one is huge volume very cheap supply of storage um but as you already know it's not just about price so it's really about that experience and the value and the next piece is this periodic proof about the data being stored on file point and then before falcon gets an evm or user-defined uh smart contrast system there's lots of bridging layer which is the main thing about talk today and then we will see a few more examples and then enable others to build smart contract layer logic on top of this um on part of the foul coin uh storage network and there's we already started to see people experimenting with this but i think um i will go over some of the example of like some of the other web3 successes and how do you really crack this and how do you really showcase the immense potential at the intersection of alcohol and ethereum or other smart contract platforms so going back to this again right so these are not just the regular token bridges this is something that the world has not even seen we have not fully appreciate the potential and the power of the storage bridges so these are not just like tokens they could be storage value data attribution flow it could really be anything the sky is the limit and fn is the perfect uh venue to really explore build teams and kind of like try it out um really experiment what could be possible many of the many of the successes in that three started in hackathons like this one so yeah so some of the other announcement or or kind of like progress that you made with these bridges like falcon training bridge falcon ethereum bridge falcon near bridge uh there's also free storage on the near bridge and um and more recently we there's lots of drawing grants i think we hear from marshmallow i want to talk about this exciting grant opportunities and then there's different kinds of bridges with like polygon near hedera and lots of lots of ecosystem momentum really kind of enable experimentation in power this kind of trial and error to figure out what is the right use case and then we talk a bit more about some of the use cases but before that let's just take a look take a step back and look at like d5 and nft solve the successful case study in black three so back in 2015 when ethereum first came up right like people talked about like smart contract but it took us a long time to figure out what is a part of market fit what can we really do with it that can really um satisfy the consumer and customer demand um and there were many that back in 2017 i remember pretty vividly i also made a few of those but they didn't make it right like um i think one strong thing with d5 is we really leverage the building block that ethereum brings to the table it really didn't really go too far into like interfacing the real world it really is like simple uh mathematic calculations that you can perform on ethereum right and then like and then there are many protocols that's being built on top of the underlying layer one very composable building block that enable even more uh emergence so um solving some of the takeaway here potentially would be like well some simple operation that cannot be enabled by this entirely new building block that is introduced by firepoint and then we look at nft nfp was also a concept for a while and then people kind of like saw the need for it but like it really and people define the standard of what is an mft so that's erc 721 but they didn't really take off until like cryptokitties uh which i believe that was in eve denver um currently if i'm wrong by the medicine if then where they really showcase the immense potential what can we do oh sorry got it eat waterloo oh waterloo that's right that's right um thank you so like cryptokitties really demonstrate what is possible with like nfts and then we see like lots of companies and really building and then now we saw this nft summer so uh some takeaway here will be the importance of defining a standard having reference reference implementation or cool concept will go a very long way and then we still need to find product market for whatever we are building whether it's a protocol marketplace or a platform or an application so just some more of that through ideas that will be part of this that are enabled by far coin i think uh we talked about this on our previous talk i'm just going over them again we have data boundaries where we have smart contract putting together funds for storage for the storage of a particular cid right it could be a collection of nfts it could be some data sets and then this phone only paid out when there's a proof that has been stored on filepoint last i heard this has already been implemented i think that maybe we can take this um hackathon as an opportunity to really figure out what are some interesting games or like that that we can develop on top of this and dinner dials where dials cannot be formed as a building building up of data about building up on data boundaries dials can now be formed around data that the community cares about right people can join and join this style by having proven that they store a piece through filecoin and through all these bridges right or they can just contribute to the pool right and then on top they have storage insurance commodity futures a minor incentivized repair data if let's say the falcon protocol reports that oh this data this piece of data is missing now you have a bounty to fix those or like there will be penalty uh already on the falcon protocol if the miner is not storing it and then we talk a lot about nfts right like i think we we we celebrated nft but we also noticed there are many areas of improvement and i think one one obvious one would be like um can we really redesign rethink the flow of nft and what is the value proposition better attribution right like because i think the metaphor should be open and then it should be and really the value is really in the context right so there is lots of room here to really rethink about what is the economics what is the future that we want to see and then we leverage uni building blocks on falcon to define new protocols and as i mentioned earlier we talked about what is in norway's and edge right and and really defining those even even in nft setting right what is a no well it's an edge right potentially let's say i uh merge to nft to create a new one that inherently there's a relationship right how can we really think through about value attribution and make that in a more transparent and fair way to really enable a greater community and a greater economy and verifiable compute right cid which is a unique identifier of the content on file coin they can be a binary of an algorithm right um you can also store it on file coin in that sense you can do you can verify compute uh based on the algorithm and based on the input data when you have compute and data you get more data so that creates a very interesting uh self-reinforcing loop and i think like lastly i think there's lots of room for layer two protocols on file point you really leverage this guarantee this like basic building block that the protocol provides where you can build multiple perpetual storage protocols on file coin pay one small forever you can see like maybe 10 of these on file coin content delivery protocols you can also see many of this on file coin and another observation here is when you look at all these like web 2 platforms right like when they first started out users have really strong incentive to uh to use the platform upload data to use the storage right like can we think about more creative incentive uh for client to use filecoin to use web3 to really bring the um the digital existence onto the website infrastructure so with that in mind falcon really is an exponentially growing ecosystem and many of um teams come into our ecosystem through the previous iteration hack fs so i'm very excited for uh hack fest this time around as well um and as we really as we participate in hackathon we think about what new interaction can we enable what kind of businesses are we building and how can we find product market fit and to recap falcon is really uniquely positioned and there's immense opportunities building layered to protocols platforms and product on file coin and we should constantly think about the business model and there are many many areas as we lay out that we can explore together as a community and with that i would like to pass on the time back to kartik thank you for excellent presentation there was a lot of information and i know everyone's going to take some time to address that given that we are a little short on time i want to uh remind people to continue the conversation in discord um if that's a good place for them to reach you i know i know we're really excited to get the conversation underway um i do want to introduce our next speaker michelle who works at protocol labs on the growing filecoin ecosystem uh i'll let ms show michelle intro herself a little bit better than i can and get things started right now thank you so much um give me just a second to get going on the slides um hello everyone i'm michelle lee also known as mosh um in various slacks githubs and discords around the internet um really happy to be here today to talk about some grants opportunities for your ipfs and file point projects um i am calling to you from philadelphia um it's in the northeastern u.s but it's got a pretty like subtropical climate and it's about 985 degrees outside today and 90 humidity um it reminds me of the jungle a lot um especially with my friends who i go mountain biking with in the woods here um and we you know in a jungle everything's growing all the time they're intertwined they're interdependent um you've got vines choking trees which are shading ferns which are catching sediment so that you know other plants can take root and grow and that feels a lot like how web 3 is these days with just you know an infinite number of projects that are getting off the ground getting started you know combining to make new patterns really really exciting space but this can't happen without a few key resources water you know air nutrients in the soil and it's through this grants program that the filecoin project is really committed to providing some of the resources uh for projects building on the stack to take root and growth so today i'm talking about grants but there's also all sorts of you know technical and you know architecture design support you know we our entire team is an open book we love to talk with you about your projects um today i'll focus specifically on grants though so um so i'm part of this ecosystem development onboarding team and our goal is to enable developers and entrepreneurs like yourselves to execute on your dreams through advocacy grants and collab support as you iterate towards success so coming in through independent projects or certain events or hackathons you know however you come in um there's there's a certain point at which projects just need a little more support or um uh or funding to to keep going and push through um and you know whether for you the escape velocity means um uh business profitability or the next level of uh investments or joining an accelerator program or you know um successfully building an independent volunteer community for your project whatever success means to you we want to help you get there so there's a two main types of grants programs that i'll dive into today um but there's you know like i said this is not the only form of support we provide so if you're kind of stuck or you're thinking that you would love to connect with other communities to take your project to the next level we're happy to chat no matter what structure that takes um but i'll give a little bit of an overview of uh one of the grants programs it's called next step micro grants the idea is that it's a flat five thousand dollars in five point tokens to take the next step on your hackathon or independent project um uh you know the the main criteria is that filecoin ipfs or lib pdp was used in the project stack and it can be either directly or through a framework or library or service like pinata or textile um nfc dot storage estuary any anything that directly or indirectly uses the stack um qualifies it's a very lightweight application with weekly review um and it's selected based on criteria so it's not a zero-sum game there's no stack ranking if your project meets these very simple criteria um we would be excited and thrilled to support you so the applications via github issue i'll walk through how that works um first of all in the dev grants repository you can check out some accepted grant applications to take a look at what we funded in the past take a look at how those successful applications have shared their info and then to apply you create a new issue it kicks off a template you complete the six questions um which includes some proof of you know um of your open source license or uh a link to the project showcase um submission that you previously made um but it's you know less than two pages hit submit new issue and we will review and get back to you within a week so just want to get out of the way and help you keep building the other major grants program that i wanted you all to be aware of is the open grants program and this is funded by multiple parties um not just protocol labs a falcon foundation um a lot of other collaborators and partners as well and these grants typically are five thousand to fifty thousand dollars for novel work to apply this stack in new domains you know bring significant new usage uh add a really um awesome tool to the tooling stack um so it tends to be kind of end to end projects rather than hey i started something and just want to take the next step um we also have some dedicated tracks for projects that integrate across web3 we just announced a collaborative grant program with hedera and with chain link and there's many many more to come um i would call the application process you know still pretty lightweight but a little more involved than um than the micro grant um and we review those every single month so you know average two weeks for you to get a response um and at most one month so um you know figure out your project idea talk to your collaborators talk to your partners talk to friends or you know come into the discords and sacks and and share some of what you're thinking um you can also check out the requests for proposals which are listed in the dev grants repository in the following project and these list areas of interest that we're particularly interested in funding um but we're also very much encouraging and welcoming of your novel ideas um after that you submit a pr using the proposal templates that's linked um and we like i mentioned we will get back to you within a month with the response sometimes there's a little bit of back and forth just to clarify what you meant or structured in a way that's a little bit more amenable to the grants program but um in general it's still a fairly lightweight submission process and um you know we're very happy to have it be a conversation rather than a you know has to be perfect on the first shot um just a few of the projects that we've funded through this program in the past um give you a sense of you know many different layers of the stack and totally different domains um ajam is a really cool ipfs app um that allows you to do asynchronous jam sessions for musicians so uh let's say i record a little guitar riff it gets posted to ipfs and then i can send the link to to ajam to to my friend to zx over there and from five states away or two consonants away zx can layer another track on someone's mind and we can write a song together so pretty cool especially um in the pandemic when it's harder for musicians to collaborate in real life um next project was funded through an open grant totally different um you know type of project this is a utility that splits and preps really big files before they get stored on file coin when it's called go graph split so this is just an idea for a really simple nice reusable tool um and uh go graph split is the result um the last one i wanted to share is on the right it's called the geo web project and here we're funding not just software but also a system so this team is actually working with um their state government on on a plan to anchor additional property rights to physical land uh it's a it's an environment where property records are not um are not particularly well trusted property records with the government at least so they're working on building a you know a digital system that crosses over into the physical realm really really cool our grants also fund community building work um software educational materials so really anything that contributes to growing the ecosystem as a whole so that's that's just a showcase um if i were to leave you with one message i would say it's just that we don't fight um we really really welcome you know conversation throughout the uh application process if you want to create a draft pr or file a work in progress issue we're happy to comment on that before you submit formally if you're not ready to do that that yet and just want to just want to chat um you can send us an email at grants.filepoint.org or find us in the file coin slack at grants dash questions um and uh you know think of this as uh you know no matter where you are on your journey or where you think you're headed or don't know where you're headed yet um non-dilutive capital is always a great thing so um thanks for having me here hope to see lots of uh project proposals and submissions in the future and look forward to being in touch thank you michelle thank you so much for that amazing presentation um just got a couple questions here um so we can just get a little bit more context and i know of course we can all find out this on the falcon selection on github but when you think about um these grants like how are you planning on structuring this internally is it more about you need specific problems to be solved or is it about know anybody who wants to continue building on this ecosystem we can do this thing how do you kind of balance uh the demand versus kind of core things that you would like people to focus on and could you share a little bit about that oh you're you're muted by the way sorry let me unmute um because i know how to use computers thanks frantic uh i think the balance historically has been 75 percent open 25 percent are you know rfp type projects um some examples of rfp projects are like the reputation service um that's being built so you can query miners and and their um their their prior deal stats and and make a selection based on that or different wallets for example um but like the vast majority of the grant proposals are people submitting their own ideas and we really like to see that because it means not only are they contributing work that we wouldn't have been able to produce with you know within the the existing community but also ideas and bridges to you know domains that they are really experts in and that they care about so um yeah there's no preference when it comes to and then maybe just uh another way to dissect that same question how do you think about ipfs versus falcon in this equation and then is that even a distinction to the program yeah um i think we're taking a much more integrated approach now on the ecosystem front um where you know ipfs has always been a part of file coin it's an olympiad as well like used as really key building blocks there and um and now we're also seeing tools on the other end tools like estuary and through storage pinata that kind of wrap the two together from the consumer end so that's why you know there's no point in us drawing lines or making distinctions between projects that's use you know certain subsets of these technologies um for us it's a win to decentralize the web and and data on the web no matter you know what uh you know which which of these uh protocols is more prominent for a given builder it's absolutely fair um and one last question for me and i'm going to put you on the spot here but could you share a little bit more about some of the rfps that are going on and sort of uh what matters in terms of priority right now to the ecosystem yeah i would love to um you can also find and read so everything i talk about you can find that filepoint project devgrants and then look under rfps um but right now we're making uh we've announced um several collaborations with other web3 projects right so um uh there's a lot of apps being built incorporating smart contracts a lot of these smart contract platforms are built to be really nimble like really fast transactions you know fast chain throughput very lightweight and an enterprise application might make 10 000 calls a minute to to a chain and these so these chains are not designed to be really fast but they're not designed to hold a bunch of data um and so if you think about smart contracts being like the logic layer of web 3 and file point and ipfs being the data layer um they work really well hand in hand and so some of the rfp areas are on building integrations between for example hedera token service and file point storage about connect with that storage or um using chain link oracles uh that that takes file phone storage and connected to off-chain systems so um quite a few rfps listed in that realm awesome well um thank you so much for sharing those insights and talking about the grants program and uh we have a little bit over a hundred projects that are planning on uh submitting uh on sunday so uh we'll be sure to tell everybody how they can actually keep continuing to build on on their work and get more non-dilated funding so really appreciate this and uh thanks again fantastic thanks for having me good luck to all the teams thanks all right so um hope all of you are enjoying the rest of the day um we are one talk away from today's summit before we finish everything and um i'd like to invite our next two speakers uh up here so um our last talk of the day is going to be about fall coin plus uh and deep and galen will talk about webhotline pluses and their as they're on the farmland plus team and just what it means to verify incentivize and onboard useful data so uh we have both of them here now and i'll ask them to turn on their video and get us started welcome thanks godzilla really excited to be here all right let's make sure deep see my screen i can see your screen sweet um looks like we're gonna go ahead and jump in thanks for that intro uh as you said talking about five coin plus verifying incentivizing and onboarding useful data uh onto the filecoin network i'm gavin mcandrew i'm with the filecoin foundation and the filecoin foundation for the decentralized web uh with me co-presenting is deep kapoor he's with protocol labs we kind of dual attack uh this project and work on it from you know both the social engineering and the technical infrastructure side and it is all open source and community driven processes so we're excited to tell you guys about it and how you can get involved and then we'll have time for questions um at the end but if anything comes up or we're going too fast or you have a burning urine question feel free to just pause us and jump in all right so to that end our agenda uh with the time that we have we're gonna go over just what is fill plus you may see it written this way big f little i little l plus that's the file coin plus program talk about how it works and its core mechanisms and concepts go over some of the kind of incentive mechanisms how this fits into that marketplace ecosystem and then talk to you about what you need to do to get data cap and then how you could get involved with the program a couple different ways so why don't we launch into it basically a like short answer is that falcon plus adds a layer of social trust to the file point network to incentivize useful storage we're going to unpack what some of these things mean as concepts the core mechanism is different actors different entities that could be an individual or it could be an organization play a role and essentially the allocation and spending of data cap so this graphic kind of highlights in a complicated way all of those interactions you don't need to memorize this to understand how the system works um but effectively through community governance model people can apply to be a notary those messages will go to some root key holders to approve it and sign messages on the chains they have this audit trail and then notaries have the ability to allocate that data cap to clients and then clients are going to feel deals with storage providers and those views are going to be verified uh through the literature of datacad so it is a novel resource that is like i said granted to notaries then down to clients and then clients use it in addition to phil to make deals it is not the same as some other currencies or tokens because it is a single use credit so it is not a currency that is going to flow or that you could go purchase it is consumed as it's used and it can't be transferred so it's more like saying like i have gotten kind of a coupon or a stamp that i'm going to then be able to use in these kinds of transactions and the way that it works downstream to the storage providers is they are going to get extra rewards by serving deals with datacap so we'll jump into how that functions so deep yeah let's jump into a little bit more so looking at like california as a network today um it's the supply side of the market is primarily served by storage providers that make storage available to the network effectively so they have access storage available or they're built out data centers which they're willing to rent out space over a period of time on effectively and so clients are in the market are effectively looking at ways in which they are able to utilize these services spread out geographically with different availability concepts standards compliance etc to identify storage providers that they would like to work with in addition or as an alternative to uh cloud storage options that may exist for those particular clients and so the way the network incentivizes the existence of supply and especially during like this initial growth phase of the falcon network was effectively looking at how much relative storage as a storage provider you are serving to the network um especially with regards to what everybody else is bringing to the table so effectively filecoin does a lottery or something close to one where it looks at the amount of power you have and power is measured as both a combination of the quantity of the amount of data you're making or space you're making available but also the quality of what you are stealing on the network and based on how much power you are making available to the network uh you are more or less likely to win block rewards so every epoch in falcon which is 30 seconds um several search providers have the opportunity uh to win block rewards and the likelihood of you winning block rewards is directly influenced by your relative power on the network um so now that you have like the basic sort of economics of the supply side down let's talk about the incentives of the supply side and why filecoin plus leverages or what it actually leverages to make a storage experience for a client more friction-free effectively so today as a storage provider you have the option to just make uh your space available or you're bringing on space to the network because you already know that you're going to steal a client's data in it so that's the difference between just sealing a sector versus stealing a deal in a sector and the benefits of serving a deal are that you actually get additional revenue so not only is the network compensating you for making supply available to the rest of the market but also you're earning money from the actual deal from a client because that client is going to pay you as you're offering them a service of storage so for the period of time that you're giving them storage as a service they're paying you uh you know per ebok effectively in falcon and additionally if a lot of people come to retrieve the data that's being stored so say it's like a public good like open data set so like copy data or environmental change data etc access that data itself can also be like paid for like the way you would expect from a cdn every time you go and actually test that data the provider that's actually giving you that data is taking opportunity cost on bandwidth dedicating hardware resources to ensure that your data gets transferred and then just in general making sure that they stay available online for you to access that data as well so that also yields additional revenue but this tends to come with liability as well right because as a storage provider you own the hardware on which somebody else's data is now being stored so not only do you have to deal with getting that data onto your hardware but also the implications of storing that data over a period of time and so while there's concepts already in the falcon deal making network around like content policy in terms of service and conditions in which a deal can actually happen it still is additional work like it's very simple for a storage provider to start out by just saying hey you know i've got a new hard disk of x terabytes that i'm just going to upload to the network and make available for supply down the line rather than having to negotiate with a client upfront identify what they'd like to store on behalf of that client and like turn it into a deal as it comes to network and what we see in the market is that price is effectively set as a combination of needing to offset these additional costs that come from making a deal which includes like the potential liabilities and then obviously the fact that it's an open market uh which tends to drive pricing down at least in the nature of the market today um or you'll start to look at falcon plus as an alternative where uh if clients come to a storage provider after going through the falcon plus like program where they've received this resource data cap that galen just talked about data cap effectively becomes like an alternate form of payment for a deal so it could be used in addition to filecoin or in place of filecoin but it's a completely independent value that's being set where a client can say yes i got datacap and i'm going to use datacap on this deal and the way a miner interprets that is basically that like the likelihood of how storing that data for them will um you know increase their presence on the chain is boosted by a 10 basically so there's a 10x multiplier on the storage that they're actually offering to the client that's coming and compensating them effectively in data cap and so miners become significantly more incentivized to choose to provide storage to specific clients that are coming with data cap so not only does it offset some of the liabilities by making it much more lucrative for a storage provider but also these clients are going through a vetting process to even receive that data cap in the first place which we'll be talking about soon after uh so it also reduces like any of the risks that a search provider may actually be taking on by creating a deal or having a long-term partnership even with a specific client and network and so as a result we end up seeing that clients that are willing to go through the process with and plus to receive data cap are more easily able to identify search providers that they can work with and also tend to receive storage at extremely low low prices so the main takeaway for you here um if you want to switch to next is actually that like storage providers are willing to effectively provide free storage for verified clients that go through the falcon plus system because the incentives that the falcon plus program creates for them outweigh the short-term cost both on board a client and their data to the network and then seal it and maintain it over a period of time so it's become a very interesting and useful lever uh for clients that are willing to go through the process to ensure that they are receiving the best possible deal when coming to store their data on filecoin and it also helps miners were able to offset their risks and increase their rewards over a period time so what does it actually mean to get datacap as a client so datacap as galen said you know it's it's a resource that basically gets allocated to a client and it's single use only so you you need to go get it from somebody who can actually give it to you and if you recall in that diagram there's this role of a notary um and so notaries are elected through like a community election process and granted a certain amount of data gap that they can dispense over a period of time to clients and so you as a client or a developer in the falcon network um either you want you already have an address to which you'd like to go and make deals from and so you'd like to go get data cap to that address or you're acting on behalf of like an additional user down the line like say you're building a service on the network or something that interacts with ether or different blockchains and you want to ensure that you are able to get the cheapest possible deal for you or for your users on the network depending on whether or not you're using your address or somebody else's address you're going to go and try and get data cap for that and so we interpret or we we like to think of this path as like three stages the first of which is getting a very small amount of data cap with a very minimal investment um through what is called like an auto notary or an automated notary one such notary that a lot of people use exists at verify.glyph.io what that particular program does is it basically checks to see that you have a valid github account that has existed for more than six months and assuming you don't go to it more frequently than once every 30 days i believe it will give you 32 gb bytes of data cap uh in the next possible like message that'll land on change so that typically takes about 30 seconds uh and so that's extremely useful because that's the size of like the average sector that a storage provider actually offers and on the network which means that on average like the deals that you're going to make are always going to be less than or equal to 32 gb bytes at a time like individually structured within the network and so when you are coming to that process and this enables you to have like at least one but oftentimes many uh since especially if you're storing uh smaller files that are in the medivites or i don't even know what the kib uh the term is uh using binary is not as intuitive but yeah if your files are smaller obviously unable to make even more deals uh but this ensures that you get at least one and it's extremely useful for testing and developing around uh falcon plus and ensuring that you understand the end damn flow and are able to utilize data cap as a client next is this process of going directly to an actual like human node rate so not an automated notary where a human is doing like subjective vetting due diligence and analysis to choose to give you some of their ground effectively as a client because they believe that you are worthy of this so uh their measure of worthiness uh we'll dig into a little bit more in the next slide uh but tends to be sort of a combination of like trust that they can establish with you as a client and like understand like who you are what you bring to the table but also the data that you're on boarding and why it's useful and valuable and enables filecoin to be a more productive network and achieve its mission to be like the data store for humanity um so individual notaries exist like all over the world we currently have like 23 uh active notaries distributed in most regions uh recently in the last military election cycle we also had energy elected from oceania so we're adding more continents as we go along um but no trees will typically ground like between zero and fifty two heavy bytes of data cap uh to an individual client so this is a really good uh way to go if you're working on like building like an actual production use case where like just like the test like gb magnitude is not enough but you actually want to onboard either like one or multiple data sets or you're working to build a solution where at least for your first round for production like having 50 uh db bytes to date data on board onto the network that's cover your needs then there's this third sort of tier which is if you're bringing on a really large data set and so this is we've seen this be really popular with a lot of like archival use cases um so like projects that are working on like multi-pebby-byte scale like data onboarding onto the network have come through this uh and so this path instead of like applying to an individual notary you're applying to groups of node trees effectively and so those groups and notaries become collectively liable as fiduciaries of the network to ensure that you as a client coming with the scale and demand to the network are worthy of receiving data cap at this magnitude and so the application process so that looks a little bit different and i'll talk to those in a second but the intent is that it's a fully open and transparent process uh where you do you know some requisite amount of kyc address questions that are coming in from the community or from those groups to notaries and receive like a massive amount of data cap uh associated with your address that gets allocated to you over time um and so that process is a little different in that for the for the first one you're going to a website and you know signing in with github giving an address and getting data cap for the second one uh you go to the filecoin plus registry and we can share links about this but you effectively it's a plus startfield.org you you sign into that and you just identify a notary that typically is either in your region on your relevant field of work and you're able to identify somebody that you can work with can understand your use case understand your business needs and can give you the data cap that you require and then there's this third year which is effectively not through such a easy or handheld process of a website but rather through like a github issue so that it is open and transparent and openly discussed and we also have community governance calls that we'll be talking about at the end of our presentation because we'd love to see you there but one of the topics of conversation at those calls is these large data set notary applications that are open at the moment um and ensuring that clients that are interested in being unblocked to store pepe by scale data on the network do receive the support and sort of the friction free experience to the extent that we can on the network and so this is more the collective responsibility large scale archival use cases on on falcon and unblocking them from moving forward i'll talk a little bit about this yeah yeah so deep sort of touched on some of this um we'll just speak you know briefly about like what it looks like to get verified again after you do sort of that first auto verification process as kind of a sample test run where you to go you know directly to a notary what they're going to do that we have some community standards that we sort of all share and aligned on but each notary can have their own individual process so there is not necessarily one hard and fast kind of application or set of questions that everyone would need to answer to work with that middle group of going directly to a notary but in general that kind of kyc you know know your client due diligence is essentially just going to be the notary asking a little bit more about you the client to say you know are you an individual or an organization can you share your website or your social media handles so that we you know can fed a little bit that you exist who are you and then tell us a little bit about your use case and the data type so the data type could be you know someone who's storing primarily documentation and the use case is it's a technical archival data set of sort of you know written documentation or it might be a data type that is video archival video files from some you know journalistic endeavor that they collected and then there's conversations around whether or not this data is public or private um and then the questions become you know what is your anticipated sort of storage behavior and there's some kind of guidelines that we encourage people to use around like how much redundancy do we encourage people to to bake into their system and then what kind of geographic distribution so our goal and intent through these programs is to kind of both help clients make you know good archival data decisions using some some industry best practices but to also have you know diversified uh network strength and so helping with geographic um and storage provider diversity and then this question is around like you know deal and data transparency so we want to have these you know deals existing transparently on the network and sort of getting the clients um you know to share and understand like that current expectation and so that's the path in that in that middle sector where you may be getting in the teddy by range of data cap working directly with the notary uh in your region and then if uh you know you wanted to learn more about the file point plus program or you know what you could do to get involved um the first great place is just following you know this link to these docs these are on the five coin docs and it's a set of steps that will walk you through everything from you know standing up a lotus light node and creating your first address you know linked to that lotus light node and then going through the process of using that auto notary to verify and get your first little sample set of 32 gigabytes of data cap to then experiment and play with you could work directly with a notary if you want to onboard larger data sets maybe you know again as something that you wanted to test or a service that you were building out or developing um then you can find more about that in our kind of github repo right now as well as in that plus potfill.org um link that we sent in the chat you can find you know both of these links we also would love to invite you uh all to get involved in our community governance you can join a call um those are happening every other week and we you know discuss some of the topics um you know directions that the program is going how can we you know where the friction points how do we unblock people because the the overall goal of file point plus is to help sort of grease the wheels on deal ceiling and how do we get more data onto the network um in a way that is working for all of those different entities and so in those governance calls we want to try and understand you know where some of those friction points are and then see what solutions we could implement we also invite you all to apply and become notaries and become those stewards of the network directly working with other clients and so you may be interested uh you know in working with a larger array of clients that are creating that data um and so you could help connect them to that data cap to get those verified deals we also always need additional tooling we have lots of interesting ideas and processes for things the filecoin foundation has grants available at a range of sizes for people to help build tools that are going to grow and improve the overall filecoin network some examples are things like reporting and investigation tools uh on you know various like deal-making and behavior practices uh being able to investigate where data cap is in that different funnel and maybe again helping automate some of that process of how we would unblock by finding the stimulus point we also want to improve the notary due diligence process what are some tools that we can help build in conjunction with our notaries and have a robust tool set that helps our notaries do that kyc process in kind of a fair and transparent and equitable way again in an international scale uh so to all of that you could work directly with the filecoin foundation contact us um we're happy to help talk to you about our different death grant opportunities uh and we are standing up kind of different bounty boards where we'll you know figure out some of these um primed ideas seed ideas but we'd just love to hear from the community about what ideas they may have we super appreciate your time and listen to us about five coin plus and verifying and onboarding useful data to the five coin network love to open it up to any questions and discussions that the group might have oh gail indeed that was a incredible introduction to flock oneplus we had a couple questions but you already answered all of them in the last slide because you went into every single subsection of how this appeals to different parties uh maybe i'll just kind of rephrase some of the questions that we can go maybe deeper into it but i think maybe just understanding how you're prioritizing which group to kind of get involved more you obviously talked about the devtools side the the notary side the sealer side so is there like a particular group that is more important right now and how are you thinking about bringing people in sure yeah um yeah my reaction to that is basically no i think that all of these stakeholders are really really important and individually um play a role that supports like supports each other effectively like it's very hard to just have extremely efficient notaries and then not have clients that want to leverage those nodejs to use the network and if you have a lot of clients and you don't have the supply side of the marketplace to storage providers that are interested in taking those deals then it's also not particularly useful i think one thing that the network has going for it right now is a very strong set of storage providers um that are willing and able to serve the needs of clients on the network and so we sort of view falco and buses and they right now as an enabling function for those clients to say hey like how do i prove that i am like a productive member of this ecosystem and then how do i convince a storage provider to effectively pick me or work with me to ensure that i get like high quality storage over a period of time uh and so effectively uh you know we'd love to engage people that are your notaries that want to be notaries or people that are clients and want to be clients um or are also just on like this the supply side of the marketplace the storage providers but also in general like the falcon press program is relatively young like we think about things on the five ten year minimum like horizon uh with these things and as a network falcon's only been around for a year  on bus was instituted as a fip at that stage as well and so i think we've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of improvement in our processes and so even the bare minimum hey like show up to our calls check out the github repo like talk to us give us your feedback engage on slack github etc it's still useful like minutes of time from somebody who has a helpful perspective at this stage uh still adds a lot of value and so i i would almost say like reduce what you think the standard is for you to like participate and engage in the system and be productive and help this sort of flywheel effect of ensuring that like the network is productive and come engage in whatever the natural fit is because i think we'd love to have you so there's also an advantage as we have lots of things that can be worked on in parallel and so you know someone coming to to this this particular program with ideas or tooling you know for example that they wanted to help build are not in any way going to slow down or be at the cost of us you know engaging with them and helping get that project going while also prioritizing you know onboarding more of those large data sets or you know working to unblock the notary due diligence process and so one of the things that's just really exciting is as you know as deep said if somebody comes in and they have a new perspective or a new idea and a little bit of bandwidth that can really uh quickly like rapidly turn into a lot of an exciting opportunity potential because we can then maybe connect them with other community members that are thinking the same way or that are kind of pulling in that same direction and so the nice thing about a very broad open source community governance model is you know we don't have as many kind of individual blockers where you know changes or project programs need to really kind of fit into some kind of road map or particular process scale um and so it allows us to really work on lots of exciting things in parallel well uh nothing this is really well said and i think i'll summarize this by saying if anybody's interested in getting involved showing up is the first step and uh it's really enough that uh you can figure out how you can best participate in that ecosystem so uh with that i want to thank both of you for talking about falcon plus and for that amazing talk and then we'll wrap the the day with uh a quick message to all of our hackers that submissions are due this sunday and uh can't wait to see what everybody builds so happy hacking everybody and uh if you are stuck or if you have any last-minute things that you need help on uh be sure to ping the mentor's channel on discord and want to make sure that you're ready for this sunday so uh thanks for tuning in uh thanks for watching all the summits and engaging with us on the chat and uh once again happy hacking and uh while uh we close this off today enjoy some low-fi beats on eclo that tv we'll see you all next week you
