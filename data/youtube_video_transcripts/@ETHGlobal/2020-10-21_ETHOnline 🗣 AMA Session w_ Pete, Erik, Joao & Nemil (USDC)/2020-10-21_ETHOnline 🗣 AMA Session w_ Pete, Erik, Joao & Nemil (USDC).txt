and we're good cool cool just wait a minute for a couple more people looks like we've got a bit of a couple people on youtube too it's good we're going to do uh non-presenting people video off though urban but good to see you doing well urban a long time attendee of our in-person events yeah i loved coming to some of the events yeah i think in particular i think correct me if i if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that urban you built like a robot that is new york right that was running up i think on thunder chain actually on thundercore yep and this time we're doing something different which is using nfds and uh reprogrammable robots there you go always a robot okay cool um all right let's let's look to uh kick off the ama here might be some more people to trickle in but we'll just let them in um awesome okay well first of all big thank you uh to everybody from the uscc team being on the call here um we have we have pete we have the mill we have eric we have joelle um so it's a full house i'm excited to be asking everybody a bunch of questions today um and of course a big thank you for the usdc team in supporting this event um you know without our without our sponsors we're we're not able to to run these events for our attendees for free at least um so really really help us offset the cost of running these and uh we're you know really grateful for their support and um you know being able to uh to run this event for everybody so and of course to have their tech um support at the event as well so you know usdc is as we'll get into a really useful stable coin for for basically anybody's project that wishes to have some sort of stable asset involved um so so yeah so i guess you know big thank you um and i guess without further ado kind of kick off the question side of things um just that everybody who knows in the chat um basically what will happen is i'll start some some nice motivating questions and then you know if anybody else is following along has any questions feel free to raise your hand on on zoom or or ask the question and chat and we'll come to you and we'll hand it off to you um so yeah so i think kind of a good place to start um typically i start these off with kind of the history but there's a lot of people here um so so maybe we'll we'll kind of start with uh i guess just kind of the definitions if you will so um i guess you know what is usdc and then and kind of a little bit about kind of the history of the project if you will i'm not sure who's best to field this one um but but would kind of love to kind of get a sense of sort of like um a what is it and then b uh kind of how to get started yeah i'm happy to take that on and happy for folks to to jump in as well i i i think out of the four of us i would guess eric tierney on the circle side is probably the person who has been involved with the project for the longest um so so maybe i'll maybe i'll share some part and then he can add but but as you said like starting with the definitions ussc is obviously a fiat collateralized uh stable coin um i think circle initially uh gravitated towards the idea of of building a stable coin solution back in i think late 2017 and uh and you know given the philosophy that we always had as a company that you know we would bring uh you know services to businesses and consumers financial services that are based on crypto and public blockchain technology but we do that in a you know regulated and compliant way and and you know primarily based out of the us and uh and with partnerships with you know us domicile banks and and partners um so so we thought that you know there was a space in the market for for that kind of uh via collateralized stablecoin solution and um and then the rest is really history i think we i think we we had a we had a an intent to use that solution internally given the products that we offered at the time we had peer-to-peer payments products uh consumer investment products and also um and also a crypto exchange in in the poloniex operation and um and we wanted to utilize that technology internally as well as we knew that it was going to be an interest externally and um i don't know eric if you want to add anything any interesting um historical elements about how how that all came about the first few lines of code things like that oh eric i'm not sure you're coming through all right i think it might be your headset yeah i think the headphones or the microphone are not totally plugged in kind of the idea i'm getting is that better that's much better okay uh yeah so i was just saying uh yeah if we go back to when we had products like circle pay uh you know we had bitcoin integration in there and we uh we kept trying to do things like um with other uh companies and other countries and stuff we kept trying to use uh things like bitcoin for it um and kind of we kept running into all these like kind of stumbling blocks and pretty much everything was kind of pushing us towards like well really we just want like dollars on the blockchain um you know we want like programmable dollars so um eventually we kind of you know learned our lesson and stop doing it you know stop trying to do it with like bitcoin and we said okay well maybe we should just uh kind of try to build this as like a industry standard kind of thing um and so that's kind of like where usdc kind of came about um gotcha cool um and then maybe maybe a question for everyone um kind of each each by each kind of curious about sort of you know obviously this is uh the effort as that what you've decided to spend your time on right and and your working hours and that kind of thing i guess um you know it's one thing to say that you know just putting a dollar on the blockchain that's like a uspec thing like but also you know i'm kind of curious about sort of like why you know for each of you it's personally important to you and it's possible maybe some of those uh overlap uh reasonings but i guess i'm you know really curious about sort of um you know maybe thinking a little bit more on the impact side or otherwise kind of motivations for wanting to work on the project um yeah but just kind of be curious about kind of the personal reasons for for why you've chosen to work on usdc um maybe we'll start with pete yeah so um you know yeah let me tell you a story um when i uh interview candidates or uh meet with people at conferences i like uh giving away free crypto and showing them what they can do with it and all i ask for in uh for like in return is that they download coinbase wallet which is a non-custodial uh wallet that uh coinbase provides that you can download for free and uh almost everyone says sure why not right like nobody says no to free money right so uh so i give them some free eat about five dollars in each this was when like gas prices were low like one gig away um and uh once they get the free eats from me you know they want to know what they can do with it so i showed a bunch of dabs that they can use so first thing i show them is unit swap and i have them navigate to unit swap and exchange some eath for uscc and then i show them how to use a compound to start earning interest on the uscc they've just gotten you know uh like i said um you know this was when gas prices were like one giga away and also compound was paying about you know five percent interest for uscc posits i think it's a lower now but back then was pretty good and it was a lot better than like what most bank bank accounts were paying right and this demo almost almost always blew people's minds you know they went from zero like not having used crypto before to owning first crypto to earning interest using crypto in minutes and uh you know and you didn't have to like fill out forms you know there was no human interaction needed well i was the only human interaction you know they had uh and uh they didn't have to like pass a credit check or anything you know and i could have given the exact same demo to uh anybody uh around the world you know i could have given the exact same demo to someone thousands of miles away in a different continent even like the most remote like parts of the world as long as they have a smartphone and access to the internet and this is incredibly powerful you know i think economic and financial infrastructure around the world i mean we would live in you know in a developed country and this is not something that we think about but in many parts of the world you know people don't even have bank accounts and the fact that this technology can be used to provide access to modern financial system to anyone around the world like that's really powerful and uh and that's what got me excited about uh you know working on uh well crypto and and uscc that's just a yeah a little story of mine and uh you know i i don't know if uh some of those people that have tried uni swap uh uh with my free eath uh are listening but if you are you can also get 400 free uni uh it's uh it's worth about a thousand two hundred dollars now i think yeah it's like a free iphone so uh go claim it if you haven't yeah pretty good deal um awesome how about um so the question i always ask people um is basically what is your origin story in crypto and i think that's what you're asking me but it's basically um i think about the world of like batman and how he became a superhero and almost everyone whenever i go to the events i almost always ask my questions how do you get involved in me so i think for me there's like two main experiences number one was um i worked actually for banks and if you've ever done it work for banks you realize just how dilapidated the system that everything like runs on is today and so for context of the us or the last 34 years has been a tremendous amount of consolidation but they still are running cobalt mainframes in a lot of cases to be able to run the i.t stack that we run on so i remember doing that experience and i'm like this is the best we got you know in the in the year 2010 or the year 2020. um so that was number one that is i think one thing that just radicalized me against how poor the stack was the second thing was that i spent a year on at the gates finish in the world bank and building a mobile payments provider in india um and so for context mobile payments was taking off about 2009 2010 and i went to india and i was helped set up one of the first microfinance mobile payment uh pilots so basically using mobile payments because of the price of microfinance delivery and so i think what i realized about system was that it's again all these apis are so privileged most people can access them and i when i compare that to the experience i was used to on you know normal coding or normal api you might be used to like a twilio it was just such so much more complex and i think that just made me realize just how valuable the need was um and what the types of like things we could do to fix that and so i remember like in 2015 when ethereum launched the apis on day one were in a lot of ways better than almost all aps available in the traditional financial stack right and so this was a world like at least it was pre-twilio it was pre like other types of banking apis and i think that takeaway was just like look this is so huge if we can add stable dollars on top programmability right and non-custodiality all these other guarantees that ethereum offers this is really just changing the types of financial services you can offer so i think those are my two experiences was working with existing banks and number two was seeing the pain points up front of like microfinance and like how we could potentially offer really powerful financial services directly to groups of customers like that around the world awesome yeah i know it's definitely a big kind of global impact is is huge and um and yeah i mean the technology stack is exciting and enables all these things very easily and um no it that's great awesome be chill turn over to you yeah i share two things but i share one on the mills experience i also work for banks in in in brazil and then in europe um and yeah same same same exact experience you know just completely shocked having having you know having come from from other engineering i i am a software engineer by by training so i you know i have i have worked on um sort of networking and uh in other contexts where where technology is pretty sophisticated and always kind of pushing the state of the art for things like you know mobile networks and things like that and then eventually i landed on banking and i was like really are you guys serious that this is the kind of stuff you're using for first of all as emil said like there's a bunch of core competencies on a bank that are running on on like a you know a mainframe and software from the 70s um that you know basically nobody knows how to maintain anymore and and people just uh you know accept certain certain bugs as features um and then i've seen people people doing reconciliation of consumer balances on bank accounts like with excel spreadsheets at the end of the day i mean it's just you know mind-blowing and then and but but the thing is we learn to we learn to accept that that's just the way it is right you learn to accept that you look at sometimes the balance on your bank account and you kind of know that that's not right but you you know you're willing to wait another day because maybe they're going to fix that up and uh you know transactions are not properly settling yeah and that and that that's just crazy you know given the amount of sophistication that we have at the softer world today for that still to be the case so the moment i entered crypto and i entered crypto you know initially personally and then eventually through circle professionally i just i just knew that you know that there had to be a way for that to to be the new infrastructure for money because it was it was so much uh more robust and sound um but then the the other experience that i had as well was was in circle then we i i helped to work with with eric and with a bunch of other folks on this peer-to-peer payments product that we had and we we built all the all the infrastructure for fiat on ramps in the u.s and then we ported that that infrastructure to europe at least um in in europe you know it's not that homogeneous if you consider things like the uk and and the eurozone um so even in those three kind of geos right the us and and and uk and europe you you realize that if you want to build a global financial service a grow a global financial product it is and you want to connect to these traditional uh you know ways of implementing infrastructure for money it's just so complicated it's just so expensive it's just so time consuming i mean literally it's going to easily take you a year to like you know deploy a system like that in every one of these regions given that the banking and processing partnerships you need to establish the compliance licenses the all the other relationships and then having to cope with like very old apis and very brittle and silent way of doing things and then nothing is interoperable you do it for that region and you need to repeat it again if you want to go to africa to east asia and so on and so forth and then once we start once we started thinking as eric said around yeah what we really want is a dollar on the blockchain what we really want is not hold consumer funds in an fbo bank account but hold them in wallets you know not not connect to a payments processor but use blockchain for transferring funds in and out uh it's just very powerful and i see today companies that with a much smaller team they using this technology they have the ability to build a product that is inherently global from the get code they don't have these artificial silos that are usually put in place by by traditional infrastructure for money as i call it so i think i think for that reason it's tremendously powerful and i've seen the value of you know in comparing what i've done you know five years ago to what we do now how how much more superior is yeah totally it makes sense i mean given like how many years the kind of traditional finance world has been kind of developing and how many different silos they have you know it's basically almost easier to just kind of in a way start from scratch right just kind of re-engineer like what we need to do um and then yeah i mean that system is archaic i mean if anyone you ever sent a wire transfer i mean that's that's all you need to know right because it's uh it's quite a tough uh system to work within um and then yeah last but not least for this question eric i'm kind of curious about sort of if you can echo any of this or if there's anything novel or anything uh yeah i mean like they've stolen a lot of things i would have said um um but i just like i'd like to add on like what joao was saying that um i'm really excited about how like usc is kind of like an enabling technology so like we work on it and we put it out there but then it enables like uh developers all over the world to just kind of take it and run with it and do whatever they want right like banks were not innovating on anything right they weren't doing payments or anything to make moving money easier right like wires and swift that's all you know john payne the ass um but by you know putting usdc out there and now making it easy so that anybody can get it now pretty much anybody can just start interacting with it on um ethereum and just you know if they have an idea they can just get some usdc and they can go run and implement it and if it's if it's a good idea then great it'll succeed and if it's not then well it won't but that's okay too um and it's just uh really cool to see all the things that people are building with it um you know just in all like the deep high space and stuff that's that that's really cool and i think they'll probably be way more stuff in the future and you know we don't even know what it is right now um but that's that's something that kind of like gets me really excited about working on it is seeing what others will actually do with it totally yeah it makes a lot of sense um okay awesome so i guess kind of want to chat about sort of i guess the developer experience and sort of just the use usage of it actually um i mean for anybody who checked the summit out last weekend or last friday pete kind of talked about the process of upgrading usdc to v2 um i kind of curious about sort of if someone could maybe provide an overview of sort of what are some of the new features of v2 and how do those kind of help enable kind of new new ways of interacting with the coin um i'm not sure who would be best to take that question but would love to kind of know a little bit more about about v2 and how it was an upgrade i think pete himself maybe might be best suited for him okay uh so yeah i i i would say the biggest uh feature is the uh the uh the guestless uh sense uh that we added and um uh you know previously in order to move uh move sorry usc or use uscc and d5 products or other adapts you also had to uh buy and hold and own um eath and that was there wasn't a very good user experience uh to be honest um on centralized exchanges you know it wasn't a problem because they uh you know they abstracted away and they they pay the gas for you but uh you know for non-custodial wallets it was confusing a lot of people um like you know a dab requires uscc and uh so they buy uscc and move usc to their wallet you know metamask or coinbase wallet and only to realize that they also need youth and to be able to actually use adapt that was confusing a lot of people and um coinbase also has um has this initiative well this is not just coin basis but coinbase is a big part of it uh called uh give crypto and we've been um doing some sort of a you know sort of a universal basic income type of experiment where we've been giving a bunch of people in venezuela free crypto uh just to learn about how first of all whether uh people can actually use uh crypto as money right the crypto like it's not tangible it's not it's just a number uh a bunch of numbers you see on phone screens and um and uh whether they can actually use it as money like will they accept it as money will they be willing to you know um barter things uh using uh crypto those are some of the things that we want to learn uh about as well as you know the the uh the effect of uh a basic income in uh high imp inflation country where fiat currency has failed you know um miserably and um and we we've been using geeth um but we we wanted to actually give usac uh but we couldn't part of the reason why we couldn't give uscc was because you know we also had to give a little bit heath for him to be able to send uscc to another person and each time they send uscc to another person they also have to remember to send a little bit of eth as well so that the next person can also send uscc and because of that limitation we we couldn't use uscc even though ustc would have been much better for the experiment because the volatility isn't there so it kind of enables use cases like that and also it's great for uh layer two as well um uh using you know with guest list sends uh you know player two solutions often require uh you to like switch networks but with gas less technology you don't actually have to switch networks because you can just um you know create a signature and someone else can you know uh submit that transaction uh for you and that enables you to um transact in layer 2 without having to switch networks which is a huge ux uh issue and that's one of the reasons why a lot of layer 2 networks haven't been able to gain much adoption but it solves that as well so yeah i think that would be the the biggest feature that i think a lot of people would be excited about and um as soon as we uh released uscc v2 um noah from uh from uni swap uh did an experiment with it and did uh the guest list um well from the perspective the user of course uh guest list swap and units and it was really fun to see um unfortunately somebody still has to you know pay for the transaction fee but the guest listens also enable you to charge fees in uscc uh which again improves user experience uh yeah and there are some other miscellaneous um improvements but that is the biggest feature that we have in uccb2 awesome yeah it's i mean i think it's important to note actually that like you know i think for like for instance like you know me using like a adapter or something and like having to deal with sort of um needing to have a little bit of ease to interact with that and then use kind of a university 20 like uscc in between like um i mean that's a that's a really bad user experience like just like using the app but i mean for people who um could probably benefit most from utilizing especially like a stablecoin as technology like it's not even just a user experience thing it's literally just like a barrier to entry right and i think that that distinction is like pretty important where um you know like it sometimes it's not just ux uh and some ux can actually be a barrier entry so i mean that's pretty awesome to hear and i guess maybe it would be possible to chat a little bit also about how uh that's working under the hood like kind of um you know like one example of this could be you know similar to sort of like a meta transaction type approach curious to see kind of how usdc is implementing it um maybe at a high level yeah it is a it is a meta transaction implementation so uh it enables the uh the sender to basically sign some sort of an authorization you know you're authorizing someone to you know move funds or pull funds um and uh that authorization can be submitted to the blockchain network by anybody and and the the person that's actually doing the active submission is paying for the gas and optionally uh you know the they could be compensated by charging you know fees in uscc does that make sense yeah yeah no no that makes sense um cool nice previously the sender uh had to always had to beat the person's pay for gas yeah right totally um okay awesome and then just a reminder anybody who's watching if you have any questions or anything you know feel free to throw up your hand i'm gonna ask my kind of famous last question um which is you know basically uh if you weren't sort of working at uh on usdc full time and you had some time to maybe take a look at building at the hackathon um what would sort of you be most interested in building on right now what's sort of like either some topics or thoughts that are flowing through your head on projects that you wish you had time to build or some unique areas of interest i'm just kind of curious like what would you be attacking on if you were part of the event maybe we could start back reverse reverse order with eric maybe uh yeah um yeah i don't know i spent a lot of time on uscc but uh uh i guess i don't know i i haven't been able to look into it too much but some of the like streaming payment stuff that is out there uh i find pretty interesting and uh so i probably want to i'd probably start by digging into some of that stuff um but yeah um yeah some i think that probably yeah stream payments something like whatever is it uh say sadly or whatever whatever that is um you know kind of being able to like steadily just pay out people with usdc you know or any sort of kind of solution where you could kind of like actually use it for um kind of like day-to-day payments um you know which right now with the high gas prices is a little challenging definitely cool awesome good job oh dang i was going to say something around payments and now i feel like i need to say something different um reverse order this time yeah but but i know i i'll stick to payment i'm very interested in maybe i maybe i should qualify as more commerce i think i think there's there's a lot of good stuff you know in place you know coinbase has coinbase commerce there's a there's a lot that has been done in the last number of years but i still think we it feels like we have a new wave of of building blocks a new wave of tools including you know gasless bands university usc v2 and things like that and i would be curious in you know seeing how how especially like two-sided marketplaces um you know the ones that have obviously buyers and sellers and you have you know payments being taken from buyers and sellers having to be paid for for whatever is happening in the marketplace it could be an uber or it could be an airbnb or or an ebay and kind of and kind of really play deeply with the the ux of uh of such an application when that you know is built entirely on top of uscc um so my interest is perhaps more on the ux side for for very mainstream use cases like commerce cool how about you in the ml so um i have packed two previous at eighth events i think the san francisco one and the new york one um and i actually would like extend what i worked on in the new york one but it's i think more and more we're gonna have funds held in d5 protocols i think the safety of those funds are paramount and the question is how do we create systems for that so i think like the idea of basically defy shorts some type of insurance products that allow decentralized insurance for people holding funds in protocols and there's a few teams that come to market but i think there's also other ideas but still to be tried there so i'd say that's a really critical one for me another one is just tooling for other developers to be able to build on top and so i think that ethereum has come a long way from the financial stack i think it's maybe not quite in the stripe type experience that we might be used to and i think there are things that we can do there of tooling to be able to make it easier to build things and i think i'll leave with like two last plugs has been um we have a request for startups that we've done and they're a number like we're willing through the uscc bootstrap fund willing to fund startups that are like or even programmers for hacking on ideas where they need initial usbc liquidity um and we also have a number of prizes here so if you are working on at least some of those would be super excited to talk awesome and then hopefully we didn't steal too many of your ideas pete yeah um yeah if i could uh hack this time i would have worked on uh an interest bearing or maybe i shouldn't say interest i should say rewards for legal reasons rewards pairing uh uscc um global venmo uh what us interest bearing uscc so basically what it is is um you know it would use something like you're involved um so you put money in it we'll pull funds and you're in vaults so you are um you'll start earning interest on your uscc and we'll put that on layer two uh we'll issue the same amount of tokens on layer two so the transaction uh between users transactions between users will be free you'll be fully covered using you know guess what sends and the fees are frankly so low and later too that you can fully cover the transaction costs like 0.0001 per transaction um so so yeah like the user experience would be like you open this app and you transfer some uscc to it you will then deposit it and you're involved and you know issue you instead of a token that wraps that on layer two and that can then be used to you know the transact yeah so you can send money between users and and since it's uh it's a wrap token um it always be um uh so when you uh even you know you know uh even after um sending the the receiver will also be receiving a token that's interest bearing and i think it'd be a really cool way to provide sort of a an opportunity for you know people in the less developed countries uh where people are lots of people are unbanked to start saving and you know earning interest now we'll have to think about how they can get usc in the first place and for that we'll probably you know think about maybe creating some sort of uh scratch cards that they can you know purchase for uscc or convert you know cell phone minutes or something to uscc but there are a lot of cool ideas that i would love to work on um to to enable you know people in uh in countries that are not uh that are underprivileged when it comes to financial systems awesome cool i think you'll be happy to hear that there is a worldwide venmo project that's being built right now and uh so so maybe we'll have that by the end of the event um but uh i guess maybe they're stealing your idea a bit too so um awesome okay cool so i mean happy to kind of wrap it up here if there's no questions from the audience but if there is kind of it's your last random fun question look at that um random fun question how would you explain or pitch yield farming to folks that are not in crypto or getting into crypto i don't know who wants to take that one i have not had the pleasure of doing that i'm thinking that maybe this thanksgiving is going to be my first time trying to do that yeah so just for context i think this is a super exciting time um the way i think about deal farming so one thing is that i think about from the protocol side i've talked to a number of teams that are launching protocols i see it almost like a marketing budget it's a way for you to be able to take your tokens be them in a certain way to drive usage um demand virality of your protocol um so that's the way i kind of talk about it it's like almost like a marketing scheme that you're using from the protocol side for the user i think the best analogy i had is like teaser rates um and giveaways that like banks do so i don't know if you knew like banks used to get like toasters away if you came in and opened the bank account that's like one more traditional example more complex examples would be like um like high yield savings accounts would offer super high yields for a period of time so for example 90 days you might get a much higher yield and so that's the way i think i would explain it is almost like it's a teaser rate to be able to do certain actions that the protocol um or financial product needs um ever once and that is a way for you to get rewarded as as part of that yeah i was going to say uh uh you know like the bonus miles that you get when you apply for credit cards you know like if you apply for i'm not gonna mention the uh the card but uh you know you can get like up to a hundred thousand bonus miles uh if you meet like a minimum spend or whatever i think it's very similar to that yeah obviously it's not uh it's not risk-free especially if it involves uh having to you know provide like liquidity uh paired to uh say uni swap like emms because there's impermanent loss and that's i think i've been having trouble explaining in permanent loss that's that's actually a pretty difficult concept for a lot of people to understand and i think the term itself is also uh like uh yeah it's uh i think i think i forget exactly who came up with the term but i i remember reading that uh they regret calling it impermanent loss uh but yeah like uh like what uh namel said it's kind of a marketing budget yeah you're getting you know toaster you're getting bonus mouse things like that for for using their service cool um awesome looks like there's another question uh looks like it's from youtube um so i think it's for pete pete what do you think about kind of layer two versus like uh an algorithm or sulcana based usdc okay um i think when you s uh by layer two i think you're referring to layer two uh i think on top of ethereum yeah yeah uh yeah um so i think it's surely to tell whether a grand or slana will gain traction in terms of usage there have been lots of ethereum killer wannabes in in the past but uh none uh has been able to really uh steal the throne yet and uh the biggest the big reasons for that is composability right ethereum already has a ton of projects on it and uh and people are it's like you know people people want to first of all build on top of existing projects uh but also they want to make their project interoperable with other projects and um uh grand i haven't to be completely honest i haven't really looked into a gran or selena deeply but uh they're interesting projects and they have a ton of potential i think and uh and usc going is going to be supporting those genes as well um but uh the the benefit of layer two um solutions is that it's ethereum compatible right so if you especially for the evm compatible ones if you have an existing project in ethereum it's really easy for you to just port it over to layer two and you can also easily move tokens um between layer one and layer two and that's what makes those i think a lot more powerful than uh and then say uh using a completely different chain where you know you can't get that inter interoperability um i think solana is working on some sort of bridge uh i i think i i read about it recently um bridgette theorem i think that could be interesting um but uh yeah i mean i i would like you know all of these uh for all of these projects to succeed and gain traction but um and i you know i can't really pick winners or sites but yeah i mean it'll be interesting to see um but you know uh just personally i i prefer layer two just because you know i i'm an etherean guy yeah cool um totally makes sense and then maybe another question which you know possibly there's no answer for or cannot disclose the answer for but is there a timeline for usdc availability on facebook novi which is apparently the uh libra wallet that facebook developed yeah and so i think over the last several months you've seen your cc be available on more and more different chains and so the goal i think our vision is basically that it's a standard it's available for developers wherever they need it and so we you know i think ethereum is a really like one of the most important places for that to be uh but i think the goal is over time that we're going to offer on more and more chains um i think i can't speak to specific items about facebook novi i think there's also they'll be launching with their own stablecoin um but i think that's like that's something that we're definitely considering and looking at uh facebook and a number of other channels cool um awesome we'll see if there's the one any last questions otherwise we can wrap up all right we'll call it there um okay big thank you to the ustc team uh for for taking the
