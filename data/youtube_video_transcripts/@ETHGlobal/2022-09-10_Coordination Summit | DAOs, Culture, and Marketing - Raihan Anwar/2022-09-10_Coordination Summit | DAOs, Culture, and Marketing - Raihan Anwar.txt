foreign [Applause] [Music] next up we are ready for our next speaker and I'd like to welcome freon to talk about Dao's culture and marketing so from FWB please uh welcome right hi how's it going things are going great how are you amazing doing all right awesome I'll I'll let you take over from here and I decided to uh hear the talk for sure so my Talk's going to be kind of Gestalt about a couple oops different things that I've been thinking about lately and primarily I've really been considering what it means for Dallas to really consider Community Building from a marketing standpoint as well as from a decision-making standpoint and a lot of similar to the previous speaker I really want to talk about it's kind of who we are at FWB how we make decisions and how a lot of our decision-making processes have bifurcated as a result of the Dow structure initially we were just a group chat um where it's just me and maybe about 20 of us chatting joking about crypto and at some point people started seeing the growth of the community saying hey how can I help what can I do so you know you call ourselves a cultural membership a lot of uh amazing web3 artists thinkers really considerate folks and we really use on-chan metrics of holding the token as a means of joining events but also submitting your own ideas your own creativity and finding people to work on projects alongside you so you know some of our larger success stories have been folks like Eric who who is a phenomenal designer X Nike a few other things and you know he was like I have no idea how on chain art Works can I find folks to really take my creative practice and make it on chain and within I want to say a three-month time span he spun up an amazing project called monarchs that was 888 procedurally generated butterflies in his very own unique style and he found all his coding and Dev help that way and as part of that mint process he actually gave I believe five five percent of the mint back to FWB as a Down so we're always thinking about kind of what does it mean to take opportunities externally share those within the community for FWB and then share those within the wider web 3 community at large mostly because so much of what we do is you know we're hot as I say um and we want to share that with everyone because all of us kind of are in this together that you know on my ends the one other thing I really like talking about is the fact that like a lot of people ask me oh how do I get involved in web3 and for me a little bit bragging why not but also a little bit kind of sharing how a bunch of experiences have led up to really building a community a lot of folks are kind of web 3 Centric for the sake of being in web3 and I think that that is a little bit of a missed opportunity for so many folks you know my little tweet on the right where it's just like Vibes are Vibes are kind of King because we don't want to look solely at someone's resume someone's experience and say this is who you are so even for a lot of Unchained credentialing the question of you know who are you is is fascinating because and my aunt just Bullet by Bullet I recently finished my MBA at USC that gives me this weird strategy macro how to talk to Suits strategy on you know previous professional lives I've been a coffee geek which is you know worked in retail worked in kind of e-commerce strategy and that's been a lot of soft skills in fact for anyone who wants to work in Dallas that might be the best thing which is like go go work a retail job for a little bit if you haven't I recommend it run your own business deal with people uh deal with people who are cranky and tired and exhausted and like oh I really I can't talk till I've had my coffee because then you will get really good at Dow governance and people wondering why you have don't have a road map and all of that um from there you know a record label operator a business of soft skills really thinking about P L's thinking about how creative can be operationalized and utilized in a way that you haven't thought of before right so oftentimes for so many people who are saying oh if we just do a Twitter space people will come well so what you know if you're an artist and you put out a tick tock or something what does that mean for your sales what does that mean for touring and how can we take that back to Dallas right in addition to that all the crystal shop and fragrance shop with my mom which again if you haven't worked with your folks that's another cool learning experience but also that's in the middle of skid row in downtown and one thing that's fascinating there is just thinking about the socioeconomics of running a business and how on the one hand you might have people who are really into chakras and going to arawan and spending 20 on a juice and on the other hand you have people who are you know unhoused who are saying hey can I get this for free can I take this whatever and you have to balance a lot of that you know I've had a lot of large conversations with even you know Fortune 50 companies where they're like you know we launched the nft and you know you have people who really want to build community but you also have people who are mad at us because the product isn't pumping and you know there isn't really A playbook for that other than going out and and being in the world and I guess the last thing is like I will plug my Twitter where it's I'm at Rayhan underscore and this is actually kind of a huge one for anyone who is on this call obviously you spend time on crypto Twitter but you also might be in a 100 to 200 discords or something and it's really fascinating to think about Discord as kind of the coordination model for Dao's and how oftentimes that isn't where the real work happens a lot of it is still you know as decentralized as we want to be it's still one-to-one and seeing you know where are the coordinated kind of group think conversations happening but then outside of that where are kind of your external flyaways for thinking that who are the quiet folks who may not want to necessarily put themselves out there and then how do you tease that out of them oftentimes we see a lot of projects even at FWB we have new member hangs I've seen people like rainbow do office hours EMS shout out to Alicia doing office hours for people who may have questions and are kind of too afraid to ask and again powerful soft skills super power there in terms of coordination and really building and getting Outsiders into your system you know and that kind of leads into kind of the Crux of something I've been thinking about for a while lately which is it feels that a lot of dows do not think about Community Management as internal versus external processes and this is really what I want to stress on here today that what does it mean for internal Community Management to empower folks to go from being tourists in your down to being elected officials right and how does that contrast with external that when we really want to define the idea of kind of tourism in a Dao or in a Discord it's people checking out your Twitter or checking your IG or even reading a pitch deck saying hey so what do you do what's interesting how much of this is is fun in games right whether it's like FWB Fest which was a three-day Extravaganza in in Idlewild outside of La we had you know James Blake waste blood jpeg Mafia it was huge all funded and paid for by the Dow all attended by Dow members or even small things like a weekly coffee time chat or wallet safety courses Etc it's that's the internal pulse that how do we make sure that people are kind of understood heard and that their action their their wishes are actioned upon in a way that's directional for the doubt so if you go back again real quick I'm sorry a little all over the place that to the idea of FW being a cultural membership you got to think about the membership test right and some of that is always going to be a very kind of functional bureaucratic role right if you lose your library card YMCA card you don't want to go to someone who is necessarily how do you say um financialized to help you all the time right they might just be a bureaucrat right they're just someone who's like this is my job my job is to make sure you jerk right so that is that first touch point of getting someone into the community making sure that their credentials and everything are taken care of and that from there they are best served in how to make the best use of your doubt because every Dao is going to have a variety of different touch points of participation you know everyone can attend not everyone wants a princess in pain even for Fest we saw them say in Cleveland a lot of folks who joyfully and excitedly bought tickets were like this is the best experience I've had I never want to touch snapshot I never want to vote you know I trust you guys and that's super special and super interesting for us and for I think a lot of jobs moving forward as well that you're going to see a lot of bifurcation between what the core team does what the core team acts on and then what the wider Community wants to work on and I think a lot of that is that second bullet point of really building those rails for participation in the next slide I will show you guys kind of the overview a little older but an older overview of how our Dow is organized but the one thing I want to highlight here is that you're always going to have rails for participation whether that is someone understanding that work in a dow could just be hanging out in Discord hanging out on Twitter spreading the good word creating memes posting whatever or it could be you know folks like Emma Emerson Kirk and our Dao who is really thinking about governance structures what does it mean for us to have soft votes versus hard votes on chain on Snapshot what does it mean for us to create new snapshot strategies what does it mean for us to build out kind of Dow treasury management whether that's you know Aja consensus or a few other folks and saying you know what does it mean for us to thrive not just season to season but year to year and Beyond how much of this is our mandate and all of that that I just said contrast so heavily with this idea of external Community Management where you might be having folks whose sole mandate is like I want to spend time in Discord I want to see how it changes message to message I want to see how it changes day to day hour to hour and then I want to float outside of that I want to spend time on Twitter or Reddit or you know in The Wider art World Etc because again all of those experiences are so fundamentally valid for the way a dow can and should work and one way that we've seen that kind of manifest itself is really checking the community pulse for kind of key issues with snapshot we have a team member Drew Kaufman who's kind of our our nft general shout out to Drew and he spent so much time trolling Twitter other discords other projects and seeing what the best practices are what the best questions are and where kind of there are points of friction for potential governance processes as you know before we commit something to Snapchat so for every process that we have or every snapshot vote that we have we have about a two-week kind of pre -vote system where people chat out ideas discuss Pros discuss cons and really get stuff going in a way that feels healthy for them and only when it is good to go and approved by a governance committee do we have a third party who's saying okay we've reviewed this this is agreed upon by the community now it goes up to vote and even post vote right it's is this a token Wade vote is this something where Wales can come in change the outcome or is it somewhere you know it's one person one vote very strict about it and that's so interesting to kind of think about which votes are your soft votes which votes are your medium votes which votes are like changing the future of the Dow and then that gets into kind of our structure right so I've mentioned all of the Hat the whys now this is kind of the how of it that structurally speaking I would say FWE is kind of riding the line between traditional Corporation and this new format of a doubt that we have editorial protocol actually I'll go clockwise we have product we have editorial we have marketing and comms Partnerships events cities and membership and then at the core we have Ops and all of the kind of external facing you know the outside rim of the circle if you will are the ones that are dealing with the wider web 3 world and figuring out how do we best kind of interface whether it is building products for ourselves like our gatekeeper ticketing app member directory for our members how do we build out editorial which is kind of highlighting the best of web3 and how that interfaces with kind of non-crypto worlds whether that is in government in Food Service in you know politics in the Fine Art world or even highlighting nft projects from established artists marketing comms is like a very valuable one where again you have folks who Focus solely on internal marketing and comps and you have people who are looking at the wider outside world of how to look on socials how to look when we get press you know what is our goal for this you know similar to a previous speaker I think a lot of our goal is not kind of growth at all costs we're not a hyper growth kind of concern we really want to think that for each project each minute how we uplifting community members and then how are those community members having the permission to uplift FWB as adult it's really a two-way street that doesn't just start with someone holding a token it really starts with someone saying I see you I hear you I get what you're about and this is how I want to help you know one great example actually is with joy Howard who runs a company called early majority and joy actually came to our marketing and comms team said hey I have a clothing company called early majority I would love to do a badge like on clothing or FWB and do it around the time of FWB Fest how can we best kind of promote this both as an nft on the digital side how can you promote it as a story for Works in progress and then how can we offer this to The Wider community and kind of show early majority as a leader in the space as a creator of best practices for kind of the interface of web3 and traditional kind of clothing and go from there you know that also touches into the next category of Partnerships where Partnerships almost I would say 100 of the time come from within our community these are folks who are again interested in helping us and also you know helping themselves right you know the idea of this is my phone Squad wealth doesn't just come from nowhere that that we understand that people are in this to enrich themselves and enrich like The Wider Community but that folks are stronger together so oftentimes Partnerships can come in a variety of different ways the web two way of thinking of Partnerships is like how can we extract money out of folks you know how can we make sure that we get in-kind support or like a fat check and for us it's been really inspiring to think about it the other way around which is oh how can these Partners best help us and sometimes it's true like if you're emerging now if you're just starting out you're wondering all right what does it mean for us to look at Runway what does it mean for us to look at a burn rate and how can we help kind of how can external Partners help us ameliorate that and that may not always be the case I've always learned sometimes the hard way that slower is better in a lot of different ways and kind of finding the story and the communications between the Partnerships and the marketing and is the hard stuff how do we sell this again internally and then how do we make this hit externally that if you go and check out all I wish I put this in the slides that our partnership with taika where taika is a beverage company based in San Francisco and they were like we want to work with the Dow and basically have all you know 1000 plus of you help us make a beverage together and we decided on like a sparkly mate we help them build out the site built out the smart contract infrastructure and do so in a way that was honoring their product and honoring a product's values towards the community that there's so much of thinking about that back and forth beyond that you know events and cities are probably the closest thing that most people are familiar with with Dallas where if you have like a youth Global conference shout out to eat Global that how do we best get involved if you're doing something at the city's level how can we apply for either a light key which is just the FW branding in name or how can we apply for an event key which is something more tangible you get funding from the Dow to like book a venue or spend it as you will you submit a p l to us and we say all right this worked this is great you can keep it going or hey this is room for improvement we're going to bump you down to a like right and all of that actually feeds into the last one which is membership right that membership is such a core kind of kpi for lack of a better term for Adele like ours where we kind of live and die by the fact that like we want amazing people joining us we want to make sure that you excuse me that folks who are joining us by purchasing the token are treated well but also that we're able to kind of go into the the flock of War if you will and find the people doing the craziest most interesting stuff in web3 and get them involved with you know fellowships uh grants you know we did a garage grants program recently where we had I think two or three hundred folks apply and it was everything from mango tastings in Miami to creating uh digital event streaming platform that was token gated for artists in Southeast Asia and that was kind of like an aha very beautiful moment where all of a sudden we're really putting the decentralized endow that for something that is so kind of eurocentric us-centric we all of a sudden saw a ton of influence and energy from folks who are like I'm not awake when you guys are how do we get best get involved and that was really a combination of membership working with events and cities to make sure this was hitting as well as it did and you know all of that kind of is the periphery and then Ops is kind of thinking about the long term this is the working of other Dows working with other events uh working with other strategists and seeing like all right what do we think this looks like in a season what do we think this looks like in a year Etc and how can we kind of address blockers or issues and the Ops rules are all kind of truth be told a little more bureaucratic they are a little more um you know buttoned up by the numbers and thinking about the harder more tangible goals of a doubt and all of that kind of is a back and forth that I think a lot of folks don't discuss which is how much of this is internal facing how much of the external facing how much is sales how much of this like marketing to your people and marketing to others I think for us and FWB I always kind of am the anti-marketer where I joke that like we're the anti-crypto crypto Club we're the folks who are like we don't really care about crypto we think about it mostly as a tool and by treating it as a vessel we've allowed folks creativity and their own kind of energy to shine through in a very beautiful way um I think that is actually what I have so far card sake I mean is it can we open this up actually there's a little more but you know just real quick I want to end it here that like our community is everywhere from kind of you know High big Tech folks like EV Williams from Twitter all the way to Jeff Carvalho at Heist Nevada if anyone's a sneaker a person you know who Jeff is to you know DJs like Richie hodden who basically invented techno to folks like Eric who again that awesome designer I mentioned earlier and across the board one thing that I've been thinking about as I look at this list of members is how do we kind of create the best interfaces for these folks to to have vessels for their creativity and that have that kind of feedback into FWB as adult so when we do an event in New York or something around Art Basel in Miami that who can we tap into and who's raising their hands but then also who do we kind of want to pick and choose from so with for example FWB Fest we were able to have talks with Ezra Miller and Eric who and artists like Khalif Mall back to back we had Milton demirs who's talking about Colts and web3 which is such a great phrasing uh that is past the weeds of being in a smart contract it's really allowing folks to kind of stretch out their minds and think of like what's next where do we go from here and you know thankfully it was a success and we're going to do more of it moving forward you know and that is what I got so far that was uh it was absolutely incredible um I I personally learned so much that uh I kind of want to rewind this after this uh this whole thing ends and just kind of go through that again um I so I think there's like a my kind of a sense of this is that there's a lot of super interesting things that you brought up and uh so much of that is directly visible as you can look at how that WB works as a community and kind of how powerful you are in kind of executing the next next kind of uh anywhere from events two seasons to just uh what you kind of broadcast on even on products um my kind of reverse question to you would be how do you make this more prescriptive to others so they can shamelessly steal and also improve what they're doing and uh and then how do we how do we do that and how do we make that a lot more easy to you know replicate and what would your advice be there for uh for those communities heck yeah of course I think um one thing right off the bat that I love is I always tell people to build selfishly like build for yourselves build for your doubt think about it almost like a brand or actually not a brand like a band almost like you're jamming with your friends and you're building that you're building for needs that you have so even gatekeeper Works in progress or any of our kind of cities or events or stuff that we did for ourselves initially we really didn't have uh how do you say a mandate to like oh you have to do this well you also were the first ones to figure it out so uh you kind of had a different premise too because remember FWB as a community has been up for a few years and there there weren't anybody to to copy from yeah absolutely you know and I think it's really fun and interesting for us because you know my I highlighted my background and the same thing for all the folks I work with that all of us came from very disparate backgrounds I think maybe it took us five or six months to get the first person who's like a hardcore solidity nerd in FWB right they were like and they came in because they were interested in music and art and all this other stuff right so I think lesson one that's huge is like built selfishly and see where you can build together that so much of our work even for stuff like gatekeeper we go back and forth with the folks from token proof we go back and forth with you know so many other folks who are building kind of on-chain identity Solutions we want to think which of this is applicable for us which is applicable at The Wider level and as we kind of grow and scale how much of this can be open source for the greater good right um and again I think some of that's going to be that external Community Management role Karthik where you're just out there outside and seeing what other people are doing outside your bubble right and how you can best rope people in because other than that like you're gonna have uh 20 to 25 people who DM me every week are like yo we're building Dell tooling and it's like uh that's cool but like to what end right that how can you build dial tooling if you're not in a dow how can you think that okay I'm building I don't know web3 Salesforce right if if you haven't really seen how you know 10 or 15 dollars work you know and that's something that's always super fun where whether I'm talking like Jess from seed club or Marty a pool Suite you name it right but we have so many kind of shared goals in building it out so I think that's kind of the huge actionable thing which is a just because something's done already doesn't mean you can't do it better but B just because it's done doesn't mean like or just because you don't see it doesn't mean it hasn't been done yet so like do a little bit of research and kind of dig and put your own spin on it no that's that's great advice and maybe uh one um so the same question but from a different lens which is uh General kind of thinking around how should they structure decision making and kind of actually on the leadership side how do we actually make that scalable or not even just scalable effective in decision making I could think about that totally so you know uh Masters in public policy which is kind of geeky um and I think about that a lot like what does it mean for someone again that I mentioned this on on the talk that what does it mean for someone to go from a tourist to a citizen to elect an official to like the upper echelons of that right and hey citizens make decisions too you don't have to be an elected official to do that the way that the roads in a dow work are equally as valuable for you as someone who's in that core team and I think this is actually the message I always get to core team members which is I really behoove them all of us who are in that kind of upper echelon to think about how do I decentralize and how do I make sure that I'm really going with the will of the populace not necessarily thinking about like the bubble and fight for your ideas right if you're really like oh no and this has this snapshot has to work this way get out there have a town hall be in conversation with folks and encourage your haters to to be very vocal and loud and deal with it right this is kind of the thing that differentiates Dallas from C corpse and traditional corpse anyways right that you have to be able to roll with a company that has the energy of like an old school message board yeah and and sometimes uh there are good critics right like so uh you get to actually have a voice yeah 100 that's so special right that we you know and I think the way we kind of operationalize that to answer your question is some of these are soft votes on even Twitter or Discord right like a yes or no we have to put this Emoji some of them are going to be a little harder again we have a whole governance Forum in this court where people argue about stuff and like really bring their best selves to it in good faith and then we have that final snapshot which is bam is on chain we see what you did and then for us as we move forward that's going to codify on member directory as well amazing uh well thank you so much for uh for this amazing talk and uh as a request from uh from us if you can share the slides with us we'll make them now public but uh they'll be appreciated and uh thanks again this was great for sure thank you so much I'll clean them up and then we'll take it from there
