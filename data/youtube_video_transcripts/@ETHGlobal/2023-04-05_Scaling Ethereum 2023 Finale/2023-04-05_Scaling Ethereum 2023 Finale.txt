foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to CLA theorem finale this is our second time doing this event and we're super excited to talk about all the amazing things that the ecosystem is doing to help scale ethereum and web great all of you are watching this on ecobo.te this is where we're going to be talking about all the things that are happening for the next our uh this will look at all the demos all the prizes all the discussions and as you may have already seen all the Summits that we posted over the course of the last three weeks and for all of everybody who here engages with the audience will also be giving out poapps so uh stay tuned for that and log in and say hi to everybody else in in our community so this event is brought to you by Eve Global and equal is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web free ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits so scaling ethereum 2023 was no different if anything it was way bigger than what we thought we would be doing uh we hosted three incredible summits we talked about everything that's happening in the world of scalability uh with our kickoff Summit on March 10th then on the 24th we talked about all the things that are happening in r d side of Meb and this past Monday five days ago we helped with the summit that led to the launch of the polygon ZK evm with the day two Summit uh with polygon so we saw a lot of improvements announcements and amazing work that's being done in this ecosystem and today we're excited to share a lot more about what happened with the hakuba so let's talk about the hack of them for a second this was a massive event we had 1400 people from 92 different countries participating spanning 24 time zones and our goal is to talk about and highlight some of the amazing things that people worked on anybody on a map to see where all those 92 countries are represented and it still constantly amazes me to see so many people excited about what's happening in ethereum and scaling this world so not only do we have 1400 hackers we also had 107 mentors and 19 Partners who were here with us for the last month and today we're going to be talking about all the stuff that everybody accomplished but also all the prizes that everybody is going to be winning from participating we have over 200 000 in prizes and we'll be talking about which teams won what prizes at the end of all the demos so I want to quickly give a shout out to all of our amazing Partners we have optimism polygon scroll gnosis chain ethereum Foundation black with virtual machine hybrid Lane ape coined out fuel Uma connects pulling base PSE to graph 8th Max era mantle Taiko push protocol uh for supporting this event and to all of you hackers uh please please please click the feedback button on your hacker dashboard we really want to understand how we can make these events better it should shouldn't take you more than 60 seconds to fill out a quick form we just want to know how your experience was and what we can improve and make better for the next events so you can just head over to your hacker dashboards here's a direct link if you are interested in going in directly the second you log in you'll see a giant give us feedback sign that'll really help us improve all future events and get to thousands of more people okay even better so let's talk about all the things that happened at this event we had 1400 hackers and last Sunday was when submissions were two from those 1400 hackers we got 306 incredible submissions we split this time judging into two rounds and after both rounds of judging that that involved asynchronous and live judging from some of our amazing judges from from the space we got to 11 finalist teams what we're going to do today is bring on these 11 teams to show you what they built over the course of the hackathon and use this as an opportunity to highlight some really interesting and amazing projects that got our judges excited and all of us excited from scaling ethereum so in no particular order I want to congratulate our 11 amazing finalists so we have snarky monsters search OS ethercard ZK links CFT decks C captcha uplabe notices Cove polynode and bloomboard these are our 11 amazing teams uh we're gonna bring them on one by one and they're going to show you what they built live and after that we're going to get to all of our prizes before we bring on our very first team I want to take a second to give a massive shout out to these 295 teams here who also spent three amazing weeks building something incredible and building something that they themselves are proud of just because we were not one of the 11 teams does not mean he were not good enough or there was something wrong our goal is just highlight some amazing themes that get the rest of our ecosystem and judges and partners in the space excited and to all of you who are here I really encourage all of you to continue working on these projects ensure that you get a chance to complete everything you wanted to do sometimes everybody uh what they work on is not enough time that's built in to finish everything from a feature standpoint so we really hope that you take the time after this event and after today to still continue pushing code making everything work as expected and taking it to the next step if you need any feedback you can reach out to us on Discord or email if you are looking to continue any conversations with some of our main judges you can reach out to us and we'll connect you with some of those judges themselves or if you are looking to get in touch with anybody in this space whether it's uh some of our partners or mentors or judges again or or even some investors we're happy to help you with all those things we really hope that this event serves an opportunity for you to get excited about what could be coming in the next 6 to 12 months from all the amazing work and sdks and research that's happening and becoming more productized and we really hope that uh we use as an opportunity to see why he should be in the space forward and even more and longer so congratulations to everybody who submitted a project and really hope to see some of you do way way more amazing things right after this event but for now let's get to uh our final list so everybody who submitted a project you can now check out all the submissions Upon Our showcase page if you set over to eat global.com showcase and you'll be able to see all the projects that came out of this event and that includes all of our finalists that are going to come here and also all the other 200 close to 300 projects but enough talking for me let's go on to some amazing demos so we're going to bring on our very first finalist for today and that is team snarky monsters so without further Ado let's keep a big round of applause for our first demo and our first team so as welcome hey everyone my name is baz this is my teammate Goblin oats uh it's a real pleasure to be here for the East Global hackathon it's we've had a really great time so thank you Carlton for all of that we're super excited to present snarky monsters it is a fully Unchained Pokemon Style video game powered by zero knowledge proofs and we built it from scratch over the source of this hackathon and you can see a little preview of what it looks like here but before we get into some fun gameplay let's just talk a little bit about why we did this so we love fully on chain games we love opcraft we love Dark Forest we think what's being done here is a lot more ambitious than just representing game assets on chainer's nfts and the reason this is so exciting is because you're taking as much of the game stay in logic as possible and you're representing it in atrocious way and letting devs and players interact with it trustlessly now I used to be a PM at fortnite so I've seen firsthand just how much platform risk there is in the gaming industry and the idea here is really radical it's like take Roblox what if what if you didn't have to interact with the centralized server to provision access to Roblox we think that this would lead to emergent open Innovation reminiscent of the best days of defy summer and also reminiscent of the best days of this industry as greatest open source achievements the second thing that's really cool uh is that we're trying to get you know the next billion into web 3 am I focusing more on play and maybe less on profiteering we can make web3 really fun and we can we can bring more people together this is a scaling ethereum hackathon so let's talk about scaling squeezing a game onto a blockchain is a bit of a nightmare and the basic reason is that a blockchain kind of looks like this but we want to get to that the answer to scaling that we all know is that you execute code off chain on a centralized fast way and then you create zero noise proofs to attest to that computation on chain in a trustless way this works really well so far but it's not so simple for gaming essentially what you're doing here is you're squeezing your computation into these nice structures arithmetic circuits but squeezing a video game into the structure of an arithmetic circuit is really hard it works for games that have like an obvious mathematical structure like Sudoku but we don't want to do Sudoku we want to do something really really ambitious that's got you know low latency and it's really fun to play so Goblin and I sat together and we thought what is the most complex fun uh interesting game that we could possibly squeeze into the circuits and we bet that we could do Pokemon uh and here is how we did so here you can see snarky monsters you can you can get straight into the game and you can start playing uh I can't wait for you to to see this now bear in mind we are demoing something which is uh gonna be a little bit chaotic because it is a game with unpredictable outcomes but as you can see you can choose the different characters you've got to play as from Normie to AGI to bench capitalist so hey it's definitely like being a bench capitalist rather than say a d gen and you can see immediately my character spawns into the forest and we can see immediately I encounter a cryptographer a moonmaster to do some battle and we can start we can start exchanging moves and I really want you to notice uh the speed of this um this is this is responsive across mobile and desktop uh each move has a chance of a critical hit has a chance of missing and you can see that each character has their own unique moves here the venture capitalist uh can use take 10 the moon math has just used plonk um and one of the key gameplay mechanics here is that you can also retrain as a different character so let's say I want to become a Bitcoin Maxi to fight this Moon mapper the key gameplay mechanic is similar to Pokemon it's discovering what what those types are but super effective sometimes as you can see just there the VC didn't successfully retrain I'm kind of getting pwned by this Moon method right here but you can see if I try and retrain again maybe this time as a normal me I might succeed uh let's see how we do uh some of these moves will be super effective against others so it might be the normies moves are super against effective against the moonmaster and the same with the fire type is super effective against Grass Type in Pokemon and part of the core gameplay Loop here is discovering all those like hidden information mechanics um I can see you can see I've got new new moves here so as a normally I can go for a boozy brunch or go for a soul cycle but let's skip ahead to see what happens when you win the game so here uh when you when you defeated your enemy let's say I'm playing as a normie you'll be able to submit approved win which will um submit a transaction to uh oh hello we seem to having some slight AV issues uh could be because the way metamask is opening but you'll sign a transaction which posts that game hash uh on chain and then you'll be able to see yourself in the leaderboard and you'll be able to see all your performance being registered from the chain uh and you can see what this looks like a little bit like under the hood the game hash what gets places on chain over here um in terms of how it actually works what we've done is we have a state Channel between player and NPC doing cryptographic commitment so therefore Randomness uh the player at the end of the game puts the hash of the game scroll up on it and used circums right circuits and ec2 incidents with 14 CPUs and 32 gigs of RAM to generate and post proof to the scroll alphanet which in turn posts the leaderboard back to the player so nice things about this is that the fake panel is really fast as you saw the NPC has hidden move logic which is really key for fun gameplay and also if you think about this more philosophically uh you've got proprietary code interacting costlessly so next steps are to let anyone run a battle server uh encode the moves of the game all of this is possible in theory and just to know that group generating time scales are the maximum number of turns per game really can't wait for you to play it follow us for updates John our Discord have a chat with on Twitter uh can't wait for you to get involved thanks very much thank you I think thank you so much for uh the very first setup that thing went wrong uh it is a really fun game and uh can't wait for all this trends that too uh congratulations thank you well that was our very first demo let's go on to our second finalist demo for today and that is Chris from CK links Chris whenever you're ready all right well hey everybody uh my name is Chris and for the scaling ethereum hackathon I put together an app called ZK links now a lot of you might be familiar with apps like bit.ly or other referral or affiliate marketing related platforms let you generate trackable links now the problem with this is that you have to share your email address you have to share all your personal information just use the platform you're also often locked into platform fees where you're paying a monthly charge regardless of actually how much you're using the product we're generating links so I wanted to leverage some of the functionality with L2 Networks as well as uh some zero knowledge components to create a platform that anybody could use by simply connecting their wallet and generating links uh using the ZK links app now the way this app works is you simply connect your wallet and you're ready to go uh right now ZK links is deployed and available on the test net for these different L2 zkevm compatible networks so you could use gnosis you could use Mumbai or polygon or scroll Alpha but the real benefit is to be able to use a multi-chain or whatever chain you want to be able to or whatever's pertinent to be able to track these links and how they're performing for the demo I'm going to walk through scroll Alpha when you connect your wallet you get taken to this form where you can create your ZK link now the way this works is you could have like a referral marketing campaign or let's say you're running an airdrop for the crypto folks here and you wanted to be able to track performance of The Links not where they're clicks and they end up as just like rows in someone's database that you don't own but instead they end up as transactions on Smart contracts that are public and available for everyone to see so if you look here I have some demo data and there's a link Title Here that pre-fills a redirect URL could be anything you want Additionally you could put a reward so if you wanted to to give like a referral bonus or some uh deposit to the address for using your link and interacting with it you could add that too but I'm just going to create the link contract what happens behind the scenes is every link that you create on this product creates its own smart contract and has its own chain of history that could emit events you could um you know hook it up to the graph uh you could have it be stored in a back end and I'll show you uh through like polybase and I'll show you how that works in a minute uh as this transaction is finalizing uh you get two links in particular you get the created contract and this is on scroll for the example and you can see that the link has been created and you get this shareable URL I do want to mention uh that I'm making a little bit of a transition here between myself that deployed the contract and a arbitrary consumer that could come to your app so I'm going to switch over to this other address and interact with this contract as if I was someone that was using this almost as a middleware to get to the to the deposit so I click the continue to page confirm the transaction and uh this page could be polished up in the future but essentially the user is now able to redirect and credit the referrer as driving a referral to this airdrop page or whatever sort of referral you want to drive uh or thing you want to track coming back to the contract you can see now rather than a row in a database we have a transaction that's appended in the open domain for everyone to see and use and and potentially tie rewards to as users are coming through the ZK link if if you paste the address of the contract you get a lighter weight version of reporting that you can see the performance of your links over time so actually this happened uh you know under a minute ago EST you can see that the this address interacted with my link and I have one here on March 31st uh slow start but uh we'll see how it tracks over time and you also have referral links that get generated as well referrals through um uh push push protocol that you can see that are attached to your account on the blockchain there's no back-end I'm using fully push protocol to track this and polybase on the back end to attach all the links to my address that you connect with all the codes on my GitHub I have a couple links you could try here and interact with but that's pretty much it and thanks for your time amazing thanks Chris another cool application of preserving some information and still letting people interact on chain um we're going to see a lot of things here for what we're going to do with the analyze proofs for the stock about so uh don't just get uh settled in here thank you and with that we are ready for our third finalist demo for today and I'll let you now bring on Project upclave welcome I nice to be in any Global like it's on an app final again and nice to see you I'm starting my presentation I we are uplifting from it blockchain in Istanbul I am Lush from upplay team and I will be presenting up play our project for the scaling hackathon in the second one we have wheels on account abstraction improvements on top of all autistic by custom clear compiles which enables Apple secure Enclave signatures in optimism roll-ups this Improvement means our accounts will be able to send transactions using face and touch ID without having seed phrase or private case and or mobile devices reaching Hardware robot security let's talk about how this story came up we believe that we can reach next billions by improving the wallet experiences by rebuilding everyday devices as blockchain wallets with awesome account abstraction features like wallet Guardians sending batch transactions paying fees with prc20 tokens and sending Fearless transactions so it means we don't need seed phrases as default which is these are new adapters and we can stay safe with our mobile devices it's better to show everything in action so it's the demo time I'm sharing my mobile phone screen I was using my mobile phone so I think you you can see me in the mobile app and I'm switching to or demo which is all play mobile app and mobiles I mean you know chasing my Mobile account and it's preparing the account details and then it will deploy the accounts contract to the optimism URL it has that and it will verify my face ID when it's ready ready for the demo purposes we are deploying users accounts and also sending some it's an OP tokens for from our closet in demo it's verified my face ID and now we can see we have some Ethan or P tokens we will demoing sending some bits and op tokens in our sun model we have an address in my clipboards and I'm choosing sending its or op tokens I will send one into field board all P tokens and also I can choose paint these with pizza or B tokens again when we prepare the transactions I am Sunny which checks my base ID and sending the transactions the bundler of ERC 4G 37 that's my transaction and now we can see our transaction in the eater stand in normal conditions we have custom op stick roll up which we enabled the pre-compiles can verify the signatures of Apple devices but this demo purpose to see the transactions in the user stem we switch to the gallery test that I'm turning back to our mobile app and you can see that my op tokens are decreased them we can use our mobile devices as Hardware wallets and send transactions verifying by or face ID and stopping my demo and let's go presentation after this hackathon we will be dreaming new account abstraction features and exploring new blockchain existence to create the best account abstraction wallet and hopefully we will ship or play as a product please say hi to my teammate storm tire delara and Hamza who bring this amazing product to real and please reach us in Twitter and or play that we are open for any Partnerships and collaboration to bring all player to life and start listening it against my projects correctly our projects we need double second one amazing thanks a lot uh this was great and uh we saw all the the amazing attention and feedback he got on Twitter already from this announcement this is really cool way to Leverage because everything we have already on devices and not can't wait to see what you do with this congrats thank you very much all right next up is Polly note without further Ado let's welcome the polynomial team welcome hello everyone uh we are excited to be in uh it's uh scaling hackathon final and I will be presenting the application poly note that we built in polybase for taking decentralized notes and uh we brought some exciting protocols together to build the centralized note-taking application on power base and now you can securely take your notes we have a very ux friendly user authentication where user doesn't need to sign a message every time to do an action everything is done through a gbt tokens and this is a one-time process your notes are encrypted in polar base Collections and uh no other user can read your notes here you can safely take notes and pulling out for the future plans we already started chat GPT implementation and we already have some improvements but it needs to be improved after the hackathon so we also want to enable the Live code editing of the nodes and some Security checks should be done for the future uh I will be live demoing in the polynote.ethlockchain.com so we have a very exciting Atlantic page where we show the project details and the main features we also share the tech stack and the team from Istanbul Technical University uh blockchain student club we also have a dark team for the landing page but I will go with the live team right now for the registration I will use metamask and create a new account to show you the whole registration process for the first time I have to sign two messages one for uh registering by account and one for signing in and this is just an onboarding process and this is one time process so you don't have to sign anything to log in yourself to the account if you don't log out when I come to my dashboard I can see my account details I can edit my uh name if I want and change the team if I want but now I will use the lighting for this account then I will be sharing another account for other features too and I can start uh creating my notes with my favorite emoji and the title when the node is created I can start adding text decorations with the headlines that I want I can add loadless or just texts I can modify the packs as all it like and other options I will talk about pulmonary eyes soon I can also upload image to um the web 3 storage which is supported by filecoin virtual machine and we can also as you can see upload images directly and these images are stored based on the centralized protocols I will also show you the notifications feature where other users can share and also with you so uh first I have to opt in to the notifications to receive them and this is because of the push SDK and this is how it works I'm copying the address of this account and moving to the moving to the other accounts with the exciting note that I created before and uh I can start sharing the note with this account let's clear the white list and add only this user and I'm sending a transaction and this is done through the smart contract and smart contract is deployed to the scroll Alpha test net let's wait for the transaction to be confirmed before uh moving to the other account and seeing the note I'm waiting for a transaction and as you can see they're not shared successfully when I go back to my other account I have to see the notification that pops out over here as you can see the my previous account share the note with me I'm verifying my identity and seeing the shared node over here finally I will show you some features from the polynode AI that we recently implemented after the submission we have some several features with a as you can see you can summarize text fix grammar issues make the text longer for example let's try uh summarizing this section it says the request to open Ai and gets a summary about the text I can copy this if I want or just for example let's start another feature Let's uh let's summarize this part uh the team members and we can directly apply this instead of the selected text and this is a polynaut we are excited to be the finalist and we are excited to continue this project for the next months thank you for listening it's amazing well congratulations to all of you as a lot of consistent talent that we see from itu student group so can't wait to uh come back and add to meet Global Istanbul this year as well well that was our fourth demo for today let's go on to number five so without further Ado let's bring on search OS Olympics hello enemies from Team search OS and for this hackathon we decided to build an urgently needed tool that we believe Embraces the scaling ethereum philosophy namely the user experience let us explain the core problem almost every day there's a new website an app or a tool for every conceivable problem we're facing within the blockchain space and while it is a progressive development it also means you must navigate multiple hard to understand menus and complex interfaces just to get on with your daily web 3 business fragmented approach makes it difficult for new users to navigate to web3 space creating a high entry threshold and that's why we built search OS search OS is an AI powered web3 search engine that makes interacting with your favorite blockchain applications easy it aims to gather the different elements of the web 3 ecosystem into one place and is searchable with one single query let's take a look so this is search OS it's essentially a search bar and but this is also where the magic lies let's say we want to query the Wallet balance we would simply type wallet handmade search and then you get a Wallet balance you could also type A NS link so we could type Niche dot eat we query that and we get his wallet balance we also made a small integration towards the lens protocol so typing something like standard of lens we can see his lens profile on Leinster followers followings posts and so on and this kind of concludes our keyword based searches it's not very difficult we basically take the keyword and then we map it to our integration so let's head over to our AI power searches so using the same search bar you could type something like this link expensive and then we make a query we wait for a bit for it to fetch and you can see the token price for today you can also type something like is gas high right now on ethereum and make that query and in one second we should get back the gas price we've also made a integration using the keywords so you could use that as well we're not only able to fetch information but we can also execute action-based queries directly here on the platform so you could write something like send tell UTC to retali the E and you can make that query and waiting a bit yes we would get back this form pre-filled in with his wallet address token amount and so on and if I did have 10 usdc I could transfer it to him right here on this platform and same thing with swap swap and usdc to try and if we also make this query we will get back this swap widget it should be pretty familiar to most web3 natives you have the from to how much you pay and how much you get back and yeah and behind the scenes we have wrapped chat GPT basically we have instructed it to use our tools and then introduces which tool to use depending on the query it then formats and inputs add the query into our integration and this is what you get so for this hackathon we believe that we have only scratched the surface of the possible powerful search capabilities of search OS and for every integration and every new feature embedded into your platform we can instruct our platform to give us yet more sophisticated Solutions looking at the future we believe that search OS has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with web3 by abstracting away all the core functionalities we can and just have leaving a simple query based framework we can create a more interconnected web3 ecosystem looking at the roadmap our next steps would include better U.S support from mobile improving the AI model and last but not least developing an extension an SDK of our application and the ambition here would be to finally have an intuitive all-in-one encapsulated way of navigating web3 finally if you want to test our application we are live on searchos.xyz and with that said thanks for listening and yeah I hope to hear from you soon amazing congratulations and I'm great to see that this project is live and available for anybody on the website or just watching this to try it out so head over to search OS XYZ and give it a shot thank you so much all right with that we are and our halfway mark we got six more projects to go and up next is Jordan from cftdex and Flash trillions whenever you're ready thank you Karthik I'm ready foreign T cfd decks I built a new technology of lending similar to flash loans but more powerful so why do we need this we needed an emergency Liquidations in situations where it's not even possible to lack to borrow any money using a flash law when it's not even available so what is Flash collateral we allow the user to borrow any amount of money yes trillions of money that doesn't even exist so how does this work this works by shadowing the entire protocol to funny money and then when the flash collateral liquidations are done we commit the changes to the actual protocol so I implemented the cfd decks but what is a cfd cfd you're trading euro dollar you're not touching Euro or a dollar you're just betting on price difference so let's see how this works I implemented this on multiple blockchains but I'll try it on ZK VM here for the demo I connect with metamask I'm logged in I select a pair I deployed only one pair and this user I already deposit hundred thousand dollars worth of collateral and I'm gonna take this bid which is gonna take me into a short position I confirm and I wait for confirmation so I'm gonna use small collateral to get a 10 times a larger short position let's see this we're waiting for there it is and uh uh and now uh now my coding uh now I have a holding of uh of this amount of uh uh uh this um you you want sorry so uh for some reason my holding that is is not there but I'm gonna take another position let's see and uh and so okay I can't take two Holdings I have obviously my first position uh was in the queue while I I tried a second but here I'm gonna go and mock the price and I have it prepared utility that marks the price and uh I'm gonna copy it from my cheat sheet um here is a utility that marks the price and uh I'm gonna Mark the price to uh 0.16 uh dollar per Yuan this transaction went through and I'm in the red my position can be liquidated so let's find someone with money this is going to be account number two yes and account number two has enough collateral and they can liquidate my position we wait for the transaction to go through and they're gonna assume my position yes they now assume my position and their collateral Jump by 925 dollars actually they made money by liquidating my position but this is only the front end and here's the juicy part flesh collaterals Alice has a position for euro dollar at 1.1 the price change she's in the red Bob is offering to take that position at even worse price and the Liquidator Larry comes in to take both take a small loss but make up for the loss with the liquidation penalty this is only possible if you borrow immense amount of money yes one trillion and he's gonna end up making 560 dollars at the end so let's try this for this I have a a local Fork of agnosis blockchain because it would take too long to to do 10 15 transactions and I'm gonna just run my tests rest is running with my class pass which shows it's working yes all tests pass and this guy made this much money 560 dollars from from this uh flash collateral transaction well how does this work it's so simple the liquidation itself is is I'm sorry this is the test and the liquidation call is only a few lines of code in the actual contract for liquidation is very simple it's less than 40 lines of code so that's it and I just want to tell what I want to do next build dexes for options Futures interest swaps and Syndicate all of them using the same flash collateral technology thank you for listening to my presentation was amazing uh sometimes a lot of demos can be tricky but you pulled through and in this uh this probably worked out and uh I was impatient to not wait for my transaction well it it was still a great demo and we understood exactly what was going to happen so congratulations and hope to see this uh in the wild thank you amazing all right next up is gnosis we're going to see a lot of cool things about our counter traction whenever you're ready hello everyone uh we are gnosis we are a smart contract wallet provider based on eip4337 uh focused on purchase onboarding products billion web 3 users I'm Brian I'm a software engineer based on the Bay Area I'm Ben a new grad from Berkeley I'm Phil a software engineer from Los Angeles and I'm Philip a smart contract developer from Miami so what are we uh we are working to be one of the first end-to-end providers of the ERC 4337 account extraction standard uh we want to provide a familiar experience for web 3 user interfaces to both web3 and web2 users alike the problem we're trying to solve uh the web 3 onboarding experience is confusing for new customers um easy to use wallet providers can often raise significant consumer facing security vulnerabilities such as private keylings or misuse of consumer funds interacting with web3 sites and buying crypto can make it difficult to interact with on-chain apps and on-chain transactions also require high students to process our solution is a one-click user onboarding experience and social logins to emulate the existing web 2 user flows a security focused wallet and infrastructure designed to protect users from Bad actors as well as response plans and functionality to protect our users Assets in the event of a hack we also have pay-as-you-go functionality to provide frictionless payment and dap interaction and then some users will actually never have to buy crypto again and then of course transaction bundling and pay masters which come as a standard of the eip4237 so what is ERC 4337 how does it work I won't go too in depth here I think that this proposal is pretty complicated but it's pretty interesting I think it's going to change how we interact with our ecosystem as a whole so I encourage everyone to read it and really understand what's going on um so most importantly what did we build for hackathon we built a full Custom Custom Suite of smart contracts based on the ERC 4337 infrastructure we also build an onboarding website to allow users users to sign up and configure their wallet and then a wallet extension at the beginning of an SDK and then miscellaneous work to support future chains and ecosystems such as optimism and CK sync uh so now we're going to go into our demo this is our wallet creation front end this is a public website you can visit at novices.io you can go ahead and sign up and we have a a account already set up for this demo we can go ahead and launch a wallet and when we launch a wallet we'll be prompted to do a few things uh we'll want to select our chains here for the sake of the demo we're going to do go really and Mumbai and you also prompted to choose your choice of Key Management either custodial or non-custodial I could choose non-custodial you'll be prompted to add an eoa such as metamask uh you can also configure recovery signers with a name email and address this will allow us to recover your wallet in the event of a lost private key or hack uh and then set up some security features uh so this is for requiring multi-sig for a transaction interacting with a large amount of funds or you can also set up the savings account feature which allows any incoming transactions to automatically withdraw a certain a certain percentage or and save it to a cold wallet or savings account we also have a set of your profile section which is part of our effort of cross-stream identity you can add a bit of information as well as your social profiles so now we're going to go ahead and launch the wolves you can see it does some background calculation both these are addresses are deterministic as nature of erc4337 we're going to go ahead and launch these and then while it's processing we're going to show you some of the extension uh here's the extension uh we're going to request a transfer for 0.01 ethereum uh we'll go ahead and confirm that and it's also going to be pending while this is pending I think we can go back and check on those wallet deployments and so yep they've they're ready both of these are have been deployed to the addresses they're both should be contracts uh their scan sometimes takes a little bit to pick it up um but they both came from a contract Factory and they should have zero balance in them as we use pay masters to deploy them here is a confirmed transaction uh let's see if the transaction slope here yep and you can see that it's a a contract with a set of internal transactions and so now we can go check on the wallet extension uh it has been completed we have sent .01 to the address as well as you can see that the transaction was bundled through a bundler and has multiple sets of transfers and a single transaction and you can see that it came from our account and then went to the account we specified and so yeah that's uh pretty much it um obviously a big thank you to each Global and everyone involved a huge thank you for the team allowing me to put you through uh quite the ringer of the past few weeks um and then of course if you're interested in helping build design or uh have any feedback please reach out uh it is live in our email is up here up here as well um yeah thank you everyone well congratulations and now this is this is awesome uh we're gonna see so much creativity around the construction and with something like this you enable a lot more complex and simple applications to be both on top so I hope uh we get to see this set been using production learning videos too congratulations thank you all right next up we have team Moon board so without further Ado what's working cool hi there cool this is maroon board a social pending platform for infants boards and early creative Market exposure foreign board sites are mostly ad-based Revenue models where creators are subject to the algorithm original work is not high in interest boards and most have to use a multiple of social media sites for exposure like new nft projects having to use engagement farming marketing tactics on popular platforms the result is we don't see new interests or new projects without some embedded ad-based payments incentive so what if we leverage web 3 social tooling and payments and NFC digital provenance to change this payment incentive at scale so the benefits of this is that in it could create a win-win situation where sharing is easy fun and cheap I.E pinning creators can also get an idea of how popular their contents or interests are without too much efforts or burden and mooners who will explain about a little bit later can get in on the economics and get passive income for helping board votes up and socially validate creators were so how it works put simply people paid to pin but only a very small amount so a Pinner pays a pin fee only about 18 cents um in the moon board the moon board's made up of Ruin pins nfts that are showing that beneficiaries of a pin fee there is a payout of that fee of 75 to the creator of the Moon pin and to the mooner who is a curator of the Moon Board gets 25 percent so let's see there's an app phone thank you take it away all right cool yeah thanks Mahal um so I'll jump into the moon board application that we have here um the first thing that users see is the explorables where you can actually see all the mood boards that have been created users can sort them Bible students most votes or they can create them on board so that's the first thing I'll do here I'll create one from some uploaded images um in the future we're going to allow users to actually create moon boards using um existing nfts that bit button or even from existing Moon board so there's some recursion um okay so we'll continue here we can name the moon board and then we can publish recharge users a small fee for create signal board and for each end up it creates so by publishing we upload all the images to mpfs and then we create some nfts soon uh determine the ownership of these items on chain um so now you can see our created Moon board here um but and this is this is fine and good but what really makes moonboard unique and the ability to pin items so I'm going to show that off with a second account that will call the pitter so I'll switch accounts here um so this dinner account has a board called what Google board with no item so that's correctly uh this user can browse around and find some items that they find interesting such as maybe I want zip in this nft um I can go ahead and click the pin button I can select my cool board to finish two and then I can click the pin button um we show the user how much we're going to charge this like my whole set is about 18 cents um in USD right now um and those fees go directly to the Creator who owns this item and the person who created the sport so any 75 to 25 splits um so I'll go ahead and do that and I can see my boards and this item has been pinned um so what this does is it creates a really strong inception for people to items that actually have lots of value that other people would find interesting um in addition to this it creates a source of royalty themes um for the creators who um make these make these original nfts okay uh the last feature that's I'd like to share is booty uh this is one other way that users can show their appreciation for some work um a user can go ahead to a mood board um and actually looks up on certain items um this is all also recorded on chain um I'll pass it back to Mahal now to conclude the conclude the presentation yes so through this um through this voting and calculating most pens a moon board can gain popularity quite easily and quickly and organically so both moonas and creators can be painted up openers plus discover if there's a market for their content early and at scale so yeah this is moonboard where moon boards are created and new contents can be collected shared and pinned you can try it out at noon at Moon dashboard.resal.app thank you everyone thanks awesome well congratulations and uh this looks uh amazing and beautiful it's a great all right oh well thank you so much uh we had four more demos to girls so let's welcome The Ether Parts team next when everybody I asked my first handy back we said that's the warrior third Bell I love you only drinks let's say and conduct music services [Music] so purchase often salted combat is introducing either today he ever offer saying you what blocks about this uses is if the evidence vertices foreign foreign countries do not get access to bank accounts or bank cards ethercart helps to reduce these costs to only one percent and allows Merchants to receive payments faster so picture this you're a small business owner like Jorge and you want to start accepting crypto payments with IFA card your customers can simply at their ether card which is embedded with an NFC chip linked to your crypto wallet to your phone no more confusing payment systems or waiting to confirm the transfer just tap and go now you can accept crypto payments faster so that more time is actually spent on running your business with these users and considerations in mind let's walk through the user's Journey thank you Maggie imagine that you are a customer checking out at Jorge storm the cashier totals your items to a total of 0.01 each the cache inputs this amount Into The Ether card app and presses the request button the user now simply has to tap their ether card onto the NFC Reader as we can see on the right side of the screen ethercart does not store the user's private key instead it stores a compressed zero knowledge proof that proves ownership of the user's spot contract wallet for our Tech stack we built ethercat using react NFC technology ethereum virtual machine accounts abstraction to create the user's debit account and zero knowledge proofs to prove ownership of these accounts for the future we'll enable users to Simply tell their mobile forms with one another to enable payment and also support 100 plus cryptocurrencies in addition to eth let's build the future of fintech together with ethercard awesome well another amazing example of account extraction and also collaborate acting oh this is this is great well congratulations and I hope to uh see ether Crossing handing out to people in the feature thank you all right we got two more demos to go and let's welcome our second last finalist of today Z captcha hey folks we're Team Z captcha and here's what we built for the hackathon my name is Caitlin and I'm responsible for the ZK and more glow verification I also build out the smart contracts and wrote the capture creator and I'm Andrew I designed the ZK approver and the Merkel tree generation as well as well at the back end and the front end so Bots have invaded web3 as you can see from these news clippings scalping Bots are causing problems in nftments sniping Bots are disrupting token launches and civil attacks are damaging airdrops and making web 3 games unplayable additional web 2 methods like cloudflare don't work with web3 because Bots can directly hit the blockchain rendering these Services ineffective to address these challenges we created a solution called z cap check it's a service that safeguards your smart contracts on the blockchain let's go into a quick demo to see how this works Z capture uses zero knowledge proofs to create civil resistant smart contracts these fruits show that you solve the challenges correctly without compromising the security of the system what this means is that no one can front run your capture solution once in sent to the moon pool nor can a malicious user circumvent the challenge altogether and to make this possible we Leverage The Following Technologies as well as use the Noir proving language which is built by AST so developers are those that use z captchas in their gaps and smart contracts to protect them from Bots and uh and it's very easy to incorporate this into their smart contracts all the developers have to do is Define an interface and perpendicular clinch recall they want to protect with the required statement which verifies the validity of the captcha Solution that's sent in transaction now we've also created an offering called civil right and this is an open system that defines reputation score based on the Count's past interactions with Z caption the more captures you solve the higher your score showing evidence of a legitimate user and the more you get incorrect the lower your score indicating other ones you can see my civil rank here now as he catches these more and more the caption verification data will allow other naps and services to have a better understanding of users if you want to integrate Z caption TQ workout we urge you to go to our website see capture.xyz and go to the developer section where you can follow Google Form This Will allows us to share with us what you want to use to capture for and will help us continue iterating and improving our product there's also an at the key section for any questions you might have and also goes into some design considerations now users are those that actually complete the capture challenges so they can interact with smart contracts and apps that are protected by using caption and we can see this in action what we've done is we created an nft collection that takes some of the biggest names in web 3 and took those names and transform them into captions themselves and I can show you how we can make these nfts that are protected by c-catching so we can connect our wallet and let's say we want to we want to Mint the metallic Builder and capture we're presented with a challenge and we have to transcribe the sequence of letters and numbers and run into us in the screen to show that we're not a bot once laser submits the proof the client side will create a zero knowledge proof about its correctness and the smart contract can validate the crackers that disproved and allows the minting function to proceed you can send this transaction and then see that it actually was mentioned successfully sometimes it takes a second for the want to be approved and there we go we can see that we minted our token successfully now the really exciting stuff happened behind the scenes so let's get into that now so the process you just witnessed is depicted in this diagram the end user solves a captcha proving that they're not a bot this process is condensed into a z-k proof which is sent as an additional argument to the smart contract function being called the function passes this to our verifier to obtain the green light to continue to recap we have three components a back-end system responsible for creating the Merkel proofs a client-side approver to create the ZK proofs and finally an on-chain verifier that checks both while the ZK group shows that you solved some challenge correctly the Merkel proofs are necessary to show that you solved the challenge that was given to you looking ahead we're exploring multi-party computation protocols to further decentralize our system we plan to adopt zero knowledge machine learning to do things like cursor tracking similar to what webtoon folks consider state of the art finally we believe that the Civil rank score based on Z captcha could serve the useful wallet abstraction service we've seen this with other high through blockchains and as we strive to scale ethereum cheaper transactions is going to mean more Bots and more spam we believe that zcaptcha is a step in the right direction to prevent this from happening thank you amazing well congratulations and uh this is a another interesting application of being able to put import information on chain and have people leverage just smart contracts directly instead of creating hockey bypasses to get the same effective blow so I hope uh this becomes a bigger open source contribution to the space and people get to use this instead of age captcha congrats all right with that we are ready for our last and final finalist demo of the day so without further Ado let's Welcome Matt from Cove hey everyone uh we're presenting code simple reliable open source contract verification built for an L2 Centric ethereum ecosystem excuse me our team consists of Matt Solomon Ed Mazurek David leprod Gary hyrett and John Ferris we're engineers at scope lift a crypto focused Dev shop building smart contracts and more for the web 3 ecosystem so we built a novel contract verification service and let's start talking about why this is needed right now verification often fails and developers are given no useful feedback as to why you can see this for yourself with the over 200 verification related issues in The Foundry and hard hat repositories additionally each layer 2 Chain has their own block Explorer so you have to manually verify with each verification provider which doesn't scale very well for developers who are deploying on multiple chains and many l2s additionally verified contracts are not linked to git commits or tags so it's hard to verify that the audited code from an auto report is actually what's deployed on chain and it's hard to verify uh the source code verification itself if you don't trust the hosted service or if you just want to be extra sure lastly there's currently a one-to-one mapping of verification providers to uis for viewing and interacting with verified contracts anyone can spin up their own front end to interact with a smart contract like uniswap but it's a lot harder to spin up your own front end to view smart contracts so now I'll take a look at the demo Okay so on the left here we have our very simple front end you can see we're verifying C port this commit hash is version 1.4 of Seaport and we have the contract address here so when we hit verify this sends a request to the server you see all of our inputs up top and first what we're doing is for each chain you can see they're color coded these are all running in parallel we're trying to find the block and transaction where that contract address was deployed on that chain we use that to get the creation code and you can see we found creation code on four different chains once we find the accretion code we then clone the repository and check out the given commit we now have the repository locally and we can tell based on its structure that this is a forged project and there's all these different build commands here in this particular case we know the optimized profile is the one that we're looking for so in the interest of time we only build with the optimized profile and you can see that command down here and we're generating some extra output for the verification which we'll use to match up the byte codes so this will take a few more seconds to finish compiling and once the contract's finished compiling we'll have our artifacts which are our compiled smart contracts and what we'll do is we'll check each artifact compare its creation code that we developed that we generated just now to the creation code that we found on chain in the previous step uh once we do that you'll see a list of each chain that we were able to verify the creation code on and we'll return that information to the front end along with all the associated metadata such as compiler settings most importantly source code and a whole bunch of other information so this should be finishing up any second now all right so there we go we can see the build succeeded we found our matching byte code on all four chains and we send the response back to the front end um right so we verified on all four chains we're just showing optimism specific data in this response arbitrarily and you can see all the source code right seaport.sol is our base contract you can see all the source code here not the prettiest but you can imagine someone formatting this to look nice um one other thing Cove does which is kind of nice is if you want to view a contract you enter your chain and the address and if that contract is not verified we try to take a best guess um that way users can still get some information right and so in this case we just have this unverified counter contract but we're still able to kind of figure out the ABI set number view number increment number uh and we take a best guess at this source code and this is all powered by heindel RS by Jonathan Becker so that way even for unverified contracts we can still try to give something useful to the users so what's next for Cove we want to support more development Frameworks and languages we currently only support Forge and solidity but we want to expand that to the range of tools and languages that are out there we also want to ensure verification is robust right this is the most important part and contract verification can get pretty complicated when you account for things like create two contract factories self-destruct which is going soon immutable is libraries and all these other things um so there's a lot of different types of contracts and things that we need to check and we want to make sure we're handling all those uh and we also want to make sure that any verification failures give helpful error messages because we know this is a really big pain Point currently once we have all that solidified we want to improve the ux so you can imagine automatically verifying on ether scan and sourceify once you submit to code to save developers time we want to make sure that the sources are hosted somewhere publicly available so that way people can fetch the source code for themselves uh verify these verifications um and make sure all the the code is accessible and lastly build a first party UI just to Showcase all these benefits if you want to take a look at the code it's all open source you can find it at the two URLs below and test things out play around with it just be warned it is hackathon code so use it your own risk thank you amazing thanks Pat Uh do we need amazing dentals like this especially as multi-chain deployment is becoming more and more common uh being able to actually get appear faster and understand what's going and managing that with a proper coming history to deployment tracing is not going to report awesome cool thank you very much anytime well you need all the work so uh well with that uh we are done with our 11 amazing finalist demos so what I think all these teams is snarky Monsters ezekielings uh clay Paulino search OS cfd decks Nemesis Moon board ether card Z catcher and Cove uh for all of you who kind of watch all these demos you may have seen some interesting themes obviously we're trying to figure out how do we make things work really well with onshine and opt-in solutions a lot of stuff leverages zero knowledge proofs here to minimize the data we need to store on blockchains blockchains are not databases and we can leverage so much thing so much of the work we can do off-chain and prove that it was actually legitimate and commit to that commit that to on trade we saw a really cool and interesting applications of consumer apps uh whether they are note-taking or social in nature and not only just were they cool consumer applications that libraries LTS but they are ready for you to use you can try out a lot of these things including the games that we saw early today and of course the biggest theme of all account abstraction uh we're just scratching the surface on the cool and interesting hacks and features you can Implement with account extraction and I just know that for the next academics we're going to do and just all the interesting things that I know people are working on in this space this is going to be a way way bigger deal than we think because it simplifies and enables and unlocks so many cool things so here are some themes that you can expect to become popular in the next six to 12 months and one gave a massive shout out to all of our amazing teams who came here at mlib lives like adults and a lot of them are I'm able for all of you to try out directly on production right now and you can head over to their showcase page and see all these demos and see which ones are live for you to try and press the live demo button so congratulations and now for the part that all of you have I am sure definitely been waiting for it's a stock of the prices we're giving away two hundred thousand dollars in prizes and I'm gonna just go through all of them as quick as I can because I know a lot of you've been waiting for a while so let's start with optimism without further Ado the op clave and pixel team are going to be taking in five thousand dollars for the first place hack the stack uh they made some really really creative improvements and leverages that will leverage the op stack and see even actually modified gath and the optimism code base to get some free compiles and to make really cool hackathon projects so congratulations to those teams

congratulations so these are all of our amazing winners I know we went through them really quickly but the good thing is that this video is possible and you can rewind but all of these products are now available on our showcase page you can see everything by in events and in just a couple of minutes you'll be able to refresh your own page and see all the prizes you want on your own showcase and also if you log into your hacker dashboards you'll be able to see exactly all prices that were given to you as a team so congratulations to everybody here and before we kind of move on and wrap up this event I want to give a quick note on the price delivery so everything that we talked about here is tentative and not final for me this means that we're going to spend a little bit more time verifying every code base and making sure that everything is an expectation with the event rules so no cheating no working on anything before the hackathon started and also ensuring that everything is good to go from a logistical standpoint for delivering so many of these prizes to hundreds of people across different parts of the world so all prices will be sent down by April 21st that is about three or so weeks from now and please keep in mind that some of these prices will have some kyc Enterprise requirements uh so for those of the teams who are in that category we'll be reaching out to you separately about this as a heads up and then you'll be receiving separate information about what that means in terms of how you get to collect and give any information that you need to claim and Prince so please be patient for all these things the next two weeks is when we're going to be acting on all the the above and delivering all these prices well that's a lot of talking for me so before we wrap up I want to take a quick moment and see if you think is to people that made this event possible in the background and is a lot of people that go it's a lot of work that goes into this behind the scenes and a lot of people that make that happen these are some of our judges our mentors our volunteers our speakers our partners that you kind of see see everybody you're involved in some smaller capacity so sometimes not at all but uh it takes a village to make these things happen on the first off start off with all of you amazing hackers 1400 of you spent the last three weeks with us to share all the things that you're excited about and that is not a small ass and that is just a testament to how impressed we are with all of your hard work and passions in building something in in this ecosystem so I hope we really continue to build a more after this event and uh and I hope to see some of you from in future events too and meet a lot of newly in person this year so thank yous to all of our amazing hackers that's all of you here I want to also thank all of our amazing judges who spent countless hours walking through all these demos getting feedback looking at projects looking at the code and really making sure that everybody here has a great experience understanding explaining and and talking about what they were excited about and getting feedback to make it even better after the nuts so thank you to all of our amazing judges there's so many mentors and volunteers that they're available 24 7 to help unblock to you whether it was technical questions or logistical questions or just even running a zoom room with 1500 people from 90 countries all at the same time these people make that happen everyone gave them a massive shout out for all of their amazing work and coordination so thank you to all our amazing mentors and volunteers then we had a lot of speakers who talked about all the cool things that you can do and got you up to speed on what's happening in this entire ecosystem whether it's r d or direct application so thank you to all of our amazing speakers who gave a lot of workshops on how you get started with different protocols and how to think about different things in this ecosystem as we go into a more multi-chain alternated world we also had a lot of amazing speakers for all of our different Summits so I want to thank all of these amazing folks from the me speak economics uh Summit I'm talking about what's happening in the world of minor extractable value and seeing some of the things that we should think about as we spent more time in this space and as more people come in then we also want to thank some of our amazing speakers from the polygon ZK 2.0 Summit uh The Oaks that help launched a polygon ckdvm and talk about all the things that you can expect in this world so congratulations and and thank you so much for sharing this moment with us and so many more Partners who were there behind the scenes making sure that all of you have a great time whether it's getting help for your projects whether it's going through all of your project submissions making sure that you have the right resources you need and just prepping everything that we needed to do to make sure that you get excited about what's happening with scaling a theory and I want to give a special shout out to the youth Global team we have definitely gotten bigger over the past few months so a big shout out to Oregon Taylor Fred Rory Wilbur George Chloe Kevin K Kevin Ivan Crete we see mini nmos Emily Andrew and Jacob these are the the members that do everything behind the scenes to make sure that you have a really good consistent experience so anytime you encounter anybody in person or on Discord please give them a big big big shout out for ensuring that you have a great experience no matter what type of event it is or what size the event it is so that's a lot of me thanking everybody but I want to get back to our 11 finalists we call them our finalists and we got them here to demo what they built and for those of me who are joining us for the first time and you may notice something that's a bit different we called the finalists because we don't want these events to be competitions the goal here is to highlight things that we think are going to be interesting to the world and use that as a way to talk about that and let people also explore the possibilities for those Technologies or ideas and we call them finalists because effectively all 11 of those teams came in first we don't have a notion of per second and third and as part of being a finalist in addition to any prizes they may have won from our partners Heap Global will be giving 500 usdc per member to each of those teams for being incredible in our finalists for this event but that's just not it in addition to the 500 we're also going to be adding on a lot more amazing things so every finalist will also be receiving this hoodie that is exclusive to everybody who's been a finalist for our event on top of that each team will also be getting up to ten thousand dollars of AWS credits that are available for them to use for the next two years so if any of them want to continue their project they get to not worry about the operation cost of the infrastructure we'll also be getting tensor polio eat and one polygon ckvm core lead part member to each of those teams I believe this is a typo it is going to be per member uh so you have to worry about scouring on the internet for different faucets to have enough V2 testings you will be keeping this from us we're going to make that a lot more easier in the future for everybody to come and actually build things without worrying about all these things those of you may have seen we just announced pragma which is our going to be our conference that we're going to be running our in-person events this year this will be a paid event uh unlike the hackathons so any finalist here is also going to be eligible to come into private in time and without having to worry about a ticket or a signup deadline or paying for an entry so that's another thing from the global team we're also going to be giving an ens domain to every team member that they get to register or have fun I'm going to give a quick aspects here which is the domain needs to be at least five characters uh we're not going to help you uh squat a through letter domain name at least at this point in time so congratulations for the es domain and in case you are interested in buying an arbor wallet you're also going to be receiving 100 off coupon to buy a grid plus lattice Harbor wallet and on top of that if you already haven't received or been given access to a lens protocol you'll be able to claim your username and get access to lens and also post chat so push chat is also going to be is currently in Alpha so you get access to pushchat early on and we'll be able to list your contract and and give you early access to all these protocols also if you are interested in leveraging web free storage or just doing anything on ipfs you will get access to the pro tier 4 battery dot storage so this will let you not worry about any of the pinning overhead or extra work that you need to do to keep your files decentralized and available so you will also get access to the port here for one year and to top it all off we'll also be giving 500 Flight Credit reimbursements to any of the finals who are planning on coming to Unique Global Lisbon which is our in-person hackathon in the second week of May so for those of you who are nearby or want to come you are more than welcome to do so and will be able to reimburse you for 500 for your flight with your data entry so that's a lot of things I want to add on to all finalists to summarize all these things in addition to the 500 usdc and I want to thank all these amazing teams for being a finalist and hope to see a lot of these projects come to life even more and be more common terms to all of the people in this ecosystem and I know some of you might be a little bit jealous but don't worry even though you were not a violist it doesn't matter for all the hackers who submitted a project we're going to be giving and shipping this amazing t-shirt to all of you no matter where you are in the world so starting Monday this chart will be available for you to redeem and get it shipped for free and you'll be notified of this over emailing on Discord to claim assured keep this in mind that this will only be available for you to claim if you've estimated the feedback form on your hacker dashboard so go to your hacker dashboard now submit the quick feedback form should not take you more than 60 Seconds and maybe more if you're gonna write some long comment for how we can improve something in detail but give us that feedback and immediately after that we'll be allowed to purchase the shirt for free and we'll just deliver it to you
