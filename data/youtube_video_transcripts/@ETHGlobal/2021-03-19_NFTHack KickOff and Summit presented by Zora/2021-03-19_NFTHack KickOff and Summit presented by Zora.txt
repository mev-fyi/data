um god good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to nft hack we have an amazing day and this weekend plan for all of you today um and i can't wait to get started and tell you all about what's going to happen for the next few days so there's a lot of things you want to cover today we have a summit going on we have uh the hackathon happening and there's a lot of things about logistics with the hackathon specifically for all of you hackers and a lot of preview on what we're going to do the summit on that i want to share but before i get into all of that i want to really showcase the eve global tv that we're using for this event all of you are looking at this video and talking to me here through each global.tv i encourage all of you to uh to log in and check this out we designed this specifically so we can share an experience together this will sync based on what's happening on stage and we will get to do some really creative things and also talk to all of you on the chat so if you're on the live chat please log in you can send any questions as we do all of our summits if you have any questions for our speakers you can ask them here and we'll be able to relate them to our speakers on top of all that it's a lot of cool things we planned for the rest of the weekend as well and uh be sure to uh stay tuned for some of those details so nft hack is a eighth global event and for those of you who don't know if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the weather ecosystem this event is especially um really dear to us because we have seen the most excitement that we've ever gone for any of our events and as a result we structured this weekend to be a mix of two things uh there's a hackathon going on which starts today and continues until sunday and we also have a summit on nfts and the potential of what could happen in this space um which is probably presented by zora and we'll be doing the summit uh right after this uh kickoff and uh we'll have some great talks um and some great speakers coming on so i'll walk through what we have planned for and lined up for each of those events and uh let's start this off with talking about the hackathon so this has been a mind-blowing event for us we have over 550 hackers participating this weekend and on top of all that we have over a thousand people joining us for the summit um the the hackers from uh the 550 plus hackers are coming in from 55 different countries and uh they span 19 different time zones so it's going to be an interesting way to kind of figure out how to coordinate all this thing and keep everything live for the next 48 hours and we are super excited to see how this experiment goes we decided to plot where everybody came in from these are all the cities that all of our attendees including the the summit attendees um are diving in from and it's just incredible to see the diverse crowd and the representation we have from all continents so on top of all of that we have over 70 mentors who are going to be available over the weekend on discord um helping you anywhere from getting unblocked as you work on your projects whether that's technical help ui ux help you to think about how you make this a better pitch for your demos on on sunday or just anything else you'd like to know about this space or how to use a specific protocol we also have 26 companies some of the best representation in the nft ecosystem sponsoring this event but also partnering with us and i want to talk about uh what each of them are doing and how they'll be here to help you succeed for the weekend and in addition to all of that we have over 75 thousand dollars in prizes uh this is uh in uh collaboration with all of our sponsors and uh i'll be going through some of the details of the prizes as well so again a jam-packed weekend and uh let's get started so the first thing i want to do is thank some of our sponsors who have made this event possible and especially thank zora our presenting sponsor they've been incredible to work with for the past couple of weeks and they're also our summit sponsor and um i am just super excited to see what everybody builds on the zora protocol i also want to thank wearable the ethereum foundation protocol labs circle nftx and nft protocol for being our pillar sponsors they're also here and they're going to be sharing about what uh what they do what they're excited about for this weekend and how you can use their protocols and their websites in the marketplaces to really integrate your nft hacks and then we have our provider sponsors that's unit swap ens dp covalent charge particles eat block art polygon decentraland super rare near pinata the graph niftax superfluid and boson protocol all of these companies are here to help you they'll be able to hang out in the mentor channel you can ping each of them on the discord and learn about what they do and how you can use anywhere from their prizes to their apis and lastly i want to thank our participating supporting sponsors foundation nftel ipves maine and niftify so um the thing that excites me the most about this entire event is that we have a such a broad spectrum of the skill sets of the attendees for the hackathon there are people who are interested in building stuff with d5s and nfts we have so many people trying to do cool and creative things with generated music and generative art there's a lot of social and gaming apps and there's a lot of apps and additions and improvements and marketplace related projects that that people have talked about and are planning to build so whether you're developer or you're a designer or your creative artist or your musician this is going to be a really cool way to collaborate cross across teams cross skill sets and really build really interesting things together so let's quickly talk about this weekend so i have a lot of jam-packed logistics for the next 10-15 minutes and then we'll talk about some of our prizes and then we'll roll into the summits so friday saturday sunday how does that look like i'll cover that in just a second a lot of you have asked us about team formation and how you can still find teammates if you're looking for them or if you're looking to get any help um what prizes you can win all the talks and workshops that are happening today and tomorrow how judging particularly is going to work for sunday and and lastly the summit that is going to kick off in an hour so the most important thing here is everything is happening over discord a lot of you are on this chat walking watching this as a hacker some of you will start joining in as summit attendees for all of you who are participating in the hackathon from your dashboard you would have been able to link to the discord and that would have given you access to all the private channels for this hackathon this means that only he was participating whether that's our sponsors and our our our attendees which is which is you um you'll be able to see the specific nft hack channels and and talk to everybody there and then everything else is still available on discord but the the nft hack channels will not be visible to everybody and and everything on the summit is already open to the public so you can just come in and log on to each global.tv and and watch all the talks there and we also have dedicated support channels for various topics and in various protocols the other thing for all hackers is that for all the talks that are happening today and tomorrow you would have already gotten a calendar invite with those details and links on how to join them and where you can watch the live streams and the entire schedule for this event summits and hackathons is already on our website we want this thing to be really asynchronous and we recognize that there's a lot of time zones that have to be accommodated so the way we're structuring everything is that if you are not able to make something live and you really want to everything will be recorded and will be instantly made available on the global youtube channel you can check out the youtube channel by just heading over to youtube.comglobal and everything else is also going to be again posted on discord and lastly just as a reminder to check out the schedule the agenda who's speaking and everything else you can just head over to nft.edu that's going to be the most up-to-date place to see everything that's happening and that's going to be a resource for the next three days so let's quickly talk about how does the hackathon work the hackathon officially begins now which means um as of me saying the sentence you can start working on your projects and that gives you 48 hours and 17 minutes to work on anything you'd like and submit that on sunday you can work with teams if you are working with a team you can have up to five members on your team and as i just said it's 48 hours from here to some of your project and that becomes it comes out to be noon which is 12 p.m eastern on sunday march 21st and rules and the criteria for the event is as very simple um your submissions and what you're working on should be related to nfts that is the biggest qualifier here we want you to still have the full creative freedom to build whatever you like but you don't have to do something specific or take something from the list we also have a list of ideas that you can pick from or receive from and uh if you're looking for inspiration and we're happy to share that and it's already shared on the discord and the info center that you have access to and uh the only other condition is that everything you're going to be doing and submitting for this weekend must be done during this hackathon that means even though you are free to use any open source libraries or for any existing project especially in in the web3 ecosystem um you should not be working on or continuing a project that you've already been working on before today so you can start something new today you could have specced out something but you should not start coding anything or should not submit anything that was coded before this event started and what we'll be doing is in order to qualify for any prizes um you will be asked to submit your source code and we will verify if the work was done before or during the weekend to actually receive the prize and again there's a lot of edge cases in there so if you have any questions you're going to clarify something please message anybody on the 8th global team on discord and we'll be able to look at and address your concerns and the other kind of common thing that we got asked a lot this this week was uh what if you're new to ethereum a lot of you are trying to understand how you can anywhere from use nfts in a creative way to a developer from the web 2 site transitioning into learning about smart contracts and solidity and we want this thing to be as open and as uh welcoming for all of you so what we really do is if you think you need help or if you would like to work with somebody who has complimentary skills says whether you are designer looking for somebody with with development skills or the other way around we really encourage you to find somebody and work with somebody uh to really collaborate and do something uh that you both would enjoy and get some insights and skills out of so you can head over to the find a team channel on discord and then really ping a lot of others who are also looking for help or ideas uh you can also introduce yourself in the nft hack chat and talk about what you're looking forward to and what you're excited about and how you're thinking about your ideas and hope to meet others and and by the way in case if you were not able to find somebody today or over the the course of the rest of the day it's still okay you can hack solo you don't have to have a team this is very much about building something and trying something and experimenting with what's possible in this space and we really want you to create over over anything else so if you can't find somebody or if you don't know what to do or you really haven't been able to figure out exactly how you want to get to where you want to be we're here to help feel free to ping us the mentors are here to help our our sponsors are here to help and uh we'll make sure that you get everything you need to accomplish what you'd like to get out of this weekend on top of all that there's a lot of talks and workshops for all skill sets for beginners for experts we did a lot of workshops yesterday uh for how to get started with certain protocols or or if you're getting started with uh solidity for the first time and we have some boilerplates as well you should really check out the scaffolds repo and use that to really reduce the amount of work you have to do on the setup and getting everything started um if you were not able to attend some of these workshops from yesterday they are all recorded and you can check them out again immediately on youtube and you can use that as a way to catch up on on that content and there's a lot of summit talks today that are going to be really broad and on a lot of different themes and we also have a lot of talks on saturday so all these things will be happening you can check out again uh everything on the website and for all the details on the workshops and how to use specific apis and protocols all that is linked on the info center for all of you hackers and one more time the full schedule workshops the youtube links and everything else is available on nft.edu global.com the website for this event so i want to quickly walk through how judging and submissions is going to structure be structured this is a really important piece so um i'm kind of covering this immediately and we'll be sending a lot of messages reminding everybody about the structure because a lot has has to happen in parallel for all of this the key takeaway is that submissions are due at noon 12 p.m eastern on sunday the 21st that is 48 hours and 12 minutes from now and we really want to make sure that everybody submits everything in that timeline because everything after that will be done live and synchronous so we really have to get everything going in order for all of your projects to be judged um for us to work on what some of the best teams and the projects are from this event so there's two main things that are happening for judging there's a main judging that every team will go through and that's where you'll present to the main judges and you'll talk about the project and who you are and what you built over the weekend and then there's a sponsor prize judging sponsor price judging is for every project that is looking to integrate or qualify for a sponsor price you will have to separately also present to the sponsors after you've done the main judging the the key thing to note here is that when submissions are due which is at noon eastern the main judging starts one hour after submission deadline whereas the sponsor judging will start 30 minutes after the submission deadline and the way it's structured is as follows for the main judging you will have four minutes in total to demo your project we really encourage you to take aside some time and record a video of your demo this way there are no technical difficulties there are no av issues all this will happen over zoom and if you are relying on anything from a live transaction on on mainnet or you have to wait for certain transactions to confirm um we don't want you to be penalized for the time it's going to take for those things to happen so we really encourage you to record those things so you can just smoothly play your video and get to the heart of your demo but of course you don't have to necessarily do that we strongly encourage that to happen but you can also present live it just means that we are going to be running on a very tight schedule so as soon as every team hits a four-minute mark we will cut you off and move on to the next team because we only have a limited amount of time to process possibly hundreds of projects so don't do this last minute please be sure to uh take out some time before submissions are due to really think through how you want this demo to work and how you're going to talk about it and we'll be sending all those instructions again in a lot more detail on discord but all these instructions are already available in the info center in terms of how the sponsorship judging works if you are presenting or if you are submitting for a sponsor prize the key thing to notice here is that you have to specify which prizes you are applying for on your dashboard as you are submitting the projects and for every sponsor you are going to be presenting to you're going to have to go to their discord there's going to be a audio video channel on discord for each sponsor so for example if you have two sponsors that you're applying for the prices you will have to first go to the main judging and then immediately after that in that same window which is three hours after submissions are go to the sponsored discord for each sponsor you're qualifying for and present your demo to them you'll have the same amount of time for uh your demo to each of those sponsors and then the sponsors would independently determine who their winners are in that same window so be sure to really specify these prizes and because there's going to be a lot of things happening in parallel you'll just have to keep in mind if it's worth coming to a sponsor before you go to the main judging or after we'll do our best to give you an estimate for when your number is going to be in the queue for presenting to the main judges so you can coordinate this and really present um to sponsor or main judges first again a lot of these details are already on the info center and you can check out all this stuff if you head over to if nft.edu judging and we'll be reminding you all these details uh over and over on discord and if you have any questions we're also happy to answer all these things um in discord um we just got a question on on the uh the chat um you your demos don't have to be on mainnet there is no requirement for you to deploy everything on mainnet it is a question around if you are going to be judging and you do require a mainnet transaction we just want you to make sure that all that still happens in time and you are not waiting for something to happen in order for you to move on with the rest of your demo because if you hit your four-minute limit for the judging we will cut you off and move on to the next team so you can do everything on testnet you can do everything locally but you don't have to do anything necessarily on mainnet and lastly um i just want to give a quick reminder to everybody on our code of conduct we have rules on how to participate and behave in our community and you can check out the rules and the code of conduct by heading over to youthglobal.com rules but in summary to keep it quick we just want you to be respectful to everybody around you and harassment and abuse in any capacity or any form is not going to be tolerated we will take immediate action against anything that resembles harassment and if you need any help or if you need anything clarified or your you want to just ask us anything or mention anything to us in private please reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be able to address your concerns immediately over discord so before we get into the prices and everything else i want to really remind everybody that even though this is a weekend event we really want you to pace yourself uh don't optimize working on your project over your health or your sleep we don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we don't want this thing to be a competitive thing we really want you to have fun and really learn this is this is more about experimentation and and seeing all the creative things we can do uh when you combine developers creators artists designers and everybody and such the the diverse crowd we have for uh participating this weekend so try as much as you can and even if you don't get to finish what you wanted to do i still encourage you to present and really talk about how close you got to our judges because we want you to learn and keep working on your projects so all that said let's go talk through today's schedule the first thing i want to cover is the summit we're going to just very soon roll into our summit and our talks the nft summit which is proudly presented by zora is going to have a super wide and amazing set of speakers covering a lot of things in the nft and the artist ecosystem we're going to kick off today uh with our crypto media talk from jacob and d from zora then we're going to have a fireside chat with gary vaynerchuk then we have a discussion on the value of nfts from with dylan field and tubador uh we have another panel on what comes after nfts and how we can make them productive which is going to feature linda linda shea jesse walton and marguerite coin artist um from neon district and then we have a panel on how a theorem is for artists uh featuring some of our favorite people in this space uh latasha bobby hundreds rac and my channel from lincoln park and then we have an amazing panel on the creators behind a lot of the initiatives in the nft ecosystem uh we're gonna be talking about mint fund um so we have carlos mikhail jess samantha and cersei who are going to be sharing their insights into what it takes to build this community from the ground up and lastly we're going to have a an interview with rohan from dapper labs and he's going to be talking about top shot flow and how dapper labs is thinking about going and taking crypto and nfts into the mainstream so we're really close to jumping into our very first talk of the day but before that i want to just give a quick um overview of some of the prizes that we have and some of the sponsors who are super excited to share um how they supported this event and and each of you this weekend and uh we have some videos that we asked all of our sponsors to record to greet us uh greet all of you and uh and really kind of cover who they are why they're excited what they do and how you can get involved anywhere from using their protocol to building uh with them and along them and uh what we'll do is we're going to kick this off with our very first in our presenting sponsor zora so we're going to share a video that's already prepared for us and we'll then jump into their prizes uh really quick so we'll pull that up and uh [Music] hi there we are zora well i'm all alone here but i speak on behalf of the people who are zora so i am part of zora as well at least for now we are not what you think we are we are not a platform and we're not a marketplace either you are the platform in fact we believe that there should be 1 000 platforms like you maybe a million even all as weird and wonderful as you are with their own communities and their own ideas valuable ideas that can change the world or at least change the way how people look at it we want you to be able to manifest those ideas put them out there build on top of them make money with it or think about completely new ways that value means to you and your community and how you distribute it we can't make this decision for you but we think that you should have all the tools to make these decisions we believe that this is the only way we can achieve the big things that weren't possible until this very moment because until now we were not able to build them together and that's what we do we are building these tools open source transparent and accessible for everyone we want you to use them to shake up things stick it to the man as they say change the world sounds complicated it's not the opposite it's the easiest thing on the planet as long as we do this together are you getting it i hope you do now some official information if you feel alone or have questions you can talk to lily breck or ethan they will be waiting for you on our discord channel on saturday lily will be there from 11am to 12pm pacific time wreck from 2pm to 3pm pacific time and ethan will be available from 10 p.m to 11 p.m pacific time say hello from me i have not seen them in so long and i miss them speaking of firm we have three prizes of 2500 usdc each but only for those who really get it we hope to see smart contracts that enable crowdfunding crowdminting pro collection and more go as galaxy brain as you want big small precise universal i know you have what it takes i believe in you i believe in us good luck [Music] amazing that was a very creative introduction to zora and how they're excited to be supporting all of you this weekend uh you already heard a bit about the schedule for the zora team uh to be available to answer and address any of your questions and they also talked about the prizes they're going to be doing i want to quickly repeat some of these prizes and uh just to give a quick overview zorb will be giving 2500 in usdc uh for building dowels and crowdex to uh really build any contracts or applications that enable crowdx uh and there's going to be 2500 usdc for making developer tools and making it simpler and easier for zoro related developer tools to be built and then a prize for 2500 usdc again for building your own marketplace we'll share all these details again in the prizes page and over discord but here's a quick overview for what's coming for zora next up we have wearable and uh super excited to see what the wearable team has to say dear hackers it's alex from wearable i welcome all of you here today on this east global nft hack event we're all witnesses of how blockchain world undergoing massive developments and the nft is deleted and the largest developments of that of this year and the force behind this development is you hackers builders designers product managers i welcome all of you here today we at rarible started 1.5 years ago as a platform that democratized access to nfts to creators we welcomed everyone to try to experiment of what will be the next big thing inside the nft market and we've been always tracking community sentiments and and being and being community oriented previous summer we launched the governance token and and the liquidity mining program that massively increased the liquidity on the marketplace today we just hit 2 million dollars of daily volume with 30 million dollars of the volume over the last 30 days and and almost 60 000 active traders buyers and sellers on the platform we are continuing our efforts into democratizing assets to the nft world and progressive decentralization and today we want to pre-release our our nft protocol we are taking all the all the infrastructure behind wearable and making it accessible for everyone wearable protocol supports nft issuance trading and there is the api indexing api that tracks all the nfts ever created on the ethereum blockchain out there in every collection and making them available for trading under our decks our issuing tools allow you to to to set an arbitrary royalties for several addresses our decks respects that royalties even if they were created without using wearable issues and tools uh we support front-end fees that that you can you can pass arbitrary front-end fees when contributing an order to the protocol variable supports indexing of all the blockchain data and providing the metadata to it wearable.com would be the largest client of wearable protocol you we have all these 50 000 traders that would would be using using the shared order book so that's that's the single best reason to try to build a wearable protocol because we know it's that it's really hard to to grow the marketplace with the supply and demand growing simultaneously and and moreover we have the wearable dial and we've been always a community oriented and community owned marketplace so by building on wearable protocol you can be sure that you will have all the support from the wearable dial and you're starting early on you can help us the team to design incentives that would support all the projects building on top of the wearable protocol we specifically designed protocol to be agnostic and agile to allow you to express all your or all your possible creativity in building projects on top of it we support lazy maintaining we support collaborations we support arbitrary royalties just as a map of addresses that need to receive downstream royalties so let's let's try to build something great together uh the documentation available at docs.variable.com you can find me and our team under ithack discord sponsor wearable channel or on twitter under insider xerox or telegram can not be i'm pretty sure that you will be able to get all the support from our team most of our team lives under european time zone so we will be able to get you supported by early u.s time and late hour time good luck building let's let's do something great together amazing that was alex from wearable and to sum up their prizes they're going to be giving five thousand dollars in total for the best use of variable protocol and uh the first uh price our first place will get twenty five hundred dollars and the runner up will get fifteen hundred and then a thousand dollar price for the third place at the best use available protocol next up we have

rachel from circle will talk us through what circle is doing in this space and how you can help win some of the prizes [Music] hello everyone my name is rachel mayer and i'm vp of growth and product marketing for circle welcome to nft hack i don't need to tell you that nfts are skyrocketing in popularity and it's making blockchain technology more mainstream the moment that we have all been waiting for as crypto ogs has finally arrived consumers are rushing into nft marketplaces the ones that can facilitate crypto and non-crypto consumers are the ones who are going to stand out everyone i know who doesn't know what bitcoin or ethereum is are trying to get their hands on the latest nba top shot moment or the next kings of leon album which was offered as an nft but we all know that most consumers don't really know how crypto works and that the process of buying an nft is intimidating how many people will know how to complete a checkout process that requires them to have a crypto wallet have an ease balances most consumers don't have a wallet or know what eth is yet they expect the same experience at with consuming a media artifact just as they would when shopping on amazon or shopping with spotify to listen to music and that's where circle comes in circle is a global financial technology company that enables businesses and developers all over the world to harness the power of stable coins and public blockchains so that you can build payments commerce and financial applications worldwide you also probably know us as the principal issuer of usdc the world's leading fastest growing regulated and fully reserved stable coin uscc is now shy of 10 billion in circulation and we're quickly adding net new digital dollars in circulation hundreds of millions each week this demand is what drives the moment for mainstream adoption of payments in consumer applications circle supports companies like dapper labs and hundreds of other crypto native businesses with high quality fiat on and off rams through apis all powered by usdc with circle apis nft projects companies and marketplaces can make buying and selling nfts super simple you can offer both crypto as a means of payment or traditional methods like credit cards and banks and wire transfers a variety of rails and payment methods bundled into one seamless ap api we abstract the crypto entirely if you want to or allow users and consumers to pay with crypto also you can pay out through rails like cards and banks when you sell the nfts for high you know high cash out values on for both creators and sellers on your platform as the infrastructure for payments and wallets for companies like dapper labs we've been in the middle of all of this crazy nft momentum and action helping scale companies when there is demand and this is why we're super excited today to sponsor nft hack this weekend and our unique prize for all developers is to award a total of 5 000 usdc to the projects that build those best payment experiences using our sandbox apis with the sandbox you have complete access to what a production environment would look like across our payments digital dollar accounts and payouts

circle is going to be giving twenty five hundred dollars for the best experience of payments using circle sandbox uh it's going to be a second price for the 15 1500 for the second best experience and another one for a third place uh for using uh the circle sandbox you can check out all this information on the circle discord page as well as the prizes page which we'll shortly talk about in a second so next up we have nftx and alex from the nftx team is going to talk about their protocol platform hey everyone i'm alex gausman the founder of nftx i'm not very good at speeches or promotions but i've written down some points which i will now share the adoption of nfts over the past couple months has been truly staggering for a while now i've been quite bullish on nfts but even i have been checked by the recent mania and it has really only served to strengthen my belief that nfts will be a revolutionary technology this decade i foresee a future where the concept of a digital collectible is as ubiquitous as the concept of a selfie is today just as the web 2 revolution has made everyone a photographer i believe the web 3 revolution will make everyone a collector in truth i do not think the real nft mania has even started yet because there are still so many unexplored possibilities bringing this back to nftx our goal as an open org and a protocol is to become a black hole for all non-fungible assets whether they be in-game items digital art collectibles physical property deeds tokenized legal agreements or other forms of nfts every time a developer deploys a new nft and increases nftx's total addressable market which is one reason i encourage everyone listening to consider building an nft related product at its core the nftx protocol itself is actually quite simple anyone can call the create vault function which deploys an erc20 fund token that is linked to a particular nft contract for example vault 13 manages the glyph token which is linked to the autoglyph contract after a vault is created the fund token can then be minted once for each nft item which is transferred into the vault it is also possible for a fund to target specific token ids from a collection such as the punk zombie fund which targets specific ids from the zombie crypto punks at the time of this recording we are working hard towards launching a version 2 but nevertheless we encourage developers to try building on our current nftx contract it is my hope that documentation for version 1 will be ready by the time this video airs but regardless we are keen to offer assistance to any developers who need it feel free to bring general nft questions to us as well during the hackathon if you have any and we will do our best to answer i am a true believer in decentralization and it has been amazing watching nftx develop as an open org these last few months there's so much work being done behind the scenes and there are always new people joining us in our mission to bridge the fungible and non-fungible worlds on ethereum i urge anyone interested in nfts whether you're an artist developer or collector to come check out our forum or stop by our discord chat and say hello we look forward to meeting you thank you for listening amazing that was alex from nftx protocol and just to sum up their prizes they're giving away five thousand dollars for the best use of nftx protocol where the the first place gets 2500 the runner up gets 1500 and third place will get one thousand dollars and lastly we have nft protocol and we'll have joseph from nft protocol talk about who they are and how you can work on the nft protocol [Music] hi everyone joseph here from nft protocol nfc protocol is a generalized protocol for nfts and what that means is we're building a number of features on top of different evm chains and different blockchains for decentralized architecture for trading facilitating the creation of and building on nfts and the economy that's supported by nft trade so the first thing that we're doing with the nft protocol is building a dex that has many unique features it's web3 enabled we'll talk a little about that a little bit later we have also an idea to create different types of nft galleries for example in archaeology and a lineage of memes and internet culture that can be represented by nfts we're also looking at making a price index for nfts so you have not groups maybe let's say an art nft group or you have like insurance nft groups or specific things like a specific artist's nfts can be bundled into an index and then given a price and traded on a regular exchange that would be like a decentralized like amm or something like that so let's talk a little bit about where we are now with nft protocol and right now we're creating a dex uh it is not like an automated market maker decks it is more like order book decks so each of the trades or each of the orders on the decks will have an index and that index refers to either a 721 to 721 swap so you can trade one nft for another or a 721 to erc20 trade so as the creator of this swap i can specify which nft that i have for sale and i can specify which erc20 that i'd like to receive now because it's web3 enabled we can have uni swap that routes trades through into the erc20 and then it'll make it so that pretty much any your c20 can be used to purchase any nft and the creator of that trade will be able to get a uh the erc20 token of his choice his or her choice so that's one of the things that we're doing with the nft protocol right now is creating this order book decks we're going to be expanding this into the 1155 standard and other standards that come out to support nft trades and currently we're in beta for this decks at the moment and if you'd like to sign up for the beta please go to nft.org check out our discord our telegram and you can get connected to us through there and once we release the beta it's going to be live with three features 721 to 721 trade 721 to 20 trade as well as minting which is going to be pretty cool some of the unique features of the decks are going to be web3 uh features like for example you'll have uh some sort of like feed of nfts that would look like a social feed or some sort of uh timeline where you can see the recent things that have been posted all that will be completely decentralized we also have the white list feature which means if i wanted to trade one-on-one with another person instead of creating an order that's open to the public i can create a private order and then only they are able to see the details and only they are able to trade with me in that instance so we're looking at some privacy components and otc trade components as well as having web3 features on the front end so if you'd like please come participate and make suggestions we also have a 1000 nft reward for anyone that's going to be making it the best suggestion and the best plan for what you could do with the nft protocol based on the things that i have outlined here and in our one hour workshop on saturday we'll also be going into how nft protocol can be used to facilitate trade and enhance the nft community as a whole so that's nft ticker on coin market cap and coin gecko that's nft protocol see you guys later amazing so just as a creative way to get people to learn about nft protocol they'll be giving a thousand nmt tokens to the hacker who has the best engagement with empty protocols saturday session which is tomorrow and you can check out the time on the youth global website so those were just a few of our key sponsors that just talked about who they are and why they're excited to be part of this event but i also want to just do a quick shout out to all the other prizes we have available from all of our other sponsors and i'll go into the details for um i'll just point you to where the details are for each of these companies so polygon will be doing five thousand dollars in prizes each block card is going to be doing 4 400 and prizes covalent has 4 500 in prices for the best use of all their protocols near protocol is going to be doing five thousand dollars in prices uh and and so will be central land and deep is doing two thousand dollars in prizes for the best use of the protocol integrations for each of these then we have charged particles uh doing four thousand dollars in prizes uh superfluid finance doing three thousand in prizes super rare doing 3 500 in prizes we have nymph techs doing 5000 in prices the graph between 2000 in prizes pinata doing a thousand dollars worth of prizes for the best use of their protocol uh ens doing 750 in prizes po app doing three thousand dollars in prizes and a couple more that we're going to be announcing in the next day um all that on uh on the prizes page so just as a way to make sure everybody knows how to look at the full list you can check out all the the workshops the videos how to get started the documentation for each of these prizes and the details for how you can qualify you can simply head over to nft.edu global.com prizes you'll be taken to the info center page on the list of every prize that we are giving out for this weekend so that was a very jam-packed one hour of logistics for how the hackathon is structured again our goal is to mention as much as we can be as verbose as we can and all this stuff is available on the info center on discord we'll be reminding you a lot of these details and we'll be clarifying anything that you want to know again throughout the weekend and we hope that it answered and addressed most of the questions that we got emailed or asked directly and uh and if there's anything that we missed feel free to ask them on on the chat here or on discord and we'll be able to address them for you immediately so that said what i'm super excited about next is us moving on to our summit there is a lot of amazing talks that we have planned for the next few hours and what i want to do is kick off with our very first talk of the day and i want to talk and invite uh jacob nd on on stage i'll ask them to turn their video on jacob and d are co-creators of zora and they're going to be talking about the nft paradigm and and inverting the internet um in a talk that's titled crypto media so without further ado please welcome jacob and dee and let's hear more about crypto media let's kick off nft hack and the summit jacob d sweet way here i'm just about to share my screen one sec ooh yo all right can you see my screen you're all good all right brilliant so yeah hi everyone um d and i are pretty excited to run through this talk and presentation today um we've titled it internet renaissance um so shift away from the crypto media title i guess uh what we want to talk about today is basically like the moment of time we're in in the ecosystem generally um i think nfts have like catapulted through into the zeitgeist and kind of having this amazing moment i think what we want to do is like take a step back and kind of talk about like well why why is this moment happening um what is the kind of the history and the state of the internet that has led us to this moment what are nfts as a paradigm why they're important and then crucially like where we think the space is today and where we think it needs to go it's so incredibly early there is still so much left to build um and i think uh yeah we're just excited to go through those details so um yeah just a quick intro on me i'm i'm jacob i'm one of the co-creators of zora um was previously at coinbase before zoro where i worked with d and i'll let d introduce himself quickly before we jump in yep d another one of the co-creators at zora i met jacob while working at coinbase i look after everything kind of artists creators and whatnot at zora so yeah pretty excited to be here thanks for having us sweet okay let's jump in so let me just press next so let's start with the obvious so nfts are undoubtedly a paradigm shift um and specifically their paradigm shift in information ownership so if we think about the internet pre-nfps they've kind of been two dominant systems of information ownership so if you think about the media you create um you know content anything that's being put on the internet there's typically two systems of ownerships that have existed and have like kind of defined how we create and share media today one is the copyright system so the legal system that's kind of instituted you know by governments and across the across jurisdictions all over the world and copyright is defined by well if i have ownership over this piece of media information i have the right to restrict reuse and distribution and copy paste downloading like all those things um so that's like kind of the think of that as like the fiat information ownership ownership system the kind of second bucket which is obviously related to copyright is platform content and media and information ownership so when you create um a piece of media or a piece of content and you post it onto a platform they that platform is like you know monetizing that information creating value generating value from that um and you know if you're a big enough creator you you may see some flow through from that ownership um but for most of us like everything that we're creating on the internet the value rounds down to zero and the platforms kind of monetize that and essentially have de facto ownership over that media content um instead of us as the creator so the problem with the kind of two predominant information ownership systems is that it's kind of a paradox basically like to generate value from that information you have to restrict access to it so you basically build a platform that essentially functions as a walled garden that world garden is built out of advertising or subscription or pay-per-view and the paradox is is that you want to build a walled garden but fit everyone in the world inside of it to maximize the value capture so if you think about like the universe as the internet today we kind of live on these mega platforms these huge walled gardens that bundle everything into a single place so all of the media you create the social graph of people who are creating an interacting community on those platforms and it's those platforms who can benefit the most from owning that content um so our view is that we've never really escaped intranets yeah the the instagrams the tick tocks the youtubes the facebooks the spotify's they're all essentially private networks that take ownership of the media and the content and the information that we create they monetize it better than any of us and then you know we get paid in social currencies like likes or follows and like i said earlier if you're big enough you may get um adsense revenue or a share on the actual dollars generated um and like this is the entire mental model that kind of forms how we think about information ownership like oh for this to generate value we must restrict access to it so nfts there's kind of like two gems of like quotes that i think you should hold in your mind to think about like well what's actually happening with this new value system why are nfts a paradigm shift and a complete inversion of how we think about media ownership so the one on the left stuart brand in the 80s it calls out like information wants to be free but information also wants to be expensive and that tension will not go away so if you think about that it's like information like we want to share it we want to copy it we want to download it we want to give like we want to distribute it as far and wide as the information wants to go but in the kind of prior paradigm information ownership that is at odds with the fact that well the only way you can generate value is to restrict access a second kind of gem that you should hold in your mind when thinking about nfts is this one by mackenzie walk which she said in 2016 in an s like an amazing essay called my collectible ass is the future of collecting maybe lesson owning the thing that nobody else has and more about owning the thing that everybody else has so it's not about owning the thing that no one has you know you could have a physical artwork that only lives on your wall but what if you own the piece of media that's on a million people's screens it's a very weird way to think about ownership but in practice that is a step towards what is actually happening and enabled by nfts which kind of you know alleviates this you know perpetual tension has been called out with the prime prior internet which is like well how could we have information that is both universally free and accessible to consume but also be recognized for its inherent value to society and to whoever the creator of that information was so nfts are a paradigm shift because it inverts the way that we think about information ownership and it really like gives us the the best of both worlds for uh information ownership on the internet so by way of example like just to kind of think about like well how this works in practice and if you've been in the nft space for a little bit like you've probably heard this mona lisa analogy a million times but if you think of nfts is something similar to the mona lisa the mona lisa as a as a artifact it is individually ownable but it lives in the public domain so it's universally free for anyone on the planet anyone on the internet to copy remix redistribute print on a poster put on a t-shirt post on instagram and every time that that redistribution or that reproduction is happening that isn't taking value away from the original that's actually making the original mona lisa more valuable because it's becoming more well-known more culturally relevant you know has more override like more notoriety and as a cultural artifact like it proves more value the more widely known it becomes so to kind of like shift the perspective with kind of by this you know visualization and you know crude analogy it's like well what if that same value system now starts to apply to every piece of information media and content on the internet um you know be it memes be it youtube videos instagram posts typefaces websites themselves what if we do now have this like canonical original this provable original that can be individually owned but is now you know universally accessible to the entire internet to be freely shared and copied and distributed built on top of um and that's where nft is going to get us there so you know with the with an nft it's the opposite to copyright or the opposite to how platforms function it's like the more you copy paste the more you share it the more you download it the more it's being displayed the more valuable you're making that original instance um the more valuable you're making that nft so if we think about pre nfps this is kind of how you would can like view most platforms so you have a platform and they're kind of this walled garden that content is bundled within and restricted within and to move it between platforms you'd have to you know copy and paste or duplicate or pirate or download or whatever uh nfts completely flip it so now it's like well you can have a single nft and now any platform on the internet can freely build on top of it so instead of tick tock having a monopoly on the entire content database of tick tock it's like well what if now every single developer on the planet had complete universal access to you know that database like imagine would we have just this singular feed experience that everyone can build on top of or you know what would what would it look like if there are now thousands of websites that can or apps that can start to build and remix and curate all of that content not just ticked up um so it gives you a sense of like the platform inversion that happens because of random keys so nfts are undoubtedly a paradigm shift in our view there are paradigm shift that's halfway there so the current construction or the ecosystem today is basically we have an amazing ecosystem of galleries or what yeah the nomenclature of marketplaces so there is probably like now 15 to 20 different marketplaces and one of the most common and you know this is all aggregated you know a level below or above however you want to view it by openc but essentially one of the biggest questions that a first-time creator coming into the ecosystem is is like well which marketplace should i mint on and then the problem is that when you mint on a marketplace the the marketplace owns the market you end up becoming bound to that marketplace in a lot of ways you've of course there's some of these marketplaces you can take your nft post sale and you can start to move it around but they unfortunately like yeah the the value system that approves there is built and held within the marketplace themselves so the market places charge fees once you kind of like do a primary sale and move it it's like well where does this value capture happen and there isn't that there isn't any interoperability between marketplaces today so you could have uh anywhere between five or you have as many markets as there are marketplaces on a singular nft um so we're kind of finding ourselves in a similar situation to pre-nfp internet which is well okay i now have to like pick which platform i want to bound myself to which i meant on and then accrual the value but there isn't this kind of like interoperability that the technology allows for so the media and the content may be universally accessible but currently we see a marketplace per platform which is kind of like giving us this head fade and you know this the inside is that nfts are bound to marketplaces so for us for zora we started as a marketplace and like we love that model we get to have a strong curatorial sensibility we get to charge a fee on top of everything that's going on and when we were starting to build for nfts we kind of had this awakening which was like well there are amazing nfts on every single one of these marketplaces and it's one thing for us to curate and point to one of those nfts but in what we wanted to do is go like hey this amazingly beautiful artwork on super air wouldn't it be great if we could just point to not only the nft but also the market on zora so we don't have to compete in the zero sum competition for like winning absolutely every single artist what if there was some shared public layer that meant we're all building on the same market and what if that market could be owned by the creator themselves so we kind of ran into this head first we realized ourselves as like oh like the whole reason we're building on this technology is to create a new open and public infrastructure for creators to reclaim ownership of their work and the way that marketplaces function is kind of at odds with that like us ourselves as a world garden and we're getting like very early like flashbacks for the early decentralized exchange era so if you remember for those in crypto at the time like there was kind of this first wave of uh order book based decentralized exchanges and they were directionally correct it was like yes there should absolutely be exchanges that are decentralized and protocol based but the early instantiations were a little skeuomorphic it was like well why don't we take the order book model that we see on traditional exchanges like coinbase or nicely or the nasdaq and put that on the blockchain but the result was is you had you know even though it was like this global and open system you still had all of this fragmented and competitive like liquidity so it's very hard to like create this unified system that would allow for liquidity to accrue into a single point and then crucially most of them were not entirely permissionless so you would need to go convince a particular relay or a dex to actually list your token it wasn't a permissionless and public tool there was still this kind of like middleman that you'd have to go through to access the technology so the shift from early decks to something like uniswap really did like three things it was a net new market model that hadn't been seen pre-crypto um it was a model that led to global liquidity so it was like a more effective model instead of seeing fragmentation across all of these different order books it was like what if you can collapse it all into a single pool and then the third and most important was it was entirely permissionless and completely open for any developer or person on the on the internet to use and start an exchange so for five or ten dollars in gas you could start up an exchange and get the same power out of the box as a developer as you would you know the entirety of something like coinbase or finance which is just a huge paradigm shift and you know so you can get a decks with a couple of lines of code um so for early nft i think we're kind of seeing a similar thing which is it's directionally correct there's no doubt about that like yes there needs to be a market model and a way for value to accrue to the creators and um you know the people who are minting and curating and collecting these nfts but the model again is a little skeuomorphic it's like let's bring auction house put on the blockchain and we're kind of finding ourselves in this similar position there's like a lot of aggregate like fragmented liquidity that has been trying to be aggregated in multiple different places but it's resulting in like okay creators having to mint on 15 different places fragmenting not only the markets for those nfts but their identity across those platforms too um and most if not all tend not to be permissionless um so there's different um curatorial standards the most you know marketplaces do not have open source or verified contracts um they're they're not like entirely open tools that developers can build on top of and get the benefit of this like liquidity out of the gate so for us it was like well okay we were to take that same conceptual leap for nfts what would it mean to what would the net new market model be for nfts how would that model enable global liquidity that would open up the ability for any developer or creator to start to easily build on top of this um new paradigm and how can we make it entirely permissionless so to speak to the the net new market model uh we designed the entire protocol around like well instead of us being a marketplace being a protocol the nft is the marketplace so you know exactly where the market needs to be the amazing thing about nfts is that they have a very unique market structure there is only a it's one to many there is only ever one owner and there are many people trying to buy so this is very different to say a fungible token which has a many-to-many relationship so while something like uniswap or sushi swap or a model like that may be winner takes most it's very hard for to be when it takes all because the types of relationships you need between those many too many buyers and sellers means you'll probably still need multiple forms of market for an nft it's very different you the market collapses to a single point at every time you know exactly who the owner is um so the protocol was designed entirely around this notion that's like well let's build the market into the nft itself and let's give that market ownership to the artist to the creator of that nft so when you're minting your nft you're minting the market for it and that market is entirely open for anyone to build on top of it and there are some interesting design decisions which you can see in the in the docs which we'll link later where it's it's not about the highest bidder so anyone can bid in any currency anyone can bid at any time and you as the owner do not have to accept the highest bidder if you see an anonymous bid for say ten thousand dollars but then a bid from kanye west for five hundred dollars you may be inclined to take the one from kanye west because it could increase the value of your work long term and there is a notion of a creative share and perpetual equity built into this token so you can realize that time so the results of the protocol so one thing to call out is that the way we deployed the protocol was a one-time deployment so zoro protocol we did not build any ability for upgrades any upgrades would have to be through you know social consensus which means that the protocol is entirely unstoppable so we can't stop the protocol even if we wanted to anyone can mint on it anyone can interact with the markets it is like by all intents and purposes open public infrastructure allows you to create these nfts that can survive outside of the lifetime of any given marketplace or platform um and you know gives it towards permanence as far as you possibly can so to speak on the the permanence piece basically whenever you meant a token on the zora protocol you have to mint the content hash the sha 256 hash of what that piece of media is uh that hash when you mint it is immutable you can never change it and what that does is it means that if you need to say it's like you initially choose ipfs or are we or even aws is where to store your media if that file storage solution for whatever reason turns out that you know it goes down or is incorrect or there's a better model you can always the owner can always update the link of that token at any given point in time um and the the the content hash means the public can always verify that that link is pointing to the exact right piece of media at that point if you try and you know but if you buy a token and change the link to a piece of media that is you know not what the nft was minted for it's trivial for the public to compare that to the the signature of of the media and the hash um so yeah that when you're creating on the zora protocol your nfts are entirely platformless so if the zorro.co website you know went down or the team went away the market is still running for it the nft still exists anyone can build on top of it so you don't need our permission to create you know your type of nft it can be literally any form of nfc you can mint and the permanence aspect is like yeah like okay how can we create mechanisms that means that this nft is an artifact can survive for as long as the ethereum blockchain itself which could be decades or you know depending on how optimistic you are on blockchain technology it will the the nfts will last for as long as ethereum itself which could be an extremely long time another point to like uh talk about is the this notion of perpetual equity so if you think about um someone like john michelle bascat it's like the original his like first paintings sold for 200 in the early 80s and you know as the the culture and society like woke up to the beauty and the notoriety of his art that value skyrocketed into the tens of millions hundreds of millions of time um and in the traditional art world resale royalties have been you know tried to be instituted over you know hundreds of years like the france had started uh the resale royalties in the early 1900s but they didn't become commonplace across auction houses so as these works like get bought and sold over time artists would almost entirely miss out on you know earning some of the value that they've created through those works as it changes hands um in the zoro protocol you know when you mint you can define well what is the resale royalty that i would like as a creator as this thing is bought and sold in the future so it could be 10 20 literally whatever you want um and that is built into the protocol itself so when you settle on the on the protocol that royalty is honored by by the market um and our view is is that well instead of seeing 10 or 20 marketplaces that are helping people view and browse and curate and collect experienced nfts there should be millions of these marketplaces so and maybe every website that is uh you know now every website is able to build on top of this universally accessible content media they should have a direct line to the market place themselves um so you know by bringing the market into a single point making it permissionless and open to everyone you know every website can now be a marketplace in some way shape or form um so to like flash back to here it's like i think we can actually get closer to this direction because now we have this public and open layer where now every single one of these platforms if they're starting to curate their own subset of nfts that exist on the protocol and you know one of their community members happens to you know love the meme or love the video or you really love the song if that platform still wants to help that person directly collect and engage with the market within its own website it can it doesn't have to push you out into some other marketplace every website can become a marketplace in essence and we're starting to see this kind of play out you know the zora protocol only went live at the start of this year and we're already starting to see like these like unique and specific experiences on the protocol so one that launched um a couple of weeks ago is catalog works um so you know they are building an entirely specific experience to music they want to come at the spotifys and the soundclouds of the world and explore what it means to you know give ownership of the music and the value of music back to musicians and it's a very distinct experience that you know you could never do for like this experience wouldn't work for memes perhaps or you know typefaces or whatever type of marketplace you want to see like we should see a very rich diversity of experiences based on the types of entities that are being created and then similarly like uh mirror this um amazing tool for like writing so coming at the mediums and the substance of the world it's like well when you're minting your writing or your blog posts your essays whatever it is like this is also being minted on top of the zora protocol and again it's like a very different experience to to catalog i think like what we're trying to help bootstrap and help teams build over time is like well what are the unique social media experiences marketplaces experiences or niche markets that we can help bring into fruition so if you wanted to build a meme specific auction house then you can do that if you wanted to create a market just for music samples or stems or typefaces or code snippets or 3d objects or you know name any form of information or data or file type you can mint and create a very rich and unique experience um and then you know you can start to integrate and curate across all of these different places because you're built on a shed an open layer um and again like you know we're starting to see like very early examples of what this type of ecosystem looks like we've got radio stations someone built like a tick tock based interface on media on the protocol virtual worlds you know interesting text um collectible experiences and then you know we had um someone in the zorg community build a zorro interface before we even did we deployed the protocol a month before zoro.com went live and you know we saw someone in the community just build their own interface on top of it because everything is completely open which was like a really cool moment for us um so to speak to like some of the things that uh the zora protocol unlocks now that you have these trustless markets it meaningfully unlocks trustless dials and all of these interesting use cases so if you think about a dow minting azura nft now the dao is directly interacting with and has the opportunity to accept bids so today if you construct the dow and we did this with st fame you like mint and nft because the markets uh kind of on a per marketplace basis you need to figure out how the dow can like interact with that marketplace and in many cases there's just no direct tire to do it now if you mention nfc with the market built in if there's say a bid for a thousand dollars the dow can trustlessly vote to accept that bid um and if it does accept that bid the funds can then trustlessly be put into that dallas treasury or distributed token holders or can then be used to you know do any collective action with um and these dowels just give you kind of a sense of like you know a visual it's like yeah these dowels can be governed by obviously um a token but they're starting to like manage any amount of nfts and like can trustlessly accrue the value and you know um from the activities around those things so you can see like well what if you have artist collectives that are now collectively minting under a single name or a single collective identity what if you have daos that are now collecting as a community so you can have you know are hip hop one of the largest like subreddits well what if they were able to pull together capital and they could start commissioning and bidding on and collecting nfts as a as a community and they can choose to vote to then you know accept bids put it up for auction and they can trustlessly then like you know create and accrue that value together and distribute that value um and there's like amazing early examples of this like flamingo but the trustless nature of the protocol now means it's like well it's very simple and straightforward to create an open template that anyone can now start um creating it on a per community basis um which drives us to these very interesting notions of community ownership both for daos that want to collectively create and curate and collect together but also it lets you layer community ownership into the platform levels themselves so if you think about the catalogs of the world with their music it's like well if they're facilitating these auctions and curating as a community and curating as a platform it's very easy to programmably route the value capture from those platforms as a community and distribute it to everyone who is you know using those platforms in marketplaces so we we truly think we are engineering into an internet renaissance one because we're actually getting a step close to what the internet actually was supposed to be like we're entering like we're exiting this massive intranet era and heading into a world where it's like well anyone can create content that is platformless and can like stand on its own right accruing its own value and is entirely interoperable universally accessible and open to everyone so our view is that the social media platforms as we know it are dead it will take a very long time for them to entirely go away but there are very direct incentives and i think a general want for people to yeah we we all know and feel that like well if we're on instagram or youtube like we can kind of feel that it's not entirely our own space or it's like you know you have to wave through the ads and you know the way that value capturing these platforms the way that they are constructed are just totally at odds with what information wants to be which it wants to be free so our view is that the mega platforms are no more and they will be replaced by public permissionless protocols that are open and accessible to everyone not just based not just accessible to the platforms who are kind of constructing these huge wall gardens and that you know there are the other tools for creators and communities to be their own platform and you can be your own or build your own or do whatever you want because you know the starting state or the way to the barrier to entry to now start a valuable platform is so much lower you no longer have to compete and catch up to the entire content database of instagram or tiktok you can now build on top of and start like stand on the shoulders of all of the content and media and now it comes down to like well how do you want to curate how do you want to present and experience all of that content um you no longer have to build and catch up to that content you can just start from there and start to you know really experiment and create your own rich and unique experiences and that's only possible when you have entirely public and permissionless infrastructure whenever you have uh permissioned or central control the incentives eventually get skewed towards you know defending that value capture mechanism versus if it's public and permissionless by design no one can really stop you or stop anyone from building or creating in the ways that you want or can like change the terms of how you're creating on that infrastructure um so for us it was it was critical that when we deployed the zora protocol it was open source fully audited twice verified and deployed in a way that was unstoppable so if we ever wanted to do an upgrade to azure v2 we couldn't just flick a switch at the smart contract level and force everyone to upgrade we would have to create an entirely new instance and you know provide the option or the path for people to move across but only if they wanted to zoro v1 will can never be changed upgraded or stopped it'll always live there as an option that is public and accessible to everyone um so yeah if you want to learn more about the sdks and tools that we've built to make it easy to interact with it this is the kind of starting point zoro.engineering we have the whitepaper the protocol source code links to the github and then a sub graph and you know javascript tools for you to like interact with the protocol also join us in discord so zoro.community um if you just go to that link it'll take you into our discord and we've got channels there where you can learn about the protocol ask developer questions and just interact with the the creative community that's growing there and then to kind of explore everything that's happening across the protocol zoro.co is kind of this general um explorer and you know uh open marketplace that is you know letting you interact directly with everything so um that's where you can like see exactly what's being mentioned who's bidding on what you know you can see everything from there um and yeah it's kind of just like a bird's eye view of this of the the way we think about um different parts of the stack that we're building out so there's the protocol itself um the os so the sdk and then of course like the the interface the open source interface and open interface for everyone to like look into and explore everything that's happening across the protocol and our long-term goal and the thing we're driving towards is that you know everyone is interacting with zoro everywhere but or if we if we're just creating a huge mega marketplace that everyone has to go to to mint and share and exchange all of these nfts then we've failed like we want there to be millions of marketplaces that is fundamentally powering the internet itself so that zoro is successful when it's everywhere but zoro.com or most views everywhere outside of that um so yeah that is kind of the end um and yeah i don't know if there are questions in the chat or if d you wanted to add some color in as well but yeah it's the start of the internet renaissance no i think that was pretty perfect amazing jacob d thank you so much i'll uh i'll kind of just ask you to uh just disable disabled screenshot so people can say hi and a lot of people are questioning who these amazing speakers are and uh one thing i really want to kind of just point out is that i think this was a good overview of essentially how nfts are inverting just how we think about business models and communities and i think you did a really amazing job in setting up the base for the rest of the talks we have planned for for today so um there's there are a lot of questions but i will ask you to do is address them on the the tv page live and we'll bring you back on later if you have time and uh do more of a live rip-off so again super excited to be working with all of you here and uh we'll talk to everybody on discord sounds good all right thanks everyone thanks guys uh next up i want to really kick off our our next talk and i'm super excited for this one and that is we're super excited to welcome gary vaynerchuk uh who is his hero entrepreneur he serves as the chairman of interx and he's currently the ceo of vaynermedia he's widely regarded as a really big person in defining what next internet culture is and just the relevance of like how social and internet makes everything um different uh for for us um interviewing gary will be jacob williams from the global team and jacob and gary gonna talk about collectibles nfts and his views on the future of this space so without further ado please welcome gary and jacob gary thanks so much for being here so happy to be here jacob and uh hi everybody who's watching uh i i said this once in 2009 we're at a social media conference if you are watching this right now for the majority of people a lot of this is old news and this has probably been a four or five year thing but let there be no confusion you are disproportionately ahead of the game and i hope there's a lot of happiness and challenges and interests with that and so i'm very honored to be here and thank you for having me thank you yeah i mean maybe that's a good place to start we'd love to kind of maybe learn a little bit more about sort of you know how long you've been thinking about the space you know i know you've been talking a lot about nfts recently on on your podcast on on youtube and everything i mean when was your interest peaked like when did you kind of take a look uh the journey is in 2016 a gentleman by name of aaron battalion and a tremendous technologist cto of living social and just somebody i'd really admire of being an incredible nerd aka really technically sound but in intuitive consumer behavior which is obviously where i live and so we would always have these jam sessions at south by southwest and he i bought bitcoin in 14 and this was 16 south by and he started explaining ethereum to me and my brain went into oh this is interesting this is platform not currency and i'm like i'm not a financier like i to this day get you know i'm all about nft life and all my friends that want me to get excited about currencies i get it and i'm like i don't to me it's not like doge this or or bitcoin this or altcoin to the moon that like it's just not as interesting to me the same reason i don't buy a lot of currencies or trade or even stocks on the public market whereas you know t-shirts and garage sailing and sports car like so um and then there's the the things that will go into deeper beyond they are in collectibles of nft life that i think the smart contract to access and you know uh touching and and feeling peop things and experiences you want um so that access and and part of of this smart contract so that excite me so anyway i you know i bought a bunch of ethereum and 16 in the same way that i'm looking at vr today which is it's looming but it's not prime time for every person in kansas that's my game i'm listening and watching and far you know i always hate when i enter a new space at this point in my career because i have the baggage of my career and so like i've been trying to be very thoughtful about that because i i get upset when i do something and and i'm so appreciative i'm humbled that people ign even this beautiful intro you know kartik you know like i understand that i've done nice and well and have done but i always think i'm only as good as my new at-bat and if i come into this space and i'm a clown and make you know and am wrong like it erases everything i've ever done you're only as good as your next day right so i've come in somewhere around february march april cover time i'm like wait a minute that nft thing that i've kind of like really far away like i know what crypto kitties are like you know like like you know i remember looking at that carefully um this is starting to happen a little bit and then i had a conversation with rohan from from dapper and top shot and i'm like huh and i was in the heat of my sports card thing physical really it's interesting and then the fall came and all this time what really  me up was kovid you know i'm i'm this you know a lot of times people forget for all my loud mouth tactics and putting out tons of content i'm the active ceo of a 1300 person global company that like and it's client service it's not even like tech 1300 which is a hell of a lot easier to manage you're just getting bombarded by people so you know navigating being the captain of really rocky waters during covid didn't get and then i decided with michael rubin from fanatics to do the all-in challenge and we raised 60 million dollars you know to help people that were hungry during cobin so i had 0.0 minutes march to august to what i wanted to do which was like why is my spidey senses then the fall came we navigated all that trauma and i actually saw offense for vayner x for 2021 so then i got suckered again into like putting in extra hours towards wait a minute i could set up a nice year for us that's probably a good idea then it was late late december i feel like i've got that all accomplished and i'm like okay i'm gonna really dig in now and i started doing real homework you know you know and i started having some you know friends you know that i started like i started kind of dming quietly some friends uh kevin rose was instrumental you know got into a form the founder of digg.com truly totally kind of web 2.0 him and i spent a ton of time talking about it he was instrumental in like check out flamingo check out this i'm going to introduce you to matt for crypto play i'm like okay like it just started feeling 2005 to me then you know i put out a little piece of content or two which allowed me with my you know awareness these days to make some new friends um jeff holm holmberg uh you know was i just have to give him a shout out kid that i spent a lot of time talking about crypto punks and hash masks with and i'm a learner i'm a i'm a learner from the bottom up i can't learn from like a tech backwards place i have to go from what are humans doing and then i go backwards up i'll learn about level two issues by by understanding like trying to buy something and being like what the this gas like that's how i learned yep and i'm also what my big advantage is i understand people cold that's my strength and so you know the last four months have been two three four o'clock in the morning canceling important and taking another thing you know you and i met that way like i'm just taking a meeting you know i'm just trying to be part of the community i got excited i started talking then i was like i have to start talking way more about what this moment really is which is the technologies forever internet 2000 some of the stocks the projects are incredibly overpriced and there will be absolutely in this world's terms ico crashing culture with and so i've been trying to put that content out there so people are being thoughtful uh i've been learning a lot more about wrapping and forking and burning and you know i've really enjoyed it and so i come to this talk a incredibly humble and knowing i'm in the middle of my journey on the consumer side like what people are going to do i have a flag of conviction that is as large as anything which is nft culture is here for the rest of my entire life there is 0.0 doubt i've only felt like this twice in my life 1994 when i heard the internet for the first time that and i'm like in a day i'm like this is gonna change my life and sure enough i'm not building 500 liquor stores for my dad anymore i'm gonna do this winelibrary.com thing and and then friendster myspace it was a little bit more of a slow burn but it was definitely when eric castner my lead developer at winelibrary.com started making me read techcrunch and i was like okay and boom you know youtube he showed me actually that's not true there was a single moment eric shows me youtube and he goes remember four years ago when you're like can i stream wine videos on our website and i told you it was eight trillion dollars and only two people would watch and you were like no i'm like yes he's like well now you can do it for free on this thing and uh and in february you know that was in 2005 and then february 2006 i started wine library tv which really changed my life because that's what made me use twitter and facebook to promote that show and then i became a practitioner the only other time i felt that way was somewhere here in january really only two months ago when i did enough homework of like it went from spidey senses to my life is going to change and that's what i fully believe as i sit here i don't know now i don't know it took me a decade to learn a lot of tech to talk the way i talk today about web20 social the internet i still have plenty to learn about blockchain i'm sure i'll say things in the wrong terminologies and things that nature those things are irrelevant to me meaning i have the humility to be corrected and i love everybody in the community i have the patience to learn some of the real core things i'll need to just just i always like to be just dangerous enough so i'm not an idiot but where i spend 100 of my time and 110 of my time is why are people gonna do this how is this going to affect somebody who's selling their home can they put a can they put this on the ledger and like make a vig every time this home sold in the beginning how am i going to launch my book wait a minute music artists can do this wait a minute who's the first providence i understand that completely that's everything that's social currency why do people wear gold watches same reason they're going to buy this does the blue check me anything on instagram it sure does of course can i take a picture into jpeg who gives a  you don't actually own it and in 13 years everyone's going to actually look to see hones like that's where i play my game i love it totally yeah i mean i think it's been amazing to see you use your platform in i think a really positive way and then kind of bring people into this fold uh and and kind of the mindworm that all of us i think have been thinking about over the last couple of years um and yeah i think you know you do this in such a genuine way it comes across really well so really appreciate you helping out there jacob if if everybody really knew me and were inside my chemicals if they understood you who you are in this space and i consider like this this authentic crew to me to me people that were really active november 1st 2020 back are really part of a crew that's different than let's say oh yeah you know february 1st 2021 right and i've lived that twice in my life that was when i decided to learn what the internet was at all and boy were those tech nerds and then i met them again in 2005. they were just different that early you know people don't understand what silicon valley looked like in three four five six like it was so different than the status that it has now and i think i i see a lot of those characters again in this world now the internet is so much more mature and accepted mainstream that the the juxtaposition of culture pop culture fame non-fame like it's different but it's still the same which is much like a band that goes on to become pearl jam that early crew feels a relationship to the technology and the movement that must be respected by people like me that come along and that is my number one kpi you saying that to me is much more important to me than me doing business well with this platform so thank you for saying that no i appreciate it i mean you know you said you kind of come to this with a little bit of baggage but i mean i want to talk about kind of you know you've had decades of experience of trading uh uh trading cards right like uh sports cards and that kind of thing and you know collectibles is one of those pieces on the nft world that you know is really coming into position right now and top shot is huge you talked about uh rohan's talking later uh in the summit today about top shot and dabber in general um i guess kind of curious about sort of what are your thoughts about the future of the collectible piece and how do you see that sort of coming on the chain and beyond just top shots right now and by the way to your point i use baggage as a slang term to an incredible gift that i'm given which is i have notoriety and respect and and of course that comes along with razzing and i people think i'm sure you know and i get that but for the most part what i mean by that is i can't do what i did in 2005 which was and six which is go to uh six aparts blog and ask a question or go on or in 2006 7 being on twitter like i didn't have the clout reputation you know personal brand whatever one wants to call it and what i mean by that is i when i say baggage i use it as hey i think too many people are coming into space acting like tough guys and tough gals like they know and i'm trying to come in like hey i do have conviction of a couple things i see comma i'm not trying to come in here like there's a million people on twitter that are ogs that can run circles around me on the understanding of the technology of blockchain you know and crypto and things that nature where i feel incredibly confident is what people are gonna do and that's why i'll go to this part let me go to a place on collectibles that i have not heard people talk about i have a lot of experience in that thank you i also have a lot of experience in something else that a lot of people know me for which is garage sale right and i actually believe that the garage sailing part of me has more insight than even the sports card version of me and let me explain when i go garage saleing i buy things based on knowing that people have nostalgia and pop culture in their blood and so when i buy a new york city bus pass that has the world trade center picture on it i know there's no inherent real massive value or when i buy huckleberry hound in a stuffed animal from knickerbocker the stuffed animal toy company for three bucks without even looking it on ebay i already know that's forty fifty dollars now let me tell you why that story is important there's going to be in the advancements i'm going a little further and beyond collectibles what i believe is gonna happen i'm sure given the nature of where we are in the life cycle of nfts and who's in this conference outside of the people that just came in from my tweet that are probably going through learning there's a lot of people here that i think most of the audience here could be giving the talk that's just what happens in the beginning which i respect tremendously i think everybody knows and is probably frustrated when everyone's so fixated just on collectibles and art when we're talking about and and by the way i felt this with e-commerce and social media people get fixated on the first thing that makes even any level of sense to them and then that one of those things become the conversation i mean i remember when people talked about the internet in 95 96 only from the lens of browsers and search engines yep like there wasn't any conversation around like e-commerce and you know like you know so because a lot of the early tech people weren't merchants like i was so for me the reason i bring up the garage sale thing is the following i'll use myself as an example now i'm going to use a concert i'm going to use coachella coachella has bracelets physical bracelets there's nobody here watching this right now that's not confused or confused that in 15 12 7 6 3 years that becomes a token and it works and then i can't wait to see like token readers and like while i got there's so much fun innovation coming right for sure you know you know smart contracts that check off that you use it like it's going to be so cool right what i know though as garage sale gary is seven years later somebody's gonna buy the first if it goes on that festival because becomes coachella right somebody's gonna buy that token the same way i would buy the bracelet at a garage sale for 25 cents and sell it on ebay for 19 i know that tokens that are really not collectibles and arts but representations of smart contracts are going to have a secondary market at a scale that most people haven't made the chess move connections on and that is going to be incredible because that is going to lead to incredible behavior at the ip level to try to do thoughtfulness for the audience to create that economic aspect the economic aspect of that is going to actually force leagues musicians festivals things to actually care more about their custom right now we're in the golden era jacob of the people launching projects that really don't give a about their audience at all it's a fast money grab i'm going to draw something a picture of me or something that represents me i'm going to mint 10 000 of them and because right now and they're going to make some real money i mean we've seen some athletes and somebody make real money what i know is going to happen on the other side is the people that are holding the bag of that collectible have paid overpaid so much no different than pets.com or etoys.com as a stock that doesn't mean nfts are not going to be the game-changing thing of this generation it just means that project is not and what you're seeing is short-term transactional behavior right now of people land grabbing for quick bags but what they're actually going to do is hurt their brand because there's going to be some fans on the other side that are sad that they paid 3 000 for ownership of an nft but now the market says it's 17 aka beanie babies right so totally so i'm worried about that from for everybody in this cycle that the person that's buying it and gets held with the bag but i'm actually worried about it equally for you know they deserve it because they weren't thoughtful but it doesn't mean i don't have compassion to somebody who doesn't really there's some people because i've talked to a bunch of celebrities ip they don't even realize they're doing bad things for their audience they're they they're delusional they don't understand supply and demand and where the moment we're in so they probably in our a lot of them i could tell i've had the combos they actually think they're gonna do well like oh someone's gonna pay 88 000 for this and one day it's going to be worth 2 million i'm like first of all your ego is insane second of all you're very much misunderstanding what's about to happen which is the tokenization of everything do you know much supply that is it's influencers jacob right influencer marketing i was right in 2009 when i wrote crush it and you have the logan pauls and charlie demilious but there are tens of thousands hundreds of thousands and millions of people making 50 to 200 000 a year being an influencer instead of an accountant or gardener and loving life that's gonna happen with nft that's gonna happen with artists that's gonna happen in a lot of places so i don't know i think there's a lot of thoughtfulness that needs to come to the market here's my thoughts it is the game changer for collectibles arts and pretty much everything in the world um there will be incredible layers of bubbles and no different it's like the stock market was invented and there'll be plenty of ibms and ges and amazons and there'll be plenty of enrons i mean there will be stock.com right i think we all know personal personal brands are going to do things you know uh i'll give an example this may be an extreme example but if nfts have been around for 60 years somebody might have done incredibly well with o.j simpson investing when he was in a high school football player and he put out his nfts and they were the rookie cards and right you know in 1991 you look like a genius you bought something for three dollars it's now seven that trillion dollars and then boom a moment happens and like there's you know there's a lot of things that are going to happen with these nfts but i think the macro is incredible and i think when you have people like i'm glad wilhelm's coming you know what he built with dapper and flow and top shot incredible you know i think he'll add a lot to that conversation but my big thing is that this that we also are now at a place where i as a 45 year old man would rather wear cool sneakers have comic books that are graded to 10 own video games still in the box graded sports cards wear hoodies wear t-shirts like the culture is becoming more collectible nerd fun like the investment portfolio of a 45 year old man with my wealth 20 years ago was real estate and stocks very part i have more in stock sports cards comic books toys nfts that i think is not going to stop and i think that's going to lead to a lot more demand than people are anticipating very cool yeah i think that totally makes sense i mean um just the number of assets that people are looking at every day is it's just it's an order of magnitude more than it was uh even like 10 years ago right and i think there's no way that's going to stop it's not going to stop and people enjoy it absolutely my crypto punk more than my tesla stock i enjoy my super mario brothers and mint condition more than i enjoy my part ownership with my dad in the real estate at wine library i enjoy i enjoy i enjoy and that totally that part the mixing of experiences and nft smart contracts is going to be game-changing absolutely well maybe um a good place to go here i mean this is going to be a hackathon right we're going to have 600 people building stuff all weekend uh and hopefully you know 150 or so projects by sunday what do you think is missing from the ecosystem right now or what do you think what do you want to see built right first i want everybody who does something cool to dm me at garyvee on twitter because i want to see it perfect uh the i want to see real life readers you know i want to be able to create nfts that create hall passes in real life and i want to be able to read your wallet physically like a scanner at a venue and then it marks off the ledger that's been used like i want that i know i know there's the roblox right now for that like so i'm not naive enough but like if you're talking about what's missing that's definitely coming that totally um uh i'm very fascinated about um the royalties changing based on you paying a different price just throwing out some random right now to get some yeah i think it goes good yeah i just think like when you buy something could you lower its royalty by paying more for it up front like that i think that's kind of cool um the physical you know i like what the artifacts people are doing i think the phys like i'm a big both and guy i think there's right now or like no yeah like they are like i'm gonna still buy this and i'm gonna buy a ton like so anybody who can capture things that create an ecosystem for and let me throw an old world problem at it can somebody create the operating system for warehouses that can take on all the physical versions of the digital in a world where a lot of people want to stay anonymous and don't even want to take ownership of the physical like like you know i'm thinking about projects yeah custodials thank you you know that's interesting to me that's like a boring tech operating system that can turn old warehouses into something very valuable that might be fun and um oh i've got a big one i actually i need this one i want somebody to create the communication layer i want to be like i'm going to launch a project i want to be able to talk every day to my 4 000 people in a deep in a decentralized way and not have to force them into a discord or something like i'm very like i want to be able to say right this second i launched a project i want to say hello to somebody like so in-wallet communication structure i think is huge like on the spot community space yeah i want to just basically be like yo thank you again for supporting my thing or yeah all of you right now here's a link like i want to support my thing and a lot of good things are happening i want people to communicate to them that's huge for me actually that one's actually that's my kill that to me is how you start the social networks the reddits the discords of the world in this game let me talk to the people that bought my yeah it's amazing to see the communities that have formed around crypto punks or hashtags or everything but that's because but that's because discord link on the site do you get it yeah i'm talking but it could just happen yeah because don't forget four years later i'm not following where these transactions have gone i might get a little money and then i know what's happening but i don't know that jacob sold it to kartik and when i want to do something for the people that own my right now i want cardik there not jacob because he went into my discord but no longer owns it so that that to me is huge totally now i can see that this all right i have to go yeah i know what you're thank you you're being sick yeah yeah i heard stuff at 1 30 but i just looked i'm like by the way anybody who's watching this please hit me up on twitter to just say hello i'm i'm the word i would use is desperate and honored to be a tiny piece of this community and want to make more friends and would love to get anybody's thoughts on anything they heard and i definitely want to see if kartik thought i said anything interesting before i leave you want to jump in kartik no i i want to say i think uh the coolest part of this is that i think we're finally getting to the piece where people are thinking about it from what the interaction looks like for the end consumer of that content whatever that may be whether that's art or way to integrate into a community and i think this is kind of the right way to think about it because what you're talking about is how do we actually make this valuable for the end user it doesn't matter how the tech is set up correct that's what gets to the millions that's why i'm gonna win just so you know not because i came in with like because what made quote-unquote garyvee was i was a liquor store son of a liquor store owner with a 40 person watching youtube show and once i understood social immediately i just did what i did in real life which is if i can bring more value to them than i ask for in return and that is going to be the winning formula in the nft because we're talking about economies and communities here the end at scale and that's the scale i mean that's you know that's why i'm probably getting there's you see the goosebumps oh wow look at that isn't that cool no but really like i literally called my mom and said nft is the manifestation of my life's work and i'm in the prime of my life to take advantage and to contribute to it do you know what that feels like to me like to your point you know how thoughtfully serious i was taking the words that came out of my last 30 minutes we're still early i have this place in the ecosystem a different ecosystem web 2 not this web 3 thing but it still carries and if i can deliver 30 minutes of thoughtfulness here it can be meaningful and i'm very honored by that that is i mean gary love loved the the no opinion on everything and then the right kind of direct view on this and i think you're i mean i'm just checking out the chat here there's a lot of comments on people just agreeing with a lot of things you've said and just that's something that means a lot to me from this community please hit me up on twitter folks because i have meetings and i want to see some things bye everyone thank you so much thanks so much gary take care thanks jacob and um i mean that was great i think we got to figure out a way to get gary back in and have a much longer conversation so um thanks jacob and thanks carrie and for all you that have questions we'll find a way to get them answered after this so i want to move on to our next talk i think i was thinking about how do i think about doing really good segways and transitions into how we change themes or topics but it turns out that everybody's just automatically making it easy for me by already setting up uh what the neckties should be about so um here i just talked about what this actually means in a social context and how do we actually get people to care at scale and this kind of brings up for for our next talk so i want to really i'm super excited to welcome dylan field from figma and tubador from metapurse to really kind of share their opinions on some of the recent events that have happened in this space um we're going to be talking about at a high level what the value of nfts are um or is and uh and there's a lot of things going on here so we'll see whatever we can fit into this ecosystem and in the next 30 minutes and uh without further ado let's kick off this incredible talk so we have dylan and tubador thank you so much for uh for joining us um not only is it amazing to have you from both of your respective communities but it's also an honor to do our summit with this anonymous person um this is kind of the world that we uh are jumping into and that kind of excites me a lot more because this is new to a bunch of us and just uh just great so welcome and what i want to do is i want to just ask each of you uh to introduce yourself and just kind of give us some context into how you got into crypto and empties you know i'll start maybe with dylan yeah well card take first of all thanks for having me and uh i'm really excited for this this conversation um i got into crypto uh i had been really interested in cryptography uh in middle school and high school um and i've done some like lectures online about uh hash functions and people have been reaching out to me like in the very early days of bitcoin about about crypto unfortunately i didn't i thought they were insane until i ignored their messages uh and then i joined the teal followership community and as a tl fellow people were really excited about crypto as well i also thought they were insane and so it took me a few revs to get to the point where you know i started to get very interested and very involved in the crypto community um and that's i think why i flipped all the harder when i finally did uh in my my day job i uh at my night job to be fair i'm ceo and co-founder of figma and i really care about uh how to make it so that everyone is able to be creative and how to make it so that more people are able to participate in the digital economy uh and i think that crypto and nfts and figma to me kind of all go under the same umbrella in terms of like how do you enable creativity and how do you enable uh sovereignty and abundance and um and so yeah i'm very excited to discuss today thank you you know i was with dylan uh on a clubhouse chat the good time show with uh rt in sriram i should have learned my lesson then this guy is a tough fact to follow uh in under any circumstance so i should have gone first and uh i can't think i'm not a pseudonym it's just that i look exactly i love telling the story of how i got into this space and uh only recently because it it says very different things to different people right if you're a left-brained person my story feels like uh a series of lost opportunities and finally finding your good but for the right brain person he thinks oh wow okay i can skip the first three years of this guy's crypto life and jump straight into the nft space because that's what it allows that that's practically my story i uh i was introduced to crypto by mr cohen who was an app developer and a serial entrepreneur already and uh so the first conversation we had he spoke about bitcoin he used a lot of words i understood all of those words uh individually but i had no idea what he was talking about and we didn't speak for the next three years and that might have been on purpose in some sense but uh a few years later some somewhere in uh 2016 he had a couple of uh enterprises under his belt he'd uh uh you know uh done escrow services he uh he installed like 100 bitcoin atms all over the world and then he came back and said let's do android and so i jumped on that ship so i did d5 for a few years with uh vignesh but then during the pandemic it sort of pushed all of us inward into the metaverse and that's when i truly discovered uh i mean uh like gary we put it right it sometimes nfts when you interact with them they feel like okay you found your life's purpose in some sense and that's that's not because of any um how to say it is actually quite profound it's because nfds are experienced at the end of it and you start to feel them and they're so vivid and they're so real and me i'm a wordsmith for a living i write for elena i communicate for a bit finally i was able to sort of start talking in color start communicating in color and that really blew my mind i was able to connect with people and this pseudonym that you see in front of you it's sort of dropped into that space without any baggage just uh a whole bunch of uh metaphors to explore and that's that's when the metropolis journey also started so long story short for left-brained people uh a bunch of lost opportunities and finally finding you who right-brained people take note if you want to jump into crypto start with the nfts skip the rest no that's an amazing intro and uh it may be so i had a bunch of questions prepared but i feel like i'm going to just throw a bunch of that out of the window because there's just going to be a lot more just things that will come from your answer so we'll just dig in and then go into it directly so what i'll do is i want to start off with actually uh with youtube adore so metacoven yourself made a bit of news a couple weeks ago by buying and winning the people's uh 5000 days uh for the first 5000 days artwork and purchasing it for a little over 69 million dollars um i actually want one and one the audience watching to you a little bit gonna hear about how you actually made that decision to sort of get into this you've talked about being a fan of people for uh not just from a few weeks ago but from lane west um just walk us through what made you interested in in his work um how you decided to think about owning that as our piece and how that historic moment all together just came to me from from your side wow okay yeah i mean uh i guess i did see a few tweets on my timeline about that so a bit of views um you know uh uh medical and naive uh metaphors was like uh uh it's sort of a coalescence of both of our theses about the nfd space that fellow uh has been collecting nfds culturally and culturally significant nft since early 2017. he started with decentraland uh he's now the largest estate owner single estate owner in central land he has the delta time triple one he has the first supper on async art which is the first work of programmable art he has an urban galaxy and and so on and so forth right he's been collecting for a while but then somewhere down the line uh around march april may when i started to sort of interact with the creators and the artists in the space our thesis about nft is being this this catalyst this touchstone for everything crypto started to converge and that's how metabours was born so after a while we when we started to think about this theses how do we power this you know this engine that we have of uh you know nfts how do we take it to the next level uh out of the blue and this is where serendipity works in uh in crypto right people reached out to medical out of the group and he said uh hey man i'm i'm doing this uh are you interested and the weirdest part is that people reached out because uh meadow coven was a losing bidder in his first nifty gateway auction he didn't get the piece that one went for i think sixty thousand dollars or something and uh mr government lost that bit and he just reached out as a whole and then it clicked so the shift here was two things one uh the thesis that uh the future of the nfd space depends on creating experiences around these nfds the cambrian explosion that we're seeing right now is only the acquisition phase right people are uh gobbling up nfd's trying to acquire them but the real explosion will occur when these nfts finally start to uh be experienced in a manner that they were meant to be and that's where we wanted to go with this so we decided to buy all 20 of people single edition pieces uh that that's that's a whole other story but but we did that and then we created these massive monuments across the metaverse in decentralized crypto voxels we called it the b20 project it's it's still there so we bundled all of these 20 pieces we bundle these monuments we bundled an original soundscape by blau and we fractionalized the ownership into the b20 tokens so white people is an easier question to answer because we believe he's the artist of our generation we believe that he represents the only thing that is unhackable in this digital world and that is time and that's what this people 5000 represents right think about it every day for 5000 plus days he sat down and done this one thing it just blows your mind and that sort of consistency almost spiritual level of consistency and creating for the sake of creating is plus the beauty of it is if you started uh the 5000 piece at the top left the first picture is absolute crap uh i mean people level absolute crap and then you graduate all the way you see the journey of an artist how he's grown as an artist and how he was able to do these things at the most crucial times in his life right i remember a story where uh he he did one in 15 minutes because his wife was in labor he didn't miss even that day so this this uh this collage or this con this thing represents uh a person's life 13 years of commitment to this one thing and that's why we believe he's the artist of the generation and that's why we also believe uh in retrospect that we got it for his that is an absolutely wonderful um perspective on how you're thinking about this and and i absolutely agree this is a snapshot of the 13 years of the progress of who people is now and i'm sure he'll be extremely happy to hear that and and uh and i feel like now dylan is the fact that you're the act that demands to follow so um it wasn't just uh mata kovan and yourself that made some news uh dylan you also made a little bit with uh the the recent sell of crypto punk 7804 um i want to actually have you just talk about what crypto punks are um just talk about some of the trade scarcity and describe 7804 yeah um so cryptopunks were the first ethereum crypto art project and they were created in 2017 as well uh which is around the same time probably that medicoven tubador we're we're checking out central land because i remember checking it out at the same time and uh right uh that's another topic i'm very curious talked with the metaverse later if we had the time but the um uh they're created by these two artists matt hall and john watkinson and there are only ten thousand crypto pumps and they were actually available for anyone to claim at the start and unfortunately i did not claim the men but uh uh yeah and playing them for free in the early days which i thought was a really cool and pure way to distribute them to the community and then from there market formed and um different people were training them based on rarity uh of the ten thousand crypto punks there were only 88 zombie punks there were 24 apes and there were nine aliens and there was exactly one alien uh punk that was smoking a pipe and its name is 7804 and i found 7804 just be completely magnetic and uh i was obsessed with it honestly and i over the holidays of 2017 2018 um i i started to think seriously i was on a trip with my then girlfriend now wife elena uh who's also amazing and uh early the nft space and now working privacy in the crypto space and um uh and we started talking about it and i said i think i'm gonna this might be the craziest thing i've ever done but i'm gonna put down fifteen thousand dollars as a bid for 7804 so i think this could be the digital mona lisa and sorry this is 2018. correct yeah this is january early january of 2018 now and um and i bought a few already but this is the one that i covered and care about the most and had most of a relationship with and just i thought a very iconic image and um and so the big guy accepted uh and yeah i i i i told some people when i first came back uh from this trip and their reaction was that i was crazy uh you know i think that you know it's amazing how in three years how much much has changed about the way that we interpret understand the internet and digital ownership and art um but uh at that time you know people just totally didn't get it and so i was a little quiet for a few years um so i was like oh maybe i you know this is not the right time i'll talk to us another time and then um over the last six months i started getting more loud i put it in my avatar i started to really talk about it more with people and um i i over the entire period time when oakland was kind of a secret entity as well as when it was a public identity i really felt a relationship with the art piece in a way that was um i i never expected and i think going through the process of selling it which i i am i was very mixed about but i thought ultimately that if this is going to be the digital mona lisa it has to change hands it has to actually be recognized with value by somebody else um and uh of course i was conflicted because i loved it so much but i um i think through the process of selling it i've actually believe even more uh that all the conversations and questions about like are at ft's art uh can you have a relationship with digital objects those are just now so clear to me because i think the answers are sounding yes like not all nfts are art but art can be nfts and you can have a relationship with that art when it's digital and that makes me so bullish on the future of the nft industry um because i think that there's it's not only art but i also think that when you start thinking about what does it mean to have a relationship with digital space and items there's just so much that that could unfold there and as we think about the metaverse whether it's central and whether it's gather town centralized decentralized um or a medium between the two worlds i think that there's going to be relationships that form there's going to be objects that are created uh we're going to go from sort of this this if you look at the way the economy develops from currency to goods to services we're going to see the exact same thing happen in metaverse and that's fasting to me and the crypto um implications for that are so vast and and just so wild that i'm really excited to see what the next ten year springs no it's absolutely amazing i think uh um you said this uh i believe in a tweet or another was the clubhouse where you said owning seven or four was a curse as as well and it's it's just the exact same thing you talked about there's an emotional relationship that uh that you have with this uh this piece and you've had it for a few years that's part of your identity and for it to be successful and really propagate the message if this actually is a new way to think about art um you have to part ways and uh right i think and you'll have always part ways of the mona lisa uh that'll ever be part of as well now but i'm i've signed up for that and that's okay with me because i i uh it's not the money that motivates me money is nice and don't get me wrong but um it's a very privileged thing to say that but uh at the same time i i care so much more about can we make this a movement and can we make this i mean where creators uh i i see nfts as a way for creators to have room to explore their art uh you know going back to what tubador said you know time is the only thing that's unhackable i think it's a beautiful statement uh and medical one said that i i just go to the medical event but either way it's a beautiful beautiful statement and i think that uh you know time is also so scarce and you know money can equal time um if you have income that will give you time to work on whatever you care about most and to the degree that nfts can create that space for people create that abundance for people i think the world can really change as a result absolutely agree and um i i guess you already bring that brought that up and i was going to ask youtube adore um let's gonna dig a bit into how you think about a metaperson just at the metaverse overall could you give us an overview of what metapurse is what led to its creation as as an entity or i would say or as an org and uh and also you kind of just talked about the the b20 project but i would love to kind of have our audience know a bit more detail about what that was how it was set up and uh and now what were uh what you expected for people to kind of do and interact with yeah beautiful um v20 project was uh um you know it was done at a massive scale and one of the reasons we did it was because it was like trying to put together the first computer or the first car right you don't know how all the parts fit so it necessarily has to be big to see if that thesis worked so which is why we needed something as spectacular as the 2020 uh one of ones of people in massive massive uh estates in decentralized cryptobots in some new space and so on and we had what was called the metapalooza which turned out to be the largest ever virtual event in the crypto space uh i mean the thing is beyond a certain point uh metaphors can't take credit for any of it because i mean if i say uh 500 600 people turn up fine i'll take some credit uh you know nifty turner phrase great design and all of that stuff when two thousand five hundred to three thousand people turn up for an event he said okay somebody else took charge of this nobody told me uh about it so that that's kind of what happened it means that people were ready for a certain shift the way they looked at art and engaged with it and that was at the heart of the b20 uh movement in a sense and andrew steinwald described it best for us it was the first public art project uh in a sense it was like the virtual uh moma with the only difference that you can now own a piece of the museum as well so when you walk into the museum of modern art and you have this visceral connection with one of those art pieces all we did was to tokenize that connection say i i own the entire experience right from the step that i walk into to this space to the sound that i hear to the experience that i have in the art and that's that's simply what the b20 token represents right it's very simple it's not a utility token it's not a social token there's no protocol behind it there's no roadmap it just means that it gives you a piece of the ownership of that and whether or not you have b20s you can walk into those museums today and experience those works around the paradigm we wanted to shift like i was uh talking about was the way the world engages with art is very unimaginative you either buy it and flip it for a higher price or you buy it and lock it away somewhere which is what happens to conventional pieces the third part is is what we tried with v20 which is to open up access to the entire world that used to be how art worked in ancient temples in india or egypt or in rome ancient civilizations that's how art was experienced but then a layer of finance sort of settled on it it stopped being sustainable and b20 changed that it's now sustainable and sort of profitable for all of the stakeholders as well and the moment we realized that was when we worked with 30 people right uh to build b20 we worked with whale street the team at wayne state but did the uh you know the underlying tech work they did the bundling and the fractionalizing now credit to uh nftx and niftex who have been doing it for quite a while now uh this is not an original idea this is not a new idea we just did it at a different scale that's all uh we'll state that that we have uh metacast which is a team of uh excellent communicators like andrew steinwand uh matthew from scent brooke and so on we had grow your base which helped us with the tokenomics of the whole thing so about 30 people in all right and all of them chose to take b20s instead of usdc or eth that's when we realized oh okay this they actually believe in this idea it's not just us and so uh it was very heartening to see also uh a community sort of formed uh quite naturally and spontaneously around b-20 uh there is no official discord for metapurse we never created a b20 discord but now three discords exist there's one uh very graciously created by the whale community there's one um you know by by fans elsewhere and there's one as part of wales street so all of this is the p20 story and and this sort of uh confidence that this this uh this enabled in us is what you know spurred us towards bringing home the people 5000 as well if if anybody ought to have that piece it should be someone uh from the crypto space preferably not just in some sort i am happy to hear that i told him what you're saying i think one of the things i've been reflecting on a lot recently is how the question of what is art has always propelled art forward and obviously that's getting pulled into question even more with nfts and and uh when people see it whether it's people seeing people and going okay that's not what i traditionally think of as art or is people saying is the format and that's changed i also think that there's inherent link in crypto and i think you highlighted it beautifully of art as community and that being a part of the artwork and i think you're it was fascinating just to hear you say about how this parallels uh ancient civilizations as well where art was also community and uh and part of the community in a different way and so i think there's so much to explore there uh whether it's dows [Music] being able to mint things or vote on how art should change over time uh whether it's sort of communities coming together to experience art i mean there's so much there and i'm really eager to see how it evolves too yeah i was just saying that's right go ahead no no just uh emphatically agreeing with dylan that's all um no it's actually very much true because what i was going to ask was like this definitely changes some definition of what art is uh because we've not to update that definition uh for the digital world i mean it's kind of stayed constant uh for for the last few decades ever since we've gone computers and internet to be uh to be widespread and mainstream but also until we kind of had a notion of scarcity uh whether that's verifiability or decentralization or anything else we've never been able to actually get the digital version of the same art to explode or actually be equally valuable or considered valuable um so it's actually curious to hear both of your thoughts on obviously nfts is not just art and it's a much bigger realm you hinted about being doused and communities and having much more anywhere from tokenization or fractionalization of these things but how do you think about programmability a programmability in in the digital world like we have smart contracts that can create dynamic pieces we have a lot of way to think about what creativity is um what excites you in sort of that realm tv where you want to start no no i'll let you okay um i think in the broader nft realm i again i think like this framework of thinking about the digital economy is moving from currency to goods to services is something i'm thinking about a lot right now and i i think that uh if you think about goods um having there's just so much that could be tokenized and uh and of course there's the question of like what is the advantage that being tokenized gives so the advantage that tokenizing a piece of art gives to the creator of the art is that they can monetize the art in a different way but they can also bring their community together and as if people have the financial incentives to grow the community the artists will then take off even more um i think that another thing that i get excited about is sort of how do you create productive assets as an fts so for example music rights would be an example there now i'm not saying ak comments legally or uh anything about like security not security but i think that that aside if you think about a music right uh being tokenized combined with fractionalization um you can start to get to actual dividend streams uh and i think that plus some of the things we're seeing with services like uniswap where um event which might eventually come actually create dividends um crypto is then looking like not a speculative you know gambling house but rather it looks like an economy and i think like we are in that transition right now uh to that final state as it happens then i think that the boom and the bus cycles become a little bit less severe and crypto starts to grow in a more predictable way and it gets a lot more interesting very fast um and i think that the the bigger trend that the world is going through right now even outside of crypto is that we're going from a physical world to digital world and covet has accelerated this by like a decade uh and our entire economy is being digital and we're seeing this in sigma all the time um because all of our customers are are these traditional shops that have gone from i create a physical product to like i have to actually figure out what that means in digital world and um i think as as we get more digital it makes sense to have currency and to have an economy that's also digital and nfts will be a critical part of that that was incredibly layered actually i saw like three very distinct layers all based on uh the the aspect of programmability uh correct me if i'm wrong one layer that you described was the experience layer right so what the nft space lacks right now and what a lot of people are trying to build is this consumption stream how do i consume an nfd uh instead of just buying it and acquiring it so that's where the first layer of uh you know programmability comes in that's that's one of the things you solve by uh say creating immersive experiences for instance or 360 degree art or you know monuments like b20 which you go into the second part is to uh of programmability is to be able to transfer or share an experience without having to transfer ownership of an asset just a fancy way of saying uh i should be able to rent or lease my nfp in an effective manner without having to you know transfer ownership of it uh so that's that's sort of uh already uh many experiments around that and the obvious use case is land of course but uh there have been uh other uses too uh which brings us to the third layer of what you spoke about for these two things to happen you need interoperability across uh you know different uh um spheres of experience different metaverses and that's when the actual metaverse sort of happens so you create a consumption stream first and then you create this ownership layer without having to transfer ownership just the experience and then interoperability that connects all of these things together and then the metaverse is fully born i love it it's like yeah i can't wait to get with you more on the metaverse you said it man i just battle-faced it i think what's even more interesting is uh um the way i kind of understood this is these are not explicit distinctions between one or the other all these three are also self-consistent with each of the other layers because you can have this programmability also apply on the sharing um on the uh on the uh the collaboration of it to generate this piece and also on like what it means to make this productive so all these things are also intercompatible and and that's what's exciting because now the surface area of what's possible is is exponentially bigger um so that to me is i think that the most interesting piece because there's over 500 people working on cool things with nfcs and they're going to be looking at applying programming to to create art and and that excites me um so i also want to kind of just have um maybe we want to wrap this up i wish we could go longer because there's so many things that we can dig into and we'll maybe just this is an action item for us to do where we can have a much longer conversation uh in the future but um how do you kind of think about essentially what we need to do to make more artists and creative folks developers get into this this ecosystem uh more any advice though and you've obviously inspired a whole generation of designers uh and and with figma uh tubador and medicoven you've brought this on from the crypto first side and inspired that that created the whole um i would say the industry on how big uh this uh this sector can be um how do you kind of think about getting people in what should they be thinking about if they're looking to get into the space and overall like what can they do if they want to be more involved yeah uh i think there's a few different parts to that so first of all i think like there's an opportunity to create technology that is not as complex as crypto typically is uh there's no reason why it has to be as complex as it is today no reason why when you send a transaction it has to be so scary uh you know um i think that there's huge ux improvements we can make the existing ecosystem that'll help bring people that are not as not as technical into the ecosystem uh i i also think that the the ultimate thing we can do to make it so that more people can experience this is scalability uh when you have it costs fifty dollars to mint and nft or more uh you're gonna limit this to the people that can do that and so i'm excited to see the ethereum community invest so much in later and uh in e2 as well as other way or twos and um yeah i'm really hopeful for for what will end up there nice um um i guess one of the powerful tools in trying to bring people inside and what dylan just described uh is uh more creating a welcome atmosphere once people sort of start looking this way whereas most of the attention we get right now is around the price tag of nfts that get sold typically nothing wrong with that obviously 69 million is a big number it does attract eyeballs but the other thing we thought we could do is to try and tell effective stories right so one of the things we've done right after uh the christie's auction while we were trying to process all of it is to announce this grant of five hundred thousand dollars hundred thousand for uh one storyteller can be a writer a videographer a filmmaker whatever your medium is split over twelve months stipends there are amazing stories in the metaverse like karthik just described 500 people working on uh incredibly diverse things to build in the metagross so those stories need to be told and i think those can be powerful magnets for uh you know technical people who will want to become part of those stories to build and also to uh right-brained uh idiots like me who who just look at bright blinking colors and are attracted and come to this space and we need a bit of both right so i think telling these stories uh effectively and uh with a conscience uh will will make a lot of difference in trying to bring people as well that's uh it's well put i think uh just for everybody listening on this and we'll actually uh we'll make sure we uh advertise this on on the event discord too but matter first not fun um just announced uh the fellowship where they're going to be giving a hundred thousand dollars to five uh folks and uh and talk in demonstrating their stories and how they can actually make this space a lot bigger and more inspiring so um that's a really good i think that's a really good way to name this um what we'll do is uh i mean i the best thing about like we've been doing events for for years that the best thing that kind of gets me excited every time is that i know who's participating but i don't know what's going to come out of it and i won't know until everybody else at that same time so 48 hours from now is when we see exactly what comes out and it's going to blow our minds uh three years ago when we started 8th global uh we saw the birth of cryptokitties and uh and if i kind of think about sort of summarizing what's happened in the past a developer hackathon from 2017 and now we're doing an event entirely on an industry that came out of a project from that event is to me a really good way to talk about and think about what it means when new industries get popped up through the benefit of technology so um i am super excited to see what comes out of it we'll be sure to tell both of you what also came out of this event and uh hopefully we'll get you a lot more involved in the future events so with that dylan tubador thank you so much for giving us your time today and uh thank you carter thank you thanks dylan can't wait to see this event amazing thanks bye we are ready to move on to our next talk so we talked about what the value of entities is and uh what i really want to do is transition into how do we think about what is entities as a from a really lower level side of it there there's ways to think about it from what's possible in the realm of uh entities and just in general like how do we think about the definition of what they are in this common interpretations of this thing so i want to talk uh with linda jesse and marguerite about what it means for entities after this and uh without further ado let's welcome all three of them to chat so thank you so much for joining us uh this might be a slightly tough act to follow uh after tubador just talking about making history in the last two weeks um but what gets me a lot more excited is is uh three of you get to see uh what's happening at the very surface level uh in this ecosystem uh whether that's from the founders side whether it's from the creativity side or from the investor side and i think this is a really great mix of perspectives that we have here so what i want to do is start us off by just having each of you introduce yourself um and we can start with linda which tell us about who you are and what you do uh and how you got into the space hi i'm linda i started a crypto fund called scalar capital we invest in all kinds of different things in crypto um i previously was at coinbase did a bunch of different roles there and what got me really interested in nfts in particular i came in through the gaming side since i just play a lot of video games myself and i often buy like skins or just video game items and when i stop playing them like all my items are just trapped in this game and like i can't do anything with them anymore going forward so i just have like a ton of hearthstone cars that i just like never see again so i'm just really excited the idea of having nfts just in on the gaming side just be able to like move these in-game assets very freely and so that's kind of how i came into that world and then it's been awesome to see it just flourish into so many interesting things uh so yeah high-level description of me amazing margaret bb you'd like to tell us about beyond just freaking blockade hi guys um i've been a creative technologist in this space since like 2013 um my entry into this world was through like mining script coins with my gaming gpus so um and from there just started to fall down the rabbit hole of how can we be creative with the blockchain and blockchain technology um started out doing crypto puzzles and um multimedia experiences across the internet and using different pieces of blockchain technology as experiences for people that led to me founding blockade games in early like january 2018 where we focus on nfts as being um a tool for the gaming experience and so that's kind of where we've been focusing and when we talk about what are all the potential use cases of nfts that's something that we think deeply about amazing um hi i'm jesse i'm the founder of variant which is a investment firm um and i i first got started in the space as a as a founder in 2014 um project was called media chain and i think a lot of the ideas around nfts are ideas that we were sort of exploring back then about seven years too early but our goal was to like build what we described as a universal media library where all the world's images video songs game assets etc could all be discoverable in a public ledger in the same way you know bitcoin is is discoverable and attributable to its owner um so got into the space through that and have been you know really really excited to see um all these ideas coming to fruition now excellent so um i was hoping that you would bring up media change so i didn't have to ask specifically but um it's interesting because you pointed out the timing thing and and i think what's been interesting is that we've finally gone to the place where the infrastructure side is getting more and more ready so that people don't have to worry about what's happening behind the scenes and they only have to think about does this click with me as an idea or as a concept and then we've seen an explosion of that in the past two months uh for lack of a better uh condensation of that or but uh what i kind of really want to get into is um there are obviously a few ways to think about what entities are and i think that public perception witnesses um are or can be is slightly different because it's not as as updated on what we think i guess where this space is moving forward so maybe a broad question when i asked and this is for anybody here is how do you think about just creativity in the digital world like do we need to change what the definition of art is right now nfts are sort of analogous to just thinking about digital paintings but that's not that's not it so what changes when uh we look at digital art okay i can take a stab so i mean yeah i think like well i think what you're referring to is like there's this like sort of classical notion of what you know what is or isn't art which is which is also like a funny def like thing to define because i think the art world itself is always trying to wrestle with this and always trying to push the boundaries but when you when like nfts start to call themselves art the art world is somehow a lot of people in our world are somehow trying to argue that no that's that's impossible like that can't be that stuff can't be art um so like the art world's always wrestled with this like duchamp's um you know famous urinal was like a statement about what can and can't be art and and we're always pushing the bounds of that and i think um i think that that you know certainly nfts are um are making the internet and internet culture into collectible culture and then i think it's like in the what is art is really just in the eye of the beholder it's like i don't think it can be defined um universally yeah i completely agree with that and then um at the same time like i think the stuff that's exciting happening crypto is the idea of um groups of people from all over the world can form these organizations and collectively create art together it doesn't have to be a single artist they can collectively own art as well together so um that part really excites me and um it just the idea of like programmable art just is is really fascinating to me and i think that that's a design space that is going to be explored a lot within the next year or so um and so it just feels like more collaborative and dynamic but i feel like you can't really define what art is because it's whatever people value it themselves i so i have to agree with the program like programmable art because i think um one thing so as a fine artist myself you know i have a fine art degree i was a gallery director and curator prior to really going into the blockchain space um but i really have like it's okay if you're just experimenting and you're a digital artist and you want to maybe make your first nfts but i think the conversation then beyond that is you really need to start thinking about how is this nft experience bringing value to your art and if you can't really participate in that conversation then i i think you're going to have a hard time keeping up with what is going to be considered valuable nft art because these people like i think we saw pack said recently he's i'm going to be on a sotheby's auction he's does a really good job about bridging generative art or what's possible with nfts and blurring the line between the two so that the experiences is deeper than just uploading a file and you know pushing a button so um it allows it opens up an opportunity for artists and especially digital artists to show a whole new level of genius that should be a part of the conversation that's uh i absolutely agree and i know it was it was less about let's kind of question or it was more of a philosophical kind of scenes added and that is actually true what it is and uh yeah like it's one of those things where we're getting to a much bigger surface area of like what can be considered art and how somebody can be exposed to thinking about and deciding how to evaluate or appreciate it and it kind of brings me up to uh about 15 years ago when uh when wordpress became um the dominant platform on the open source side and if you would ever look at wordpress's uh code base uh they had this line on every single file and uh the line was code as poetry and uh and that's kind of what got the whole economy of wordpress plugin started and that sort of is what the developers valued as an interesting perspective i think we're seeing that on a lot more ways where now we're looking at visual with with uh the the binary bits so um what i want to kind of ask is i mean a lot of things just came up from it from each of these answers and kind of just prefaces a bunch of topics i want to dig into but maybe for uh for marguerite tell us about what neon district is and and kind of how you think about this as a game as a matter of horse what kind of are you doing with the game and how do you think about the future of the game so many so many things i could say um so from my different experiences that i had developed developed as a puzzle designer um which were essentially they they got to the place that we were essentially making mini games to the point where i don't know if you guys remember pineapple arcade it actually had a bunch of memed games that were blockchain themed and they were games um in arcade consoles or cabinets so um the the vision for neon district was how do we come up with an open economy where you can have a free to play gaming model where you can have a play to earn mechanic through the gameplay that can be inclusive to people that possibly do not have crypto as a mission to put nfts into as many people's hands as possible with as little friction as possible with as little blockchain knowledge as possible um that was the mission and and so we shipped uh the public alpha uh january and we've been working on this game for about three months so we have years of art content and story and the game design itself i think went through multiple iterations but it was a design in process for about 1.5 years so um what i can say though is that we were successful in what we aim to do as we have people now competing for the top position on the leaderboard who have never spent a dollar on the game um and and that to me is very exciting and then also gas fees are handled on the back end we're on a layer two so um players really do have a free to play gaming experience and soon open c is going to be rolling out the polygon matic support so we'll have the same sort of um market experience that all these other dots have but the other side of it is that this game is open to the entire world if you as long as you have access to a web browser um i love that nfts can be a tool that allow people to leverage their talent and skill uh to participate in what will be the new global economy and um i think we will see more gap developers explore that space i absolutely agree i think uh this is kind of like the high level theme of how do we actually now make the assets that we do unproductive and that sort of sets up the base for if i'm learning something in the game i want to figure out what i can do with it whether that's combining with other games because if it's an open platform or or using that to leverage um existing game mechanics or just in general integrate that with outside world that i may just be outside of the game itself and uh and this is kind of where i think that's a really good piece for us to kind of transition into just thinking about what entities mean outside of art so linda you kind of talked about i think include things on programmability and generated art and assets um i'm curious to kind of just hear from linda person and firm from jesse and artery what are some creative things you've seen with nfts outside of our um any kind of favor or examples that you can talk about yeah um so there's a lot of stuff happening um so there's just been a lot of projects working on fractionalized ownership which i think is really powerful allowing people to now have access to these really valuable pieces of art or it could be like very expensive gaming items that now everyone can like own pieces of so there's like niftex faction.art working on that i also think what's really cool is the idea of being able to use your nft as collateral in d5 so being able to take out a loan like let's say it represents some really valuable art or real estate or even like social capital like you could stake someone else's time or someone else's like community and be like hey like i own a bunch of this and now like can i take out a virtual mortgage or something um so there's a lot of like cool stuff happening there and um i think uh yeah nft5 is a is a project that's working on using as collateral i'm just what's happening in like programmable nfts uh i think yeah i think something that i'd like to see happen is just um like the idea of like artwork changing as time progresses i think that would be really awesome to see not just having static art but um being able to like somehow prove like ownership and visually display like how early you were in something and um and not have that be like you could just buy that and then display it um like later on so i think there's like a lot of cool stuff you can play around there um and then i also um there there was uh so kathleen breitman she was also working on uh nft stuff really early on and she was talking about the idea of like the importance of having ownership of in-game items and having the history behind that item be really valuable so an example is like let's say you're playing the game magic and you win a tournament with this deck of cards and now you have these cards that have won this tournament and therefore these cards themselves even though they might be the same as the mother card they can be more valuable just because they won a tournament so there's a lot of really cool stuff happening and i could go on forever about that stuff yeah yeah maybe just a riff on on this last point about the deck of cards and like it's history i think um one one sort of interesting idea space is just the fact that the thought that every piece of media on the internet is gonna have its entire history be discoverable um on chain right and like that's kind of a new a new thing because you know with with traditional media like a jpeg file when you copy and paste a jpeg from like instagram to tumblr it loses its entire history like you don't know who made it what it's about like you have to go reverse image search and you then it's like really noisy to figure out where it's been and so i think that the one one way i like to think about this is like media on the internet has largely been sort of like this flat two-dimensional surface it's just whatever we can sort of see right in front of us and trying to find where it came from is is really hard but now every piece of media is gonna have this like z-axis that we can traverse and like figure out like you know who interacted with it what it's about and that's so i haven't seen a whole lot of like people experimenting with that yet and that's because we're still early and the history is not that rich but i think it's one of the most exciting things to explore with nfts because it's net new enabled by the blockchains that these live on and maybe just one one other idea offer up is um so there's there's this project called mirror which is letting people mint essays as nfts um and and that's kind of it's interesting because it's not visual right it's like why would you want to own i think the idea of owning like a you know piece of visual art is very intuitive for people because it maps to the idea of a painting also owning like a game asset is intuitive to people because they that that's like a common commonly understood thing from traditional games but then like why would you want to own an essay and i i think the answer there is like well essays are how like big ideas come into the world right so like what if what if like elon musk's next secret master plan that you know he published for tesla was published as an nft um that would be like a really cool artifact to own right so i think that's the base case but i can imagine like you know jack he just recently sold his first tweet as an nft i can imagine like the next jack the next person who's gonna build something as big as twitter you know publishes their their hello world moment for their platform as an nft from inception and that's actually how they fundraise for the project that they're building like so you know that that and when you think about what is like you know what how would you do that well maybe you do it through a blog post or an essay right so maybe that maybe that's actually what mirror is doing is they're you're they're selling nfts for essays but they're really starting like companies right like they're that are our projects um so it could go very far so say uh yeah go for it yeah i have a so i have a lot of ideas about um nfts to enable deeper experiences um i think something worth like i was just thinking about this morning um so rolham with dapper labs and that team did a really good job with this concept of moments and basic basically you're taking a piece of time or an event from a a celebrity or you know a player's their sports history and turning it into a moment is really an idea that can be applied to anything that is consumable content like entertainment content um from let's if you think about a famous director a movie like a series of movies um there's just basically anything can be turned into a moment and in that same line of like the essays when you buy an essay it's like buying a moment of of thought um so i'm wondering if there's gonna be a whole like as we see drops as a service if we're going to see people start to do like moments as a service for different people like uh something hits a certain engagement criteria and all of a sudden like in the same way with tweets like oh maybe i should buy this tweet you could so that's really interesting about where we're placing value there's a heavy emphasis on story which actually has me thinking about things like our virtual influencers and how we're going to be blending the two worlds between physical and digital um if you're familiar with i was telling the other day to linda about i um the code miko she is so incredible with what she does with her virtual skins that she produces and then does live streams she change them in real time she like i just saw her take out a flaming blade in the middle of one of her streams and and she has multiple camera points it's very engaging and then the audience can be typing and she'll you'll see their words going across her chest um and so like how is that monetized is she monetizing that um i'm really curious about all the different use cases there nfts directly have a fit for um and then additionally that idea scaling it to event-based experiences so tokenized like you could have tokenized like a swag from your favorite musical artist go to a concert and maybe even the musician has like tokenized it's basically a cold storage device that has an nft in it with bluetooth and location tracking and then now we all have an augmented reality like phone where we can be interacting with each other and who has it we can receive airdrops on location from the different vendors and artists moments of the performance are now being dropped into my my wallet that's with me um these kinds of game effect gamified experiences won't also like extend that further let's say i own skins like of the performance so like i could change the backdrop that the artist has and you see the big what's being displayed and and i've changed their environment maybe i've introduced a monster on stage you can you can that can give both like musical production all the way to improv theater and what that now your actors have to change what they're doing based on what the audience is putting in their hands um these i definitely think in the next five to ten years we're gonna see this prototyping and i say that because i'm going to do it that's amazing um it's an interesting topic though because i think you're talking about basically having a whole set of um tools and accessories uh to engage with your existing audience and sort of what's interesting to me here is that um jesse you're your client's thesis is on the ownership economy um obviously there's a lot of things in that category but um we're curious to kind of hear more about what does ownership economy mean to you and sort of how do you think nfcs just kind of overlaps with uh with that and where things are headed from your perspective yeah sure so i guess yeah the the ownership economy idea is that um crypto has sort of like unlocked this new economic model for building networks that are operated and owned by their users um so so like this is sort of the lens through which i look at all of crypto like bitcoin and ethereum i think are the first early examples of networks where there's you know there's no multi-billion dollar networks there's no company um their their networks that were built by a community of independent developers who then operate you know run run the software on their computers and mine the networks and in return for their contributions earned an ownership stake in the network through a token and um that the the idea is that that same economic model is is going to find its way into every piece of consumer software on the internet and we're sort of starting to see that happen in in d5 and i think nfts are sort of another example where nfts you know make the whole internet ownable right it's not just the platforms but it's actually the media itself and and um when when you think about that i think it has pretty profound um implications in that it sort of like in inverts um the way social media platforms work today where you know like when you upload a file to facebook or instagram or whatever you're you're copy pasting the file to their server and you also copy paste ownership of the media to them in that you sign the terms of service that allow them to monetize that however they see fit um and and so effectively like you're just giving away the ownership whereas nfts allow you to retain that ownership and for anyone to discover that it's yours in the same way you know your bitcoin is yours which is you know verifiably the case without depending on any third-party platform um so so nfts really invert the ownership model of media on the internet and i think it's a it's an important or sort of like formative inflection point for a lot of people um who are new to the space because it's a very easy way to understand oh i can actually own digital property that's truly mine and i think it's only one hop to go from there to the idea well i can actually own a piece of all the internet products and services i use every day which is something you know people in the ethereum community understand very well because that's what's at the core of the success of you know networks like ethereum and bitcoin um so that that's the ownership economy in a nutshell and i think nfts are really exciting like accelerant for the idea that's amazing um i forgot to mention this a bit early but um we're getting a lot of nodding heads uh so to speak on on our chat so if you have any questions as the audience you want to ask want me to ask our panelists please just type them up in the chat and i'll relay those questions uh here directly so i should have mentioned this a lot earlier but we're happy to take any questions as well as we're going through this um i think jesse what you talked about makes a pretty good or kind of sets up a pretty good base for like how people should think about as individuals but obviously if you were to kind of extrapolate from that there's a condensate or there's a way to kind of generalize that and think about communities at scale and this is where i want to ask linda about dallas you recently wrote a blog post about uh what dolls are in the future of dials and how they're interacting with a lot of different parts of our ecosystem whether that's steep high or mts um for for those in the audience i would love for you to just kind of go over a little bit about what dials are and uh how are you seeing creative use cases of daos uh whether it's nfts or dfi or just what you would even like to see yeah um i i do feel like dao is our natural progression of what's happening in crypto and so that was just basically a group of people where you're there's no central management telling what everyone what to do like in a traditional corporation and they organize themselves around a set of rules that are completely transparent and enforced on on a blockchain and um like if you have funds managed by the dow it's all via smart contracts and you can see where funds are moving to and from so it just makes things a lot more transparent and accessible um and i think um just with thousand nfts there's there's like the first progression i think is is um you're seeing dows themselves invest in nfts so you're seeing like a flamingo dao investing directly in nft art and owning that you're seeing like a yield guild games uh own like virtual land and the games they're playing and then like actually building it up like virtual real estate so i think that's like the the start and and um i love the idea of people collectively owning this and i think what's cool about dao's is you can be completely anonymous too like you couldn't join a company a traditional company in silicon valley and just be like anonymous and like never reveal your identity but like you can join a doubt like no one knows who you are and as long as you like build up a reputation and you actually contribute like everyone treats you just as any other member and i i love that piece to it and um and so i think we're gonna maybe have uh the concept of like dao's issuing nfts to their members to have like badges or identity or reputation that they can have tied to their address and maybe that could even carry on to like other places like hey i'm a really high profile um reputation in this now and like i think i can contribute a lot here but no one knows who i am except for my reputation so i think there's like a lot of cool things with nft issuance and then um i also just really want to see like collective art created by dao so people being able to vote on parameters of art and just create art as a group and have it be constantly changing i was like i was part of a dao that was kind of working on something similar to that it was called saint fame dao and like you would vote on um like what the designs were for uh these clothing items and like everyone would be like voting on different um aspects to it and then the dow itself would produce and sell this so i think it's like really cool you could uh create like digital and physical items here um and meta factory is an example of a dao that's kind of bringing together this culture and then actually making clothing items people can wear so i think there's like so much interesting stuff happening in the dow space and we're just at the start of experimenting with that yeah i feel like if i were to ask you follow questions we'll end up using the whole chat for just uh exploring the possibilities so maybe maybe the action diameter is for all the hackers watching the twitch plays mona lisa uh for for the soccer ball and uh and we'll uh we'll see what comes out of data in the scale um i think the ownership economy the the taos in general and kind of how they're letting communities operate um is up with the natural progression of how do we get more people involved i think what's another interesting piece here is uh we're seeing personal social tokens also are thrived and uh margarita you have a personal token uh called coin and uh for her audience i would love to uh for you to get an overview of what these personal social tokens are how do you think about them uh why you decided to to uh create one and uh and sort of uh what it means to you and what others should be excited about in this space yeah um so i used coin so coin touches on a few things that we've been talking about here um i took an nft and i said this kind of represents me and like myself as a creator um put some story to that nft and then i started it over with niftex um so now it's been charted into erc20 tokens uh we set up i did a sale to fund the uniswap pool i did a sale of making nfts that were accessed to a crypto puzzle so you had to own the nft and then it acted like token controlled access in order to be able to solve the puzzle um and the nft itself the artwork actually was the starting point for the puzzle um the winners actually got together and like they someone who had that nft they pulled them into their group and then shared the prize with everybody um but anyways so the story like my community has been around from just the crypto puzzle journey i've taken since you know 2014 um and it was easy for me to have a creator token because of having an existing community i think people like you have to kind of have that first otherwise it's just trying to grow a community out of just pure value of a token is kind of backwards you need to already have something valuable that people are like um invested in on an emotional level i believe um i think to be more successful but for us like when i launched blockhead games i we don't have an erc20 token for blockade um i had always participated in the um the open software development world starting with bitcoin and i missed having that community where everyone got to participate in some degree of um building and then and then people like being paid in some sort of a token even if it's just a tip like there's just it's a fun um experience so when i launched coin i was very clear that this should be viewed as play money um it is an experiment and so donut don't come to knocking out my door expecting one moon um but it's it's done surprisingly well actually um and the better it does the more opportunity we have to turn around to our community and basically support developers who are trying to do something creative that kind of fits right now to our ecosystem we can put allocations towards those funds so it's a it's a really healthy feedback loop um we surprisingly have done a pretty good job not having a lot of the toxic like erc 20 token holder conversations in our discord i think that's another reason of having a very strong community where you already have moderators that are not even paid that drive how the conversation is going to go um so like blocked games does accept coin in in-game so that's another path and then also there's ways like we reward these types of people like if it's a whole nother level of having a committed user essentially and we can target so for example the game neon district can read ethereum wallets matic wallets and custodial wallets and then populate thing experiences in the game based on your asset holdings which include coin and also the reward token cred that you get when you are liquidity miner for coin so we can allow people to essentially farm the the database token which is um neon uh it's non-transferable and you use neon to funnel into your nft development so there's ways around on the fringe of the ecosystem that we add value but the whole idea there is that coin um so it's coins eden which is a syndicate within the neon district universe and lore we already have someone else in our community spinning up their own creator token who's a famous hacker his name is zayat and he's head of security at blizzard he uh is one of the top 20 like bug bounty hunters and so with his token he's doing token controlled access in his discord where you can get really close and the inside look at when as he goes and breaks things like breaks apple how did he do that and even maybe before he uh files his bug report you can see like what's going on and his actual work which i think is so fascinating i think these guys really undersell he's like no people don't really think this is so cool and i'm like no this is so cool so anyways in the neon district universe zaya is now going to have his hacker den and his community that he's he does have a following because he's a talent himself and we can build up that lore around himself as well and his game characters um and he has this token that we can also he can have his own micro economy within the new young district universe we could accept it at blockade games um to funnel into their their cooperative efforts they they act as a team they go and take down other teams on the leaderboard as a group so anyways that's i get really excited about tokens as tools and communities especially when it's coming from a good place and in a sincere place that's so cool this actually is a pretty good uh time for me to ask you there's a question from the audience that came in and uh people were curious about hearing uh uh what kind of uh websites or applications you know right now that sort of let you experience uh the metaverse like the way you would do it in snow crash or declare one um other than obviously in the union district we just talked about uh do you know any other uh attempts at this right now that people can check out and you do yeah you can check out crypto voxels people have art galleries in it and you don't you don't need a vr headset or anything for it although you could use it um and you just enter into different like lan parcels in the game and people have social events there concerts you can check out people's like nft art hanging in the galleries and there's also uh decentraland as well so um yeah the completely vibrant communities happening in these worlds amazing i think there's also a decentral land or for those of you interested to check out the world there that's awesome so i think one other kind of thing here is that what's sort of just the way you can apply and compose these tools in ways to kind of merge uh anywhere from art to dpi to transactions it sets up a whole new world for setting up new and unique business models i'm curious to kind of hear from jesse and linda first like have you seen any new interesting business models for for how either entities or gals or just these communities are thinking about monetizing or what changes from a traditional sort of definition of like what we think about business models so revenue well yeah it's interesting i guess like the the the business model of nfts is is not um like new right like it's like you're selling people your stuff and that's like that that's kind of like a well and just like an artist sells their work um game game developers so you know in-game assets so i think like the business model is well understood and you could say it's like it's a micro transaction model like you you know you buy stuff when you want it um but i think there yeah there's a lot of interesting like potential um because all these assets are programmable so you know one early example is like you can bake in royalties to an nft so that the creator is able to like benefit when from from revenue when it's resold um and that's kind of like that revenue stream is like a net new business model for creators um and so that's kind of interesting and then like linda touched on earlier like the idea that you can like fractionalize ownership of these nfts and then and then give it away to your audience and or or like sell pieces of it right like these are just kind of different different ways to monetize the work um which are interesting um but yeah i guess i i think the one important thing that i touched on earlier that maybe i can come back to here is like um i think the the business model of like social media platforms where we enter where we like engage with and consume media online is is gonna have to change because you know a lot of it has been ad driven in the past um and and now um you know there's this kind of like growing market economy around nfps that's happening and so i think like developers that lean into that and sort of like build on top of what is now emerging as this universal open programmable media library um have this opportunity like step into the flow of value that people are transacting in that marketplace and that might you know look completely different than an ad based model yeah i i agree i i don't feel like they're like brand new models but there is it is like new ways of thinking about things like for example um jesse talked about like mirror and just uh like essay tokens and ownership over these pieces like that actually historically hadn't been something i thought about um like this is actually something that i would want to own a piece of and thinking through like what is essay token enable and i think there's going to be so much more developed along like what these tokens can represent and what it allows you to be part of so i'm pretty excited by that and then i think one area that um like uh i've i've been really interested in seeing more of is um just the idea of so like a very common business model just in traditional world is like selling advertising space on on your website or um on google having ads or something and um i think it'd be really cool to just have like these tokenized advertising space and like virtual real estate and so like having people just be able to like buy your advertising spot as an nft really early on if they think their website's going to get popular and then being able to like bake in royalties into that advertising space as people can now trade this freely so like that the idea has been around for a while um but i haven't really seen that many people work on it so i'm excited to see that as like a maybe promising business model in the future i thought that's a cool hack of an idea too for for those of you looking for ideas still um it's actually kind of true because uh maybe i could have phrased it better it's not really a new business model just more about unlocking new ways to to sort of earn or sort of generate we would say revenue in this case and we've seen creative things like i mean now looking at something like ens domains uh en esta means our erc 721 tokens you are able to physically transfer ownership of domains which is slightly different than uh how we think about purchasing domains in kind of the current world um you have things like people auctioning their time we saw reuben one of our kind of common friends uh giving out legal advice for all their token holders as an experiment as a lawyer and uh and uh that's a whole new way to think about prioritizing or being able to book a meeting because you owned the social token um and i think just i think the mirror example is probably the best thing here that you talked about which is unlocking thought and that's a super unique sort of thing that we know that we've been able to express on the internet we've been able to replicate and copy it infinitely but i've never been able to think about valuing it um in in sort of this crypto first i guess way so that to me is super exciting and i feel like i'm now jealous that i don't need to compete on the hackathon this weekend because i want to try some of these things but uh this is so cool um uh we'll see if there's any more questions coming in uh but ahead of time um uh so like the advertising space i've been telling the openc team for a while they need to have that banner position at the top where you can compete to get your collection or nft position there um like as an nft use case and then like people could yes being able to monetize that and buy it by the advertisement i think is really neat and i like the idea of then for example in universe in neon district having a billboard and the billboard could have you know just roll through nfts that people have put on a list um whitelisted and then it could be about events an event in crypto voxels dance party um but you can the other thing i like about it is you could buy it like just by clicking it and it could go into your wallet um yeah and i said those kinds of systems i think are neat um so i recently did a pitch deck where i made a list of um accredited investors and found who they were on like through openc and other means like for example mr beast when he bought a punk i knew like okay i got his address um and then i airdropped these pitch decks which were um unlockable so you had the cover but unless you owned the nft then owning it you could have access to the deck currently it was just a link but the idea that um i think soon openc will support where and i think wearable has unlockable content too but you can upload the actual pdf too so it could all be like one experience um i'm really excited about like unlockable content as a just as a tool and mechanism it you could launch so many businesses just on that model i totally agree it's a pretty big space because people definitely are always curious for mystery boxes um it's it's a natural instinct no this is great um so maybe what i'll do is i think we should we should end this here and then kind of wrap up uh with some kind of final thoughts uh there's a a a great setup kind of panelist here they're investors gamers founders uh you have really diverse backgrounds that kind of got you through where you are now and uh what i want to do is kind of end off with uh with a question for each of you and we'll start with uh margarite for people who are trying to get into this space whether that's kind of creative folks want to learn about this or founders and we're trying to start something um in this ecosystem given the advice they want to give them um and kind of how should they be thinking about what they should focus on with what matters and what they should be looking at in terms of what the possibilities are what what are interesting things to to kind of dig into um what kind of so i want to just have each of you answer that and we'll wrap up this panel today i think um something i've been thinking about is the dichotomy of people with a big brand wanting to come in and participate um and make their nfts but then like so then you have what almost feels like a cash grab that happens um i think it would be better if people with large brands and they are just get ramping up to almost go through the steps anonymously um make a collection don't associate it with your brand kind of look around spend time and seeing what is sustainable models that other people are doing other creatives how do they plan to support these nfts that they're minting because i think you actually have a lot of responsibility as someone with a big following or a brand to make sure you're being thoughtful even though there's money on the table potentially doesn't really negate that you should be you should be thoughtful in how you're going to introduce these economic tools into your community yeah so i guess my advice for founders is to be persistent um which you know so having having like been thinking about this stuff for a long time it's i think like in hindsight it's easy to see like it all it's all happening now and then i guess the important thing to keep in mind is you know we're definitely in some kind of like hype cycle for for nfts right now where like you know the whole world is excited about them and that excitement will will like wax and win in the short term but in the long term like this technology is not going anywhere and all the things we're talking about on this panel are going to happen so yeah my advice is like be persistent there's going to be a sort of like hype cycle correction and that's normal it happens it's happening in crypto it happens in all markets um but just keep going and and you know if you're in a position where you can get to the other side um you'll you'll you know you'll be poised to succeed when the next hype cycle comes and you know that that'll carry you all the way through to adoption i think um i think my advice um especially for nfts or anything that involves like having a community or having to engage with the community i think what works really well i mean not not always the case but generally i've seen work really well is building in public and being really collaborative with people early on and not just building in a complete vacuum like people in the space are really welcoming very open to feedback and helpful with each other so um like i feel like we talked about mirror a lot but mirror in particular i think did an excellent job at building in public um having their like launches and testing like just live streamed and really people could see the uh the kinks that needed to be fixed and and um would just kind of iterate from there and i really like that they're now having like very public displays of um like community building early on by having like like people voting in who are gonna be the next writer so i just think like building in public um can can really benefit you in just starting that like community building early on i think that's a wonderful note to end on and uh and uh to kind of sum it up i think uh that's primarily why i also need global exist we want you to succeed in this space and want to be there to help you unblock uh wherever you're stuck or need help with so um and this is a really good advice for people 550 plus people who are going to be diving into or building something cool in in the world of nfts uh over the next two days and with that i want to thank all three of you for being with us today and sharing some of your amazing thoughts uh there will be some more questions that we'll get and i will just send them your way directly and we'll be sure to kind of connect you with anybody who uh definitely wants to uh to talk with you so thanks again and uh we are yeah we're super great what's happening this one thanks yeah thanks everybody bye bye bye guys so with that we are a little bit ahead of schedule and uh what we'll be doing is we're going to be taking a quick 10 minute break uh before we move on to our next panel and that is an amazing lineup that i am super excited about we're going to have natasha bobby hundreds rac and mike schneider talk about ethereum being for artists so we'll take a quick 10 minute break stay on the chat stay on this video enjoy the radio in the meantime and uh we'll talk to you in 10 minutes check check hello hello hi how are you good how are you good hi oh my god bobby hundreds oh my god it's michael shinoda ms what's up bobby what's up everybody how's it going hey latasha how are you doing good good good oh my god it's that rac raku rack right that's rock rock are we live right now but i think this works even better so let's just jump right in we've already adjusted to this environment and uh without further ado let's talk about how hearing is for artists and how this ecosystem is can't do so rc uh has graciously accepted to moderate this chat uh it's not really a panel it's more of a conversation and a hangout with all of you here so i'll get out of your way and now we'll spend the next 45 to 60 minutes just talking about what has been exciting in this place so yeah we'll take it away well thank you um so i got asked to moderate this about two minutes ago so i'll do my best uh if uh if you guys can help me out here i would greatly appreciate that but but no i mean i think there's there's obviously like a lot to talk about here um i think we all kind of see the potential um in ethereum and blockchain and nfts and all the fun stuff that we've been sort of you know hearing about for the past like month and a half um but i think maybe pretty typically i think we maybe should just do some quick intros maybe just brief bio um uh well i think you just nominated yourself so uh i'm mike i um [Music] was i started a band called linkin park i had a side project called fort minor i actually grew up playing piano and um i uh thought i was gonna be a graphic designer and or illustrator um like a visual artist and then the music thing just took off um been into crypto for a few years been into nfts um like not super early i feel like i was like kind of being becoming aware of it on the earlier side of when everybody else became aware of it certainly later than uh andre for example um who was like one of the first people i contacted and i was like okay tell me about this what's going on here um and the community has been super um welcoming i think i think we should talk about that too but um yeah i've got a few uh nft uh projects lined up for the future that i have not announced but the one that that people do generally know about is i have a new single called happy endings which i debuted uh as an nft it was the first major label uh song debut with uh an nft natasha do you want you want to go next what's up guys my name is latasha um i'm from brooklyn new york but now i live in l.a i am a singer-songwriter rapper producer and artist um just all around kind of creative i love to just do all types of  that i want to do so um got into nft about a month ago honestly um my boyfriend actually put me on he's been doing it for like almost three months now and um got into it in a month but it like just went really quickly i've already sold like 26 nfts in um about like three weeks which is crazy and um just been really grateful about the especially the community has been so amazing um along with the fact that i make music but i also make like these visual pieces with the music and um i'm just so happy because the music industry has been a place that i've tackled with for a while and um just it's nice to have a new space for my work and you know allow myself to be multifaceted and stuff so yeah that's me 26 nfts is impressive thank you that's actually amazing i'm hoping today is 27 because i just dropped another one so let's see what happens [Laughter] i mean i don't know many people who have who've been able to to do something like that's a lot and for it to work yeah it just it just kept happening where like one one dropped and then it sold and then the next i was like all right let's keep going let's let's see what happens and in three weeks i was like oh my god i'm up to like 26 nft is gone this is nuts so how did you i know i need to introduce myself but before i get there i'm i'm just because i'm so curious about you and and your work how did you how did you build traction with your audience did your endemic audience already understand nfts that seems to be one of the hurdles with my community is that i it takes a lot of education we're all still learning but you know so but for you what was it yeah so my honestly my community is all like they know hip-hop and that's all they know so like it wasn't about the community it was really like i think the black crypto community was really supportive as soon as i got into the the scene and was just pushing my art and just buying like collections like very quickly and so it was just beautiful and then zora was also really supportive like out of the gate um they just like really was like yo we love what you're doing just keep going they minted my first piece for me and it was just like oh just a lot of love out of the gate and i'm just so grateful for it because i was like i don't know what the hell is going on but let's let's get it going um but yeah and um you know i i talk a lot on twitter people know like i'm always like you know bigging up black women on twitter and just pushing black women crypto so like everybody's like word i'm about to buy everything what tash is talking about so it's just been it's been really dope in that scene so i'm really grateful for that i love it i love that that also pushes against the this narrative constantly that crypto and nfts are just about these white male you know whales we gonna get there bobby we're gonna get there because we got a lot to talk about that too we do i i know i haven't even introduced myself yeah i'm watching i'm bobby hundreds i have a i'm here in la i have a brand uh streetwear brand it's almost a couple decades old at this point called the hundreds um i do a lot of stuff i write i draw you know i grew up like the same way as mike i thought i was going to be an illustrator cartoonist i loved reading garfield and calvin hobbs and so i thought that's what i was going to do because i like drawing cartoons and then i ended up actually kind of doing that i just do it on clothes i got into nfts in december through trevor everybody knows trevor somehow uh he had tweeted something it was probably around that people auction at the time which was like kind of the first wave and i was like what is this and you know he radicalized me and then he connected me with d and zora and then d indoctrinated me and then i was fully in and uh spent the first month being entirely confused i'm still more confused than ever the more i learned and um in the middle of january i started having some breakthroughs with it understanding you know wrapping my brain around it i wrote an essay which a lot of people shared it was it was great that just explaining what i'd learned and onboarding a lot of people and then um it just started going from there and february was crazy it hasn't stopped you know not a day goes by where i don't get 30 to 40 texts or dm sayings can you explain an nft like what does fungible mean and i'm like i don't know i i love this thing that you did where you told me about uh you got so many requests that you set up like a weekly zoom call just like all right just show up at 12 30 on tuesday and i'll explain it to all of you i'm an but it still happens all day right like everyone's can you explain it and the same conversation so i just say hey tuesday mornings 11 a.m pst here's a zoom just come in and out ask your question other people will be able to help you along with me and that latosha i think that goes back to your point about how so much of this is really about community right the people who seem to be the most successful the reason why people's like that is he's built a community over the years like people love him it's not like he's just some random artist exactly and bobby i totally big you up for the zoom because i'm thinking about doing the same because it's been really nuts just trying to like explain via text like what this is it's just like nah and i've been telling everybody i'm about to just teach a course whatever let's let's just do this i never want to teach a course but this might be the next thing all right i've i've gotten so many texts that are just like hey do you have about two hours of your time that uh you know i could take to like that take so you can explain all this to me i'm like i mean i i get it like but i totally understand it because it is a lot to take in right it's it's a pretty broad topic i mean crypto alone without even getting into nfts is like already like you know a mountain to climb uh so once you get into the nft world it's like a whole other side of it that i think it's not only just a technological thing but it's also sort of like a social thing and and and it's kind of like a movement in its own right so it it's pretty pretty overwhelming at the moment um i i think i can say that for anybody even remotely involved in nfts it's sort of being uh yeah as much as i complain about it i really the the intrigue and the excitement for me with nfts i i haven't minted 26 nfds i've i've i'm not even really much into trading and and doing that yet um i'm just really fascinated by the conversation i love just talking about it you know even with a lot of the naysayers i'm like mike and i are on a thread or we have a friend of ours who's really against it so much because he he is it's he is so um he he totally understands what is um exceptional about this moment in time he totally understands the technology and he just doesn't subscribe like he's just like yeah i i you know people are doing this people are going to be doing this and he's right about all of it and he's like i just don't like it i don't like the idea of like that's totally fair yeah yeah i don't like his thing is like here's his i think what do you think his biggest beef is it's because of all of the whales running away with the headlines is that really the yeah i think he's really caught up with that the that it seems to be just this cash grab a lot of you know the argument that a lot of people are going to get hurt in this process it's um money laundering it's a pyramid scheme like that one um sometimes he brings up the climate stuff which is of course incredibly critical um but he yeah i think to him it's more it's and not to call out anna mike but mike's wife also she sums it up the best way which is this is stupid [Laughter] we have that conversation so bobby hit me up was it november you hit me up and you're like hey are you guys paying attention to nft thing and i didn't respond to that because i was like ah i'm hearing stuff like i gotta wrap my head around what's happening and then when we finally like in december um i think you're right i think it was about december-ish yeah like okay so like do we get involved like who should we talk to because there's some exciting things going on and my wife was in the conversation too she's just like she was she was at that first stage of why would people pay money for that yeah right like this is stupid how do you guys reply to that here's the argument that i like to make is like okay uh not not everybody buys art you know a lot of people buy art from ikea like and they're happy with that and that's fine if if that's what they want to do and and fill up their walls or something like that that's great uh i mean but some other people really value high-end art and you know they exist in their own little world and i do understand like like yeah a lot of the money you know it's it's pretty the headlines are coming from like the big whales right but i actually think that there's sort of this like if if you look a little bit closer there's like a whole generation of artists that are being sort of elevated by this that weren't being served by you know their other spaces yeah the visual artists like latasha yeah you guys see um did you guys see the pack um the title collection um no i don't well i remember seeing it but i i don't remember the specifics now i got reminded because he because he quoted a linkin park lyric the other day i was like oh yeah who's that guy so he did this he he did this collection called the title and if you look it up it's basically the exact same image with different names and the name referred to itself like so there was one called the cheap uh they're all the exact same thing it's 500 bucks one's called the expensive was 10 000 bucks one's called the unsold which he didn't sell one's called the lucky which was a dollar like they each have a thing that refers to their what they are and what it did was what was so um revealing i mean it it basically focused its its its essence itself on what was really important which is what's the concept of the thing and what will you buy it for exactly the image was inconsequential and like a lot of good uh fine art like it it ruffled feathers and made people uncomfortable like have you ever heard of it's like the banana with the duct tape like people went like i don't understand why anybody would spend so much money the banana is going to die like because it's not about the art like exactly sometimes you buy a piece of art because it's beautiful and and you want to look at it but other times art is not about that art is about the the concept the story or just the or just the rarity yeah that too yeah absolutely yeah yeah i feel like that's also another reason why so many people have been gravitating to like certain artists is because the story there is something they've never heard before right and that changes everything for people i know a lot of people are like word like i see what happens to women in hip-hop so i want to support what you're doing because you're telling that story for so many other women in not just hip-hop but in music and art and everything right so that is so crucial and i agree with you mike like totally well by the way and when it when when it is about the visuals like latasha i see i see your like some of your work part of the story is you as a creator and as an innovator right so people are buying part of what they're buying is that as you as an idea and then the other part of it is that the visuals just look great like they don't have to not matter they sometimes they matter a lot and in your head they matter a lot thank you yeah i mean you have to have both to me like i feel like the visual got to be dope and the story got to be dope if you want to get something like you know and work right out there so you know that's the crucial part for me right now it's it's a new medium right and that's how i'm i'm thinking about it personally it's it really is a new art form and like poc is a great example of sort of applying concepts that really only make sense in this in the nft world you know there's not really an analog that you could you can't do that anywhere else like he did this other fascinating project which again kind of ruffled some feathers i think he's becoming more of like a conceptual artist at this point which i think is cool but he he did um essentially took michelangelo's uh i forget the the sistine chapel like famous piece whatever but yeah yeah the the yeah the the et moment um and uh and so he took each like individual block and then reprocessed it through an ai so it was a different so it was a new work technically um and then sold them by parts and it was interesting to see like which parts people wanted to buy and of course like the finger everybody went for that one you can imagine where else what else people wanted to buy because there's some nudity uh but like you know obviously there's some blank spaces that were like you know who's gonna buy a blank space because that's not that interesting but again like fascinating concept and using the technology as like a new medium a new art form and approaching it from that perspective and i i love that i think that's what's what's so cool about this is this is like new net new we're not trying to replicate exactly what's been done before it's like something completely different i mean i i didn't even introduce myself but [Laughter] andre musician um tech addict i don't know i i love i love all this stuff i've sort of been involved in ethereum worlds for a long time but um you know when when i decided to sort of approach the nft space i had only really seen visual art and i was like okay this is fascinating but like how do i as a musician even approach this and the the closest example i could think of is like okay when i go to a museum and look at a piece you know i'm there for 30 45 seconds maybe a minute depending on the piece you know and then i kind of move on to the next one so i was like okay how do i how do i apply that to like something that you consume digitally on your phone or or on a screen and you know the the idea was like okay a 30 to 45 second loop of you know of sort of like a diorama like a 3d space with music and you're sort of setting a tone like that was kind of my approach to it and um this is something that could only really exist as an nft it can't really exist um as a painting it's not a painting you know it's it's it's it can't exist on spotify because then it doesn't have the visual you know it's it's it's kind of a whole new medium and i think that's that's what so exciting to me um and i don't know i'm curious if you guys like think about it that way um there are a couple of things that i that like i keep coming back to i'd say there's two two things to me that i keep coming back to one is that when i when i was in school i went to art center college of design in pasadena and i studied illustration and as part of that we had to take um a couple we had to take some other classes in different disciplines um you know required classes and and i remember taking fine art certain really really abstract conceptual fine art classes that i did not want to take and one of the things that drove me crazy about them was that it was all about concept and it was always come up their concept first and then the medium secondary like express your concept via whatever medium is appropriate for the expression of the idea so in other words if i have a cool idea i wouldn't go straight to a canvas and paint about it because the idea there's no connection in the case of if my idea is about for example uh coming out of quarantine and people feeling like socially awkward coming out of quarantine let's say that's my idea like at its core that has nothing to do with paint that has nothing to do with a canvas so the that class they would challenge you okay express that idea in a way that's more true to the idea not true to the thing that you do i think that this uh that nft the enft space actually opens the door for a lot of that that the idea of a a file of any kind that you can create being you know that you can play with rarity and play with value um to whoever it touches like you know they have a connection to it somehow like i love the idea right now we're seeing a lot of like this is a video it is being sold on an auction like i think later we're gonna see it it being um authenticated the item that is being authenticated and and is being offered in a rare kind of way uh not just be a movie not just be a song not just be a text file and the other thing is just that um i also keep think trying to think of that through the lens of web three i keep thinking of it in terms of like how do we do this in a way we're also sick of huge corporations being in between us and a fan being in between wedging themselves into a transaction um turning us or using us as their commodity as their widget to sell against ads and and um how do we do do the first part while keeping our eyes on the ball of the second part was that too much no no no that no that was great i like like i guess like hearing you talk about this it sort of re reminded me of of like sort of like how this really kind of changes how we value things right um you know th this idea of i mean yeah like our our industries especially in music is sort of rife with with middlemen and different services that take like pieces here and there and sort of dwindles it down to like not a whole lot left at the bottom for the artist and what what i like about this it's i think there's a couple kind of main things that this this changes is like uh shout out to zora i guess once again because like i think they kind of came up with this concept but that uh essentially like on the internet you know early on like information sort of wants to spread out like wants to like move to the edges like information kind of like wants to be free you know like it feels like that's sort of the natural state of it is that like people want to access content or music or art whatever whatever it is and it just wants to be free-flowing and the way that we've monetized it like what you're saying about like ads and and like that that's sort of like adding friction to it's like okay well this is our thing we're going to charge you for it or we're going to add this inconvenient like weird thing on top of it and and that that was that's been kind of the model for like 20 years you know or 20 25 years how much will you put up with yeah right that's a very negative way to approach i'm not selling you something because you love it i'm monetizing your discomfort or your annoyance crazy that's a crazy thing to do but it works it works on some level but i think it's like showing its cracks with certain types of industries i think music being one of them art being another and i mean even to some degree news and you know uh it's sort of distorting that right on on multiple levels so so i think i don't know that nfcs are the answer for everything but some it kind of fixes a lot of that right where it's sort of just it's saying it's like content should be or data should be free-flowing should reach everybody for free but that ownership at the top should be scarce for for the creator or for you know a bitter or whether it's a group of people or you know so it's it's a very interesting sort of way to to to monetize i guess like because it doesn't require you to just to set up a paywall or or um you know it it like there's no friction there it's sort of like it i mean i think a lot of people get caught up with this right like this is the point was like why would i want that what i don't value that you know um but there's also this overlap and i want to ask bobby specifically about this there's this overlap with musicians and concert tickets the way they're they're scooped up and resold and that's the same thing that's happening secondary market with fashion right and and other things so there's a mechanism in place with an nft that addresses that the creator can set a percentage and continue to make that percentage and if if you go in you know if it's auction style then then the the audience will decide the price and then it will continue hopefully continue to move in the creator of that i mean if you can imagine like i i loved that the nyan cat creator like sold his i thought it was worth more than what it sold for personally because same it's a world famous joke like it's a world famous piece of art and cultural artifact right like it's perfect and it's going to continue to get passed around because it's because everybody knows what it is yeah it's that's one of the most compelling parts to me about nfts also is this idea when people say well everyone has that i'm like that's actually what makes the nft more valuable the more visible it is the more it's been seen and saved onto somebody's desktop or screen grabbed on the phone it only makes it stronger that you that someone has the original one the mona lisa is always the example everybody uses but there's a copy of that everywhere everyone has one in their computer or their home at an ikea and so when you see the actual one it means so much it's like seeing a celebrity it's like seeing mike shinoda right like i've seen mike shinoda so many times right music videos on the award stage there's photos there's billboards of him and so when i see the actual mike shinoda it's like holy crap this is him this is the one of one mike and anna owns him but i just i don't know if that was the right way to look at it but that's that seems to make sense in my head i had a question for you all which was um it's when i talk to people who are really deep into this people like trevor all right this person trevor that we keep talking about but people like trevor or some of the guys who own the platforms and the artists who've been doing this for a long time it's actually not even nfts really aren't about what's even happening right now it's almost like this is the gateway to get us to where we're going it's like this is what we need to do to crack people's brains open so that they can kind of understand the blockchain because up until recently i still didn't really get i still don't get the blockchain but yes i didn't understand and i didn't really care right because there was no way to really use a lot of this crypto and it just didn't seem very practical to me and i couldn't imagine what life would be like inside of this screen every day and so the pandemic accelerated that because we spent so much time on our phones but also nfts really helped me to see what it was like what andre has been understanding about the ethereum blockchain for many years um something about that captivated you early on like for me it didn't happen until nfts and it seems to be a lot of people on boarded and joined you know in because of nfts and so it's like was this just as as usual art and culture and music right are always on the front lines that's what gets people to enter into the next space right when you're gentrifying neighborhoods you the artists do it first and then people follow the artist right so we're like gentrifying ethereum blockchain um i mean to be honest like as yeah like i i've been involved with this since 2017. so you know it was more a lot techier early on but like it's a very interesting subset of people because it's a lot of tech people but they love art and and that's why i think it was it actually made sense in hindsight the nfts were the thing that really kind of made this a little more mainstream versus just like an investment vehicle which a lot of people had viewed crypto as that and that was sort of one of the biggest misconceptions about all this stuff is like when you talk about crypto people assume you're talking about investments i'm like no there's actually like a whole platform that you can create like entirely new systems of course wait the thing is it's so big that like it's really hard to like keep it um to not be hyperbolic about it because you're like you can run the government on this you know it's like like like you can go there but but you know obviously that's not going to happen overnight or anything like that but but you know what i mean like it's it's so i think nfts are actually even though they are somewhat complex it is like that first kind of like okay that i get that that makes sense you know scarcity okay i don't need to understand the technical stuff so much i don't need to think worry about blockchains and and whatnot but like uh ideologically i i understand what's what's happening here and i like it you know um i i i think that's cool but but like the the the the whole thing about the it being like a sort of an open platform for me was really that was the north star for me you know i was like okay this is amazing it's like set up right from the beginning because you know in in music especially it's there's three labels that run run the world and uh always a gatekeeper yeah and and they they just control a lot and and what i like about this is that it's not really it's like i don't think it's going to replace them overnight or anything like that but it's like basically every service that exists out there could potentially be replaced by code and that's kind of a scary idea but also like kind of uh fascinating because like if you think about it like um nobody's safe yeah so so it makes i don't mean the artist i don't think like i'm not really worried about that side but it really like all these services and all these like applications you know um the financialization or the financial side of it which i think is maybe the more hostile side of the music industry uh could be essentially replaced by your fans or or or some kind of other mechanism so uh like to me i find that to be like the ultimate leveling of the playing fields so so uh like now they have to compete with zero they need to compete with code you know what i mean so it keeps them honest it's like okay now you're a label are you going to take 50 maybe not you know maybe you're only worth 25 because you're more of a marketing service you know at this point like maybe they are with 50 i i don't know are they worth 80 percent probably not you know how are how are the labels responding to all this they seemed a little late the people that i do know at labels they caught on very late they're scrambling they're a lot of the people that are hitting me up like can i ask you about nfts real quick but what are they doing in response a lot are hitting me up like all the time now to just find out what i'm doing it's a joke because a few months ago nobody was hitting me up and then all of a sudden i got into nfts and like all these homies are like yo what's good latasha where have you been back then you didn't want me no i'm hot you're all up on me no you might go like that hey do you have two hours to do you have two hours of your time yeah all day with the two hours of your time so yeah i've definitely been noticing more labels are interested um but i also feel like they're interested because they want to figure out how to you know leverage this on their side you know so artists still will try to get to labels are they scared are they threatened by this i personally think some are scared because yeah yeah because this gives the power to the artist you know what i mean this this like gives the power the worth and the integrity to the artists and wow artists the integrity yeah yeah most artists are fighting for that to keep that i know from myself i've been doing music for like eight years now five years like professionally um and most of the time that was what i was fighting for for my creative integrity to keep like my word and keep myself intact you know and i made choices where i didn't go to a label but you know was hurt because i didn't have the money to pay for or deal with and now i got into nfts and like in two weeks i made the money i probably would have made getting signed you know what i mean yeah you know what i mean so it's like a whole different game just the same thing happened to me where my my i did a drop just recently on maker's place and i made more on that drop than i did my entire last two albums um on a very well-respected label you know we put a lot of effort into it like i made more money you know in two days than than the entire that's so that's like i i think that in addition to there are certainly the folks from the labels who are scared of it because just like anybody's things that are different and new and unfamiliar are scary um there are also folks that understand it or are starting to understand it and are trying to be strategic and one of the things they're not scared of it in terms of like um oh it's different and i don't understand it i think one thing that i always tell young artists is that if you're in an existing relationship with a label then a new delivery model like meaning a new way to get product to a fan shows up and and there's no precedent for what the economic splits should be so if they're used to like like andre you said if they're used to 85 splits you get 15. um they take 85 because they have so many employees and they do such important work and without them you wouldn't be anywhere right the starting point of the conversation is i get 100 you get zero if that's the starting point of the conversation that is terrifying to them because they're just like well we're so like we certainly have okay and i'll say this like for for them if i'm if i'm at a label i'm thinking well i do have value like we do a thing we do when we could certainly help make your nft drop bigger than you could on your own there's a totally like look at warner records they have a worldwide infrastructure tentacles in every single country in the planet and they could help make your drop really big and for that like the question mark is like the the question is like what for what what what do they spend on that and what do they make on it right and they don't know so what i did for example when i dropped um my new single happy endings as an nft we did ten limited edition um we did one of ten two of ten that type of thing on zora and that was it and i have co-writers on the song i have two other vocalists on the song disney is in the mix like like okay so we got warner universal disney publishers etc like i just went to them and i said look here's what we're gonna do if you're okay with it just give me the green light to give all the money to charity so we don't have to work out splits let's just look at the let's just look at this as an experiment and if you greenlight it we're gonna look at we're gonna watch how it tracks um because it really the whole the major hold up is they're gonna at some point say like if you sell an nft we the industry standard is we take this much and they don't have that right now and they're trying to create that yeah exactly the place where they're gonna go they're gonna try and do deals with a hundred young artists and say it's 50 fair right you're not if i say no you're going to not let me release it so i guess and then they're going to go to the big artists and say we take 50 yeah exactly exactly like even back when i was uh signing my deal with with a major at the time um you know i i sort of you know i was aware of what i was getting into but also it's like i mean these these rates are ridiculous let's be real you know like 85 or 80 it's like toxic to put it to put it so so um but but then again like the argument is always like well you know michael jackson got that or you know or prince got that or like you know any other literally any other major david bowie got that and it's like who are you we all were upset about that of course nobody's happy with it but but it is a lot of like well this is how things are done around here you know yeah um yeah and even with small labels like i've done i did a small publishing situation last year just to test out the waters because my whole thing was like i'm from brooklyn jay-z is my guy like you know i'm not signing nobody as long as i can and i'm gonna hold all this integrity forever you know whatever so i was like let me just try this publishing thing and you know i had a bigger name than even the publishing company did right like i had like more clout i guess if we want to call it clout and um the label still tried to pull the whole like no this is what you're gonna get because this is the standard and i'm like you guys are a small publishing company you guys have no kind of like like push like i could probably push myself i'm doing this kind of as a favor and they literally told me my sweat equity didn't equate to their work and i was like you've got to be kidding me right now like i remember battling this like for like the whole pandemic being pissed off about this pretty much but that's how they run and then when i found nft i was like oh well that's bye there goes my resolution [Laughter] it's like i mean i don't know if restaurant is the right analogy but what if it's like you know so the economics are different right you if you're if you're a small artist if you're a small artist making more per unit you make 90 90 per unit or 100 per unit or whatever and you only have to sell you have to sell this tiny fraction of the amount of units in order to make the exact same amount of money exactly and there's then so many artists can be successful because the late monetizing against like volume like you have to sell look at the spotify uh streaming numbers like everybody who hears about these numbers about like you you know you stream five million uh your song stream five million times on spotify and you just collected a check for ten thousand dollars like congratulations right right like that those economics suck no artist likes that the label the labels and whoever else is making money spotify themselves taking all of that money to do all of the things they do it seems so efficient to do it the other way right right and if they can provide about if anyone in the equation can provide a value to take you from i'm said the restaurant analogy may be wrong but like i just popped into my head to take you from hey we're a single mom-and-pop taco shop in la to okay we're gonna franchise right we're gonna go bigger and now you're gonna need more staff and more um infrastructure and we're going to help you do that so we're going to share in the proceeds of expanding your business like to me that starts to make more sense that everybody's got everybody's on the line for some part of the value and some part of the take yeah that makes more sense definitely i think it'll actually like generate better art you know what i mean because the scale is is like like a more niche artist can can thrive in this environment that caters to like i mean if you're into like hardcore you know techno or or or industrial whatever you know noise like so it's some kind of very niche thing that there's like a strong fan base for like you can thrive in that and not even worry about you know the competition that you're dealing with absolutely i feel like that for sure i feel like being like i was doing i i mean i'm a i started out in rap and hip-hop and being a woman in hip-hop is all you know you guys all hear the jokes and the stories and the trauma that women deal with in hip-hop and so when i got into this i was like oh my god a safe space where i could just like be myself and like create whatever the hell i want and people with it if they don't all good you know it's so i'm i'm being me and i get to like create my own platform in this way and then people are all like excited about just nft period so they're like word you know this is like a whole new world i'm going to be the first you know that's a whole thing that people are hype about so it's been really amazing um to just feel like myself again in this world you know i tweeted something kind of along the lines yesterday because this week we are seeing this crazy story unfurl about um these asian american women who were murdered right and so i'm very sensitive to the race talk right now because now the spotlight's on our community and i realized that much of the appeal of nfts which was also what attracted me to the internet to begin with when i was like 15 20 years old was it was a place where i was outside of my body right like i wasn't being judged on my gender my skin color my anything and it was just my soul and my art and my ideas and it wasn't influenced by anything that i was wearing or you know the color of my skin and so i think we only have a few minutes left and i didn't mean a hard pivot but latasha earlier we were talking about how there is this perception this misconception of nfts being this you know billionaire tech bro douchey guys on clubhouse yeah like that's all it's about and the representation part of this is so important for me right like the reason why i didn't get into crypto earlier was because i just felt like it was another planet speaking a language i didn't understand discussed by people who didn't include me in the group absolutely silicon valley guys you know who are billionaires like mark zuckerberg i was like that's that and i'm down here i'm a streetwear guy and that's not my community and nfts have now been a place for me where look at you know even just on this call there's three people that are of color like we have a woman in here you know we come from all different backgrounds in the room right now like um it's so important for people like us to be out there like me representing for the streetwear industry and for asian americans like you're a black woman in music to do so i i think if you're everyone's okay with this can we end with this no i just wanted you to kind of speak on that if you don't mind really yeah for sure i think it's it's really complicated still because we're still walking into this with a bunch of people who have mindsets that are from those spaces right we still have probably racism issues in crypto we have all the same issues we're dealing with in real world in crypto it's still here i'm not gonna say it's not here i'm not gonna say you know i'm not gonna try to make this all pretty and fuzzy because there's a lot of stuff going on in here that's problematic and complicated so i feel though what needs to be like the forefront of everything to change it is the communication and i say this all the time especially to zora i'm like as a platform you guys have to be communicating constantly about you know marginalized communities and you guys have to push that agenda in order for us to change the whole metaverse you know what i mean because that's what that's the problem with our world right now you know that's the biggest problem with our world right now so yeah when i first got into this and i saw my boyfriend get into it i was like what is this like it's a bunch of little white boys putting up like weird art like they not gonna with me like you know what i mean like whatever and and bam andre shots fired no key fonjay is cool i with andre's work i've been checking out audrey and mike's work for a long time and i i love what you guys are doing but i feel like i i constantly am going back to this idea of meaning in the work and of course there's there like i feel it's very important to have a resting work that is just gorgeous and of course that's my heart too but if there's context is there meaning is there story are you going to change someone's life with this piece are you going to change someone's thoughts with this piece that's where i kind of sit with everything and i feel especially watching so many artists in the black community start to thrive in this world i i just and not just black but people of color in general find their ways to thrive um i'm just like so excited for what it could do for the future of us you know what i mean and um one other thing i just wanted to say i have still noticed like issues with economic issues going on with like people of color aren't i feel like a lot of times women of color are receiving like lower end you know bids and things of that nature i've dealt with that i've seen homies deal with it and i'm just like you know this art is just as integral and amazing as this render core art even though it might not be a render core even though it might be photography or whatever whatever right um and i think i don't know if i want standards in crypto but i think we need to start addressing like that all art needs to be seen in this world um so that's where my heart is with this and that's what i've been pushing for everybody really that was amazing thank you thank you tasha you're the best i'm so hyped for this world guys like yeah it's gonna change a lot of things for us man so i'm just grateful and thanks for having me all right andre natasha mike this was absolutely amazing i wanted to ask a bunch of questions but i was just like this was going so well that i didn't want to wrap it up that was an amazing note and uh and kind of just seeing through this from i'm hearing you talk from from my side kind of the synthesized synthesization of like what i got from all this thing is that it's not just about one or two applications of it you're talking about a massive first innings of a big transition in power of just the new economy and how can you not be excited about that we're getting to share perspectives about artists and musicians and other industries and they're all coming together but the underlying theme is that you are putting the power in the person not the other person managing uh some other relation and and to me that is extremely exciting and you've done an amazing job uh highlighting that and sharing that perspective from how you've seen the traditional versus what code is really competing on so thank you so much for uh giving us your time today i feel like one thing we should do is we're happy to take on those zoom calls for you and just keep people listening what's happening against the developer side or what the possibilities are from a non-technical perspective this whole weekend is designed for that and uh we're more than happy to uh route this uh and address any of these things because we think the potential is just way too big here so thanks again and uh thank you blessing you guys thank you have a good one so good to meet you all you guys amazing so with that we have two more talks remaining for our summit um we are a little bit ahead of time so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a quick break uh we'll be back in about five minutes so all you gotta do is just hang tight take some uh take a quick stretching break uh get some something to drink and now we'll resume with our next talk in five minutes so see you all shortly my all right hope you all got a quick break um there's still a few hundred of you watching these summits and i really want to thank all of you for sticking with this for the last few hours there's a lot of activity happening i kind of spent the last few minutes catching up with what's happening on our discord the hackathon's officially begun a lot of people are thinking about ideas talking to each other talking about teams and uh two more talks to go for the summit and uh and then we're gonna spend the next 48 hours just looking at all the creative projects that come out of this so i'm super excited for this next talk um we've been talking for the last few uh talks and panels on what's happening from the artist side and the creative side where people who are uh known in in this industry through other uh sort of uh means and have distribution have definitely are seeing the value of entities and benefiting it off of what's happening in their ecosystem but we definitely wanted to contrast that with what's happening at the grassroots of our ecosystem whether that's dallas how nft culture is changing how how should we think about ownership in this case and investing in this ecosystem all these ideas we haven't really touched too much on so the next panel is super interesting because we're going to talk about all these things and how we actually think about community in the space from a really fundamental level i'm super excited to welcome carlos samantha cersei and mikhail to uh to discuss community and solidarity and nfts and they're going to be talking about mid fun i'll ask all of them to turn on their cameras and we'll have mikhail from zora moderate this discussion and let's get started started without any further ado so please welcome everybody here thank you so much cardik good evening everyone uh welcome to this very very exciting panel about the mint fund uh it's going to be funny because i'm as well as much as i'm hosting also part of mint fund so you not going to watch a traditional panel but rather a informed conversation and reflection between friends and colleagues who have been spending the last couple of months doing something very very exciting um first round of introductions maybe um i think i'm going to introduce myself probably afterwards so let's go around and maybe you know my steam colleagues tell us a little bit who you are what your connection was to nft and technology and art pre-nft and pre-mint fund and maybe what has happened for you let's say in the last six months that most certainly all felt like at least a decade um samantha since you sneezed yourself into the uh spotlight tell us a little bit about yourself it was a slight cough actually um yeah so i'm samantha i during the day i work for a foundation i'm the creative content lead there i work a lot with the artists that we onboard into the nft space before i found my way into crypto i was working for contemporary art museums in los angeles and so really come from like a space of um understanding artists and their practice and how i ended up in crypto i'd say over the past year i've really started to notice that a lot of artists not just from like the visual sense but musicians um poets um developers coders creatives of all kinds were really experimenting with nfts and yeah there's just so much happening in this space i would never imagine that i'd be working in crypto at some point in time and then your last question was something that's felt like it's happened for a long time what was it um i was actually wondering but it doesn't matter i have so many more questions i'll find um okay because because actually because you are some also with me you have a background in let's say non-digital art or institutional oh i really really you know like one of those mega words institutionalized art um so i would like to talk to you a little bit later about that in particular you know the similarities and differences but maybe let's um have carlos who is dialing in from shanghai and it's four in the morning so please all of you at home a warm applause for that much commitment to get up at four in the morning to face all of you carlos um thanks thanks mikael uh yeah it's 4am uh in in in beijing uh close to shanghai but yeah so my name is carlos um um i'm currently the founder of forefront which is a social token aggregator content targeting market as well as a contributor for city club and uh obviously uh mint fund uh but yeah i think i i really got interest i've been you know in the space for a while now but um really around social tokens uh but i got really into nfc and started to think about it um more deeply when i was uh on andrew stinwood uh you know podcast and we were talking about all this you know social tokens and stuff and then he asked me like which nfc do you own and i couldn't really come up with one because i didn't uh and from that moment i was you know i started to go down the rabbit hole and uh but yeah until today we are here right so like you said it's been a decade or two i don't know did you do before crypto um so i i did all my undergrads that is here in china and um 2015 uh was the year i started you know you know learning about crypto and 16 working for a crypto exchange but before that it was just your normal uh you know job right like you know for a sas company and it's always been a software developer uh but yeah that's pretty much it okay interesting um amir now you are not only in technologies you're also a crypto artist but tell us a little bit about all of that sure um my name is amir cersei on twitter i'm very loud i'm kind of a creative anarchist um two ways i think mainly because of the fact that uh i'm very gung-ho about inclusion and sustainability and making sure that everyone feels like they have a safe place and so i'm not afraid to call it the um and i think that's part and parcel as to why i've flocked to this space um and tried to embrace it holistically because of the fact we have a very unique opportunity to shape the ground that we're walking on um and intention and good action is important to that um and so for me this space was sort of always kind of like pitched as the the new frontier or the way in which we can uh you know build true equity and self-sovereignty and so i'm here to call that bluff to really see if it if it's about if it's really about that um i've been used to blockchain since like 2011. um i had i'm a part of the old stories of people who had some coins at one point and then lost it and can't recover it no big deal there um but i think after 2017 i really got a chance to really think about what blockchain could do and how to build around it or how to build with it um i had done a lot of bounties through like bitcoin um i had done some stuff through consensus in 2019 um and then after kind of like uh being a part of that hackathon circuit i just kind of let it go um and then last year i was just for some reason dead set on owning a crypto kitty and didn't necessarily know why i wanted to do that um and it wasn't until my friend uh leighton shout out to late effects on twitter uh told me that he was selling instagram filters on the blockchain that everything sort of clicked um and after he showed me a wearable profile i really sort of understood that this this actually could this could work um and so ever since i've been kind of just like i was at first experimenting with my artistry and seeing what i could do in the space um as an artist it was one of the only things that really got me thinking about pursuing art again um i'm by and large uh a designer and worked in corporate in and like startups forever um but this was something i could really kind of like take hold and shape in the way that i wanted um and then i realized that you know even though we have a decentralized environment and like we have the affordance to build these equitable and inclusive spaces it still requires human work and i realized that there wasn't a lot of that being done so i just was like okay well i want to still do art but i think this is also very important and so i want to like focus on kind of filling in these gaps and building infrastructure and so that's why i'm here and that's why we're out here from infund so um so uh thank you and i want to touch on kind of immediately on two of the words that you introduced because they really really relate to either community on maybe the opposite of that so maybe also a few words of introduction to me my name is mikhail i work at zora as the curator i um and my background is actually in a lot of grassroots um culture i'm come from electronic music from underground electronic music where i've been working with a lot of small electronic music communities all over the world and the focus is in particular in community because electronic music is in particular defined by communal structures which means structures that build mutual space um hold that space together support each other out of principle and not because there's some sort of financial gain out of it and it's it's it's incredibly powerful and i through of course covet that made electronic music completely impossible you know looking at new spaces nfg of course became a very interesting alternative proposition and not for art but rather to renegotiate power relationships that are always present in art and in the way artists um relate with the systems that enable them to do the art and that also informs the possibilities of artists to kind of build communities you know in an analog world this is a lot of manual labor you know you build out a space you maintain that space in the digital world this is a little bit different so i mean you said two things first of all you mentioned the word anarchism and you also mentioned the word sovereignty now a lot of people equate um in particular on blockchain with a the idea of sovereignty you know where everybody can kind of build up their own island you know be their own island kind of define the rules of engagement with uh him or herself which seems to me a little bit opposing the idea of actually communal structures well sure you can build community but um my understanding of community is that with a community comes also a certain rule of conduct rules of conduct that are sometimes informed by principles in terms that you do things even if you kind of maybe not agree with them but you do them because they're part of that you know contract that you have within that community so because you're the longest within crypto art and blockchain in this group tell us a little bit you know your perception of how community has been built out in those largely digital spheres and what you felt lacking word yeah so i think the how community are sort of formed is you know it's always a commonality right that's found first people flock to a thing because they like a specific thing for a certain set of reasons um and i think interestingly because we're dealing with art for instance artists like that it's it's very ubiquitous it's just one of those things that is art is culture and so much as you know culture is just like this intangible tangible thing that we all contribute to in some form um and so art is like the pinnacle of that in many ways and so when you have like work that's being created and and talked about those that are around when that moment is sort of happening become a part of that initial community whether they are diametrically opposed to the work that's being done or they completely agree with it or they fall somewhere in between um and so what ends up happening is that there's a there's a conversation um that's formed around the general consensus of how people think about that work um whether it like is like infused within them whether they deal with it on a daily basis or you know or again they don't like it um and so that's kind of like how you have like these these like communities that are sort of like forming and these are all fine because everybody can have their own particular pockets and kind of like speak to the things that they like or that they don't like the the problems that end up happening though is when you introduce commerce and to these types of communities right and certain communities get more of the commerce um and what we end up happening what ends up happening and a lot of chains or a lot of spaces that create these this um this commercial layer is that we tend to see mono cultural consumption right where you know a certain set of parameters are floating up at the top of these sort of communities and largely ignoring other ones and so if these communities don't have the right type of components and sometimes it's rooted in a lot of different tangible intangibles like race for example it's a quasi-tangible thing because we can see physical differences within each other but honestly it's a social construct that means no thing at all like it just it shouldn't even exist but it does um and so because we have a social construct like that that could be a modifier in which commerce then says does it fit this criteria if not we're not really going to pay that that much attention until it becomes so much of a thing that now we have to buy into it um and so it's that's the thing that i noticed is that there's a uh there's monoculture when it comes to what's being purchased and what be what's being consumed more often what's being talked about um and then what's being highlighted and when you have that kind of uh division from a monetary perspective then that's when we have a lot of issues um again if you're a community it's fine if every community doesn't necessarily like mesh or talk to each other that's okay everybody has their own pockets but money becomes a signifier of value for many people and it's a very binary thing for them and so when you start assigning monetary value to one particular groups of communities versus another then we start to see a structure of power imbalance um and we start to see um you know the imbalance of you know what gets propped up and what gets talked about we have these we have this concept of what happens first within crypto and a lot of people are chasing that next first and there are a lot of communities that have done these things prior to but because they don't have the the the resources uh which could be monetary because people aren't putting value in their work or in their community that's largely ignored and then other people are first which is in many ways cultural erasure and so that's the stuff that i noticed um is that uh the way in which value is derived within communities from a monetary perspective is creating a large imbalance on on how these communities can operate but ultimately what you're also saying is that even though blockchain very often promises to renegotiate a lot of those power imbalances that are quite often structurally um ingrained into the way the way society operates just because you know we're claiming to build new contracts that a lot of that is basically being carried over one by one in terms of um even like all the way to the biases because what you say you know when you talk about the monoculture that means that the attention of a largely space populated by white patrons of the odd white artists benefits also exactly that socio-demographic markup whereas that's exactly the issue that when one had promised to overcome you know like the traditional art world that does not let in marginalized communities but nonetheless that is being at large reproduced that ultimately the lay of the land at the moment and to to that point too like i think in terms of the culture that's being built right now the opportunity that we have at the mint fund to really be conscious of this is something that we're all really thinking about as we build up the mint fund and for people that are tuning in and maybe don't have like the background on how that started i think that'd be like really great for amir and carlos to tell how that happened plus do you want to go yeah go ahead go for it carlos yeah i think i think amir you know really goes really deep into this stuff and he's really you know involved in so many ways which is amazing to see him on his mission and it was really the way everything started for mint fun was just um you know i i forgot his i think was lex i'm not sure um an artist on twitter you know like these days everything started on twitter and he was like can someone you know send me you know each ten dollars and then um for me to mint a piece on zora um and if i make sale you know everybody gets a piece of it right so the moment i saw it i was like yeah why not like right so i sort of like reach out to amir we had we previously had talked before uh and we sort of put the money together and he ended up selling selling it so fast and then out of nowhere amir is like carlos like you know where do you want me to send you the you know your piece right so i was like what do you mean he was like yeah so the the money we sent right so it sort of started that way then i was like what if we can put that amount you know to help other artists or the creators that want the one to mint and you know what we'll just give them zora invite as well right and for that point it's sort of spin out with you know jacob also helping there and we're like you know we're turning this into a dow and you know let's you know make sure that we get you know as much um people you know to to get started with minting and all of that right uh and this has been like a month or so but the journey you know it it's so crazy how it started and the way we're implementing everything now and you know we're making sure that um not only we help artists mean their first piece but we're also providing them like mentorship and sort of like really like the the whole process right so like you know how how can we make because like just the process i really feel like some sort of fulfillment when someone from mint fund meant a piece it's just such such an empowering um uh you know step forward for the new internet right uh and and um but yeah that's really that's how it started and i america go really deep into that because he definitely was involved into helping so many other artists getting started but uh but yeah that's pretty much how how he went and now we have you know you can see how the community is evolving how everybody's helping each other uh yeah happy to touch on on commute a little bit but i i mean it would be great to just you know type in a little bit there and and yeah yeah no you you basically did it yeah um shout out to my friend leighton again latefx on twitter uh yeah he was like i wanna mint a song on zoro and you know like what carla said put up some bread and so we did i ended up getting like 600 bucks and i'm just like i dm carlos with the quick fix like bro like you just got a hundred dollars he's like are you kidding me i'm like yeah man um and yeah i mean again like i i what's interesting and what's not what's not lost on me is uh how twitter has sort of become like this uh this tool to galvanize community around in around crypto um culture and the fact that we were able to get such an expedient and like big response from a tweet that was very kind of just like we wanted to just pay it forward and we didn't necessarily really anticipate the fact that it would become an actual like entity that can be responsible for starting up many artists careers um but in many ways i kind of just feel like there were a lot of other working pieces that we all were part of that that kind of culminated in this right like for me as i got more into the space i was hosting clubhouse rooms becoming a crypto creator in like since last december where i was doing like a whole week long thing of just taking people all the way through the entire process from knowing about cryptocurrency getting a digital wallet buying eth for the first time all the way to the mint process knowing all the different marketplaces that you could mint on and then how to manage money and everything like that like i was trying to field lawyers cpas to talk about money management because i think there's a lot of other stuff too in this space that a lot of people don't really hardball or talk about they'll say oh it's you know we want to like make sure all artists are earning but then what do you do with the money that you earn from sales right like you could just reinvest that back into yourself you could reinvest that back into artists but if you're not careful especially because we're dealing with a very regulated uh or not very but like somewhat regulated space within the united states if you are not careful you will be screwed um and so it's very important too to also have um when we're talking about sort of creative freedom and self-sovereignty there also harping on the financial freedom and financial sovereignty being able to really truly understand how to manage the the funds that you have because this is not like a bank that is doing it for you you are responsible for for a lot of this stuff so it's a huge mental shift um in um that we're that we're doing here and i think because we've all arrived at this point in time to where we've had that mental shift about how we operate in this space it kind of works it speaks well to kind of like the chemistry that we have at midfield and like what we're trying to do even though it's like kind of a snowball that's chasing us at this point or at least that's how i feel like we were rolling it and then now it became too big and then i'm i'm ahead of it like oh like this thing is going to take me so that's that's that's how it goes with you know the best things when they grow faster then you can chase them because that informs also that makes you proactive you know but also a lot of that was also kind of you know i remember i mean you and me had a conversation months ago uh also about this idea of digital communities of care you know where we were discussing that and this is also one of the things that i was observing that a lot of young artists were finally you know getting to a point where they could make money with art that they thought would be a hobby probably always maybe if they're lucky enough they might you know get a commission from a brand but they never thought that they would be able to to to make a living with it and then i saw a lot of big artists who obviously already had a platform you know now just were able to to make an even better living you know and that started the thought process also where if we are really claiming to build out a new artistic community what are then the support structures that will foster an understanding of solidarity and understanding of meaning and that also holds people accountable for contributing out of principle and not just because you know nepotism and when you look at you know crypto and especially about communities that are very much twitter based quite often support means retweeting but that's not really support that is the lowest you know this is the technological function that if you if you wouldn't be built into the interface that you use you probably would not do it because it's very convenient and whereas you know in in in real life when and then samantha you probably will be able to confirm that if you're part of an artist who's part of a group you know part of a collective part of an atelier community means access to infrastructure access to support emotional support even not just support in terms of help you get something going but it's like here's a shoulder to cry on um and uh resources right that is i mean that is the beauty of of having having that and how do we build that out in a digital sphere yeah and and to like go off of that i think that's not to pat ourselves on the back but i i really do see that as what's happening at the mint fund right now in terms of like the the additional layers of support that we're giving to artists um carlos organized a workshop with osinatchi where they were able to give advice to artists about what goes into minting a work um we had cooper turley who is just another very vocal voice in the space lead an introductory workshop about the lay of the land and i think that artists that are coming into the crypto space there is like such a steep learning curve for them that by having this community available to artists that are just learning about minting is so crucial right now like from my own experience to see the artists really getting to know each other and wanting to collaborate with each other and help each other out i think that's invaluable and even after they meant something with us for the first time to see like those relationships really cement in the space is what i'm looking forward to seeing how we continue this i mean one of the things that's also incredibly important and pretty much everyone who's watching maybe you know when they try to understand nfts as well there's very little canonical language there's a lot of of half knowledge and i felt when i was looking into i mean now there's lucky a little bit more sociopolitical discourse around it on quality discourse but until very recently half of the things you would read online felt either as a pitch or an investment scam or you know some some half truth and to also to be able to build a community where artists who are not plugged in who are maybe not quite tech savvy will have a community that already verifies the knowledge you know that gives them also the support because ultimately one thing that we also see is that there's also very critical conversations around nfts because there's a lot of misunderstandings about what it is what it stands for and most people what they see is just a bunch of crypto rich white people prepping up rich white artists you know and in combination then with some questions about ecological footprint and support and so on a lot of artists who venture into that face conversation that might be not prepared for and that might sometimes be unfair for them to have individually so building also an information databases educational database that equips them with the right understanding and language is also one of um of the one of the jobs not only of mint fund actually of anyone who's out there doing this but we decided to make that our focal main focus absolutely now knowledge is key um and the best people who have the best knowledge are those who are always seeking and always asking questions and always figuring out how to distill what they're picking up what they're learning what they're able to synthesize from others into a way in which they can give to someone else um and that takes a lot of intentional thought work too to trough through all the noise to really kind of look and and find what's out there that really actually is helpful um you know when it comes to a lot of the discussions about saying oh nfts are like you know money grabs or you know it's a ponzi scheme or uh you know it's contributing so much to the environment and it's like well let's take a look and and break down sort of like what the what these actually mean what these what what claims you're talking about and then you know sometimes too even have the experiment and saying okay if we even consider these that are not true to be true for example what else is mirroring in the real world these types of examples that you might already be actively participating in that you may or may not know of right and i think what ends up happening is because stuff is new and this is no different right anytime technology is new there's going to be a lot of resistance against it right because we all go through the cycle of something is new it starts to catch on a lot of people are catching on to it all the way down to those who are late and then by the time those folks who were deniers or didn't agree with what was new become late adopters a new thing's already happening so they're always in like this catch-up mode of trying to figure out where they're going to fit because they're no they don't want to accept the fact that they can find footing in a new thing and this is not just about technology this is about culture too culture moves the exact same way there's going to be a bunch of people art moves the exact same way we think about our history over the past like especially the 20th century it was almost every decade somebody was saying oh that's data art that like we're gonna do something else oh that's that's expressionism we don't care about that this is impressionism now so there's always this um this like this new wave of of folks kind of shouldering and moving on um and so we have to i think for us it's uh it's very important that we take heed with what's happening and make sure that we are a a space that we can distill the best in information as possible um and also still be kind of like that shield and say hey like you know what i noticed on twitter all last like a a lot of this month was especially related to the ecological um conversation was that there were a lot of people who weren't aware of what's actually happening in the space that is uh uh citing old research um from a group that didn't actually have the most accurate and information at the time to then attack artists right and then after that point was after that was happening when we were when they were talking about the financial issue situation they were also still attacking these artists and so what what ended up becoming a place where you know we're talking about open and active participation became a a toxic environment for a lot of people um and that that leads to real physical harm mental harm emotional harm that a lot of people aren't really taking into account in that when you are a part of something new it requires you to be very strong because you have to have the mental fortitude to take on what's like to take on what's happening um to to to say that you're going to be a part of this experiment to see if something is possible for us in this future and what does that look like and being an active builder in that future requires that we got to take a little bit of dings but hopefully you know what we're building at mit fund is uh a safe space so that you know we can we can dismantle a lot of those fears we can talk about the stuff that's happening in the space in a real honest way and say look like we don't know all the answers but that's why we're building a brain trust of a community so that we can all arrive at a point together um that solves a lot of these issues we we we have the mental space that we're saying we're going to fight um to build uh you know an equitable environment for all artists to participate in um and so once we have that mental framing then the rest of it kind of like fills in itself because everyone's going to say that's a mission that we can get behind because we truly believe that this space can can give us that affordance um and so it's just doing the everyday work um and i love the fact that we're you know we wake up and we uh we do something about it and it's awesome i mean that also two very important points that you all um brought up one is dismantling you know um and that means that dismantling means to dismantle structures within society that are also mirrored in the technological and artistic space that we move in and those structures are often rooted in white supremacy sexism um ableism um racism but also eurocentrism and also a an extension of eurocentrism also you know focus on north america and when we speak about you know building equity we cannot have that position rooted in these immediate realities which very often are very privileged realities because a lot of people and this is like what upsets me when i look at you know crypto conversations and people come along with the statements like oh this is you know this is this is universally accessible there are no entry boundaries but they are there there are so many structures on systemic boundaries until somebody can even enter this and those need to be also addressed if you take the word equity into your mouth then you need to go all the way and maintain an equitable proposition for everyone and understand where are the boundaries and how can you overcome that and that is also one of the reasons why we actually not just have in inspirational conversations but actually taking money into our hands to at least compensate for some of that because for many people you i don't know the demographic layout of the people watching but many artists that we engage with a hundred dollars gas fee or 150 gas is a month salary and you cannot say yo for this incredibly exciting thing that potentially might work out for you but there are some caveats it's an experiment that we're all into but invest that much money that is technically an immoral proposition to me um and you do have as a community especially a community that's well-off to make sure that you extend support that is more than words but also money which is why mint fund actually also has the wallet with eve that we use to support artists and why we also knowingly chose to focus outside of north america and europe even though we're open to everyone but they're also priorities or yeah i mean you you said it right there right like like people think um equal and equity are two different things and i think people say oh i want things to be equal but equality we kind of technically already have right like there's for the most part especially if you're in your opinion in america almost a near equal access to stuff but equity means that there are certain communities that need a little bit more pyt right or like or tlc rather like tender loving care rather right that's the right word not the other one thinking of two different michael jack jackson songs anyway um you know but with that right that that says well okay they might need a different allocation of resources that everyone can sort of get an equal opportunity to get um and when we're practicing real equity then that says it's almost like the um there was a a a graphic that was released a while ago and it had like equity of saying uh you know there's a a gate and then there's like uh uh certain people with different heights and then they put them with different crates and they were like oh that's like equality and it's like great but like equity is removing the gate in the first place like why is that even there you know and so we we're we need to be in the business of saying if we're talking about equity we're saying like we're removing every potential barrier that we could that we that we can be ever present of um the most immediate is obviously funding um and then secondarily on top of that is then knowledge right um and then after that then everything else kind of like falls into play where it's like once we imbue you with the way in which you can kind of engage in the space we give you knowledge to know how to engage in this space in a meaningful way now it's about okay how can we help accentuate your what it is that you're trying to do as a creative you know what your story is what your what your what your mantras are what you stand for what you're about um and so that you can present yourself in the best way possible when you're not operating in this space because ultimately we could do a lot of the stuff that we're doing in mint fund to help people mint but i feel like my goal is um is that people who go through med fund i want to get their work sold yeah that's that's the one right there yeah and it's like real equity i found the edited version that is also about ableism just really quickly yeah yeah so it's like it's weird it's like yeah build a ramp and it's like that's great but why do you need a gate there in the first place um yeah so but yeah i mean i i think uh we're equity is hard to do um and and i i always say that there's like human work and like we need to like but it's like it's hard to do but i think the more you do it every day it's like a muscle right like practicing like anti-racism like to be anti-racist for example to be anti-sexist right all these types of things it's real active work and you have to practice it right it's a lot of work exactly because we're we're all trained we've picked up certain things just depending on where we are and how we've how we lived and how we've grown up right and so to to dismantle means it's like an it's a it's an active engagement and active practice in removing you know like like systems and tools of harm and so some of the systems of harm are the the ways in which we see each other um and by actively removing those things and practicing better habits of of of love and understanding we get to a place to where we can we can we can create true equity because now we're we're impacting folks from sort of like the metaphysical um space to not just what we're able to do with real tangible resources yeah i think one of the things that i've been really um because i'm from a small island with like with like 50 000 you know population you know my island specifically have like 3 000 people so for me access is one of the things that i look for the most so i'm really into this you know what happens when you you sort of like level up the playing field a little bit for everybody right so and one of the missions that you know it's you know now it's been fun but and the idea here is like when when we have conversations amir i always tell you like you know how can we multiply this effect right so we want to be able to mentor artists that are able to mentor their own you know create their own mint fund essentially right so that's the whole idea here right and once you have you give this these people that want to express that you know whatever they do uh into this new you know this new thing you know that is so exciting called nfts uh but then you know once they define their nation then they sort of you know you know sort of on board other artists or other you know people that want to express as well so you multiply that effect you give them the resources you give them the the financial you know incentive to do especially on ethereum nowadays expensive but the ideas here is like how can we get this information that like you said the knowledge out there and reach as much people that we want and the focus essentially is going to go to to you know minority groups and people are really like have never heard of crypto and how empowering this thing can be right so for me access that's the mission man i want to get like you know people from you know ev every single corner in like you know in africa somewhere like some talented artists or some talent you know you know writer some just you know apply for mint fund we're gonna give you everything that you need to you know to express yourself and and and then bring your your homies your your buddies and everybody else right uh but yeah that that's the idea when i think about it right instance we're coming to an end we have i think two minutes left there's one very important thing that i wanted to say because developers are watching us and what i find at the moment the most exciting thing about this is that we're as we're entering a completely new generation of the internet where the tools to build things are so much more democratically accessible you of all people who are coding who are designing the systems are the ones who can decide if you design the systems with ideas like solidarity not like not just what is a thing to tick at the checkout box but as the rules of conduct codified put into code as the base function of what you are to design and that is the real power because when facebook instagram all the platforms were designed the only function the base function they had was the bottom line of whoever designed it in mind and this is what we've been basically fighting against or not being able to participate because those systems were predestined in their outcome to privilege a selected few and now we're the process we can actually make principled decisions about building out technological solutions that are principled that are solidaric that are intersectional and the biggest power in that have the people who understand how to write code and who write code um amir samantha what are your last words for the group uh i want to say that this was the first week that artists from the mint funds were able to mint their very first works um so yeah we're going to be building out a gallery on the mint fund website to share all their works once they're all ready but everybody i guess follow us on twitter and keep up with us there because there's a lot more incredible work to come absolutely check us out at the ment fund on twitter um yeah this was this was great um mikhail you said it you hit the nail on the head right um those with the ability to create um have a responsibility uh to think about how to create a more inclusive and equitable world um and if you don't really know what that looks like then you know get with folks who do um we're building an amazing community at mit fund and a lot of the very nice social economic kind of like ideologies about equity and inclusion can be found there uh so please check us out at mint dot af or the mint dot fund uh join our discord hit us up on twitter and of course you have me as a resource on twitter as well at cersuehabe um i'm talking about equity a lot uh it's literally what uh what uh but it's like wheaties um so we're about this life let's do it come join us and help us to really build a better world because we don't have that many chances left in our lifetime to do so and maybe we're gonna be the ones who succeed um thank you for watching thank you carlos samantha amir uh thank you youth global for having us and being able you know to to have this conversation and good good hacking i would say what do you say at the hackathon like you guys participated in this you good hacking god speed code speed i don't know okay this is bad i'm sorry bail him out everyone samantha carlos thanks so much for watching the conversation and telling us more about how you're changing this thing with uh mint fun and mikhail thank you for moderating it was an excellent conversation and we're super excited to see how this develops and grows as a community thank you so much peace out and next up uh we have our final talk for the day um i want to welcome rohan from dapple labs um and uh this is a special kind of talk for us because there's a lot of things that sort of tie things like things together from how each global started and where we are now so um roham is here with us we're going to talk about top shot flow how dapper came to where they are and a lot of things in between and of course they if any questions as we kind of go through this talk please feel free to ask them on the chat and we'll ask them here directly so without further ado please welcome rohan hey can you hear me okay yes we can uh super excited to have you here um i was thinking through a bunch of questions i wanted to ask you and uh and i realized that even though i have a list i feel like it's not gonna work out the way i want it to be so we'll just kind of go through whatever deep dive we go into and uh just dig into whatever comes out of this but uh uh kind of the one one sort of super interesting piece here and i mentioned that another panel i did a few hours ago was um three years ago um eve global started um and now we ran an event called eat waterloo and um there was a project called rufflet that came out of it uh not a lot of people know what roughly it was and uh the origins of ralph lit were cryptokitties is now uh this is where things came out of me i came out of and uh kind of almost three years later we're at nft hack and i just thought about it and it realized that we're making an event on an industry that came from that event we did three years ago and just how massive and how interesting that is and uh it would have just been perfect to make sure that we had you uh to share some of that that's because you've been part of that journey from from the beginning so welcome um and uh and uh yeah i'm super excited to talk about this so so the first thing i want to do is just have everybody learn a bit more about you and dapper just tell us about what dapper labs is and how the company has started i mean the apparatus was born out of cryptokitties which was born at a i guess it was just waterloo at that time i don't know if we would have yes um and uh and yeah so we created cryptokitties and and at that waterloo event we were both uh so the team was hacking on roughly which was sort of an analytics tool for um for ethereum transactions sort of mixed panel for for blockchain but um we were also testing cryptokeys so we had the cryptocase alpha which is a very buggy smart contract with a very buggy front end and that was where we got that initial community right the first thousand people that that just convinced us that hey this thing's gonna be gonna be huge and and so the team went from so we had a team of about four or five people on crypto kitties until that weekend um and then right when they came back from waterloo we we uh we put a team of 15 people on it and a month later launched the product uh onto mainnet and then so we were we were part of my previous company it was called axioms and it was sort of a bootstrapped venture studio we didn't have any outside investors and so when we made dapper labs it was just it was a big decision and and the reason we did it is everybody was so excited uh back then but it was clear we had years and years of sort of the whole industry had years of work ahead and so uh we we started working with fred wilson at usv chris dickson and andreessen um and uh so you you you a capital and others jumped on board uh afterwards um when google ventures and so that was sort of the start of adapter labs um and we basically got to building um first a bunch of things on ethereum and then uh as you're saying float on top shot which i'm excited to talk about that's amazing so so i wanna mostly spend time on the future but i do want to ask an interesting question i think 2017 when all this was happening this was sort of the time where ethereum sort of came into the spotlight we were seeing a lot of things around icos and projects and the initial concepts of concepts of like what's working now whether that be dao's or some early versions of of um amms and and defy um i think what was super interesting to me about the crypto case launch was you were one of the first teams to actually blend the creative side of it with the tech and and just the level of or the amount of thinking that went into designing a user interface and a product experience that was just more um intuitive to the end user who may not necessarily know about ethereum or crypto was just amazing to see because the the star contrast was was incredible could you talk us through like what actually went into launching cryptokitties from designing this thing and making it friendly and sort of how that came to be after the hackathon for sure and i want to just call out the last panel uh super inspiring stuff and and that concept of those who build the future have a responsibility to shape it was literally our slogan or our sort of mission statement at axiom's end and that's why we created cryptokitties because we saw these icos and and but no one was thinking well wait a second hey how far are we like what's the actual gap between making this this thing usable and then and then two well what's where are we going to start are we really going to put leases and and you know um uh sort of homes on the blockchain is the first thing we're going to do like i don't i don't think so let's so you know let's start with digital cats and get people comfortable with it um so so you know i mean in terms of the ui honestly there's there's um there's a lot of improvements we've done with top shot and also a lot you know we're still 0.1 i think but the biggest thing we did was was trying to make sure the thing was fun at its core um and so the you know when we ran the alpha at east waterloo it was barely a front end it was just kind of a ugly interface into a smart contract uh the team had stuck uh stickers of cats onto pokemon cards and was sort of handing them out as and it was just amazing to see just to test whether people got excited and that's the key thing right in any consumer product you need to have that hook and that that's you know i don't know if there's sort of a formal framework for it but i like talking about you need to have a hook turn people's heads you need to have legs like it needs to have frequency people need to come back and and build habits around it um and then you need to have a flywheel there needs to be a reason to bring your friends to explain it to other people you need to feel cool because you're a part of something and then that that's what unlocks the real power of nft which is the owner becomes a participant in the in the community they're not just a customer that sort of comes and presses a button expects service but rather they become a contributor and and sort of that thing just snowballs and and it gets really really cool so that that's i think i would just say you know all consumer products have to have hook legs flywheel but um sort of nfts are both harder because they cost money but they're also easier because they're actual real ownership in in the community now this is super super interesting because it sort of answers one thing i was going to ask so i'll just kind of jump into that section and maybe um what i'm going to do is like i think it may be useful to just also know a little bit about the intent for how cryptokitties was designed as a game and sort of like the skill you reached um i remember at one point seeing something like a hundred thousand users um playing with the game and back then when we're looking at what's being interacted on ethereum that was like an unheard number of uh just kind of usage and that blew everybody's minds so kind of talk about the scale that you got to it and sort of how that transition into you thinking about scalable systems and we'll kind of jump into topshop yeah and the biggest thing was that when we started cryptokitties and when we started testing on mainnet breeding a cat was costs individual sense sending a cap back and forth was fractions of a cent you know ethereum was you know those were sort of the good old days right where you know you could you could get a seat at the restaurant no matter what time you showed up kind of thing and it was it was and the game was super fun and the problem was after we deployed to mainnet you know power of smart contracts it's it's it's immutable right and but the cost skyrocketed even back then 100x now it's another 10 to 20x on top and you know massive credit to ethereum for being able to operate at such high levels of congestion right like it's super impressive that that you know all these people are trying to use the the same highway and it's actually working but it's just costing too much for uh for consumer products and so you know people are buying nine dollar cats paying fifty dollars in gas fees um the economics don't work right it costs 150 bucks to or a hundred plus bucks to breed your own cats together um so so that that's i think um the the only issue but um but other than that you know there's there's the the the game was designed as to be accessible to folks there were these sort of founder cast or the first you know 100 uh that that were high priced and and they get all the headlines but the idea was if you have two of your own kitties you should be able to make kitties that like that look the way you look you want them to look and and there's so many different kind of corners and pockets of rarity and sort of collectibility so being the first to discover particular genes being the first to describe particular combinations um that that sort of thing and so you know we're super excited about crypto kitties obviously we're going to continue supporting it on ethereum i'm gonna keep giving those kitties now more functionality and things like that on flow um so so you know it's gonna be it's gonna be a good but but you know there's the problem is to design a customer experience then you have to solve the technical challenges to delivering that customer experience and so everything always takes a year longer than you have yeah just measure it twice and then double it the crypto kitty sort of paved the way for what people people can do with uh just gaming especially on blockchains i think there's a lot of creative things that came to be because we're talking about nfcs we're talking about digital art but i think you sort of made it blend of both by making everything programmable as well and i think it sort of sort of clicked a whole new uh neural pathway and then most people's heads were they talked about how you can actually make things interactive um how did that sort of transition lead you to to top shot um can you tell us a bit about what top shot is and just sort of uh how that idea came to be yeah absolutely i mean in a lot of ways top shot is simpler than crypto keys cryptokeys the genetic algorithm is on the blockchain the all of the creating a new cat is the you know the blockchain has to run the computation and mint a new kitty whereas top shot is a little more uh you know no one can create new top shots or you can't breed the the two two cards together they get packaged up into packs those packs uh are sold people open them up and then every single top shot is an individual nft um and the the scarcity is usually fixed from the start rather than in crypto keys had to kind of be discovered in a lot of ways and so much more kind of um much more collectibility and playability in crypto kitties but also more complex and and and so with tasha we kind of simplified it we said let's take the best parts of trading cards um make them better because they can be digital so it's videos instead of photos it's it's sort of interactive they're actually unity objects so you can take them into arvr in the future and and and so they're just sort of future proof in that sense um but but but you know an improved spin in the pudding the people people are uh we're doing the same transaction volume on top shot in in a week as we did in cryptokitties in the year um sometimes in a day actually last 24 hours 15 million dollars in transaction volume that's half of all of crypto kitties throughout all history um and so so it's super low friction and you know everybody talks about the high dollars but but the cool thing is more than half of the transactions are actually under 50 bucks where you know you can sell a one dollar moment they don't they're very few one dollar moments anymore but you could sell a one dollar moment and it cost five cents in in fees um and so you know that's that's um and that that actually cut goes a big chunk if it goes to the nba and the players and so they're incentivized to support the platform and and all these things so so top shot is you know it's every single top shot is an nft it's on the flow blockchain um every user account is a uh blockchain wallet but there's nothing on the website that says nft there's nothing on the website that says blockchain um and you know obviously you can go on third-party tools and it's transparent because it's on blockchain it's limited edition because it's on the blockchain they have value because they're on the blockchain but nobody needs to know they don't need to know anything about crypto to start engaging and that was really important to us absolutely i feel like uh um you're being a little bit humble here so i really want to press on sharing some some stats about how uh top shot's been growing you obviously talked about the volume as of last 24 hours but uh tell us about how these drops work and kind of the the crazy amount of traffic you get and sort of what happens in there and how you're thinking about the interest and uh and everything it's still it's still early right so we're in beta but but we're about 300 uh users that have a top shot so so it's it's um you know it's but it's growing really fast about 220 230 000 of those were in line this morning for for the all-star packs it's highly highly engaged right and so you can tell kind of when the total percentage of a user base is really into it that that's a good sign um and then there were only 30 000 packs and so what happens is some people get what they want some people don't and so then they go on the secondary marketplace and and and trade there and there's been about 400 million dollars of peer-to-peer trading on the marketplace since since we launched and we've really only been in public beta since october um and so it's it's you know super early days um but people are spending a lot of time and the best thing is like just the players and the athletes and the the the commentators and the team owners and they're all into it right they don't they they never cared about like they don't even care really about technology necessarily uh other team owners of course they do but you know it's it's that the fact that they can say hey put it on a top shot on national television that makes sense players are jumping off the court and saying i hope i made a top shot tonight they're they're adding flair to their game to to be able to get into top shot and like that that's cool that that sort of shows that you know it's it's gone beyond being you know the technology just enables that because that wouldn't be possible without blockchain it wouldn't be possible without crypto for the nba to have such a direct relationship with your fans they'd have to do it through some video game right rather than or through like facebook or wechat or something it wouldn't be real uh but now it is and it feels real to all the players and everyone involved and it's because of blockchain but nobody really even you know needs to needs to know you know how merkle trees and other things work so that's what gets us excited that's that's absolutely amazing uh you can already touched on this thing in my my next question is going to be about just what actually how did this came to be so like how do you actually pitch uh or account what the reactions do you get from like the nba or if you're approaching any interesting large party to do this type of integration where there's ip involved or there's like a whole new cell for a whole new paradigm shift what kind of what was the reaction how did this came to be um were there any concerns what did you address like that whole backstory of how this actually finalized would love to learn more yeah i mean it took it took well over a year so we started talking to them early 2018 in the beginning of cryptokitties and then uh we signed the deal sort of mid-2019 and then it took a year to actually build a product so um so so it took a year but they were great i mean they were super sophisticated brought like a multi-disciplinary team to the table and our philosophy was look we're a startup we're not going to pitch you on working with us it's do you want to do this together or not and we're going to work with one partner and is going to be the one partner that works with us most closely and is sort of most understanding that this is a new technology there are risks the timelines might change we we have to change which blockchain we're going to build on halfway through and you know all of the things that that means and so it was much more important to us that we find the right partner and it just happened to be also the best partner because you know nba is huge it's global it's culturally relevant it's young the younger fan base uh crypto savvy and so so just it worked out but my advice to startups out there is do not go bet your company on an ip partner unless they're they are you know they're they're gonna you're not gonna they're not gonna treat you like a t-shirt company right there's a high degree of risk in licensing ip and building new kinds of products and it's very important to work with the right partner no it's amazing and sort of um this is kind of what you talked about where this took quite some time to kind of work out the details for and uh and so that's the same transition we thought about uh flow itself um give us an overview of what flow is and sort of uh did you came to be um how to came to launch the blockchains or where it's headed now as a platform yeah for sure and look like i'm a huge fan of ethereum i hold uh as probably everyone and everyone here um and and our our philosophy was just we we built uh dapper wallet on ethereum we built cheese wizards and and you know maintain crypto kitties on ethereum and the idea was look there's there's so many people that want to use ethereum there's d5 products there's traders and they're spending a lot of money to use ethereum so if we want to have very cheap high volume you know high number of people but maybe each individual transaction cents for dollars um then we're gonna need to figure something else out and so we looked into layer two solutions we looked into you know we talked to every single person building layer on blockchains and and you know i i think personally i'm all for competition and like finding different ways up the mountain and so our perspective was look we're the only ones that have built out of all the people building platforms we're the only ones that have built apps on top of the platforms and so we have kind of this just ptsd and pain of sort of you know what we want to do different and nobody's really listening to us because they're like what do you cat guys know about you know how a blockchain should work or how these these you know high import highly important payment systems should work and so we said well you know and we didn't take it lightly right we had a team that did research for a year um we have advisors like dan buddy at stanford we work very closely with the injuries and crypto team uh tried to get everybody's advice and and sort of and and with flow it's a fundamentally different architecture it's not like we copy-pasted uh some code and said hey you know we just called it flow it's a new approach to scaling blockchains and we think it's a better approach for consumer products um and so we want to we want to you know put it out in the market and see what people think that's a wonderful overview and i feel like especially with top shots it's it's uh it's working and you can see this first hand um the kind of the one other thing you just sort of mentioned is that the the nba deal and top shot took quite some time and and your initial pitch was you want to work together and that sort of kept everything serial versus parallel or just being able to do more how do you actually think about that now moving forward like is kind of the approach to work with another partner for however long it takes and then we want to the next how do you kind of balance that with like what a product is versus like where flow should be headed just a little bit more insight into that would be amazing yeah look it's hard um you know everybody wants to do nfts now from like you know uh supermarket companies to politicians to you know everyone in between and so i think for us is we need we got to stay focused and the things we want to stay focused on are making sure top shot is the best product it can be and making sure flow is the best platform it can be and so the the goal the only way we can help everybody is to say well we'll give advice away and i'll tweet and sort of you know anyone who who wants to any entrepreneur working in space happy to now i'm doing angel investments some companies building on any platform you know just just to see sort of more people coming to bed and taking swings but the biggest thing is helping others be successful on flow because we think you know the tools are enabled that other people should be able to build billion dollar companies uh billion dollar brands not just licensing from brands but but creating their own companies what's the next cryptokitties what's what's the fart app for blockchain we want it to be on on flow and we want to support and make that happen so you know we're not trying to build everything in fact we're trying to find partners that are saying hey i want to be this sort of lego piece in the flow ecosystem because i want to serve consumers too and and that's kind of our mode is finding others who want to want to do we want to serve the same customers we want to serve and then say hey you want to build that great we're not going to build that in fact you know if if it's a sort of infrastructure thing we'll use yours because you know we we have so much stuff we're already doing we don't need to maintain our own like you know uh access api or our own you know minting service or our own i mean even potentially marketplace right with if you have a super advanced one with all of these sort of features maybe we'll just use it so you know we want to be kind of open to um uh partnering with folks and and that's kind of our highest priority is showing that it's not just a dapper labs thing and it's also not just a major ip thing you you can do this if you have a group of users that that have love for something and then that that sort of social value is expressed in in the economic value of the crypto assets that that sort of tie your ecosystem together it's it's i mean those words haven't been used together much but like that's a very obvious thing and it will sort of be obvious as time goes on in uh in ethereum and especially d5 we talk a lot about composability and then this is another flavor of interoperability and composability because i remember after cryptokitties launched where so many projects were fun and some professional attempts of being able to um anywhere from adding a costume or a prop on existing kitty because you can merge contracts and read stuff and i feel like obviously the ip stuff aside there's so many opportunities to make a whole big universe uh you're going to call it metaverse you can call it a much more collaborative open ecosystem um that's just i think getting started and i was just curious to understand like how do you think about composability in general like is whether that's flow or whether that's a specific product that you're working on um have your kind of thoughts change over the past few years on composability here my thoughts have not changed i think composability is as important to crypto as open source was to the internet and in the sense that you know the first generation of internet applications were just websites right and it was until it wasn't until there was enough maturity in open source that twitter and facebook and now uber and all these things can sort of just build on the shoulders of giants and put new products out although because these are closed you know they're still open source but closed data and so the the you still have to reinvent so much and you can't fight the network effects that these big companies create well that's what composability changes right the data is public the customer is in charge they can take their stuff anywhere they want and that that concept will will create a whole new uh class of software um that that will out compete every single thing that centralized because it will be exponentially faster i mean that's for sure it's just a question of when because i you know i'm i i'll talk i'll say this at an ethereum uh conference because you know most of the people watching should probably get it but you know these concepts you know most people are still in the website stage right they're like right it's dot-com it's sort of the it's the token becomes the thing rather than the application that the token is part of in a sense um and so it'll take it'll take some some time for people so but that's why we both flow the reason we think flow is necessary is because every other blockchain to scale they are using things like layer 2 or things like sharding and breaking up the network into smaller networks and what that does is that that makes composability harder it forces you to be asynchronous right if i'm talking to you and you're on a different chart i have to lock my thing up you have to lock your thing up we have to tell each other that things are locked and it takes seven eight transactions whereas right now it happens in one and so so you know i don't think there will be one chain to rule them all but i do think that large composable execution environments will uh hold network effects you know almost like app stores or or or you know maybe like i don't know what the analogy is because because it's actually freer than anything right it's still you can move it to somewhere else you can still have bridges you it's just one hop away right it's asynchrony versus versus synchrony so it's like it's fundamentally more open but there are kind of huge benefits of if you have if you're serving a common customer your customer will be better off if like on the same composable environment on the same intranet in some senses maybe yeah i don't know if internet's the not the last one but um well we i mean i have a few more questions we got one from from the audience um so there's over a thousand people um that are participating and just watching the summit which is a canadian experience designed for just the public side of it and then we have a little bit over 550 developers and and creators and artists uh hacking for the weekend and uh the question is uh is there anything on your list of things that you would like to see people build for the hackathon on the theme of nfts i'm sure there's like a master list of cool small projects you want to see but uh we're curious if you can share a couple um i would look there's so much data out there in nfts and nft collectors care about this stuff like who owned the thing before i did what else do they own and like i would love to see someone take a social approach to a block explorer because like people go through etherscan and they literally share screenshots of etherscan right that's a thing in the crypto world but that's not a thing in the in the normal world and so you know for example what's happening in top shot is you know if you if you buy a thing off of a player you know it shows up as hey you you bought it off of you know josh hart or wherever and that's that's that's viewed positively in sort of the top shot community it's almost like the player signed your thing right you got it off the player they they sort of they interact with it so what's that equivalent like not necessarily for nba players but you know for top collectors for for i don't know i just think there's such a wealth of information in in block explorers and and and i've been that's something i've been harping on for for a little while that's awesome so hopefully hopefully we'll see some attempts uh in two days on on something like this and i'll be sorry to follow up if we do and uh uh maybe one other question that i'll try my luck on um any any hints about what's coming after top shot um like i said i mean we want to make do a good job with top shot and we want to help others be successful on flow i mean we've already announced you know ufc is one of our big partners super excited about that um dr seuss um and others there are few doctors like things that are going to be lighter weight you know uh maybe kind of even more mainstream and so and so we're really excited about that but but kind of me personally and and what we're trying to put in energy behind is let's make some other folks successful uh on flow on ethereum let's help sort of uh art cross the mainstream and and be sort of something that that um you know is uh has a lot of staying power that's all i'll take it um one thing i've been asking almost all of our panelists today is uh um i think you sort of talked about this is like the dot-com sort of stage of just what the internet was uh 20 years ago and i think right now nfts sort of are being treated as as the same as just digital art and and obviously the surface is a lot larger than just being art or or sort of paintings or images um what do you kind of think um the next kind of evolution of nfts are like do you do you think there's a do we need a better definition or what can you give us a like paint us a picture for what else kind of falls into the category of entities and what people should be excited about and and how big can this uh actually get i mean i think you're already seeing nfts as like promissory notes and insurance contracts and things and you know there's been months ago but like those kinds of things just don't capture popular imagination right and things that don't capture to the imagination don't break through the noise that we all kind of live in with notifications and sort of the bubble that we already all have surround ourselves with so so so i think that those things will happen and you know real estate leases and like all these things are going to be non-tangible tokens but i think the next big sort of mindset shift when people really start to understand the power of nft is when you can use them in actual games um in sort of 3d worlds like actual video games that millions of people use if those assets start becoming real then wow like then those people's parents really understand it right and then and then those those people already understand digital ownership but now they understand the wait a second um i could do this in fortnight now this blockchain thing gives me this whole like series of right rights essentially right or property rights they're sort of they're things that we consider almost inalienable in sort of the physical world and then in the digital world we're just happy sort of giving away everything to you know the facebook star or you know uh others in the world so i i think it's going to be games i think that's going to change people's minds on like what can be nft because if my digital land can be an nft why can't my physical line be an empty if my digital you know uh loan between you and me that's that little promissory note can be an nft why can't my you know why can't my accountant sort of use that or or whatnot i just think there's gonna be years of people having to experience things in games and virtual environments before they're comfortable you know the late adopters before they're comfortable putting you know their wealth and sort of the things that they consider you know 401k and and all this stuff right like we forget that most people that that's they're still in that sort of you know most really here might have a big chunk of the wealth in crypto most people are like one to five percent even if they have any you know and so so it's sort of a and and and the other thing i i was like saying is the people that wanted to get into crypto because of the anyone who who you know isn't scared of crypto in some ways is already in crypto because you've seen it go like that for for a decade now i mean why wouldn't you be in if unless for other reasons that you're afraid of it you think it's a scam you think it's you know it's not legitimate you're no one's taking the time to explain to you and so like that's a big part of you know um i think the thing we can all do and the products we build is make it usable and sort of bring people in without them even noticing that's absolutely wonderful um that's a really cool perspective and i feel like i've uh um i've seen you sort of answer this differently in a few other interviews so what kind of says there is not even just after there's so much activity happening in this space right now the past three or four months have just been absolutely um kind of exponential on the interest that's happened in this space and if someone were to ask you is this a bubble how do you kind of think about this and how do you respond yeah look i answer it differently every time i've i've um i mean in general i think it's it's interviews work better if you're more authentic rather than sort of prepared and whatnot but but the bubble thing look like everything's available now in in some ways but then in what in what denomination are you in what sort of currency are you denominating the bubble and that's the biggest bubble of all and so what does that actually mean for for for us as entrepreneurs and builders i'm not i'm not sure um i think um what i'm trying to do is sort of put the problem right now is that in these current environments everything works you know whether you you put up you know pixelated anything or you work with any celebrity with any twitter following you put something on people will buy it and and like that's not a good you know you can do that to sort of make hay while the sun shines but i think it's good to focus on hey what's coming over the horizon what are the fundamentals and let's sort of ignore the noise and and escape to where the puck is going um and so in some sense i don't care if it's a bubble or not i think if you're an entrepreneur you should raise money right now that's that's that's one like is it a bubble well you should raise money so maybe that's the answer um but but look i think fred airson put this really well peak euphoria helps people see the future and and like right now is a time when people are sort of you know poking their head around like wait a second all of these things that we took for granted maybe we shouldn't take them for granted and that process is going to work several months and people's minds will be blown that wait a second we can have software that we can have a stake in and and dao's haven't even started going to public consciousness the idea that as individuals we don't need anybody to help us govern a thing we can govern it directly right like ancient greece democracy instead of you know uh uh whatever system we have today um but but then people are gonna realize wait a second the tech's still not there yet we still need mass adoption right like you need you need uh you know a billion uh wallets in a billion people's pockets before they can start voting on things right like there's it's gonna take a little bit of time to sort of deliver what people expect um but that's a good thing about entrepreneurs we can sort of ignore that the surface or waves and just you know keep keep kind of keep swimming towards the right destination i'm mixing all the analogies today this is no this is working really well in your favor so don't don't worry i think one of the other answers you've kind of talked about in the past is that i think in most cases bubble imply and exit and uh and if you talk to a lot of people especially the ones that are collecting it uh they're not interested in selling um legitimately wanted and and uh the demand is for people wanting to own it not because they are they can get like direct money from it or they want to flip it and and that's been the change that it's very noticeable if you have seen the past few years of how this piece has evolved and to me that's a really good sign on on seeing this actually becoming more mainstream and topshop is definitely one of the key players in making that possible and putting that in front of hundreds of thousands of people um yeah nft is that to be clear nfts are the least bubbly of the bubble uh that i believe in despite the high numbers yep that's sounds really fair um that's all i had honestly i feel like this is a pretty good note to end on i don't want to jump into a bunch of other tangents i feel like my takeaway from this entire conversation is that you started from an experiment and that became a feature that we're all here experiencing and on top of all that i feel like gaming and just the thought that's been put into designing these products has sort of become i feel like the de facto way of getting people to care about decentralization without having to worry about the technicality of what that means and and to me that's absolutely incredible it all started at a youth global hackathons so i i can't wait to see what comes out this weekend we have 500 people specifically building in this realm and uh let's hope the next few years are set up for even a much bigger wave of creative ideas so raham thank you so much for uh for chatting with us today and uh we'll be sure to tell you what comes out of this take care everybody so much and with that we are finally at an end for our nfc summit i want to especially thank zora for being our presenting sponsor and and being with us on helping curate this content and all the talks that we've done together um i want to thank all few hundred of you who've been around this entire day interacting with us talking to us on discord and on our tv chat and just what i'll do is i'll just stop talking and uh i want to just say thank you so much and and happy hacking uh we'll all be on discord now there'll be a lot of talk still going on today and tomorrow but we'll see all of you back here on sunday with our finalists for this hackathon so thanks so much and i hope you have a great rest of the weekend and happy hacking one more time
