foreign [Applause] [Music] going to the next into the next uh panel which I'm particularly excited about as well um I've already mentioned it we need to talk about the social political realities of these Technologies and particularly about agencies especially because web3 is so much about language about Agency for for for communities that had no agency in in the platform capitalist age that we hopefully exit at some point and for that we teamed up with a wonderful organization that'll encourage you all to follow mutual love um Anova and Alex will be hosting uh from Mutual law of this conversation um unfortunately one of our participants could not make it but we still have Lee from super rare Zach from the Korean Museum of digital art uh Raymond from the 50 millimeter Collective Jack from polygon and my colleague and friend gem from Zora and they are going to talk about trans and queer and cultural and economic ecosystem so on chain so I think we're good to go live and I'll just hand over the microphone and the video space to Anova and Alex and all the participants please enjoy friends um hello everybody how's everyone doing I'm excited to be here so let's kick it off let's do this thanks everyone hey everyone my name is Anova kalawar you see him pronouns and I'm in New York City I'm the co-founder of mutual love the nft marketplace and what three ecosystems

Equity activist we are so excited to be here today representing mutual love thank you Zora and Eve Global for having us at metabolism this year and thank you to this incredible brilliant group of trans and queer web 3 Visionary leaders for making the time to be in conversation today we are so grateful to know you and to be building alongside all of you awesome hey everybody my name is Alex Guerra I use he him pronouns and I live in Austin Texas uh I am one of the co-founders of mutual love as well um as a content creator and Community Builder um as a trans man myself I'm super excited to be here having this conversation with other trans and queer people in the web 3 space it is much needed and very refreshing so we're going to start out with some introductions from our amazing panelists here um starting with Lee uh then Zach Raven Jack and then gem if y'all could just start with names intros pronouns creative territorial practice and what you do in Webster so I'll pass it out to Lee yeah it's an absolute pleasure to be here with everyone and sharing um In This Very uh queer happy space within web three it's just it's so exciting it tickles me fancy but um so like said uh lee Knight I use they them pronouns um I was with the uh I was working as one of the technical community manager or super rare now that's kind of transitioned more into Dei initiatives within uh within super rare space and then also I do a lot with East Denver and so I've been working on that and building that out as well so if you're coming to East Denver please let me know and we can get things happening um and uh yeah I've been in the space since 2017 and so just trying to make the world a better place for for artists thanks so much Lee hi my name is Zach crevit um I originally entered the webview space as an artist um oh my pronouns are they them I'm located in Brooklyn New York um so I have been a photographer for years and years and years was just really dissatisfied with the traditional Gallery space and when I found web3 I just had so much more power and control over my work there um originally started as a photographer but have transitioned into working a lot with AI really heavily um throughout that sort of Journey I kind of just noticed that there really wasn't a lot of representation for queer and trans creators um you know institutions kind of holding them up so I along with some of my friends in the space founded the queer Museum of digital art cumoda which is essentially a preservation effort um you know collecting work preserving work long term permanently and displaying and uplifting queer artists in the space so we're really a group dedicated to you know hyping up and collecting from queer and trans artists and um it's been a journey thanks for having me hey everybody thank you so much first and foremost for your time and energy and thank you Alex and nuba for this opportunity as well as youth Global my name is Raven tremel AKA Raven 50 millimeter my pronouns are he him I'm a photographer and Community Builder um out based in Los Angeles and aside from my Artistry building the 50 millimeter Collective with Chelsea quintella our co-founder and an incredible artist in her own right has been a major Focus currently within my journey in the nft space last year I did a lot of experimenting with mentioning my photography and towards the end of last year really leaned into the 50 millimeter Collective which is an nftr Collective founded by bypoc lgbtqia artists who are dedicated to providing resources and opportunities to historically underrepresented communities We Believe diversity and inclusion should be the Forefront of web3 as it is a global market and we also believe that being an artist for a living shouldn't be some on a table unobtainable dream and our goal is to fuse together culture community and curation to further uplift and enrich the global art world and so yes that's a bit about myself and the collective and thank you all again for having um for having me here thank you so much everyone it's such a pleasure to be here I'm so honored to have been asked to speak at this panel it's really important my name is Jack ayushi her pronouns uh I am based here in Los Angeles during my day I work at polygon I'm a community development manager there at polygons I oversee the ecosystem of the blockchain um and my the the real work what uh the real fun work that I really enjoy is all of my artistic practices that um nfts and crypto kind of found this beautiful outlet for this uh this really deep work so I'm a dancer and I work with a motion capture uh project that will be bringing that uh data information to blockchain which is really exciting a good marketing so more about that later um and then the other initiative that I work for is I'm also a musician and I work for an extension of a web three of a record label a web 3 extension of a record label that already exists here in Los Angeles and it's a it's core its core root is uh uh uplifting underrepresented genre and genres and people so um really finding the the outlets for some of these Expressions that don't normally get uplifted and by people that are historically uh under represented in this space so that's kind of the work that I'm doing as well it gets me I I'm John my pronounce it I'm gonna sing a songwriter generative artists and people stag uh creative technologists and I also work at Zora Jane developer relations I guess my you know the thing that I'm stuck on is I'm as a technologist having access to a medium that is essentially forever and I think that is just such a powerful concept to be playing with when we consider queer and trans and other marginalized voices so I'm just so excited to be working on technology with other people who really seem to be building a primitive extremely long-time meaningful storytelling amazing what a great note to end off Segways perfectly into the first question so thank you all for uh sharing a little bit about yourselves and we'll just we'll just get right into it um just broadly for our audience we're going to touch on archives building Community First and gate breaking on chain today with these uh leaders and creators um and um we're just gonna let uh the conversation flow uh with these three questions so I'm gonna kick it off um a lot of Our intention at Mutual is informed by the concept of archiving and instigating trans and queer cultural and economic equity and Legacy on the future of the internet the concept of archives interns and queer communities is nuanced many histories have been suppressed by non-benetic forces but trans and queer creators have been around impacting culture since the beginning of time we are ancient and sacred beings we archive in community and creative practice in incredible multifaceted and Multicultural Legacies in a world of surveillance sensors and Shadow bands and a future impacted by automation metaverse Tech and more how does building on chain shift the concept of the queer archive from your unique perspective and how does that inform your practice as a Creator and contributor in web3 we would love to start this convo off with Zach from kimoda sure so this is um something that is completely Central to our project um in a lot of my work um sort of before this and now so during was with AIDS activism and when you work in AIDS activism what you hear over and over and over again is how much was lost the people of course tragically but their artwork right their creation their music um so much of that was lost um there was an effort at the time when people would pass for friends and family members to preserve the work um sometimes that work would be donated to various galleries or museums um and um it was safe for a time you know what we've heard from these from from artists involved in this process and from these institutions is that um they are no longer really safeguarding these works a lot of the works are ending up out on the street because either the institution has changed their mind as the value of the work or they no longer have room to store the work um or whatever the reason may be it's just not a permanent and safe solution so with that in mind that was really Central to creating a permanent archive on chain um you know even even long after I am here right there will still be this blockchain record of these works who it's by when it was made what mediums are in there and I think that is is so important is something that is really unique to the space you know we've seen how vulnerable um artwork is to to time um and we've seen legacies lost we've seen creativity loss we've seen culture destroyed in this sense um so yeah so for me um this this on-chain aspect is is everything I mean that was what really kind of gave us the um you know the courage to do something like this because if it wasn't for unchain technology a blockchain technology there's no way I could store all these works or guarantee that I wouldn't move in some time and I'd have to deal with like where they go safely you know are they being damaged by weather or by you know mold or even these these kinds of things or whether someone's just going to put them out on the street so um yeah it is it is Central to to what we're building and I think is really Central to preserving the legacy of trans and queer people um globally yeah if I can chime in for a hot second um yeah I mean I think that like absolutely I'm in complete agreement with what Zach has just said and he you know was very well put but I think that even like on a on a grander scale uh or let me back up um before I became a software engineer I double majored in art history and music and I'm a trump bonus and an electronic musician and then you know I'm touring and playing and all that stuff and so I you know people come to town they call me up hey you want to sit in with us hey we're in town recording you want to record with us like I have been screwed out of like so much not even talking about royalties just credit just credit to be able to say this is what I did and to be able to prove that um and I mean just why is it so hard to just get your name added at the end of the discography um and so with that in mind with web3 with being able to preserve what you have contributed to like one of the first projects that I was contributing to when I first went web3 space was eujo um and you know it was fantastic to be able to see everyone who was responsible for getting a track um developed and being able to even see like the royalty splits of how of how that broke down it's just uh you know it gave me hope for artists and musicians but I just throw them all into the category of artists it's giving me further hope for artists in the future to be able to preserve what you have spent you know I started playing trombone when I was 10. and I have spent so much time mastering that craft but like nobody really unless you are a musician nobody really understands what it what it takes to be able to uh to be skilled at what you're what you're doing um they just think like oh you're just musician you can show up you can just do this thing here's twenty dollars call again at the end of the day I'm like bro like to be able to play this like little thing that caught like you know sit in yeah you you play some air trumpets don't do it you want me to figure it out uh you know that took me 20 years to be able to do that you know it's not sure you only see the top the front end of that because you know I'm skilled position and it looks easy but you know that took time and practice and to be able to preserve that and then you know to be able to demonstrate what your your history is without worrying about it being uh misconstrued or just like simply just taken off uh is what web3 is able to offer in ways that web 2 is so limited and is so this stuck in the in the past and so um you know this this ultimately it's just so so much more hope is now accessible for preserving the integrity and the work that musicians and artists have uh you know spent so much shed tears and blood over to accomplish um and you know being able to share that just like the Click of a button so I'll I'll add on to that because I'm a musician as well and I definitely know people do not understand that you know what you're seeing is like the culmination of these 20 years uh this five minutes that I totally killed it is 20 years of practice you know to be able to do that um it's also the same with um with dancers uh I had I recently hosted a panel with polygon and I showcased one of my dancer friends and people were very Blown Away by the fact that you could put dance in if T's on the internet but it was a way to capture value it's a way to for for people who have never been able to capture any value uh to find this value going back to like the concept of the archive um here in Los Angeles at USC there is a queer and gay archive at USC called one archive so I went there and it's only one type of person which is like the stereotypical like Thomas Finland uh like white gay man from the certain era there was one little corner of lesbians and I was like this is not enough this is not enough this is not enough representation this is not intersectional at all um fortunately I was there because a friend of mine was uh showing uh and displaying and pointing that fact out um and it was called the show is called The Invisible archives by Prima janikandra who is a non-binary um performative lecturist and sculptures um going just going back again to the archive they had to have all of this permission to do all of this work in at USC blah blah blah blah long story short web 3 enables you to do this all permissionlessly which is the hugest like paradigm shift that we've ever seen we've always had to ask for permission we've always had to fight just to express ourselves even visually it's exhausting and so web3 is this like almost like this Outlet like all of these things that all of these songs that I sat on all of this work that I've sat on that I've been waiting for a gallery I don't have to wait anymore I could just put it up on the marketplace so that is where the equity of the technology comes into play for me and if I can touch one more time on uh the queer archive I think that it is so important for our histories I mean like if you kind of go back um so I'm also I'm also a bull rider and so like I compete in Western Sports and um and so America thinks that bull riders at Cowboys are blonde hair blue eyes and like everything has been written out in terms of you know black cowboys Rancheros like all of this has just been completely erased to fulfill what Hollywood has uh deemed attractive and so with these archives you can preserve these histories in ways that you well two things you can preserve it in ways that you haven't been able to do it before but then secondly you have the opportunity to to preserve it and to to share and so I think that's like one of the bigger things is like getting more people into this space so that we have another chance to write histories in ways that are actually authentic and more meaningful but then we know that they will be preserved and so you know it's just building up our uh Community with other like-minded individuals so that it doesn't happen again like we have the opportunity to actually progress and not be stuck in the trends of what has historically happened um in the world amazing um cool Raven gent do you want to add anything if not we can move on to the next question that kind of segues into um yeah I do want to um I just really loved what uh lee just said about how important this opportunity is um and I feel like that's like what I what I personally stress the most is you know as a um trans man as a black Trans man in America like this this is this is really our shot like a lot of a lot of um historically underrepresented communities have been just pushed aside and kind of honestly forgotten and not considered um and this is within this space you're able to create the the opportunities for yourself and for your communities for you're able to with those opportunities Empower people and that creates hope and hope is unmatched you know like that can that fuels you and that that motivates you to to keep on going so this it's it's so important and I just have to like shout out each and every one of us who are here in this space as as people who you know are usually an after your thought we're here every day and like doing doing what needs to be done to enrich our communities and it is it is a constant Grime but I'm just really I just have to acknowledge that and just say like I'm proud of all of us you know like we're we're really here um we're really here doing what needs to be done and shout out to all of y'all um for that so thank you that was so beautiful Raven I guess like the thing that I want to add to that is that you know as I'm as a species like we are animals that tell stories right that's that's that's kind of that's kind of who we are and so our mythology is carry us and I think you know I needed myself in the past we've seen what happens um when specific um political groups banned books and try to erase history and I think with you know honestly I think we're seeing maybe I'm maybe like some of that energy coming back into the world and I think that's scary but we need these stories to um Prevail and that is and it's not just we're stories but I think where stories have been so often left out of this but you know I think what the blockchain offers is the chance to preserve stories of Hope and of optimism and of like utopian Visions to carry us through whatever kind of period we might be coming into in history and I think it's I'm quite special to know that whatever Liza had I'm the hope and the optimism that we can encode into the blockchain is are books that can't be burned so anything that's just a really powerful concept amazing I'm I'm just in awe of everybody here so thank you for sharing um just beautiful words and wisdom um amazing so you know speaking of you know communities and and all that you know we're super dedicated to building Community First um at mutual love and it's something that we've both been doing in our careers in general um so it comes very naturally and we think of the blockchain as a tool to reflect the already existing queer and trans ecosystem and further amplify and connect communities that are underpaid or even underbanked um Mutual Aid is part of these ecosystems and blockchain can be a tool to build generational equity and access across borders um so from your perspective how can Building on-chain Solutions effectively amplify trans and queer Creator and cultural economies and I think we'll start with Raven here um all right okay I'm sorry can you repeat the last just the last part of the the question for me please yeah yeah absolutely so just you know from your perspective um how can Building on-chain Solutions effectively amplify the trans and queer economies that I guess already exists um you know and how can blockchain kind of just amplify that like Mutual Aid um you know equity and all that stuff that we are so often looking for as as a community okay thank you I think um I think we touched on it um I'm not quite sure who it was earlier but uh talking about all of this ecosystem being permissionless and us being in control of um the ways in which we want to use all of these really powerful tools such as blockchain such as nfts social tokens um and I think we can I think as artists and as already creative beings we're able to really use um use these tools in creative ways to not only on board but also encourage our communities um for example um with with 50 millimeter Collective we have a 50 millimeter social token so with every ready wear purchase each consumer earns 10 50 millimeter tokens and with those tokens you'll once will have a Marketplace built out and only sell things on that Marketplace 450 millimeter tokens and you can earn tokens from participating in Twitter spaces or being in the Discord it's not always about um who has the most money or who can collect all these nfts to unlock this this other other thing over here or whatever it's it's more about okay who are the community members who really see the vision and want to um and want to contribute to to helping build the vision and those are the uh contributors who are rewarded with social tokens and therefore can you know who know the social token aspect they're so like we'll there's a lot of possibilities within this you know web3 space in general but so with social tokens I just feel um I had I had an example of like the ovofs tickets were like I don't even know like two thousand dollars I don't I don't remember how much they were they're so crazy expensive though but I just threw out an example of like if Drake had uh OVO social token where his fans got you know x amount for downloading his album listening to tracks for buying merch whatever and then they could contribute some of those tokens to the sale of those tickets rather than selling their computers or doing wild things to to get that to get that um ticket money that's just like you know one example of how this ecosystem can be Equitable for for a larger um a broader audience in broader community so there are also you know parts of the world where being a part of the queer Community being represented at any sort of uh you know clear capacity is very illegal um and so there are so many like just like a very simple like basic example is you know trying to create some sort of um queer Alliance or a community in one of these places where it is illegal and you need funding and if you cannot create a bank account affiliated with the actual name of what you're doing because it is illegal and then like it could be tracked and uh and you are blocked before you can even start and so by being able to utilize um you know any any of uh you know Unchained marketplaces or any like anybody can send you funds and you don't have to lie about it just simply straightforward like here it is and these funds are accessible um on like you know applying for a bank account then needing to be approved for your bank account and then how are you going to actually extract those funds and all that just like very simply being able to receive financial support in other ways where in other situations where if you're going the traditional route you would be blocked before you could even start or even to you know make your case and so there are uh you know from a foundational level of being able to start your organization web 3 offers a solution yeah and I think that we're also getting to kind of the heart of the problem which is like that conversion you know I think that on-chain Solutions are amazing but I think that if we're talking about underbanked or unbaked people until there is a system for housing and food um you know Common Goods that were really will accept these on-chain tokens be they either polygon or or a social token from a from a group um I I think until we reach that point I think it's going to be really hard to um have these Unchained Solutions go as as far as I really need to go to truly solve this problem so I think that you know there really needs to be um some some Incredible Minds out there and I think people are working on this but I don't think we've really quite solved it yet um that would really address housing first and foremost um and allow these interactions and these accumulation of tokens whether it be from from you know actions like Raven mentioned or from selling nfts to go directly into uh food and housing so I I think that we have a long way to go but I think that there are some really incredible people um working on this problem um you know and or banking systems that can guarantee privacy and safety to queer and trans people um that will allow this this sort of system to happen to to extract those funds um you know love it or hate it we just saw what happened with tornado cash um and you know there's there's a clear kind of Crackdown on financial privacy happening and um that was really a big setback you know tornado cash is obviously Rife with its own problems but it did ensure a certain amount of safety for the types of people that we are talking about and the situations they're talking about so privacy tools um and mass adoption for common goods I think really needs to happen for on-chain solutions to truly Empower our communities yeah I mean I think like a the bigger thing like none of this is going to happen unless we get more people like with massive Mass adoption is like the first step and then we're actually probably like education but then mass mass adoption um and so like but we all need each other we all need to share with each other and support each other and then I think with and you know if you're creating a doubt like actually use your Dow properly it's not just a buzzword like there are actual uh components to it that officially make it a doubt and how you operate and like actually you know needing quorum to you know move move a proposal uh but I think that again these like foundational elements to create a future that will be more sustainable and safer for individuals within the queer Community are accessible but we need that education to onboard people and the mass adoption so that it is a vial so that people don't think that it's not a viable um option for you know transferring funds or ideas or projects um I mean if you can think it you can make it and so we just need everybody like it's just a little bit of Kool-Aid drink it it's fine so join us come hither on that Jack did you want to speak uh okay sure oh oh no worries no worries yeah I just don't need it uh yeah no I think it's it comes down to like uh if you make a a space that is hospitable to our concerns and to our perspectives and the where they have space to live and and be heard and be seen that's really going to draw a lot more people to the space as well beyond being like educated and Beyond finding this place of belonging it's also just holding space and I would say like in order for in order for the community to embrace this technology more I think we can just all embrace our own fairness more and really dive into like what makes us safe and what makes us feel good and and really find moments to Showcase those attributes in the community because I think I think we're all sort of um in ingredients that values alignment is much more important than any sort of other like facet that may come up that may be in alignment because if you're about in the your values are are aligned then everything else can fall into place but um going back to how this uh on-chain building can change the way that we show up in these spaces um it goes back to the permissionlessness and the immutability of these archives of these uh Records so uh just keep making that that beautiful queer welcoming space and we'll just have more archive more to add to the archives because of it thank you um we have about 14 minutes left um Jen did you want to say anything about this topic before we move on to our last couple questions feel pretty good on that last one okay awesome so um as we've talked about what you know uh hope and optimism and embedding our values and our cultural alignments and on chain also accessibility and education and storytelling has come up so um we talk a lot about accessibility and gate breaking and mutual love um and like many of you have noted a lot of the concepts in web3 are fairly inaccessible onboarding is also a very broad term there's Community Building storytelling ux it's content Bridge applications Etc so we would love to hear you know from your perspective what actual accessible onboarding looks like for the global lgbtq Community or even the local communities that you are part of from your perspective and uh one tip you'd give to a queer trans Creator or contributor entering web 3 in the audience today I would love to start with Jack for this question sure I think we have to be very mindful of intersectionality I think that's the only way forward and the only way that we can really truly understand the perspective globally is by listening to the people who are living those experiences directly so I find that you know embrace your queerness create this beautiful queer space but also you know and ensure that you are honoring where people are coming from it and making space for that as well so that I do see as um sort of like a core a core uh negative how we will on onboard the math is educate the masses really just feels Community it's really just building Community because once once everyone's on the same page um then you really you really can go very far and then you have other stewards of the community to to spread that great word as well so really just creating space and creating a welcoming environment is really going to take us so much further than than anyone else and I'm totally convinced of that because this is our chance it's like Raven said like this is our chance this is our moment and as artists and as queerful we're not gonna let that just slip away we'll fight for it that's all I have to say about math adoption I think I think my tip would be um you know take a holistic approach to your education you know um it's not just learning about smart contracts or just learning about this one thing or that one thing but you really have to at least in the beginning kind of be a um you know have a really holistic approach you know so I would say you know study marketing study smart contracts study social media study Community Management like I think taking at least um a a dip into all of those topics will serve you a lot more than just focusing on one in particular um you know I think that's what's missing in a lot of web through education is that there is there's education for okay how to write a smart contract but then okay maybe you've written your smart contract and you want to sell some of your artwork but then you're you're sort of lost when it comes to marketing um so yeah just really kind of embracing all different aspects um so that you can be you know Community is incredible but at the same time there's so much um Power to be found in being able to cover all these aspects and then linking up with other community members that are also kind of talented in a lot of different places I think where I would add to that is I'm you know I'm for everyone involved like let's be really conscious of what we're on boarding people to and what types of tools that we're recommending people use I realize that as a new coming to this space sometimes you know there is a lot of jargon and it's being thrown around and sometimes it's hard to like figure out like the differences between different platforms and stuff that you know in general I feel like if someone is trying to sell you something they're lying to you if someone is you know making you certain promises they might be lying to you like all I can say is like I try and Trust in decentralized and permissionless tools I try and Trust in systems that don't have Gatekeepers even if there are experienced people around to help you learn that should always be entirely democratized so you know I guess I at this point like I kind of have to plug Zora because I feel like that's what we're trying to do is just give people access um to the best tools that we are making for ourselves and hoping you back with those but we're not trying to sell you anything and we're not trying to sell you on anything other than giving you the tools to succeed based on honestly like based on the spirit of your own work and I think that is that is the magic that people always bring to the space no matter how experienced they are in web 3 or in crypto like there are some unique Magic that is inside everyone and I think that's the thing that we're excited about seeing and these are just like these are the technical tools to help people out it's a piggyback off of what gem just said um you know the the unique Magic that you have within yourself right and if you're new to web3 space I think a lot of the tools can seem very daunting and surprising and then you think that your magic is not as magical as you once thought it is it still is uh and so and that's okay you're learning something you're learning something that's I mean if you if you were a brilliant at it like you showed up and you're like I know everything then why why aren't you running the world um but so like aside from that like it's okay to be in that place where you need help and it's okay to ask for help um and so like one of the things that I would do at East Denver uh is I put together a number of talks to help people get into the space and you know a very the general term of you know onboarding like these are people who don't have wallets don't have any crypto like so walk them through the process walk them through adding tokens to their wallet so that they have some Foundation no rinsing of what it is to be within the space and then dropping them some uh some crypto so that they have they can interact in the space it's you know it's like one thing like hey go get it get set up get your wallet going good luck to you see you see you at this conference make sure you're in the hackathon it's like that's a lot it's a big very big ask and so you know be willing to share what you have learned I'm not saying give all your time but if you can share so that people can learn and ask questions that's how I got into the space a friend took me out to brunch and just we went through everything step by step by step and then before I knew it now I'm like helping out run run east Denver um and then secondly the biggest tip that I have do what makes you feel good do what excites you because if you're excited about what you're doing then you're willing to do the work to figure out the components of how of what you're interested in operates you know um and so like hey you want to create an nft but you know nothing about blockchain but you're an artist okay start creating your work how do I get this out of blockchain oh I need a wallet how do I like all these pieces will come into play that and you will have you know that your route will be laid out for you on how to understand what you need by following what interests you so if you're excited about something follow it love that Raven do you want you we have like a minute okay but I want to give you the floor go for it yeah thank you um I'll I guess my my tip would would be to um just be intentional with with where you're placing your energy within various communities and things like that it can be a um the space can be a lot there's a lot of information there's a lot going on it's very fast um give yourself some Grace to like Lee said ask the questions it's okay to that's like encouraged here people are hype when when when people don't know things and they can be like oh well here's how you know I can help you or here's this information and um definitely tap in with the 50 millimeter Collective I've made a handful of YouTube videos uh foundational tips that I wish I knew when I got into this space how to set up a metamask there's a we have a metamask tutorial and also a tutorial on how to get 50 millimeter social tokens in your wallet um so finding different resources like that provided
