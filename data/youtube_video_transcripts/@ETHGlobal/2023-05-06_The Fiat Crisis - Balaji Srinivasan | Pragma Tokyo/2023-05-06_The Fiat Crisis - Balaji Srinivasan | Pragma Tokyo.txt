foreign [Music] I know all of you been waiting for this one so let's get right to it that is our last interview of the day our next speaker is Balaji as we mentioned in the morning a lot of things happened last minute so he wasn't able to make his flight in person but we managed to get this setup on zoom in addition to a online a video they recorded about the actual Fiat crisis we're going to cover that he's been talking about for quite some time so what we have next is a quick 15 minute video that I recorded about everything and then immediately after that we're gonna do a extended q a with him where we get to ask all of our questions directly and without further Ado let's welcome well let's play the video and then we'll welcome biology after the video very soon so let's give that up folks uh today I'm here to talk to you today about what I think is coming in 2023 and you know the timing is always hard to predict uh but I do think we're at the beginning of something whether it transpires in months or Years or or longer than that we will see but I think we're on the verge of something that's not simply a financial crisis but a Fiat crisis where what fails on the other side isn't unfortunately just Banks but governments and uh you know without further Ado let me kind of describe what I think uh the context uh for what's coming today is um the ongoing economic poly crisis and how we might be able to adapt all right so uh let's take a look at some slides so the concept today is the Fiat crisis what if the long term is now okay and this is a slide from Ray dalio's uh video The Changing World Order which depicts the US in decline in a rising China and some has also added Bitcoin over here and essentially I think what that conveys is that the future order is not simply just replacement by another Reserve currency but a multi-polar order where for example let's say the Renminbi takes on or the uon rather takes on medium exchange along with the Indian rupee and Bitcoin takes on store value and ethereum is you know maybe the financial system and all of them can test the US dollar system of control and then we have all kinds of you know decentralized exchange stuff for for exchange rates so it's not just that the dollar quote fails and goes away and has a single replacement but it's multiple replacements it gets unbundled in a sense okay so that I think is one of the potential long-term outcomes but first let me talk about what the crisis is what if the long term is now and what is the long term so let's talk context crisis and then change context we kind of know if you're an American if you have even a glancing familiarity with the US that the U.S national debt is unpayable it's passed 31 trillion dollars 238 000 for every family this is far in excess of U.S household savings or what have you and uh that national debt just keeps getting larger and larger this is a graph uh that someone made where you know this is showing you know annual tax revenue this is like you know deficit and the debt gets added to by a number of measures um but it's just being expanding across parties for a long time and now it's many many full larger than even Revenue each year which would mean um it would take quite a long time to pay it off even if all the tax revenue each year was devoted to the debt it won't be so this debt just keeps expanding okay and the thing is though investors know the United States can pay the debt because it's doing its own currency so it can always print the money someday okay when that day comes if that day comes that's called monetizing the debt and because it basically spends down the uh full faith and credit of the US government and it pays the debts it's one dollar for one dollar but it prints so many dollars at the purchasing power the dollar is gone that would be the end of this financial system in the beginning of the next uh Ray Dalia wrote a whole book on this in a video which talks about how this is coming in the Nazi distant future it's called principle for dealing with the changing world order I recommend you read it but he kept it abstract he kept it with cartoons and so on which was good because sort of distanced it from from daily events uh but but go and watch that and then you know start replacing the cartoons in those videos with with real events um and uh and perhaps that long-term future is now so uh that gets to the crisis there's basically an economic poly crisis underway meaning many you know poly meaning many okay multiple simultaneous crises where the whole is greater than some of the parts and I want to start with the banking crisis which tech people should be familiar with it killed Silicon Valley Bank let's start with that first okay so the first question is how did Silicon Valley Bank die how did this 40 year old bank with 200 billion dollars in assets just go to zero overnight we depositors getting no warning whatsoever from Regulators okay so people queuing up outside these things should be in business for so many years just literally just died in like two days it wasn't a continuous process it was digital at the end just it was one and then zero so how did it die and the answer is it was killed along with many other Banks First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank Are Not Alone look at lots of other Banks they all show the same pattern of gigantic unrealized losses starting in 2022 which essentially you know make make the bank having having negative equity okay meaning it has uh in this case the technical term would be um it's uh its assets on a mark to Market basis are insufficient to pay for its withdrawals even more than the typical fractional Reserve situation so the bank was killed but how did all of these Banks die at the same time and who is a killer well you know we know that if if lots of banks are near insolvency and hundreds are already fully insolvent how did lots of banks die this is not a single Bank problem it's not One Bank making bad decisions about tech Investments it's all the banks or many banks so the answer is the killer was the Central Bank okay this is now starting to be admitted how fed shrapnel killed Silicon Valley Bank but it's more than shrapnel it's more like the main bomb was targeted on the banking system the Central Bank the FED bankrupted many banks and then I know this sounds crazy but the Central Bank the banks and the bank regulars literally covered this up until SV blew up after which the FED printed more money to cover it up okay so let me kind of show you how that happened okay that sounds incredible but here's a sequence of events first the Federal Reserve sold a ton of bonds in 2021 there's there's backdrop to this further as printed money during covet banks are binging on bonds but not because they want you this is August 2021. Banks and all these other financial institutions loaded up on super safe government bonds because you know Consumer loans you know uh weren't there people weren't taking out um taking out loans since um they had so much printed money so Banks Benjamin bonds the FED print of money and projected low rates forever then it hiked rates all the way to the moon now you don't need to know too much about like you know the fed or what have you to know that if you hike interest rates up very very fast uh well all the bonds that you sold over here they were giving like 0.1 or one percent or whatever interest um it's not exactly this rate but it's like a related rate let's say it's a one percent something interest you sold the bonds over here now bonds you're selling are like four or five percent interest in just a few months which means these old bonds are relatively much less valuable and so that just destroyed devalued all the portfolios essentially what happened is they sold a bunch of assets these bonds and then immediately devalued them dramatically and what that did is it caused uh enormous losses across the entire banking industry that the Fed was aware of uh that instantly killed hundreds of banks so for example at the end of 2021 they're only four Community Banks that were you know let's call it insolvent to just to you know to give a um locally understandable version by June 30th there was 300 33 and this is a publication by the Federal Reserve Bank so how did this number increase by 75x in six months it's because the FED basically killed the banks but with these rate hikes they even admitted the rising interest rate environment has led to unrealized loss positions a Fed killed the Central Bank killed the Community Banks okay and and this is from the FED itself we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars in losses this is a graph from FDIC okay this is like you know negative 620 billion dollars in losses that's an official FDIC estimate unofficial estimates 2.2 trillion in losses that's the Sanford estimate okay uh but wait there's another number which is maybe it's more like 18 trillion is it all Bank deposits we don't even really honestly know what the number is that's all Bank deposits an estimate of it and it is being floated that the FED would just basically print money to backstop everything um not you know not just 250 000 but all 18 trillion and of course this is something which the FED caused this problem so you know quote doing a bailout it's not something which is like a normal bill it's not like the bank took a risk that was some atypical risk the FED killed all the banks if it was One bank it's a bank problem if it's all the banks Central Bank problem so this is like you know printing money to solve the problem the FED itself created so the thing is the exact number we don't know what the number is is it is it a 620 billion is it 2 trillion is it tens of trillions uh or 10 18 trillion don't know we do know is the printing has resumed in Earnest with something called a bank term funding program and there's going to be more programs that will follow and there is no cap okay this basically this is something where uh they they are in my view we're an in-game so that's that's a lot but it's actually just the start of the cascading poly crisis so the economic poly crisis there's a debt ceiling crisis so the market estimated probability of sovereign default to the US is at an all-time high because of the debt ceiling vote that's coming up since January 19th the U.S has uh not been able to issue bonds because it's debt ceiling and there's a huge fight over this coming up okay um there's a municipal crisis blue states and cities are going to be bankrupt without money printing there's a Wall Street Journal article the coming Biden bill out of blue states and cities all those 300 million bus lanes coming due there's a bond crisis it's not just banks that bump the bonds lots of other all bondholders who bought bonds before 2022 were crushed there's the commercial real estate crisis Morgan Stanley and is forecasting something worse than in the great financial crisis for commercial real estate by the way the great financial crisis is pretty bad that was one thing arguably it's actually more than one thing but if this is worse than that and this alone took down the economy the world economy well commercial real estate there's a North stream crisis basically the bombing of the pipeline in Europe it is now being widely reported that the U.S did it um Seymour Hirsch had an article that came out basically hasn't really been knocked down and a lot of people in the European Parliament believe this is true this is seven Doug dildon I'm probably pronouncing mispronouncing that but a German elected official saying that hey actually we need to we need to look at this the German government needs to see whether or not North stream was blown up by The Americans so European allies like France and Germany are breaking away from the US over the economic damage that's being caused to them then of course relatedly there's a Ukraine crisis uh you know only the order of 100 billion dollars in new expenditure plus obviously massive cost to human life global trade all these things there's a Taiwan crisis another potential massive new expenditure for for the US and the world in the middle of these existing budget crises there's a deolorization crisis this is a whole slide deck in its own right but it's um it's a number of different countries it's China Russia Iran Saudi uh trading in Yuan but it's also India trading with the UK Israel Germany New Zealand rupees it's China doing deals with Brazil and France and Yuan it's um essentially a bunch of countries going back to their local currencies for China C1 uh but for India to repeat for Brazil it's a real for uh France it's going to be the Frog they all want to de-dollarize because the dollar is not simply like a piece of paper it's a network and if you're on the dollar too much then the US can de-platform you from that Network at any time has happened to the Russians or uh you know in Canada has happened to the truckers um and they don't want to give up that level of sovereignty so they don't want the extra territoriality of the US dollar okay so um we won't you know they'll become vassals this is what macron has been saying and this is why he's pushing for dedolarization uh and so that means that even the neutral parties not China Russia Iran alone but lots of neutral parties France Malaysia Brazil India lots of these countries in the middle are now breaking away from the dollar there's an auto loan crisis look at these spiking default rates and again this is looking like you know the Run of 2008 but I think the where it spikes to will be will be higher than that this is a massive issue that could crash the economy on its own there's a credit card crisis how about that all-time high of 930 billion dollars Mars Syria 2003 okay so consumers don't have money there's a student loan crisis okay that 1.8 trillion student loan debt all these people who had a three year pause and now you know that future that long term is coming due okay there's a private Equity crisis okay Blackstone limits investor redemptions again in March because people were pulling too much money out of this private Equity Firm there's the insurance crisis you know the backup plan for all these crises is is insurance but what do they hold they hold safe assets they hold they hold bonds and uh and bonds and Market those those have also been destroyed as I mentioned you know the FED devalued a bunch of these okay especially if they bought them before 2022 so these long-term bonds have also gotten crushed and all of this is against the backdrop of a divided low trust Society where you know there's no Trust in Media to report the truth this is you know at this point bipartisan and uh you know this is you know shows like how unified the US in in many ways was in the 1940s 1950s how it slowly come apart and this is in 2011 at the Congressional level was already polarized it's also highly polarized like this now at the level of the individual it's not really one country it's two parties okay it's not there's arguably there aren't Americans or Republicans and they're Democrats and Democrats don't marry Republicans 96 of Democrats aren't married to Republicans according to one study so it's becoming more and more partition so it's not like one country will pull together in a crisis it's it's really two you saw this during covet whatever position one side took the other side took the opposite and they switched multiple times and so what that means is if this is the true crisis of the Sofia crisis we're going to see great change um it's not simply going to be a recession or a depression it's going to be a change of the world order and so what comes next it's very hard always to predict timing in my view is 10 chance a Fiat crisis happens in months 70 in years 19 decades one percent in centuries so I think you know it's months to years probably but I may be wrong um I don't think it takes more than 10 years for it to happen but there are experts at kicking the can so maybe maybe they can Kick the Can another 10 years I I doubt that is the case but who knows so if this is happening if we're now seeing the decline of the dollar and the rise of you know the Yuan and the repeat and so on and the rise of Bitcoin and ethereum well what that means is the state itself becomes counterparty risk and you should think about what happened to the Russians or the Canadian truckers or anybody else like that who is adverse to a Western Government and start thinking about private Keys first um and so you know I leave you with that you know that that new Financial system uh you're gonna need to build it a little more quickly so um that is uh the talk on the Fiat crisis thank you very much and let's discuss awesome apology welcome uh to the live stage uh thank you so much for that talk or uh a little bit sorry that we couldn't be here in person uh can you all can you hear us just uh just gotta all right perfect I can hear you can you hear me yes we can awesome so okay great what we're going to do is we're gonna do something hacky which is he can see and hear us but this is a laptop that's gonna have him see all of you and uh we're gonna just position that so the audience question is visible but the rest of the setup is working as extended so wave hi to everybody um we're gonna start taking questions if you have any questions for biology please come on here and line up we'll uh we'll start some questions and as people are showing up um I'll kick us off with our first question for today which is you can list it all these things and seems like things are not really that optimistic um that's not really a good thing to hear when uh the events about pragmatism um but less assign some probabilities to how serious or how near-term these things are and let's say the probabilities that we assign are high for the near a few years next few years if not a few months what do we do in that scenario um are you asking me is that a question for me yes okay great yeah and so by the way for everybody here uh I'll take a bunch of questions and then you know I I said I you know I wanted to come in person uh uh I I just couldn't this time but you can all DM me on Twitter I may take a little while to respond if 100 people DM me but but I will try to get through it so if you have any questions let me know there okay but just a karthik's question so the thing is I'm not a Doomer at at worst I would consider myself a Doomer Optimist which is to say yeah this current system might be doomed but we have to think positive and think about what something better is on the other side and um you know obviously I've been talking a lot about Bitcoin on Twitter I've got like a video update coming out on on the BET and other types of stuff just work through legal details but um but I do think that uh you know let's say that you give even a 10 probability to what I what I'm talking about that is a radically different future that's a future where the you know US government is now counterparty risk where all of you are like Canadian truckers or Russian Nationals where if you have property in U.S bank accounts US Dollars um stocks even real estate those things could be unceremoniously seized taxed Frozen whatever indefinitely just to pay for all of these unpayable debts and by the way if you go back and watch The Big Short or you go back and watch Margin Call that'll kind of get you in the right headspace because the big Banks were actually counterparty risks at that time things that people thought of as institutions like bear Stearns or Lehman just went down and you know all the money was gone ftx's collapsed was like that SUV 40 year old bank people had a heart attack when you know for at least a couple of days three days four days they couldn't get their money out so the things you think are safe or may not be safe that's the big thing to to rethink right not just Banks but governments in that event in the event that the government is counterparty risk the people who are best positioned in the world to deal with that are folks like yourself where it is cryptographic private keys that are actually property and possession is ten tenths of the law in a sense right if you actually have the private Keys locally you have it and if you don't you don't we also understand this is just a better way to build things um you know for a variety of reasons you can do you know provable internet encryption all this type of stuff but basically if you even assign a small percentage probability to what I said and again I gave a bunch of different links a bunch of different references I talked about a bunch of different crises I'm not making up this stuff tweeting about it isn't causing I'm simply observing it if you if you just take that Morgan Stanley headline alone which talks about how the commercial real estate crisis is bigger than 2008 2008 was a really really really big deal so you should seriously consider counterparty risking everything you're doing and toughen up ethereum toughen up what you're doing one way of thinking about it is Maslow's hierarchy of needs at the very base of Mazda's hierarchy you need air right then water then food and then all the way up to the Top If You're Building Things in crypto like air is sort of like well of course there's air itself but air within crypto might be access to banking okay so building relationships with local politicians or crypto friendly sovereigns like El Salvador like Florida and Texas in the U.S uh maybe like South Korea where I understand the president is very pro-bitcoin thinking of that as a first class priority is one very important thing the second thing is just to think about simpler tools that could be useful more quickly because what I think might happen is something like the surge in remote work you know the coronavirus came to the US and then 50 days later 50 days later we're the US was in lockdown happened very fast and and remote work suddenly surged and had 10 years of growth in about six weeks eight weeks something like that might come for crypto I'm not saying when I it's hard to say when or rather you know I think there's 10 chance it happens within months 70 chances in years but it could happen quickly and so what is like the simple kind of thing that you can do that would be useful in that environment versus some very complicated nft ish kind of thing up over here what is closer down the stack on Maslow's hierarchy needs like crypto banking crypto payments crypto ux what if 10 million people wanted to use your product tomorrow I recognize of course that that hasn't happened yet but it's something to think about if you assign some probability to the scenario okay Karthik back to you nope that's very helpful I'll let our audience questions kind of jump in so I'll let you ask the first question please um don't know where to look but uh Balaji thank you for your presentation um Graham Smith from bitcoin.com news here in your view what are the next practical steps on the road to setting up Network States and what sort of work is being done by yourself or others such as Dows or foundations to help spearhead moves in that direction it's a good question so what I'm personally doing is so obviously I think the network state is is actually even more important in some ways after the Fiat crisis because there's going to be a deficit of trust in the world if you do have something like hyperinflation if the US government does default then a lot of people will be drawn to the ultra low trust idea I mean there's there's a lot that is Bitcoin maximalists will feel that they're being proven right about everything the problem is that Bitcoin maximalism when taken to its extreme is a recipe for like a zero trust Society and I think some societies will kind of be like that or very low trust Society some societies will be like that and that limits the scalability of a society because you're you know if you take it to its extreme you're going and getting your own water out of a well right you're going and chopping down your own Lumber you're so capitalist that you're against division of labor you're so low trust that you can't trade with anybody you need some degree of trust you need some degree of thinking about public goods and the collective and the greater good Beyond oneself even if that has just been betrayed especially if that is just being betrayed by the previous state and so it's kind of like centralization the decentralization is is coming and then we need recentralization but consensual recentralization on their side into these small clusters I recognize that thinking ahead but we need to think ahead because these changes may come very quickly so that point that what I'm doing on the network state is I'm writing Network State V2 and I'm creating um a video and and so on and so forth videos and all the content and that itself is a whole thing because a lot of those things I thought were going to come in 10 years might be coming in a few years you know so that's what I'm doing and that that itself is like a whole thing um I may fund you know more you know Dows and network States and so on but a lot of that stuff is kind of happening in parallel I've been gratified to kind of see that happening and the biggest thing about it is just building High trust communities as hard as that is with physical meetups where people know each other and know each other in person and that's the seed for rebuilding things after what follows one thing I'll also say by the way um just to kind of calibrate this a little bit you know I I also called covid-19 early on and it and one thing that's interesting about covid three years later is on the one hand we know that it infected 700 million people killed seven million people uh you know injured quite a few more um it you know caused gyrations and markets and Banks and the government and so on a but B three years later you know what life went on and if you said both those things in January 2020 that this is going to infect 700 million people and millions will die but you know life will go on in three years you'd have been considered that that would have been the most non-consensus opinion of all okay that things would re-adapt to a new normal that we'd come back to normal afterwards but of course humans re-adapt this world war one and World War II all these crazy kinds of things then we come back to a new normal afterwards it's not to say that what happens isn't going to be crazy but the network state is in part a recipe for a new normal and the other thing is that you know with the Roman Empire when the Western Roman Empire collapsed the Eastern Roman Empire actually remained for a while and I actually think Western Fiat will collapse but I think Eastern Fiat uh unfortunately the renmin B you know the Yuan but also uh the Indian rupee and possibly other currencies like you know Dubai's currency the Singapore dollar I think Eastern Fiat will probably continue um but Western Fiat May collapse so be a greater degree of you know Bitcoin maximalism in the west and less so in the east so kind of take taking those sort of global damage all this stuff is going into the network shade V2 and you can critique those assumptions or or modify them as you see fit that's what I'm doing a what I think you guys should be doing is thinking about building High trust societies with physical meetups where you can physically verify people that'll also be necessary for AI proof of human becomes ghost from a nice to have to an absolute necessity all the stuff we're doing in crypto you know it's it's funny you know the meme Graham like uh we're so back you know that meme actually I don't know okay we're still back it's a meme on Twitter it's like you know there's something that happens to people like we're so back dude so and then there's the related meme is it's so over right so this is both at the same time it's so over and we're so back because in this post Fiat crisis kind of world like you know where AI is risen where China is risen where you know fiata's collapse where you you know it's a low trust study you need to cryptographically verify all kinds of things the identity of somebody on their side the fact that they actually have the money they say they do everything that you're doing in crypto becomes much more valuable if you can survive um and it goes from web 3 as oh the stupid thing where people are dealing with the totally adversarial environment to this absolutely necessary thing much like all the stuff that was mocked before the pandemic like oh look at these stupid guys with their delivery services and then it became like absolutely essential during lockdown once we have digital lockdown which is coming and that's capital controls wage controls price controls um you know cbdc's that get rolled out to try to block the exits that's actually easier in some ways to roll out Than Physical lockdown digital lockdown the alternative to that which China can easily roll out which western states will try to chaotically roll out the alternative to both of those is freedom is cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and I believe it is what you guys are also building so that's how I think about it go ahead thanks very much and I think I think the network state is part of that I think it's I don't think it's the only thing but I do think it's part of that hey logic uh Carlos here from web3 Beach so recently I was invited to prospera which is a like a startup city in in Honduras and uh I I remember reading a lot about the Asian Century coming right but now this pop-up City popped up right next to me and don't do it so my question is do you think people should be aligning with those kind with those cities more like do do they have legs well I'm I'm a seed investor in prosperity just says full disclosure assume I'm a seed investor and everything okay but um but but I think I think the prosperity CEO is phenomenal and really good and Roatan is really really interesting this English-speaking Island in in Latin America my general thesis is actually not just the Asian Century but the inverted Century um I talk about this in the network state but in many ways our futures are past lots of things are flipping for example you know in 1991 the Frontier internet Frontier reopened in 1890 the American frontier closed yeah today we have the tech billionaires in the past we had the robber barons and and the captains industry today we have covid-19 in the past we had the Spanish flu and I have all these examples in the book with the mirror moment being about 1950 because you have centralizing technology going backwards of time like mass media mass production and decentralizing Technology going forwards in time from the transistor personal computer smartphone internet cryptocurrency okay um how does that apply here well one of my macro Theses is to first order every country that had a great 20th century will have a terrible 21st century and vice versa so the countries that had a great 20th century were the U.S especially but also Western Europe the Anglo countries and so on they were capitalists and recently stable and so on who had a terrible 20th century China Russia India Vietnam you know like like all these places that were under communism and that were or socialism and just destroyed over the 20th century with huge Refugee flows mass murder crazy things happening um I think we're and of course South in Latin America they had currency crises they had all this type of stuff right but now I think we might see a flipping where if Western the Western Fiat crisis happens that's actually like the worst place to be the worst place to be is close to Blue America Japan is unfortunately close to Blue America it's got large treasury Holdings and so on but it's not like right next to blast radius you know the blast radius Center would be like New York or DC or something like that was totally blue and you can go you know far out from American different directions you can go to the red States you can go to South America like where or Latin America like where you know naiba Kelly's doing you can go to China you can go to India and I think the farther away you are physically socially financially from Blue America the better off you are and now the asset like Latin America's experience with currency crises in the 20th century is actually now an asset for it because there'll probably be some the first to get into Bitcoin and gold as this Fiat crisis develops because they understand what currency crises are at least the Smart Ones other countries will copy probably naiba Kelly so I'm actually it's quite possible that this Century it's North Americans that seek to immigrate to Latin America and this is actually already happening you've got all these expats in Mexico you've got people who have all the options in the world going to El Salvador you have um you know it's it's a Middle East this Century that's at peace potentially if you look at the peace between Saudi and Iran it's Asia that is capitalist if you look at you know India being you know capitalists as opposed to socialist and China going cause a capitalists so all these things are kind of flipping around conversely in the west those who are still stuck under the dollar regime when the weight of the devaluation hits the dollar holder is the bag holder the weight of the devaluation rests on those who are still very very very heavily involved with blue America and so South and Latin America's distance from it in some ways actually could be an asset so it's not exactly the Asian Century it's like the inverted centuries how I think about it again I may be wrong but that's my mental model and you can critique it but at least those are my thoughts cool uh I just got invited back so hopefully I get to see you there okay great it's a wonderful place I'm very the other thing is Miami has a chance of being the Singapore of Latin America I mean it kind of already is if you're from Honduras and and you know Argentina and you want to Inka deal people tend to go to Miami to do that deal and uh you know with leaders like Suarez and Miami naiba Kelly arising um a lot of Bitcoin sentiment in in South America uh Latin America I think uh I think we might see some amazing things there's a lot of great people there that have been kind of held back by terrible systems and crypto might be the answer there it's a shame you couldn't make it in person you said we have to build the financial system of the future and the future is now my question is what infrastructure tooling and Primitives are missing now that are necessary for the future network State environments you envision in terms not only of the financial layer but of governance and everything else that's necessary for replacing the nation state well so that's the thing is I as I said just like the Western Roman Empire collapsed but the Eastern Roman Empire stood up I think the East survives it's going to take a hit but it net survives and like States fail to a greater extent the closer you are to Blue America the more the level of State failure the more you think U.S treasuries are a risk-free asset the more you think the FED is all-powerful and so and so forth right so I don't think all states fail I do think the closer you are to Blue America those States fail I think the the red States might turn out to be like Eastern Europe or the baltics where you know they actually after a crash do okay afterwards it's possible okay so it's not just as simple as quote the nation state fails some states do fail however and that's a huge update in the mental model of people in the world so so then to your specific question on the on the specifics in some ways I'm glad about where we are thank God we have Bitcoin thank God for Satoshi thank God we have the ultra you know for lack better term paranoid zealous um you know intense Bitcoin maximalists even if I discrewed them on so many things um I'm actually glad they're out there net net all overall I'm also glad we have the scale like all the changes to ethereum have gotten merged in right you can withdraw from staking the internet bond is available you you know like the like you know it seems like everything has gone well and we haven't seen any bugs surface knock on wood from the merge and so on thank God we have Z cash thank God we have zero knowledge thank God we have you know proof of human a lot of the nft stuff um we have a lot of The Primitives we have hundreds of millions of crypto holders worldwide we have crypto exchanges we have dexes uh we have tools that people are building on decentralized Discord um so we have a lot of The Primitives what I what I think the next step is is to not simply think of it as just the state versus the network but the network State there's different ways of calling talking about that Fusion and one way is obviously the titular you know the the network State book right right back here one way is the titular Network shaped book but another way is the network working with smart people of the state like naiba Kelly like dabot um like you know the for example the President of Palau is crypto friendly think about essentially if you're within the US it is um red States and purple States you know it's Wyoming and Tennessee but the Dow laws it's Texas with Bitcoin shall not be infringed it's Montana and Mississippi with the with the mining laws it's uh it's Florida which is allowing uh potentially crypto companies to use so-called State Charter Banks it's Colorado which is kept in crypto for taxes so within the US it's like red and purple States and and also places even pockets of blue like Eric Adams in New York or New Hampshire and uh and then outside the US it's small states uh naive Kelly tweeted a photo with 44 um I think central Bankers from small countries and they will also accept crypto so that's a if I say one big thing that people are not necessarily focusing on it is is making the spreadsheet of people around the world perhaps not tweeting in English perhaps they're tweeting in Korean okay or uh or in um you know actually Hong Kong of all places is seemingly more pro-crypted now though obviously you know you have to take that with a great degree of caution uh you know but but there's a lot of place in the world that are pro crypto that you might not know about like small countries like Palau so if there's one thing to do that you might not be doing it is find jurisdictions like El Salvador find jurisdictions like Palau find places where the state is actually supporting the network do deals with them maybe even try and do a deal with the Sovereign so they have one percent of your company or something like that so you have an interest in keeping you there locally and seeing you grow and then you've got State support and you've got you know a government in your corner because have you ever seen the movie Pacific Rim it's actually popular maybe it's based on Japanese stuff have you seen the movie Pacific Rim yes no yes yes okay so in Pacific Rim these gigantic monsters rise out of the ocean and humans can't fight them so what do they do they go and get giant robots and when it's giant robot versus giant monster then it's a fair fight so right now this giant monster is Arisen out of out of the ocean it is the U.S federal government and it is attacking all of right the crypto Banks it is attacking all the tech Banks it's even attacking the fintech banks it's attacking it's tacking AI it's attacking every single piece of the future and it's just going all out on this right against the government you cannot fight as an individual or even as a company to beat this gigantic monster you need a giant robot a good robot of your own you need your own government you need Texas you need Florida you need UAE you need El Salvador right you need the the good states fighting the bad States okay so you need to actually go and find states that you can do deals with those have a ton of hit points now it's Sovereign versus Sovereign right it's not you and your 20 or a thousand or even 10 000 people it's 10 million people and a un represented represented flag or even 500 000 people in a un flag or it's like an American state and now that's got the hit points and the budget and The credibility to actually fight a long fight with DC and if they've got an interest in your company if they've got a sovereign fund or something like that some deal you can do they have an economic interest this by the way is going to a crisis level now within the U.S red States for example their state level Banks all their funds because of what the FED has done they're flowing out to money market funds they're flowing out to Big Banks those state level banks are getting killed so what red states can do is allow crypto Banks to be chartered um at the at the state level or rather uh to allow sorry a lot of crypto companies to use state-level Charters uh for for state level Banks and um then they're basically defying the FED they're saying the FED can't cut off these Banks because we're chartering the state level they dare the FED to turn off ACH and Swift and this is the same thing that countries outside can do because lots of small countries will also see deposit flight to Big Banks because the FED has caused all of this uncertainty you know and and the way to pull that back is with crypto companies and crypto banking locally so now you have a strain tension on the system where you have the innovators and the smart money that is going to Red States and purple States and the banking there or foreign States and banking there and you have the dumb money that is running the 2008 Playbook and putting it all in the big Banks which is putting it in the Venus flytrap to get eaten by the FED at the time that it does a dollar devaluation which I think will will come so so I think just to summarize the key concept the key strategy there is to not think of yourself as necessarily oppositional to all states but to go and partner with smart States and to literally treat that as a sales process and it doesn't even need to be a nation state it can be a U.S state it can be a city it just needs to be some Sovereign some mayor some Governor some president who is tweeting about Bitcoin tweeting about cryptocurrency and is willing to take a meeting and may do a deal with you okay so that's I think a very important way of thinking about it once you've got that shelter then you can roll out a bunch of the stuff okay thank you thanks I know there's a long answer but hopefully you guys got thank you for that how's it going Balaji it's D5 Dave I'm from flywheel defy uh I have a question about an idea that you talked about in the past which is flat coins um there have been several early attempts at this including frax's fpi which is thanks to the Consumer Price Index and so to you what does the ideal flat coin look like what are some what are some variables that could come into a flat coin it could be energy which could be measured in Bitcoin mining difficulty or something else and how can different network States uh adopt flat coins for themselves and do you see one becoming you know a new reserved currency so I think what's going to happen is if you think so first on the second point right the new Reserve currency um I think what happens is if you think about the four functions of money right unit of account medium Exchange store value and then what Andreas antonopoules adds which is System of control okay those four functions of money are getting unbundled medium exchange is going to the Yuan and also the repeat and the Brazilian real and and whatnot okay uh store value is going to bitcoin um and also Ethan and Zach and so on depending on those communities um the system of control well actually remember P Bitcoin ethereum they all push back on the dollar having system of control because the the FED is not the root administrator of the Yuan the FED is not the rooted initiator of Bitcoin and then finally you know unit uh unit of value that's um that's something which can be resolved by like that that's the last thing that gets unbundled you know you already BTC is unit of value on coin market cap for many things eth is unit of value in the economy the honest unit of value for many trades nowadays that's like in some ways the easiest thing to flip over at the end if the dollar devalues if you have a medium Exchange in other pieces okay so rather than thinking of just one Reserve currency think about okay the multi-polar world means not just um you know different countries and different uh you know companies but lots of different currencies and pieces of the currency as opposed to one thing USC that does everything so it's from centralization decentralization okay now um can you repeat your original questions I was just a point of the reserve currency go to the beginning again yeah so what does an ideal flat coin look like what could go inside yes yeah okay yes so the flat coin uh just to explain to people what a flat one is if you take a stable coin you can divide it into two now separable Concepts a Fiat coin and a flat coin which differ by one letter Fiat and flat right in L so the Fiat coin is just pegged to the US dollar for example but if the US dollar is inflating or highly unstable that's actually less favorable now the flat coin would in theory be something that maintains its price against a basket of goods uh like bread and other kinds of things and might be helpful in a time of price instability now the thing is it's actually very difficult to do that because um if for example there's a true supply chain scarcity of something like I don't know bread became really scarce then you have some reserves and if you try spending those reserves to keep the exchange rate of the flat coin versus loaves of bread you know stable you'll expend all the reserves on that and they'll be gone because there's a real world scarcity that's killing it right so um I think probably now you know as I've been thinking about it more recently I think we're just going to have to accept a time of economic instability um and the actual flat coin uh may turn out to be something that's like a Bitcoin or gold back coin that's like one option or it's like you know related to uh rupees or maybe the Yuan though they're not going to let you really do anything with it and the repeat is also going to be a fairly controlled um you know central bank account uh so the answer is if you can solve the problem of somehow how to have reserves that maintain the price of a flat coin against lots of things you might be able to go with it but that's a that's a challenging problem and it might turn out that you just have people tolerate the instability and uh and you go with a Bitcoin back to Gold back coin and um and then you have the gold window or digital gold window open um and then of course people say well why not just use Bitcoin itself blah blah but but I think I think you might be able to to do something like that you can eat back coin as well so you just you just kind of say you know what volatility is going to be a thing for a while okay um and one way to think about it by the way last thing I'll just say is one way to think about it is you've seen the graph of like US dollar inflation over time okay and I'll just put that graph up if people haven't seen it one way of thinking about it though that people don't normally think about it this way is that that was a trade-off to get uh long-term devaluation for short-term stability and Bitcoin makes the opposite trade-off right so you see the rise and follow the dollar can you guys see that on screen yeah so you know 100 bucks is then worth you know now all like you know way less than like 10 bucks if you held it all the way through due to inflation and so you know basically over a long enough time frame 100 years dollar loses 99 of its value but what's happening is the Fed is printing to keep it seemingly stable over here so it's like a controlled demolition of the dollar um so you lose a purchasing power over the long run but you're maintain in the short run Bitcoin is the opposite where it gains in the long run but it's highly volatile in the short run and it's possible that you could you know that's another approach to a flat coin is you take that as okay I've got some Bitcoin reserve and I'll spend that Reserve in order to maintain prices flat for a while but if that Reserve exhaust it may not be flat after that time period because I need to spend that Reserve to maintain price stability okay so that's a that's another way of thinking about it okay thank you hey biology uh Bradley lowen from coinpost I'm wondering uh when you look at states that have access to a money printer um and how closely they cling to that power and then you look at uh how the only state to make Bitcoin legal tender was one that didn't have its own uh money printer it was already on the dollar system do you think there's any chance or uh even incentive for any state to give up access to a money printer uh peacefully um so uh unfortunately you know I love everything that I that I was talking about to be totally totally peaceful but uh you know Ray dalio projects um you know conflict in the future many other people project conflict in the future uh what I think is though let me qualify your question which is lots of U.S states red States and purple states that do not have access to the money printer themselves are also very Pro Crypt as I mentioned it's Wyoming and Tennessee Florida Texas Montana Mississippi Arkansas Colorado New Hampshire right all of those states are passing pro-bitcoin Pro crypto bills right lots of red States lots of purple States it's I don't know if it's 50 of the US by States but it's in that ballpark okay it's like at least 40 50 of U.S states are pro-bitcoin pro crypto so that's not just the so that means there's internal you know dissidents and there's external distance and externally you're seeing um I mean this huge things by the way are happening one way I think about it is if you're blue America you're about to suffer the ABCs of economic apocalypse AI takes the jobs Bitcoin takes domestic power and power of a currency China takes military power and and you know global global power right so the ABC is AI Bitcoin China right Karthik you like that one it's a mnemonics pretty good that's pretty good all right yeah so if you're like a blue American bureaucrat or lawyer or whatever AI takes a job and then you're writing some Financial regulations or something and then Bitcoin and China are taking Powerade domestically and abroad right all of that's hitting at the same time and it's hitting on top of the fed's mismanagement so the the blue America squandered the massive massive lead that they had so I think the answer to your question is actually it might be more peaceful than we might think and the reason is lots of guys who are in the middle okay so of course we know China Russia Iran are kind of on one side versus the US you know in blue America especially on the other side or the US establishment more generally it's not just blue America lots of Reds as well but you know it's called the USS thousand but what's happening now and it's very underreported is if you go and look at recent statements from a bunch of different countries okay I'll name some off the top of my head uh from nanyahu in Israel from bakeelli and El Salvador from Malaysia saying they're getting off the dollar from Zambia and Kenya in Africa from uh Saudi Arabia saying they don't listen to the us anymore from the UAE uh head meeting with with China and people trading in Yuan for for oil uh from Germany you know having a representative saying get the US troops out of the country because she was mad about the north stream bombing credibly being assigned to the U.S based on Seymour hearse's reporting any of the Washington Post starting to admit that might be true are you seeing France macron go to China and come back and say France needs to do dollarize you're seeing um uh this guy Charles Mitchell uh Charlie here I'll tell you uh probably butchering his name um Charles Michelle uh the president of the European Council is basically supporting macron in this saying you know what we don't want to just be an American colony we don't want to just be pulled into a fight with China on the other side of the world we've got this whole Ukraine thing we're already you know stuck on on on on gas and so on so what's happening actually is when you add that up by the way that is not just trying to rush Iran that's Latin America like El Salvador that's Africa like Zambia that's the Middle East like Saudi and UAE that's Europe like France and Germany that's southeast Asia the entire asean Block it's not just Malaysia all of them at the same time oh and of course India is doing deals with with everybody on rupees and of course there's China you know very big dog um even Japan you know we'll see what the new you know uh the the new Central Bank president does even Japan has um you know like wanted to buy Russian oil in defiance of what the U.S wanted it to do uh and it's doing other things it's like it's jail this guy I read alconus at the U.S didn't want them to jail um so you're seeing essentially a global revolt against the dollar specifically and you know let's call it being an American colony more generally if in 1776 America declared independence from British Empire lots of countries from Malaysia to El Salvador to Germany to France to you know like UAE they're declaring independence from American Empire okay that's a huge deal because that's all happening at the same time and people are starting to see in the U.S like uh political around the sing America's lonely fight against China that it's like basically something where all the stuff from the Trump era and the Biden era of essentially acting unilaterally and saying you know Fu to everybody in different ways there's a red way of saying Fu and there's a blue way of saying Fu all of that is now caught up where it's very clear the US just wants allies quote to be pawns you know that they're supposed to bankrupt their economies getting towards also a very one-way relationship um and uh you know this is something which is if enough people do that at the same time and it does seem like I mean you know for example turkeys you know everybody is de-dollarizing and pulling away from fighting Blue America's fight at the same time that's a very big deal so that may turn out that rather than spreading the dollar devaluation across four billion people um it spread across 150 million people and so rather than taking 10 of the wealth of you know four billion people or 20 or 30 percent instead you're taking like 800 of the wealth of 150 million people if you see what I'm saying people opt out before it's kind of like uh if you ever seen the movie Margin Call big time okay so in Margin Call the entire movie I recommend everybody watch it it's a bank and it's got these massive losses on its books and basically it's like okay can we dump them on the other guy right and that is actually what the U.S system is trying to do right now it's trying to say nothing is wrong stay in the banks stay in the dollar go to big Banks buy three month treasuries lock up your money stay in the system everything is fine everything is fine everything's fine bam okay just like lockdown everything was fine of course totally paranoid bam doors closed okay and this happened you know if you you know there's this guy there's a central Banker called Jean-Claude junker if you go and look at the Cypress haircut that's exactly what happened Arabic said oh you know the banks are fine totally fine the banks were allowed to run ads talking about how safe and secure they were bam it's gone okay the whole point is for you to be bait like you're not going to get a warning from The Establishment like I'm I'm the warning okay um and again go watch Margin Call go watch the big short one of the things that was critical about that by the way is all the dials all the warnings were broken okay you can go and look for example s p went and down created U.S sovereign debt in 2011. from Triple A to double a after a debt crisis do you know what happened I don't know president got fired not the President of the U.S but the president of s p got fired David Sharma and s p got a federal investigation for its troubles okay remember how during the mortgage crisis all the ratings agencies Moody's s p they rated these bonds at AAA when they were toxic waste right sure why are they doing that it's because basically the downgrade of the ratings is so material that it's actually worth more to them to fake it until they can offload it on some other poor sucker and then they downgrade and then you you hear about the mortgage crisis in September 2008 but the default started in Q2 2007. okay so that's what's happening is the system right now is trying to shunt the cost to those who are the least politically connected the least aware of what is happening and uh and then they'll announce oh some you know we all need to band together now and we we got we got to pay our all the costs that they came up with all the failures of all the banks everything the FED did they're going to say oh it's your it's your duty to bankrupt yourself for the fed's hijinks okay and I know that sounds cray okay I'm gonna put out a talk which has like a zillion more references on this but uh but that's that's essentially the concept go and look at the Cypress haircut and how depositors who had their money in a Cypress Bank lost like 50 okay I mean it's kind of like FTX it's like FTX saying everything is fine FTX is fine and those people who trusted sandbankment freed gone okay now what that would mean in practice by the way is to like limit your exposure to Blue America um like minimum necessary US dollars minimum Minister U.S bank account minimum Missouri U.S assets assume that everything like you're like the Canadian truckers right assume that anything can and will be seized that's sitting on a U.S establishment control Ledger including those that controls indirectly you know it's a it's a toss-up as to whether Bank of Japan will freeze assets for it how you know it's it's kind of under the U.S thumb it's got you know the US is 50 000 troops or whatever here um but but other countries like India won't do what the US says it may do its own things but it won't do that uh sorry go back and repeat the question because I know I digress but I think it was relevant uh just whether there was any chance of a peaceful transition Ah that's right so I think if people the more people who get out sooner you know Paul Krugman has the same fiat currency is backed by men with guns okay have you heard that one by Paul Krugman I think so yeah it's a clip all right now what the FED has is I mean people think of the dollar as like a piece of paper that's actually not the right visual you should think of the dollar as a network okay it is a network of billions of people around the world and the FED is the system administrator and he can hit a button or have one of its delegates said about one of its central banks one of its banks hit a button and it can freeze or seize or print it's like a video game and they've got root access and they can make all the numbers go up they can make all the numbers go down on anything within that system that they control if enough people get out of that system or they have at least an account on another Network they have an account on the repeat Network the ethereum network the Bitcoin Network even the Yuan Network or whatever right the El Salvador Network the you know the Dubai network if they have an account on another Network and they have some degree of insulation then when all their property is seized on the dollar Network well they aren't diluted to zero right they can continue to some extent right and then what that means is that those folks who are diluted to zero those are ones who have the maximum amount of conflict and what I actually think happens is something similar unfortunately to what happened with the USSR where it just imploded at the end and had to pull back its troops from everywhere I think the us is going to implode and due to this gigantic Fiat crisis again remember that Morgan Stanley thing the commercial real estate crisis alone is worse than 2008 and lots of people said in 2008 you know you don't know how close we came to the end of the world now we're going to maybe find out what the alternate reality looks like okay lots of people who go back 2000 they're like You Came really closely into the world right actually by the way you know one thing I will say you know because 2008 people are like wow baji what's the big deal you know 2008 wasn't wasn't that big a deal and you know we lived it'll just be the same thing as before right A lot of people will say that but I'm going to show you just one more plot which gives you a sense of how 2008 might not have been cost free okay and I'm not saying this is a conventional wisdom but let's just say this is something to consider okay um can you guys see the screen there yeah okay so here's a really really important graph in 2008 this is what this is showing on this axis is uh the GDP of a U.S congressional district okay and uh in 2008 is the uh the solid line outline okay so in 2008 the distribution of Democrat and Republican districts was roughly equal as you can see like kind of the center of the Democrat distribution the the solid line outline is roughly the same as the center of the Republican distribution right this uh this sort of solid line out okay by 2018 the the dots are where the blue distribution has evolved to and you can see all of the richest districts are suddenly Democrat and the median of the Democrat distribution is way above the Republican distribution so this is how if you guys if you're old enough to remember in the 2000s Republicans wore suits and ties how did they in 10 years become the trucker hat wearing Pearls of the Trump coalition well 2008 to 20 2009 2016 was when the money was printed and when it's distributed and it went to the coast first which were mostly blue there's a lot of data on that and this is not a blockchain so we can't track everything but the cantle in effect means the guy who gets the printed money first wins they get the purchasing power by the time it gets to some poor Schmo in Nebraska or something that dollar is already worth less its purchasing power is being run through okay and so you know look I am I saying this is intentional I mean it's just a coincidence perhaps that Democrats became Rich by 2018 and Republicans became poor but it does seem like the cost of the print was imposed on the political opposition in a deniable and invisible way unconscious even to those doing the imposing okay so it's like it's like an anesthetic it's like a mosquito it tranquilizes you and then it drains your blood right so the Republican suddenly became poor over exactly this period And this is a massive shift by the way this is trillions of dollars being moved the other thing is it's not just Republicans who may have paid for 2008. the other group that may have paid for 2008 were the non-americans right because guess who else got hit by inflation the Arab Spring and that's what caused the Irish Spring the food guy if you remember that guy set himself on fire because food prices were so high okay and so all these Civil Wars and revolutions broke out and you know 2008 was the end of the world if you lived in Libya they're still in Civil War 10 years later they got freedom exported to them with NATO airstrikes and inflation and um you know like basically the Arab Spring was the Arab winter for them unfortunately right you know lots of countries were plunged in Civil War and Chaos so the point is that inflation is not cost free it's just optimized to be invisible and the costs are imposed on those who are the least conscious of what is happening to them and uh and that's actually part of the point but once if a lot of those people let's say those billions of people exit in whole or in part from the dollar Network and they're in cryptocurrency or they're in foreign currency or they're in gold or Commodities and when I say that by the way I don't mean like Commodities trade on Exchange I mean like gold in your hand I mean like a barrel of oil outside on your doorstep okay you might not want that because it's toxic right that's why you go back to crypto or something like that but those people who are in foreign cryptocurrencies foreign currencies Commodities foreign currencies being non-fed control currencies because they're less exposed to it they are less exposed also to potentially what happens when the US government doesn't have any money left I think what happens is the troops get pulled back the militarized police are then turned on the population and then some very ugly things happen in the U.S scenes that we have seen unfortunately in Russia in China in Vietnam in North Korea in Cuba in much of the world in the 20th century you had very nasty scenes if you're from Iran if you're from actually arguably much of the world if you're from Eastern Europe right lots of countries went Communists or socialists they had asset seizures they had nasty nasty nasty things happen when their governments ran out of money this is what I think is possible thanks a lot we'll do one last question and then we'll close off with another question in my end hello I'm wondering if you could talk about the prospects of Bitcoin being banned and what would you do in that case and also how would you buy gold custodially yeah so um I think actually what's going to happen is uh Bitcoin trifocates the world into three kinds of states um Bitcoin atheist Bitcoin monotheist Bitcoin polytheist okay so the Bitcoin atheist States will probably be blue America the dollar States and um probably the Chinese Zone and you know Bitcoin in private hands may not be legal okay it's like guns and private hands okay it's like the gold like you must give Bitcoin to the state if you have it okay you're not supposed to hold Bitcoin person the state is supposed to have it Bitcoin monarchy Estates will be like Bitcoin maximal Estates and their only cryptocurrency will be Bitcoin you know you know Bitcoin Maximus on Twitter and and I understand where they're coming from by the way like you know the Star Spangled Banner has that bit the end you know and the flag was still there right every single thing that Republicans conservatives and so on had has betrayed them from country music to the military Etc but Bitcoin was still there right so that is the one constant when everything else is variable and we'll acquire a spiritual level of significance for those people where the status field the network is still there okay it's the inverse of what Nietzsche said in the late 1800s you know basically I talked about history running in Reverse late 1800s you said God is dead and what happened this the state rose in its place and the state also tried to kill the network it tried to kill capitalism you know the Soviet Union tried to kill capitalism now today it's a reverse technology has restored God in the form of the AI God why because it's smarter it's wiser it's more all-knowing we're at the early stages but every Community will build its own AI which will be like unto a God because you'll go to it for guidance you know there's this book called uh are you there God it's me Margaret where this girl little girl writes letters to God for answers because it's wiser and more you know better knowing that becomes a real thing again you have something that is smarter and wiser and more knowledgeable that knows everything from your culture the Indian version will know the upanishads the ramayana the Mahabharat it'll know all these things and they'll be able to give you you know for example the Hindu way of doing things or the dharmic way of doing things right every culture will have its own God we're also restoring the network and this time it's the state that is dead Okay so the rise of AI and Bitcoin flank the state on either side point being the Bitcoin monotheist States will basically worship Bitcoin and it'll be it'll be lightning it'll be ordinals it'll be Bitcoin only like you know quote coin scammers will be treated extremely harshly you would not want to have any digital asset other than Bitcoin like the one coin and then finally you'll have Bitcoin policy Estates which are uh those states which are far enough outside the blast radius that they aren't radicalized as being either Bitcoin atheist or Bitcoin monotheist if you're far enough outside then you can afford to think okay Bitcoin and so Bitcoin and ethereum so these will be the Financial Centers of the world like the UAE like Singapore potentially like El Salvador um you know potentially other countries that make good decisions lots of the small states the ignored States the looked over states of the 20th century that have good leadership could be Bitcoin polytheist States but they'll need some degree Prosperity background prosperity to to allow this and so that's my answer to your question I don't think it's as simple as a Bitcoin ban I also think by the way that the Chinese might be able to affect a Bitcoin ban but I think the blues will find it hard to do so because it's like their bans on speech they don't have enough political or economic support or enough IQ to execute on them there's enough pushback from the Grays the tech tech people and the Reds you know I think of the tech Libertarians as a future and Red's a conservatives is a past and the blues is the present they're hanging on to the Western present and they're fighting the future in the past same time I have to be political here because just everything is going to be political soon um they're also fighting the Asian past and the Asian future so the Western president is against the Western past the Western future the Asian past the Asian future I don't think they can fight all those things at the same time I think they're going to try I think it's going to be nasty I think they're going to try to narrow the exits to bitcoin as they do so by the way as liquidity drops less buying spikes the price higher as you close the exits people demand to exit more okay and it's going to be very hard for them to ban every single crypto Exchange in the world okay it's going to be hard for them to do that because what's going to happen is some states will rise and they will say okay we're going to open the digital gold window we'll have something like bitcoin.florida.gov bitcoin.texas.gov reopen the gold window that Nixon closed in 1971. other states can do it bitcoin.el salvador.gov where you can buy and sell Bitcoin it's just coinbase 2013. it's simple exchange functionality the simplest order book buy and sell Bitcoin for the local fiat currency but that means the right to buy sell send and receive Bitcoin shall not be infringed that's like the founding principle of I think the Bitcoin States if you have that you have everything and if you don't you have nothing um you don't have digital Freedom so freedom is basically can you buy sales and receive Bitcoin and if so you can probably do other things and if you can't well you're probably in digital lockdown so I don't think it's as simple as just a Bitcoin ban or what have you I think it's going to be quite a struggle all right we're on to our last question for today hey um so to give you some context I studied the market cap of people bypassing Capital controls and I'd like to hear your thoughts on two different scenarios and which one is more prevalent so scenario one is when someone creates enough wealth in their life they start looking at for different passports and they'll go to countries like Dubai or whatever and then swap passports and then dip out of Dubai and then they are effectively a different citizen for a different country right so what's the market cap of that and then alternatively scenario two is that when the when you're looking at the Forex markets and all these currencies are flooding towards the dollar right now when you're looking when you're comparing to like USD to CNY USD to EUR you know blah blah JPY included right it's actually um flooding towards the dollar right and during those during that scenario um there's a a phrase I'm calling a financial colonialization meaning that any American or any dollar holder that uh you know is holding the dollar at uh a better exchange rate compared to their you know other other countries you can effectively buy like you know Japanese real estate for like 30 off and all that kind of stuff right and you know the US is one of the few countries that actually charge um Global income tax right so it actually helps the US so you know I'm trying to figure out like what's the Marquette difference between two well okay so on your second Point um I agree that right now people are running a 2008 Playbook where people within the US and outside the US are trying to flee towards the big Banks the too big to fail and so on and so forth because they haven't fully gamed it out and said oh actually the USD is no longer too big to fail in 2023 that is the new thing a human can die before their successor lives but a system can only die when its successor is alive the new new system has to be up before the old system can die and there's at least two competing currencies both BTC and r b right BTC is like the cloud competitor and R B is like the land competitor RMB and also the Indian rupee and so on they're backed by natural resources manufacturing Commodities gold Etc BTC and then eth and so on are backed by compute IQ agility and both those are different kinds of contenders and competitors for the USD and so in 2023 as opposed to 2008 USD is no longer too big to fail so while I do agree that dollars are flowing into the big Banks as they were in 2008 I don't think that's the end of the ACT I think what's going to happen is also it's it's being turned agile that that money it's like a it's like you know you've seen a flock of pigeons and you you know you you somebody throws bread at them they all take off at once all the money has been turned digital and agile and like hundreds of billions of dollars can move in a day and so right now it's at Big blanks but it's very flighty and it could move here and it could move there and when it does they're going to try to impose Capital controls potentially depending on where it moves but then we start to get into end game um to your other point like basically I think there's multiple levels of exit Okay um and everybody is going to choose a different level of exit based on their own estimational conditions in their own life some people will just say okay you're such an idiot obviously you you know people predict 15 of the last three crises we've gotten through 2008 everything's going to be the same you're just you know histrionic you're blah blah blah okay fine that's that's basically the blue American dollar nationalist their mental model is the US government has infinite hit points they believe all the stuff in textbooks about the risk-free rate of return that the treasuries are the safest asset they probably also believe that the CDC can control disease that the FDA can improve tests that the U.S military was telling the truth about Iraq that the banks were telling the truth about the mortgages and so on so they believe the media this is that kind of person okay leaving that kind of person inside doesn't even agree that there's a problem folks will pick different levels of exit as a solution some folks will just buy like okay they'll buy some crypto currency and they'll sit in a blue State that's they're just doing Financial Insurance others will do that and they'll also move to a red state if they're in the U.S others will do that and they'll move to a foreign State okay um which is farther away from Blue America both physically socially and financially uh and um and so and then States themselves are now pulling away from Blue America so that's the difference to your thing is there there's obviously individual level adaptations there's company level adaptations and then there's country level adaptations where macron or the European Council or Brazil or Malaysia are all pulling away from Blue America now and the farther they can get away before the blast probably the better off they are and so so that's that's Collective exit that's actually the big one of the big contributions if there's a contribution you know at least my attempted contribution with the network state is to popularize the concept not just of the sovereign individual which is important but the Sovereign Collective because no man is an island and you know if you look at Steve Jobs's email from a while back I mean Steve Jobs one of the most exceptional human beings on the planet but he was like look I don't you know uh I don't make my own antibiotics I don't you know like uh Brew my own beer um the water coming out of the tap it wasn't due to me I depend upon this network of humans my species is amazing right now you might need fewer humans thanks Ai and Automation and Robotics and so on I will grant that and I think a smaller group it's easier and more Nimble but you do need some other humans to do things humans are social animals so that Doctrine The Sovereign Collective is not simply just leaving the country but it's finding a new Collective it's not simply unbundling and decentralizing it's re-centralizing and finding a community and then you're stronger together as opposed to just one solitary unsympathetic individual awesome well thank you apology for taking the time and uh for the video and answering all of our questions and going over more than uh what we asked for in terms of time great amazing and if you guys have any more questions you can DM me twitter.com biology s I'll have an update on the BET also soon I think it'll be satisfying for everybody um and uh of course you know the reason I did that was to draw attention to this crisis nailing the timing is hard Michael burry thought the market would collapse in Q2 2007 the guy in The Big Short only collapsed in September 2008. timing is hard I think it's maybe 10 probably things on wine a month I think it's 70 years 20 decades or more but 10 is a lot you're a sovereign debt you know default rates are you know probability estimate by the market is already at all-time high you can go and look at that yourself so um so I'm not trying to be alarmist I'm not trying to be you know crazy or anything you can discount everything I'm saying go and check everything I've said figure it out for yourself um but uh but this is my opinion and uh hopefully all of you guys can start thinking about building that new Financial system faster and and closer to immediate user experience things and with States and get that done sooner rather than later thanks guys thank you [Applause]
