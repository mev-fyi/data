today i will be talking about safeguard is a application we built for the first wave of the unisoft grants program is an optimistic governance accountability tool that brings a way for governance to retain better power over any group committee or grantees they have within the program so let me talk about a layer of the background uh you know that uh on chain governance tends to be a little bit slow so it's because it requires you know a lot of coordination between many individuals within the protocol to pass a a proposal or a vote which is a little bit too slow for managing day-to-day operation or expenses within the protocol that's why protocols seek to scale increasing the agility by delegating authority to smaller groups all decision-making bodies uh it could be multi-seats uh comedies etc this uh this way of doing things also brings a trade-off which is even uh the the communities can be secured because of the security that brings uh montisic this uh delegation of power over the funds they they they give is a little bit like one way there's no way for the protocol to regain back control to those uh funds if anything goes wrong so uh also there there's a little lack of accountability that you can help over them much of the protocols the committees can make decisions but the protocol will basically agree on the past agreement they did it so sometimes let's say there's a diversification of stuff that the committee can do but i may or may not align with the things that the protocol uh wants to do so this project brings a way to help accountability and also change uh things a little that's how safeguard was born and the solution we came up with was a little bit uh simple because we wanted so it can be composable with the already existing structure of the governance but that bring also this flexibility that the day-to-day operations needs for even the committees or grantees events etc so the solution we came up with we build a permission ledger on top of a timelock contract that has a delay a smaller delay that the overall governance and it could be one day or even minutes if you need it uh the funds are held in the time of contract but they can also be held let's say on the token contract as well in those meetings through the timelock there are different ways you can do it so the committee is grant permission by the safeguard at me that could be that mean can be um the governance can be another uh comedy can be one uh executed from protocol et cetera and you see like all all the roles can be assigned to different uh kind of entities or persons and so it's really composable to making uh like word for a lot of different scenarios so the request that the company can make for funds can be reviewed this is done in an optimistic way because if no if no one takes action over the request that the committee do it will pass and they will receive the funds easily it just when there is something that needs to be reviewed or something that needs a little bit more context they can uh post that and and continue um later or after the review process for the use cases of this uh token holders can oversight committees through governance communities can oversight suit committees they can build and also can oversight events they form etc so there are a lot of use cases that can be make the solution um for the general grant project we just thought of these two but as i mentioned before a lot of uh of the composability solution that we bring we allow for like a lot of different scenarios that people can come up with in different flavors of it so it will be great to see what the community came uh with for the roma uh of this project the other image we apply and receive the grant during april we build the smart contract and may we build the front end for it right now in progress we are prototyping uh the usage of the project with the stable subcommittee warriors is going to talk about about this comedy after me so you can hop up to know more about them in the next step for this project are the audit of the contract with you we are currently testing with a small amount of money because uh the contracts are added after after audit uh this project can also help like a really big uh phones and without any problem furthermore uh all the repo links are on valley are available open source so you guys can see and afford work on them um make um github issues if any questions or or even bring up more solution to this project this was my presentation thank you you can help and talk more with me in the tally discard if you like is a pleasure and also if you have any questions about the project about how it works i'm here for you guys
