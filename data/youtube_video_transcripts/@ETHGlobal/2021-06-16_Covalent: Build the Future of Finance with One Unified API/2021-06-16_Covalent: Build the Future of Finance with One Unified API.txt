us today um we'll kick off the session uh with covalent building the future of finance with one unified api we have ganesh here and brandon who will run the show if you have any question please post them in the chat and um danish and brenda will get to them either at the end or in the sponsor channel in discord in the very end if they don't have the time to address everything without the further ado i'll let take it let you take it away thank you catherine um good morning everyone for the people uh on this this uh part of the world uh super happy to be here hackathons are actually very near and dear to our hearts because covalent itself started at a hackathon many many years ago uh i found uh myself in on a weekend uh tweeting my thumbs what to do so let's go attendant hackathon and then i built the initial version of covalent and here we are many years uh later so i love participating hackathons we actually have i think three or four hackathons going on right now very this very moment so we're very very busy and love uh hackathons uh with a passion so uh let me introduce myself letting me introduce uh covalent and then i'll let brandon get to the meat of today's session so uh hi guys i'm ganesh swami i am the ceo and one of the co-founders of covalent uh covalent provides a unified api to pull out balances and positions and historical transaction granular activity on 12 different blockchains so the magic of covalent is from the developer side you integrate with the api once and all you have to change is one character which is the chain id and suddenly your schema your requests and your responses uh work on finance smart chain and polygon and phantom and avalanche c chain and we just keep adding uh chains as time goes on so that's really what the magic is we started out with very humble roots started out building a product that understands on-chain data so more of a retail focused product because it was difficult to communicate what an api can get you this was you know i'm talking about the dark days of 2018 2019 when there was no d5 there was no nft it wasn't clear uh what was going on but we had this uh intuition we had this vision that one day this kind of api is going to be crucial for the space moving forward and that future futuristic vision has uh played out uh actually quite exactly as uh as we planned out so yeah built the couple uh built the project out started around 2017 2018 2019 2020 2020 is when you know we hit product market fit became profitable as a company and then from then on it's just been blue scaling so today uh we have a team of about 30 people building the project uh we have a community of about 20 000 people we have lots of initiatives we have over 5000 devs in our developer ecosystem um so there's a lot going on with covalent we have over 200 projects that are relying on covalent for their uh pretty key critical needs all the big names that you know if you use uh xerion for example all of their data is covalent if you use coin gecko coin market cap crypto watch it doesn't matter um like we seem to have uh become the the default choice for a lot of these projects and what's exciting for devs is that you guys have exactly the same kind of uh api that those guys are consuming exactly the same product so there's no difference literally you just have to go to the website sign up for an api key and then boom uh you have access to all of this information so uh one of the other things that i i think is very interesting about covalent is the diverse use cases that the api supports so one analogy we would like to use is we give you a can of tomato sauce and some pasta and whether you make lasagna or some other italian dish or i don't know some of the asian dish it's up to you it's up to the developer you know you're fully in control this is why we have portfolio trackers we have taxation tools we have you know dex watchers we have market data we have machine learning models we have uh wallet use cases tons and tons and tons of use cases exactly as you said you know a can of tomato sauce and some pasta uh you know go go crazy uh be your own chef and so um yeah that's high level what uh i'd love to uh you know talk about covalent you know what i would love to see from this uh from this hackathon is d5 specific stuff so uh we are only focused on the on-chain stuff so we don't really do any uh like protocol related stuff uh it's purely that if you want to uh pull out on-chain data across any of these blockchains you can use the api and we have like two classes api specifically for that so i'd love to see more advanced analytics more advanced understanding more transparency things that even ether scan cannot do you can do with uh with covalent so that's really i think where uh this is really an opportunity to push the envelope on what is possible in the space which is really what uh what hackathons are about right besides having fun so uh we're here to support we're on discord uh you know where we have our own telegram channels and so on so you know feel free to reach out i think there's a dedicated discord channel for this hackathon so uh our team is always available and we will have room for questions at the end but i'll let brandon take on the rest of the uh the session uh today awesome thanks for that intro so i'm just going to share my screen here and uh get started with a bit of a showcase and an intro to the the doc site and everything of this sort so let's start um here this is kind of where where you should always start when you're when you're getting started with covalent uh get get start started by signing up for an api reference or an api key sorry um and and read through the docs um so on this page which i will send a link to in the chat um here we go you can uh this is basically the landing page so you can see the supported networks you can see the campaigns and we're just going to take a second to go through all of those and understand what they are so let's start with the supported networks so currently we support main nets for ethereum avalanche c chain finance smart chain matic phantom rsk and arbitrum which hasn't been added here just yet we have test nets for all of those as well and there's upcoming networks that you can browse down below so this is where you'll find the chain id you can click into each of these to find more information about them uh block time for ethereum 15 seconds for matic it's about one second with 12 second refresh latency so all this type of stuff you can find in the supported network section if we go to the tutorials section uh under the alchemist cookbook here you can start to to understand how to build with the api so two two of the the key tutorials are the primer tutorials so we'll talk a bit more about primer later and maybe ganesh will will be able to add in on that um but just for reference there's a tutorial section there are how-to guides so these are different exercises that we have built out to kind of get you going so this class a endpoints summary is a really good recipe to start with it gives an intro to the endpoints it gives an intro to some tutorial videos so it's a great place to start and there's more so we've got case studies as well these are just two there's more coming so this is a tether analysis you can see match up basically what tether says with the on-chain stats and so that's what we do in this case study here and i'm going kind of quick because i have a few more things and a few more detailed examples that i want to get into and so i guess the last two things that i want to show you on this site are the developer tools so this is going to be really helpful if you're looking for addresses if you're looking for primer stuff so if we just try this default out here so you basically put in your address you select the chain and it will tell you the events that are associated with that address with that contract and what the topic hash of those events are so this is super useful while you're building out research or building out tools um and the sort so and then lastly we'll show off some uh of the projects we'll do that closer to the end um this is our project showcase page so community members that have built projects um through previous hackathons through previous youth global events you can check those out and message any of those the creators they're they're happy to answer questions if you find some related avenues so that is an overview of the docs site um i'll talk a little bit more i guess i didn't give myself an intro really um i i run a lot of the research at covalent so if we go to alpha alarm this is the kind of the research external facing research branch that we have started it is now run entirely by the alchemists which we will talk about in a second but feel free to scroll through here and and see some of the research that's been done the whole purpose is to provide daily visuals and daily insights that are not just speculative they're fact-based and based on research used or gathered through the api so we've provided over 150 of these insights so far over the last three months and we're not going to stop anytime soon so feel free to check those out request insights or request research or you can even join in and we'll talk about that a little bit later on as well but i think the biggest takeaway from this page here is the the ideas so these are things that can be done with covalent or stats that can be found they can be integrated into your apps and your your d5 projects so to to cover a few more of these use cases let's actually backtrack and go into the api docs themselves so we'll do a quick uh run through um again there's the introduction the you know there's this whole overview section i'm just going to let you read through that on your own i really want to talk about the end points that we offer so the some of the coolest ones are like the token balances so if we just enter in an address here and a chain id then we will get balances and we can fetch nft balances as well so let's just do demo.eve and there's all this primer queries that you can make as well but we'll just keep it simple for now look at demo.eth on the main chain and while that loads i will talk about uh the other end points that we offer so historical portfolio balances uh well i didn't actually put in my api key that's why that didn't work um i'll grab that in a second so um we also have historical portfolio balances so this will give you the last 30 days and you can make all these api calls right from the browser here so you can prototype any of your your calls and see um what you have going on here so uh now and let's give that a try now there we go no api key given there we go so now we have a response and this is kind of the the preview here so we can copy this url and view it somewhere else we can just use this url to make the calls from excel from google sheets whatever whatever you please or from your project obviously so let's let's continue this through here we could also get transactions we can get the the most powerful ones are certainly the the log events endpoints so uh we can get log events by contract address so uh let's let's actually do a quick a quick demo here um let's look at the of a other lending pool uh v1 will work so we'll grab that we'll go back here chain id 1 address put in the one we just grabbed ending block let's do latest so if we do that it'll just grab the last million blocks we don't need to specify a starting block if we just say latest right there and let's actually look at this in a csv format so that we can make everything easier give that a try service temporarily unavailable fair enough we'll come back to that later on but basically what that would return is a similar page to this with all of the events from the address fully decoded number one and also from the start of that block range that we gave so it would give every event for the last million blocks and if we wanted to query every event that this contract has ever emitted we would just need to go to this creator transaction hash figure out when this contract was created and start our analysis from there and then we can get every event that has ever been emitted by this contract so that's just a quick a quick overview of the api docs and what i really want to do is go into some more of the community built projects so let me just close some of these down uh so this is the the first one here this is a uh was built for one of our dnd hackathons uh with one inch and this is actually a uh qi gas token tracker so you can see how much was minted how much has been burned you can interact with it on a monthly basis and you can also see the largest qi gas token addresses now this is entirely powered by covalent all of the granularity and everything down to the block level so if we continue on that thread this is another submission from a previous hackathon here while it loads so this one goes even into more depth and finds the swap the largest swap the swap volume how many unique users a protocol has so this protocol specific here is one inch but we can find how many unique users it has ever had or we can do a sliding window on that all that can be powered by the api so i'm going to let that load for a second it's a lot of data to go through and to switch the tone a little bit here this is a cool nft bot that was built by the community as well so it posts hourly i believe yeah close to hourly different nfts and just showcases them so it's completely built by or powered by covalent and then they built a bot out of it so i just think that one's a fun one to look at um let me just check the time okay so we have about 10 minutes i want to open it up for any questions while that this one oh it's loaded so we'll do questions in a second here um so just to to show the granularity that's what i want to i want to show here and you can build this for any protocol it doesn't have to be for one inch it can be for your wallet even it can show all these stats for your specific wallet it can calculate the different taxes that you owe based on different transactions based on where you live whatever you need to do all that data is available so for one inch specifically the largest swap on ether both ethereum and bsc is about 36 million a little bit over 36 million so you can see the total trade volume there have been about 95 000 unique users on ethereum and bsc across 900 000 swaps and then that's just the high level so we can start to dig in to daily statistics gas spent statistics the median values this page shows volume and as ganesh mentioned before it's as simple as changing the chain id so to get it on ethereum versus bsc we need to match up the addresses and change the chain id and it's as simple as that so from i guess this page is going to take a little bit to load so let's let's do some questions where can we find those submission repositories yes uh i can send some links here i'll do that in just a second um but they are on that initial covalent docs site that i sent they are in this project showcase section most of them and if they're not yet they will be eventually so but here just quickly here's a link here are the links to the ones that i just showed um any other questions i just want to take a minute to explain one of the unique architectural pieces about covalent how it works and what our philosophy is so what makes covalent unique is that we make an exact replica of the underlying supporting blockchain into a database this means that we index every balance every transaction every position every log event in fact even every storage slot that you have on the blockchain and from there on this is where the developer has the control and the flexibility to ask any question that they want you want to do like token balances for an address for example this means looking through all the 250 000 erc20 contracts and then checking if your wallet addresses is in the balances map that's an example of a query that covalent is able to answer in a few hundred milliseconds because we're able to scan the entire blockchain so that is what makes covalent unique so you don't have to write any special code you don't have to write transformations you don't have to wait for your data to index all of your data is automatically indexed with a two block latency so we're about 15 seconds behind so 30 seconds behind on ethereum and about six seconds behind on polygon for example it's two blocks behind uh but everything is available to you you just literally have to just consume the data and uh and then you know go on and do your uh do whatever your your task is rather than sitting down and trying to write indexing code and uh you know waiting for the index to refresh uh and uh going through that process so that's really how we're different in fact we've pushed it so hard that we want you to use the product from the browser so the browser is an extension uh to the uh to the product it's a question what tech do you use for this blockchain's db this is a very very custom postgres so it looks like a postgres database on the front end but we've completely rewritten the storage engine on the back end and we've rewritten the rpc layer so that it directly it's like this uh i'm sure there's a greek mythology uh mythical character which uh looks like a database on the front end but is actually a blockchain on the back side uh back end right it's a it's like a double-headed demon so that's that's what this architecture is uh so it reduces the sink latency so we're probably the only guys to sync uh binance smart chain for example because it's so fast or arbitrary any of these fast blockchains is very difficult to sync it using the rpc layer but we're able to bypass all of those steps and then we're also able to keep keep the database in sync because it's this hybrid hybrid kind of architecture are there any fees the product is completely free so at least for the next year it's completely free what's exciting about covalent is that we have a shadow decentralized network also running and what is going to happen i would say later this year is it'll be network pricing so anyone can go in and run a node and if you host the own node you don't have to pay any fees but if you rely on another professional validator to answer your queries then you pay fees but i guarantee you that it's going to be cheaper than any sas product out there because the validators who have come on board are professional validators and they run bare metal hardware so it's going to be dirt cheap and there's going to be downward pricing pressure but until i would say next summer the product is completely free so i just want to jump in and close close it off here with how to get involved so we have a bunch of different campaigns going on obviously hack money is one of them and you should reach out in the dedicated discord channel on the hack money server we'll be active on there but we also have the covalent discord that you can reach out in or if you want to just look in there for you know frequently asked questions and support we also have the alchemist program so go to the home page and look up the alchemist program if you want to become an alchemist we're building really cool things we have the from the data team i can speak from where they run alpha alarm they run newsletters we're building a machine learning team within the alchemist data side so there's lots to get involved with there and you can check out the events page that i just posted here and we'll talk about you know this upcoming podcast with ganesh if you want to learn more upcoming tutorial sessions and just generally reach out if you have any questions and we're happy to support all the way throughout this campaign as ganesh said we love supporting hackathons so whatever you're building we want to help build that so just feel free to reach out thank you so much brendan and ganesh i was super interesting you do have a few more questions in the um in the youtube chat uh somewhere related to um i can post them here so how many tb is your indexed db and where is it hosted great question so the database is about uh five and a half to six terabytes and it's a few billion rows across all of the blockchains that we index where is it hosted it's currently hosted on google cloud uh but with a decentralized network basically what's going to happen is that it's going to be distributed across the globe so every validator will be running this this database so when you make a request from asia for example you'll hit a data center in mumbai if you call from singapore it'll be singapore from africa from europe from north america from south america but that's the future of covalent awesome uh one other question was was the main difference between covalent and the graph great great question so we hear this a lot uh and i've spoken a lot about this but phil the biggest difference is the philosophy so like i said covalent is a no code solution which means we extract all the data index all the data and then the developer does the transmission at query time that's what primer and all of these features too in the case of the graph what happens is you have the blockchain data and then you need to sit down and write a subgraph which could take you know a couple of days if you're experienced you need to really understand the data and then you need to wait for that to get indexed and then you query that transform data so there's a new question that you want answered you have to go back and modify the sub graph and redeploy it and wait for it to index so in the case of the unit swap subgraph for example it takes about seven days to resync so our philosophy is inverted we actually don't believe in that approach our approach is is unique and it's different so that is the core difference between uh the graph and uh and covalent thank you i think that covers pretty much everything um anyone if you have more questions please join the sponsor covalent channel in our main discord event or you can directly go to uh covalent discord i'm sure they'll be super supportive during this hackathon particularly and we'll be happy to see you there on this part thank you so much dennis thank you brandon and everyone
