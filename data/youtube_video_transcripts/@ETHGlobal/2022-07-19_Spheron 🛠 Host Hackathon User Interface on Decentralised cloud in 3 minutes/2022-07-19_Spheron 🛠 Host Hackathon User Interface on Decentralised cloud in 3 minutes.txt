[Applause] [Music] uh thanks for joining us so we have prashant here today from spheron your workshop will be on how to host a hackathon user face on decentralized cloud in three minutes richant i'll let you take stage thanks hey awesome uh let me uh walk everyone through here like how to go ahead and host your application on a decent list network um so there are a couple of i'm not going to share a slide here but i would love to jump directly into uh demoing like how exactly you can do that i'll try to cover some of the important aspects of this fieron which is going to help most of the people who are building into this particular hackathon hosting their user interface and i would highly encourage everyone to go and use a lot of features into it because uh we have built this by keeping developers into our head so you are going to love all of those features which are there so starting with with the with the sphere also uses tab to go at bispheron.network click on deploy the moment you do so you will get three repositories which we are currently supporting uh github gitlab and bitbucket and uh just go ahead and click like from where your repository is currently um click on that the moment you do that you'll be able to log into the system there are a couple of things which uh you should be aware about uh spiron once you log into uh there are some tabs which which you should definitely go and check it out um it's called members a member is one of the uh interesting features which we have built into spheron to allow uh your team members who are remotely present to participate and collaborate with you for deployment or for doing anything around this runner itself uh just go ahead and invite your teammate or the person whoever you are you wish to invite and then uh during the invitation you might also find one more thing if you are not a pro member you might uh get something um error with the error will be like you are not a pro member and you have to upgrade in that case go to spheron faucet claim some usd usdc die or whatever you need uh to go and claim that and once you are done come back again go to billing and click on upgrade here so for me it is it is not coming up because i'm already in the pro version uh but for you it will be like it will be coming up as an upgrade option so upgrade your plan and you should be able to use invite your teammates as well so this is one of the interesting features which we have i i'd love everyone should go and check it out now what i'm going to do is i'm going to deploy a open source web application which is built by some of our friends and we are going to see how exactly it can be done the first thing you have to do is um click on new project um if you have not attached your product uh yet on from the github you have to just go and click on new project go and select your repository where exactly your repository is and then again go and click whatever deposit you want to launch and select wherever you wish to launch so for example if i want to launch a file coin go and do that choose there choose it and you will find there are couple of things which are pre-filled for me uh like framework will be pre-filled um so if we are supporting that framework it will just automatically pick it up and it will it will by default show it here and then there is a branch which you can go and choose let's say if i want to deploy from this dev branch or if i want to do the platform main branch uh root directory and and all these configurations and one of the interesting new features which we have put forward is the node versions um we during our um bug hunt program there are a lot of program which we run at sphere on we found a lot of people were running different versions of the node and their build was happening in different versions so we went ahead and we said let us introduce all those compatible node versions into our platform itself and uh and here we are so now you can go and use 12 14 and 16 node versions and apart from that if you have any environment variables which you are passing in during your build time you can also go ahead and do so as well so this is how simple it is to go and set up your initial first configuration and once that is done you will just have to click on deploy and the moment you do that what it does it just starts building your application and starts applying now i'll try to show you some of the major uh features using which you can automate your entire task as well once you install your github app into your repository you'll also give us uh allow us to build your repository on the runtime as well what does that mean if you see here there is a there's a blue orange kind of a dot which is coming up which is showing like there's a there's a deployment which is currently in the progress and it is happening around which which i have recently deployed now let's do one thing is i'm going to change my branch let's say test dev branch and i am going to make some changes into my readme file to see and to basically make sure like every time whenever we make a commit the deployment should happen and the moment i say commit changes it should go back and if you if you check here uh you will find there is a one more deployment got into pending state and this is the deployment which i have just now triggered and this is how easy it is and if you see this this particular primary has been deployed from the test day branch with the commit id of d832961 and if you open that this is the changes which i have done so what i was trying to show you is it is as easy as it sounds you can also automate your entire diplomatic experience from the github directly not only that uh let's let's imagine you might be building two kind of environment the one where you might be running your in our production environment where you are going to submit your user interface to the global team or to your team members to look at look around and there will be a development environment in which you might be working on so you can easily go and set up your both the environments both production and development environments from sphere on user interface directly so what you have to do is go into the settings and go into deployment environments and if you see here i already have two environment center which is called production and development now uh it might so your requirement must be around let's say if my production during my production time i want my main branch to be utilized and i want it to be get pointed to let's say rv right and go ahead and save that the moment you save it and the next time when you go and make any changes into a main branch it should deploy your application or not even let's try to find out how it works so the moment you go back let's say i'm on main branch now go into the readme click on edit again and let's try to make some changes here and the moment you make the changes just come back and let's check our deployment how exactly it is it is going on so it did not got that your deployment let me just make that commit again so whenever you make any kind of changes it just uh triggers the deployment sometimes if the system is not properly been updated it might not catch it up so as it is happening now um there must be some kind of a bug which we have to fix it up but generally this is how it works you just make the commit there like i i did on the file point side uh you can go ahead and do the same on an rv when and if it is a bug just raise the bug we'll be more than happy uh to provide the resolution of it and since we are into the closed beta axis we are always looking for your feedbacks go ahead and start providing those feedbacks now coming to the attachment of the domains we currently provide your centralized domain and some subdomains uh one subdomain which you will get always from our site which is called spheron.app domain and using that domain you can access your web application whichever you have deployed and apart from that if you have your own domain you can analyze that as well we also support handshake ens and hns domain so feel free to start using your a decentralized domain uh here and and start attaching your domain there as well so and one of the one of the interesting fact um there are a few things which we have made very uh centric to the developers is let's say if you want to set up your environment in such a way like you don't have to come and change the settings again and again then in that case you can come and uh to build and deploy a function here uh go and attach repositories install commands or whatever commands you have just make sure you enter enter them here and that's it that is sorted the second thing is like if you have a global environment variables if you which you want to pass into different environments you should be able to do that so go and select your different environments and if you during that build time in that environment if you want to pass a different environment variables you can configure them as well so there are a lot of functionalities which are which are there into the system which you can go ahead and start using it apart from that we would love to um basically would like to also invite you to help us um to um test few of the features as well while you are doing everything uh if you find anything which which which is missing feel free to let us know and we'll be more than happy to help you out in in fixing those um and also helping you out in uh and getting more things done now uh there are last few important notes here is if you want to go and see the documentation there is a triple dot button here just go and click on that box and you should be able to see your entire entire document of ours and you should be able to learn more about the project what we are currently building now coming to the notification so whenever you make any kind of uh payment kind of transactions you'll be getting those notifications here if that payment is successful if it is not then why it is not everything will come here so that you are very informed about what is happening around the contract side so yeah that is all around the spheron and uh would love to see most of your web applications being hosted at spheron and uh i would love to answer some of the questions as well if you have any i can see some of the oh uh try signing up but it says okay so seems you need to have an ftp yes um we have as i said like we wanted to make sure like it's a great access because it's still in beta uh program we want to make sure only people who are getting the access are not are using it not trying to exploit it and we should be also able to get the feedback so just join our discord channel say you have been here and listening to me and they'll just white list you immediately um you can see the meeting notes here uh try it standing up but it says i don't have bit access again the same thing just go ahead into our discord channel and we also have our own in each global channel as well we have one form which you have to fill just fill that up and we'll make sure uh will will give you that so let me just quickly share how you can get to our discord channel is go to spiron click on contact i'll share this link on our chat so here you go so here is our discord channel where you can go and basically join our discord channel as well and get widely listed prakash is there request will be there a bio will be there there are a couple of teammates who are who are there to uh make sure make sure you are getting those nfts uh can't you click redeploy project yes you can click creative live project it is there i did not did that because i thought like you guys will do that so uh redeploy will again help you to redeploy from the previous settings so for example if you have set up some last deployment whatever you have done on the same deployment settings it just triggers the redeploy uh is it possible to host a sphere on as in however it's useful as of now it is static website um but most likely once we participate in the next uh global event uh we'll be coming up with the compute as well so that we have we have been receiving a lot of requests around the computer and um we are on to it uh our user interface and a lot of things have been completed uh there are only a few things which we are testing it out and if you have nfds you will be able to test it at the earliest so make sure you hold those nfps and um and and go ahead and test it out most likely within this month end or most likely uh second week of the next month so that is when we are also introducing a compute into our platform so uh we will be more than happy to invite you as well for testing it out so yeah guys uh these are the things uh feel free to join our channel uh we are already on the global site uh we have a discuss section there uh we are we have our own discord channel if you want uh if if somebody is not available in the team in that channel you can just just ping here and i or anyone of the team member will always be available to give you the answers or help you to host your site and yes one more last thing which i want to add on is we all are building and we need your support to make sure uh the product which we are shipping out is very good and awesome uh as as most of our devs are awesome always so let's let's try to focus on that and um yeah looking forward to uh get more and more web applications get posted on file coin rv and all the other supported chains which we are supporting currently is there any any more questions you would love to take up or just feel free to join in our channel it seems like there is no more questions thanks christian for your time and everyone in the meantime if you do have any questions feel free to follow over discord um in sponsored spiron and we'll be happy to thank help thank you so much bye take care
