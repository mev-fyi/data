good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartek i'm one of the co-founders of youth global i am super excited to welcome all of you to bill quest now you're watching all of this on eatglobal.tv and this is the platform we'll be using for today as well as the rest of this event uh to live stream everything that we'll be doing whether it's our summits or the closing ceremonies and this opening ceremony and this event is brought to you by youth global uh for those of you who are participating in the global event for the first time youth global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running two specific types of events hackathons and summit and build quest is no different so we'll be covering a lot of what's happening um over the next two weeks for real quest and going through a lot of the logistics and the price information and everything else that you've been asking us that we can kind of condense everything into this one quick kick off so build quests is an amazing event we have over 575 hackers from 67 different countries spanning 16 different time zones participating people from all over the world that are going to be here with us uh asynchronously and synchronously for the next two weeks and we are super excited to have all of you be part of this effect we kind of put everybody on the map to see where everybody was coming in from and it's so incredible to see the immense diversity we're seeing from all different cultures countries cities and parts of the world so i want to say hi to everybody who came out and is participating and i can't wait to see what you're excited about on top of that we also have 16 different ecosystem partners that are going to be here this entire time and over 50 ecosystem mentors who are going to be there to help you with anything that you need to make sure that your projects are successful and you get all the help that you need as you think about integrating different protocols sdks and various kind of tools and resources for your projects and to top it all off we're giving a hundred twenty-five thousand dollars in prizes so there's a lot of things you can win and we'll be covering a lot of those details uh shortly in this live stream so i want to quickly give a shout out to ipfs and the political labs team they are our key partners for this event so we'll be covering everything that you can win and use to make this super easy for you to build a cool project that kind of leverages gaming and metaverse here together and i also want to thank immutablex and ballast studio stardust sequence morales chainsafe tableland exotic covalent op games nmt port pinata chain link and lighthouse so let's jump right into the logistics i want to cover a lot of stuff around the hackathon and how everything is set up and hopefully this addresses a lot of the questions that we've been getting and also if you have any questions about anything about the event that isn't answered in any of my slides you can just ask them on the chat here on the global.tv and we'll be able to answer them for you as well so the most common question we get all the time is what can i actually build this event is called build quest it is a metaverse and gaming themed hackathon so to clarify this and kind of give a little bit more information on what others are building here and what you can totally kind of take on uh there's a lot of stuff around gaming that you can do whether it's kind of making a brand new crypto native game that uses a lot of new primitives from just kind of web3 or you can pour some existing games whether it's uh something that's in like the free domain you want to bring on and have a spin off crypto or kind of just a sparkle of new things around crypto that you can integrate there's a lot of stuff you can do which is kind of the cool experiences we're seeing with nfts overall and kind of metaverse there's a lot of existing products and tools out there that kind of blend specifically what's happening in in metaverses all around and you can also use this as a way to come up with different 3d experiences so it's not just about making games uh if you get excited about building something on the the 3d animation side you can absolutely do something like that as part of your project for this hackathon and all those things are are fair play if you still have any questions that uh haven't been answered are you not sure if there's an edge case that you are excited about and you know you don't know if that qualifies uh just send us a note whether it's on discord or on email and we'll be happy to answer and clarify that for you so let's talk about the next 10 days i'm going to cover what the next week looks like we're going to cover stuff around deformation we can talk about how you're going to get help all the prizes you can win all the talks and workshops that we have we also have a summit next week on what's happening in gaming and metaverse and i'm going to also cover judging and submission processes so the most important thing is communication this is an asynchronous event and everything that we're doing is going to be on discord which means that if you rsvp then you are a confirmed hacker you will have access to these discord channels that you see on the screenshot on the left and you'll be able to verify that because otherwise you will not have the permissions to view these channels so make sure that you have access to all these channels this is where you can ping any of our partners you can ask anybody anything on the global team you can use these channels to find potential teammates everything here is happening on discord on top of that for every workshop and talk that we're doing over the course of this event uh you will be receiving calendar invite to join the talk so you'll have to zoom link directly in the calendar invite and the entire schedule is available on the website so we want this thing to be as a synchronous as possible which means anything that you are able to make especially given the time zones we're kind of working with you're more than welcome to join and if you can't there's still ways for you to catch up and see what happened there and and kind of do this thing at your own pace where can i find the schedule so everything about the schedule prizes and everything i'm going to cover today is going to be on our website which is buildquest.ethglobal.com so let's go into how the hackathon works officially hackathon has started and that means you can start hacking and working on your projects now as part of the hackathon rules everything that you are submitting must begin at the course of the beginning of this hackathon which means that you can only start working on your project today until the submission deadline which is 10 days from now you can have up to five members on your team and you have nine more days to hack which means from today including today to at the end of sunday on the 13th is the time you're going to be given as all of you to work on and submit your project submissions are due at 12 p.m noon eastern on sunday the 13th so we'll be sending a lot of reminders and a lot more information on how you can go about submission process how you can think about making a really good demo and all these things i'll cover some of that as well in this call but officially everybody can start working on their projects in terms of rules and criteria there is a very simple list of things that you should be keeping in mind everything that you're going to be working on working on must be done from scratch which means that you cannot bring in something you've already been working on since before this event and kind of use that to submit and get ahead if i do it by presenting some work that was done earlier i want to make this fair for everybody that's out there so uh please make sure that anything that you're going to be submitting was done over the course of the event itself and not before it there are a couple of cases where we have received emails from a few of you asking for clarification on is this a violation of the rules if i were to build on this or if i were to use this previously done work and we have made a couple of exceptions but uh if you have not emailed us about it and we have not given you a written okay anything that is submitted and is found out to be in violation of this timeline will be a disqualified project at the end of this event uh that said this is a comment specifically on you being able to use something you've been working on as a side project for the past few months or however long and using that to submit is is the issue but you have absolutely uh the flexibility and the right to use anywhere from uh existing libraries sdks apis or even marketplace 3d models that you can anywhere from purchase to go from free domain and you can use all those things um freely and and totally um into your project so that is entirely good on top of that everything that you are submitting must use ipfs and or filecoin for for storage so that is a key criteria and there's a lot of libraries and prices that are available to kind of make that simplified or that simple that simplify that for you so you don't have to spend a lot of time thinking about how would this integrate in different languages or frameworks that you're using for your projects in addition only rsvp hackers are eligible to win prizes which means that if you are working with a team and your team members are not on your team page and you win any prizes we will only honor the people who are listed on the team at the time of the submission so this is a really big and important note for everybody that please make sure that if you're working on your team individually every team member is listed on your team and is confirmed as a rsvp feed hacker for this event [Music] uh so we're also getting a couple of questions by the way i will try to answer all the live stream questions as well but if we miss any questions you can ask us the same question to us on discord or on email we'll be able to quickly answer them for you as well so one question we just got is can we add a feature um to an existing project and uh and the answer is it depends because it really depends on what is the extent of work that was already done and what is the nature of that new addition that you're gonna be spending this uh this hackathon for so uh please give us a lot more a bit more context here so we can assess and kind of give you that thumbs up or or not but uh again this is going to be very specific usually it is not allowed for you to kind of just continue building on work um and the cost here is that it just disqualifies you from winning any prizes if you want to slowly use this event as a way to just kind of do something on your own that is still totally okay another common question which uh we get excited about is what if i'm new to all of this there's a lot of you who are trying to build something in web3 for the first time participating in this event and um the answer to that is uh that is totally okay we want these events to be very beginner friendly and want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support everybody who is trying to understand what's possible and as part of that we're doing a few things a lot of these things have already happened earlier today and yesterday but you can head over to find a team channel where you can join somebody who is looking for potential teammates or people with certain skill sets whether that's design or front end or or smart contracts um and you can kind of find potential semester there are a couple hundred of you in this position and a lot of you have already kind of started talking to each other which is great so you can definitely use that as a way to talk to others asynchronously on top of that we are also running a brainstorming call tomorrow we had another team formation call this morning uh so a lot of you are able to join we had another one yesterday and a lot of you kind of ended up meeting different teammates so um there's a lot of opportunities for you to meet others uh synchronously or asynchronously and we encourage all of you to kind of say hi in the build quest chat channel so that we get to know who you are and what you're excited about and also it is not required for you to work with a team it is totally okay for you to work on something on your own whether you want to use this event as an opportunity to try something out and give yourself a challenge or just simply you you prefer working on something that you've already been working on or brainstormed before it is totally okay to act solo in terms of talks and workshops there's a lot of amazing talks uh and uh content we have for beginners and experts so a lot of those workshops are going on today before and after uh this live stream and you can watch all of them uh through the website um and you should have already received calendar invites there's also a summit that we're hosting next friday uh we're gonna cover everything that's happening in the latest in kind of crypto gaming as well as what's happening with the metaverse the world and what people are kind of excited to build there uh and also all this information is available on your inflow center which is linked in every calendar invite as well and just because there are so many talks happening and there are people from so many different parts of the world if you're not able to make something uh work from a time zone standpoint and that is totally okay everything is recorded and it will be immediately made available on the global youtube channel so you can watch any of these talks uh immediately after by heading over to youtube.com eat global and to kind of see where all the talks and workshops are everything is listed on the website schedule so you can just head over to buildquest.apollo.com and you'll be able to see everything there immediately now one other important thing i want to cover is this notion of a check-in so this is a a two-week-long event and to make sure that we're able to help everybody uh with making sure they're unblocked and they're getting the right help or their all of their concerns are addressed we have this notion of a check-in a check-in is like a simple form where we ask you a couple of questions on your dashboard and we'll be doing two of these uh next week so this kind of lets us point you to the right direction if you kind of say i'm stuck on something or i need help with something specifically or i try to get help but i couldn't this makes it easy for us to kind of spot these cases and then make sure that you are unblocked and starting monday you'll be getting a message from us as well as it will show up on your dashboard as a quick check-in form where you can fill out how things are going so keep an eye out on these check-ins and as you can pull these check-ins out and submit a project you'll be able to kind of be good to receive all of your state returns back so everything happens to your dashboard no worries if you are uh not able to see this now because it will show up when check-in's officially open and it will pop up on your dashboard immediately after and just as a reminder submissions are due at noon eastern on sunday the 13th and i'll cover what submission process looks like and how all that's going to work now so in terms of judging um this is how judging is set up for bill quest judging will happen on monday the 14th which is the day after submissions are due and the judging is divided into two streams there's going to be a main project judging and there's going to be prizes for them on the sponsor side and every project will be considered for these two tracks the main judging only happens at a single two and a half hour window we'll be doing a lot of stuff in parallel so this is the window for all of the main judging and the way it's set up is that on sunday in the submission process you will be asked to record a four minute demo of your project this is a video that you have to kind of create as part of your submission where you get to talk about who you are why you're excited about what you built what does it do show us a demo and anything you want to kind of cover in those four minutes this is what's going to be used by our judges whether it's for any prizes uh or the main judging and we kind of really encourage all of you to not do this last minute because uh a lot of these things uh try to condense all the two weeks worth of work you've done and uh oftentimes you end up in a situation where it's gonna end up being more than four minutes so please make sure that everything is under four minutes from from the length and that you are leaving at least at least an hour if not more to record this about your team and being able to still make the deadline and all these details by the way are going to be made available on your dashboard as well as your info center so don't worry if like you missed this thing or you you're not sure if this is detailed enough we have a lot more information here with samples and examples from previous events for you to kind of use as a reference in terms of sponsor judging so if you're qualifying for any prizes by any of our partners the way that's going to work is that on the submission process itself in addition to your four-minute demo you'll have to specify that i am qualifying and trying to qualify for this price so you get to select this is the price um i want to qualify for and as you select those prices on your submission process they will be sent to those individual companies and they will be reviewing your four-minute submission as well and deciding on who has won uh what prize on their own which means that this will be entirely asynchronous the sponsors will kind of come to you if they have any questions but if they don't they'll be sort of just uh reviewing everything on their own and uh telling us who the winners are which we'll be announcing on the wednesday after submission and also i want to kind of quickly cover the code of conduct for this event even though it's an online event uh there is still a code of conduct here and the rules in terms of kind of what we cover and what matters uh for these global events as well as attendees the rules are fairly straightforward you can head over to eatglobal.com rules to get a quick overview and the gist of it is that we want to make sure that anything that comes out of this event is owned by you so you own intellectual property of all of your work and nobody else and in terms of how we behave in this community uh the gist of it is please be respectful and harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated so if you need any help or if you notice that somebody is treating you the way they shouldn't please reach out to anybody on the global team we'll be able to take immediate action and let's get to some of the exciting prices stuff so we have some amazing partners here i want to bring them on to kind of tell us about who they are why they're excited to be part of build quest and what they are kind of offering to all of you as hackers and first up i'd like to invite ipfs and nikki from the protocol labs team and she'll be able to share everything about the company my name is nikki and i work in the ecosystem growth team at ipfs and filecoin welcome to build quest our very first metaverse and gaming hackathon of 2022 organized by eat global and supported by ipfs and filecoin our team and the teams of other ecosystem partners supporting this hackathon are very excited to see what you've built in this hackathon we've been waiting for this since nft hack not so long ago in january after seeing all the exciting projects that were built there our goal uh in a hackathon such as build quest is to bring builders together and give you all a platform to bring ideas to life and you know also find people you can vibe with we hope you create meta verses and spaces and games that you not just build skills while creating but have the best of time doing so uh to tell you a little bit about us ipfs makes the web work peer-to-peer replacing the centralized architecture of today's internet and filecoin is the largest decentralized storage network built on top of ipfs and with storage helpers like nft.storage filecoin is becoming web3's infrastructure layer for nfds which many of you would be using to build your projects but you will hear a lot more about it in the workshops and talks that we have planned for you all in the meanwhile uh we have a whole bunch of learning resources that our community engineers have put together uh that you can check out to get started they will also be available on discord to answer any questions you may have with that i just want to say i hope you have a great time hacking and win some incredible prizes along the way amazing uh thank you so much nikki so uh just to kind of summarize this is uh this is an incredible set of tools that we have here uh especially being able to use nft store their web readout storage and kind of the goal here is that we want to make it super easy for all of you to quickly kind of use and port everything that you're doing in web 2 to web 3 especially as we look at a lot of these game assets so i'm super excited to see how many creative users we get to see on people using paulcoin or ipfs here directly for all these metaphors and gaming related submissions so if you have any questions around how you can use different libraries or if you want to get a support or something tested out for a different framework that you're using for your submission please ping the discord for the uh for help and the protocol labs team is there to answer all of your questions so you want to kind of get all that figured out very soon uh next up i want to bring on alex from immutablex and the way talking about who they are and what they're building hi everyone i'm alex cto and co-founder of immutable at immutable we build immutable x the first dedicated zk roll up for nfts with the mutablex we've created a platform for building high quality high asset count high scale gaming nft projects like elluvium gods unchained guild of guardians and embersort we've been building in the space since 2017 and we have so much excitement for what's coming next if you want to build an energy game in hours go to our documentation deploy an l1 or robson erc 721 contract and use our mint api to create assets at high scale with zero gas fees and an awesome user trading and minting experience immutablex is also the fastest way to build an nft marketplace immutable provides a shared global order book which any marketplace can contribute to and any marketplace can read from on immutablex you can build an nfc marketplace where you can take fees from the trades you facilitate literally with no back end fast enough even for a hackathon project there are many types of marketplaces from a big aggregator like openc to a really targeted website for trading god's unchained decks immutable lets you create an awesome targeted user experience for your marketplace without knowing any solidity at all immutable forms the liquidity layout between nft marketplaces and games we'd love for you to help us build the future of nft trading awesome thanks alex um so yeah you can use immutable x for a lot of really kind of high throughput gaming experiences so be sure to try out the sdk there and make something really cool and seamless uh and then we finally have ballast and alec will be talking about all those cool things you can do with the ballast api welcome everyone i'm alex from vallus and we enable web3 native software distribution and i'm also super excited to be here today because we came out of hackafest 2020 and now we're here sponsoring youth global so you never know what comes out of these things but what is web3 native software distribution well the elements are publishing fetching secure updates dow coordination and software licenses why do we need it well we're still distributing web3 tools over web 2. and i've got a few screenshots here of some awesome web3 tools that we all know and love that are still being unfortunately distributed over azure github or npm and we're putting massive amounts of effort into decentralization but then we're re-centralizing back at the distribution level and we're trying to fix that but what can we do now that we're in web 3 well at first it looks familiar we port over all the common features that we love from things like github and versal but once we're ported over no more reliance on a single entity from addition for distributing dials can now coordinate releases together instead of a centralized team you can create secure auto update systems powered by smart contracts and ipfs and you can monetize software directly using software license nfts and we're also giving a price for that so check that out how does it work well ipfs and filecoin for storage smart contracts on polygon for access control and versioning and then the vals client is then aware of all of the releases and mapping everything together and it's really a set of tools that glue these protocols together to make web3 developers lives easier while keeping everything decentralized so how do you use it for this hackathon you'll mostly care about the web dashboard and the typescript sdk and you could find it over at valves.io you could come join talk to us on our discord and check out our docs at docs.vous.io so best of luck and most importantly have a bunch of fun we're super excited to see what you build good luck and enjoy amazing thanks so much alec yeah this is this is one of the best parts of doing this thing because um as i like mentioned ellis was one of the winners of hackafest about two years ago and now they are fully pulling this incredible uh toolkit to kind of let you sort of get these guarantees that you wouldn't have otherwise what too and we're super proud to have them here supporting this event and kind of helping all of you also make really interesting and amazing projects so uh check out the valve sdk and i hope to see some really cool integrations here and some amazing winners all right on to
