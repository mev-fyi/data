[Applause] [Music] hello uh good evening uh good afternoon good morning or good night um i do not know where you are dialing in from but i do hope it's from all over the world just as we had over the last a few days participants from all over the world here at the eth global and zora hackathon metabolism hackathon um my name is mikhail based in berlin i am part of the zora team and being also one of the co-organizers of the hackathon and the last few days have been incredibly exciting for us um i'm really not exaggerating i really really mean it that the things that have been happening over the last few days were um absolutely unbelievable and i want any of you who might have participated as a builder as a designer as an artist or just as an audience member to thank you for your time for your work for your giga brain giga brain galaxy brain even ideas and all the beautiful things that you have built and i'm quite excited also to see what the jury has picked from i think nearly 100 submissions that we got um on sunday for the hackathon the jew was deliberating yesterday i've heard it was a very thorough and tough process they were fighting over the greatest ideas and the prices will be announced um tomorrow so i hope that you of all people and your team have uh won um so we have also today a wonderful program for you a digital summit that will explore a few ideas that i think and all of us things especially you know here zoro we think are very worth and important to pay attention to when we think about web 3 as an ecosystem when we think about web3 as a social space when we think about web3 as a technological space or as i like to call it as a techno social space which combines all these wonderful things into one um ever-growing wonderful rhizomatic network of ideas technologies communities and all the wonderful people embedded within and um when we talk about you know web 3 very often and especially also within the context of a hackathon we very often focus on the technology so we focus on the code we focus on on the solutions and very often and very utilitarian that's like somewhat technocratic aspects of these technologies but ultimately these technologies are way more they do manifest um also social political realities they are not just code you know within stories are embedded within that um um whole identities are embedded amplified and hopefully also also empowered and some of these things we wanted to explore now that you know you've had all the workshops you had all the intros you had all the technological deep dives you came out with more wisdom than ever about what it is that you're trying to build but um today we will dive into into the more social aspects of it not just we'll also have a couple of technological things let me have a look by the way i do this for the very first time so if this is um a little bit rough around the edges um for example you know this slide should have been shown already a few minutes ago but here is me um um two years ago and by the way opium hum that's like how you find me on on all the social media uh channels opium said by the way my dj name so if you ever go into a club you see opium harmless me um so let's go to the today's schedule so what are we actually you know exploring today if we talk about you know all of these ideas that i kind of try to introduce to you so one of the things that we really would like to pay attention to is dowse so the idea of a dao has kind of changed over the last 18 months to two years which used to be really really technocratic kind of fully on-chain tools of governance those tokenomics has also a little bit um changed into a cultural signifier of sorts so web three native communities that want to signal that they are using a web3 technologies um they call themselves often a dao even though sometimes the technological aspect of the dao are not quite there yet or might not be the priority but nonetheless it's a really really important um category and one thing that we've seen is a lot of the of the projects that we've seen over the last 18 months are cooperatives you know they are vehicles for co-production and this is something we would want to dive into with a couple of participants that are really native to web 3 but also come from the culture industries and particularly you know andrea mcdonough from shisetso which is a group of women and femme and queer people in the media and art industries and what i'm particularly excited about elijah who is an absolute legend of uk grime and bass music and then music industry heavyweight in ukraine she will be joining us as well on top of sir su who all of you probably know and izzy from refraction now and and after that we are going to talk a little bit about how these technologies were 3 technologies in particular can be used for agency how to manifest agency what agency really means especially within the context of politicized bodies so um when we talk about you know building technology that contains equity the question is you know what kind of equity and for whom and i do think that in particular you know trans and queer communities uh that very often are not at the center of when such technologies are built have a unique opportunity using these technologies for not only empowerment but also for building very very resilient ecosystems and this is going to be a panel that is co-presented by our friends from mutual laws a wonderful group of people that you should most certainly um follow like everyone on these panels please please i find them all incredibly inspiring and so will you follow them and a whole new world will open for you uh a no whole idea space um let's see oh yes han von and dobel legendary like this is an artist who was making nfts because nfts before nfts were even invented that is how long he's been doing web 3 and blockchain based art one of the very first artists to ever do an artwork on on chain and he will deep dive into his creative process and um wrapping things quickly up we also will look into the emerging ecosystems of web3 music so web 3 music is not just minting songs as 101 nfts but they are already whole economies and ecologies of web 3 native ecosystems emerging from on-chain digital audio workstations down to what does that actually mean you know to to bring music on chain and one aspect that scholars and scientists and also builders have been arguing about a lot is metadata standards and even if it sounds boring to some of you it's incredibly important because it enables so much and then something that i'm particularly excited about is um imanibello will join us from france she is a lawyer that is particularly um focused on ai and innovation law and given the fact that the last few weeks were all dominated by conversations around um artificial intelligence whether it's art whether it's not art she will deep dive um with us into the ethical implications of these new emerging technologies and also the economies that will result from it so this is what we have for now um and um i'm gonna kick it off
