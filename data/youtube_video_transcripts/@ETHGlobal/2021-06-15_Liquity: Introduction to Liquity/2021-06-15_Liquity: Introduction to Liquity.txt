confirming stream one second all right welcome everyone to our um hacker workshop we have colton from liquidy with an intro to liquidy um you guys should feel free if you're in the zoom call to enter your questions in the zoom chat and colton can read them as he goes along and you're also it's a workshop so if you're really feeling it you can turn on your audio and ask a question colton's good to roll with that um so i'll let colton take it away we have about 30 minutes cool thanks andrew um yeah as andrew mentioned i'm colton i'm the head of growth at liberty let me know if my screen isn't working it should be working um but yeah like you mentioned feel free to interject at any time if i'm saying something that doesn't make sense or i'll try to keep an eye on the chat if i miss it just interrupt me and i'll stop and answer any questions before we get started though i'll just knock out the important stuff right away in case you don't want to hear me ramble for the next 20 minutes so our prizes for this event will be 2 500 for first place and ltty tokens uh second third place will be 1 500 in lpty tokens and then we'll be doing a pool of one thousand five hundred dollars in lkty tokens um basically distributed across all ballot submissions under the sort of liquidy category uh some ideas that we're looking for uh again i'm just getting this stuff out of the way and i'll actually cover what liquidy is in case you aren't familiar uh some ideas we're looking for things like trope management tools which are effectively position management tools uh migration tools such as like maker to liquidity tools or aveda liquidity tools uh sort of auto leveraging and deleveraging tools so liquidity is a great protocol for using or getting leverage so making that as easy as possible is always ideal and then multitasking using things like instadap's dsa architecture or even just regular ds proxy architecture would be awesome things like the ability to claim lqdy rewards and then stake those rewards in one transaction instadap also has prizes available for this event so maybe there's some opportunity there to participate in both and then any product that increases lusd demand by utilizing curve urine pickle finance or sort of any other integration is fair game to us and then resources are liquidy.org and docs.liquidity.org all right so now uh that the tldr is out of the way i'll actually kind of cover what liquidy is so liquidy is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw zero percent interest loans against e this collateral uh those loans are paid out in lusd which is a usd peg stable coin that's completely backed by e that's not backed by any other forms of collateral so our post launch growth might zoom things in the way i can't read this there you go so our post launch growth has been pretty awesome uh right now there's around 970 000 eth locked in the protocol lusd has a pretty big supply of around 780 million um which is i think a market cap a little over that of 780 million dollars there's around 840 troves open i think you know with the tools that are hopefully built throughout this event we can get that well over a thousand uh there's a thousand stability providers in our stability pool and curve our liquidity on curve is around 240 million dollars so we launched around two months ago so all of that is within about two two and a half months so some unique features of liquidity that people are really resonating with are that it's capital efficient we have a decentralized front-end model there's zero percent interest as mentioned and it's completely governance free so there's no governance overhead in any way so for the capital efficiency liquidity allows for a minimum collateralization ratio as low as 110 percent which is noticeably lower than you know other protocols that require 130 150 or even you know as high as 750 percent collateralization ratios and it gets away with this because it has a sort of efficient and instant liquidation mechanism so other borrowing protocols require sort of collateral auctions or fixed price collateral sales uh whenever positions need to be liquidated and these are sort of famously inefficient and slow uh you know back in i think it was like black thursday a while back like whenever we had issues across d5 because of these mechanisms uh liquidy you know greatly improves upon those so liquidy instead provides an instant liquidation mechanism that leverages existing stakeholders through what we call a stability pool and it also uses a secondary redistribution mechanism in the event that that stability pool is empty so the stability pool allows users to basically pre-commit lusd to repay debt from liquidated tropes in exchange for the surplus youth collateral and additional lqty rewards this basically completely removes the need for auctions post-liquidation and i'll kind of go over how it works so we can kind of wrap our head around it so you have the troves on the left and then the stability pool on the right users come along and they deposit lusd up front and they're basically saying you know i'm willing to give up some of my lusd exposure in the event that there's liquidations to buy that liquidated eth collateral and let's say a trove gets under collateralized so it falls under the 110 percent collateral ratio a liquidator comes along and says okay this position needs to be liquidated it's under collateralized that liquidator will receive 0.5 percent of the eath in that trove plus a 200 l usd sort of flat fee and then all of that troves eat will be distributed amongst the stability pool depositors so now the liquidator is happy they have their money but we still and the east has been distributed disability pool depositors we still have this sort of um leftover bad debt that we need to pay for to do that we just burn some lusd proportionally across all stability pool depositors to pay off the debt so the debt's made whole everybody's happy uh stability pool depositors got to buy that liquidated collateral at a little bit of a discount and we're all satisfied and so the other bonus for participating in the stability pool is that you earn the sort of secondary token of liquidity called the lqgy token and so these are rewarded proportionally disability pool depositors as a function of time so as long as you have an lusd deposit in the stability pool you're earning these rewards and the sort of eth rewards if you want to call them that are a lot more variable because it's hard to predict you know when eath is going to be volatile when there's going to be liquidations etc if the stability pool is empty the system falls back to a redistribution mechanism and the way this works is relatively simple so let's say we have a trove that needs to be liquidated but there's nothing in the stability pool that trove's collateral will be distributed proportionally amongst all of the other troves in the system according to the amount of collateral they have so once the collateral's distributed proportionally then the debt is distributed proportionately and that trove is completely offset against all of the users in the system so in the event that the stability pulls this empty then all of the the risk kind of falls on the users of the protocol i mentioned lpty so again lqty is a sort of secondary token it is a reward mechanism for stability providers and front-end operators which i'll cover in a bit lqty can be staked in order to earn fees which are generated from the protocol super simple it's not a governance token it doesn't give you any governance rights or anything like that it's a really simple reward mechanism that can be staked and then it can earn fees uh so far uh 12.5 million dollars has been distributed to sacred since launch so these rewards are paid out in lusd which is charged on loans whenever they're initiated and then eth whenever uh redemptions take place which i'll cover later and i guess i should add that lqdy's taking is a relatively simple mechanism it's not like obvious taking or some other protocols taking where lkdy holders take on some amount of risk for like backstopping the protocol or whatever you simply earn the token and stake it and there's no real like risk there as far as like you can't be slashed or anything so i mentioned a second ago that front end operators also received lqty rewards and the reason for this is because liquidity ag the company or b or us that built the protocol we do not actually run a front-end or ui for liquidy so instead we incentivize others in the ecosystem to do so via lpty rewards so basically anybody can spin up a front end and have the opportunity to earn these additional rewards by generating turnover for the protocol just a little fun fact the top five front ends have earned a combined 41 000 a little over 41 000 ltty which is around 370 thousand dollars and so it's not too bad for for two months after launch and the infrastructure looks a little bit like this you know you have your typical uh back end which is your smart contracts then you have your front end and then users can access that protocol through whatever front end they choose you know they don't just have to trust us to give them a good product they can trust the ecosystem to give them a good product and so the only way that front ends get paid is if people make stability pool deposits through the front end so we covered the stability pool earlier that is the one thing that front ends can earn rewards from you don't earn rewards whenever people borrow from your protocol but only when they deposit the stability pool from your from your front end so a stability posit when it's made through a front end the front end tags it with its ethereum address and what we call a kickback rate which specifies how the lqgy rewards will be split between the front end and its users so for example a kickback rate of 80 percent means that the front end will receive 20 of its users earned lqti rewards this ensures that front-ends and stability providers are sort of rewarded for their essential service right without front-ends nobody can access liquidity without stability providers liquidating positions becomes you know super undesirable so being making sure we reward those two key stakeholders in the ecosystem is essential for liquidity success i won't go into this much further but to get started you can go to liquidity.org frontend uh there's some resources there to to get things going for you and if you want to make that part of your project uh throughout hack money then by all means please do so the next interesting feature of liquidity is the zero percent interest rate uh so in liquidity floating interest rates are replaced by a one-time borrowing fee this means that you know the cost to borrow up front it's a lot closer to a fixed rate lending model so to understand how like liquidy gets away with this when almost every single other borrowing protocol charges variable interest rates i think we have to like take a step back and understand you know why do some of these protocols charge interest at all uh whether it's like maker dow or maybe reflex or some of these other ones uh similar to liquidity where you're depositing each and then borrowing a minted asset from that eve so interest rates help encourage or effectively help encourage and discourage borrowing it's it's basically an economic lever that these protocols have access to and so if there's too much borrowing but not enough stable coin demand and the peg is starting to float below the l usd peg or any usd peg stable coin is starting to float below one dollar you can raise interest rates and that'll encourage people to pay back their loans decreasing the supply and increasing the the price of the asset there's too little borrowing but too much stable coin demand and so the price of the the synthetic asset is you know going up and floating way above peg you can lower interest rates and encourage people to borrow more so more supply enters the market and brings the peg you know back down to parity so understanding that you can start to understand how liquidity can use fees to recreate a similar dynamic so liquidy uses what we call a base rate to determine the issuance fee so the issuance fee again is charged on your lusu whenever you borrow from liquidity it's just charged up front and so if the demand for loans is too high relative to lusd demand that base rate will increase otherwise it will decrease or decay over time meaning that there's not um there's not too much demand for lusd and the way that liquidity sort of detects this demand for lusd is through what we call a redemption and so at any time anyone can redeem lusd for the underlying eth collateral at face value such that one lusd equals one dollar worth of beef so when lusd is below one dollar meaning there's too many people borrowing but not enough lusd demand arbitragers can sort of step in buy up some lusd and redeem it for as if it's worth one dollar sell that eat that they get from that redemption and then pocket the difference so again if a usd is at 97 cents they can buy up some mil usd redeem it against the system as if it's worth one dollar and then you can kind of keep the difference there this in turn causes an increase in that base rate that i mentioned earlier making loans and redemptions more expensive and thus less appealing so you whenever a lot of redemptions are taking place and lusd is below its peg then people will start redeeming it and the cost to borrow will become you know prohibitively expensive relative to other alternatives in the space and so that means lusd is being burned until eventually hopefully luc floats up back to parity with one dollar and you can kind of visualize this by seeing here that you know lusd has this like price floor of around one dollar and a price ceiling of around a dollar and ten cents or so and the reason a dollar in 10 cents is because if it's at a dollar and 15 cents you just take out a maximum loan at the 110 collateral ratio and then sell the lesd and you'll make an instant profit it's basically free money and very similar for if lusd is trading uh comfortably below one dollar you could just redeem it and again it's basically free money so these arbitrage strategy or these two arbitrage strategies kind of keep lusd where it needs to be as far as price parity goes to understand how redemptions work i put together this little visual because it's kind of weird so it's important to understand because some people get pretty confused by this so first things first all troves and liquidy are sorted according to their collateralization ratio or their collateral ratio mostly from least or most risky to least risky so the from lowest collateral collateral ratio to highest collateral ratio and somebody when they come along to redeem lusd that lusd is redeemed against the riskiest trove or set of troves depending on the size of their redemption and what happens is they redeem that lusd and they pay off the debt of the riskiest troves that are affected by the redemption in return for those troves collateral so you can see here the guy comes along he pays some lust and in return he's receiving some eth and then any surplus collateral is retained for the trove owner so basically if you're a trove owner and you're affected by a redemption it's not a net loss for you because you get to keep your lusd that you borrowed and you lose debt so that's debt you don't have to pay back and any bit of your extra e collateral that's left over after the redemption you get to keep so it's very different from a liquidation for example where in a liquidation you lose 10 percent of the entire value of your trove a redemption is sort of a net neutral experience for you the only downside is that you lose a little bit of your earth exposure and the plus side is that lusd doesn't lose half of its purchasing power by some weird event where there's too much lusd supply and not enough demand so it's a little bit of a trade-off but that's how sort of liquidy gets away with not having an interest rate by instead using a mechanism that allows lusd to be burned and sort of go back into the system the last big feature of liquidy is that it's governance free so probably wondering like you know wow a lot of this seems automatic and that's exactly right so liquidy handles all of this stuff automatically no new collateral types can be added no new interest rates can be added it's completely immutable completely decentralized and liquidity has no need for like governance or lengthy votes or lengthy processes or anything else basically the bar the issuance fee is determined algorithmically the redemption fees are determined algorithmically and everything else is handled by the smart contracts and so again no governance the only thing that some people consider governance i guess are the underlying oracles so liquidity uses two oracles it uses the chain link usd price feed as its primary oracle and then it has telor the teller eth usd price feed as its secondary oracle and it primarily uses the chain link price feed but it can automatically switch to the tell or price feed if it needs to and vice versa so again governance doesn't even need to intervene there the system can automatically detect when something is off between or for one of the price feeds and switch between them um i guess i can pause now for some q a and then if not i can if there's no questions i can go back and review our sort of prizes and what we're looking for now with liquidity in context there was something in the chat i might have missed it um it doesn't look like there was so if there's any questions now feel free to ask them if not i'll go over you know our prize stuff or anything else hey i missed the first few minutes so i'll go back and watch the youtube video later uh but cool cool project uh question on the oracle um yes why is chain link expensive like why are you using chain link uh there yeah so i mean there were there weren't a ton of options that felt like sufficient to us especially like maybe uniswap would have been a potential viable option the only problem was that uh basically lusd just didn't exist whenever you know before liquidity launched so it was like a chicken and egg problem and so we couldn't have got gotten a lusc price feed or anything like that and so that means we would have had to have relied on some other uniswap pool or to get that t-watt price and use that which didn't make sense to us like it didn't like how do we choose do we use usdc do we use usdt do we use die it's hard to know or do we like average them all and so it seemed to make the most sense to use uh chain link because it gave us that sort of guarantee that we're going to get a good usd price and it's fast it updates really frequently i think every 0.5 price deviation is when it updates and liquidy needs to be able to liquidate positions very fast due to the low collateral ratio so that those were some of the thought processes that processes that kind of went into it yeah that makes a lot of sense cool is there any any other ones if not i will go back over uh what we're looking for throughout this event or kind of give some ideas of what we're looking for throughout this event now that there's context uh so the tl dr people got it earlier but anyway so revisit so some cool ideas that we're looking for are things like trope management management tools so people can avoid liquidations or avoid redemptions or you know whatever cool sort of trope management ideas anybody might have migration tools are always great like people might want to be able to sort of migrate from maker to liquidy or even liquidity to maker ave to liquidy liquidity to ave like having tools like that is super valuable i guess one of the things that i should have mentioned regarding the sort of borrowing fee if i can get back to it somewhere yeah so the borrowing fee on liquidity is especially cheap relative to peers in the space so uh for example if you want to borrow on maker right now i think they just lowered the ethereal vault like 3.5 or something like that whereas on liquidy the upfront borrowing fee is usually about point five percent and the upper bound is five percent in case that there's just a ton of redemptions or something so for the most part you're going to be able to borrow from liquidity by paying a point five percent borrowing fee up front so for some people who are taking out maker loans or ava loans or whatever else they might benefit from instead leaving those loans and borrowing from liquidity instead where they know they'll get a much much cheaper rate so that's where those ideas come from about you know being able to migrate between protocols then again auto leveraging and deleveraging tools the ability to access leverage really easily or automatically it would be great for some people multitasking using again instant apps dsa or regular ds proxy architecture there's a bunch of steps in some of these that people may not like paying gas for doing like you know nobody wants to earn a deposit to the disability pool earn lqi rewards claim those lqi rewards then go stake them and pay gas all along the way they'd probably rather just do it all in one transaction if it's possible so creating tools like that would be sick and then again any product that increases lusd demand by utilizing any of our integrations is fair game and i'll just leave the prizes up for the last part of this in case there's any last-minute questions other than that i think i think i covered most of the important stuff oh go ahead i was just opening up the questions can you you can do it on the an auto leverage and d leverage in the same transaction um maybe i have no idea it might depend on like what you're what you're trying to do uh and depends on the amount of leverage but i'm not totally sure but uh if you're if you're planning on doing something like that feel free to ask in the discord and i'll get somebody to take a look and make sure like it whether it's possible or not possible right great any other questions sweet if not hopefully i made good time i i tried to try to make it short and sweet i know people don't like sitting through like 50-minute workshops so tried to run through it yeah it was great and um you know like colton said you can continue if anything comes up continue in the discord uh the liquidy channel in the discord and also we're going to post this to the youth global youtube um channel so you can watch it uh if you want to get uh reminded of what was in it all right thank you very much colton thanks everybody and we'll see you in discord awesome thanks
