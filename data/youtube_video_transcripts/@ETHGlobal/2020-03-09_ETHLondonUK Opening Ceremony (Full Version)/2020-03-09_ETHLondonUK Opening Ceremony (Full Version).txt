hello London okay it's a little bit tough to follow Queen but I think you know I think we'll do a good job I hope so yeah I hope so welcome to East London I'm Simona I'm Karthik and welcome everyone welcome to London welcome to London so is the clicker not working nevermind so this is the very first hackathon East London global hawk Vaughn in the UK and we are super super excited to hold it in London in this beautiful venue I know a lot of you have travelled from far and wide some a little bit further than others personally this is the hackathon that I've traveled the least for I live down in Brighton so I took the Train I'm very green today and will be tomorrow and on sunday karthik on the other hand has travelled a little bit longer are you a little bit jet-lagged a little bit just a little bit so your tasks aside all the hacking and all of the other cool stuff is if you see karthik without a coffee or an energy drink it is your job to provide him with one literally the future of each global depends on it so please please if you see him without energy or coffee provide him with some she's not kidding she I am not I'm not he's dozed off a few times no I'm joking great so we are here there's about 300 of us I think there's more arriving for tomorrow and Sunday we love seeing the advanced and intermediate hackers coming here and hopefully building some incredible stuff but I'm particularly excited about the beginners in you to aetherium people that we have here today I was in a workshop an intro to web 3 workshop this morning which was awesome and we went through a lot of the basic concepts and hopefully that will help everybody have a really really good hackathon and produce some really cool stuff so yes so over 20 countries represented here again thank you so much for everybody who travelled who dared to travel with all the news about all sorts of viruses and and all of that jazz but you are all good we're here and we're gonna have an awesome weekend and because I mentioned a lot of people are from from around here we actually have 65% are from London whoo oh there's London you could have done better on the we will rock you for Queen come on guys okay so we have over 20 companies who are sponsoring this event which is again great great to see we have 13 tech talks which are not Ted Tech which are gonna happen tomorrow and on Sunday we have eight workshops all happening today we've already had some they will continue this evening and they are all literally get out of here go left if you have trouble ask the guys at the front desk they will guide you and help you out we also have over 30,000 great British pounds in prizes that's over it's like a hundred thousand US dollars or something that's like a lot of money yeah yeah yeah so that is a lot of money right there and we also have our wonderful wonderful mentors who go mentors for defy for UX or privacy for gaming literally everything that you need so ask them everything ask them anything they'll be able to help you and also maybe not help you with some hacking tips but tomorrow we have an awesome fireside with Vitalik and Joe that will happen on this stage right here at noon which is 12 p.m. you'll also be able to ask them a lot of questions if you have burning questions that you want to ask them and I'll show you how you join our community so that you can ask these questions and hopefully get your answers that's tomorrow so I'm gonna figure out how this clicker works and well we're super excited to kind of be be in late London eat London is a neat global event the thing that excites me more and and everytime when when I go on stage and talk about it global is that every time there is a new set of audience that have to speak to and they don't know what if global is and that is the best part because the goal of if goal was to get new developers into the weather ecosystem and the more new faces we see the better it is because we think that is us being successful that our goal so if global events are at these events we do these around the world they contain okay well that that is a glitch in the matrix oh never mind it's it's the transitions so what what actually the template of each of our events is that these are hackathons and we don't section them off as anywhere from tracks to specific problems you're solving you get to put whatever you want we want you to have the creative freedom to build anything that you like whether it's interesting to you at the time or something you've been thinking about you get to do this these are opportunities for you to learn mentor and grow this is about understanding what's possible in this ecosystem so a lot of this is about being able to find the people who are working on these similar things with you getting help from them there's tons of mentors out here available anywhere from in-person in to discord and if you're ever stuck or if you want to learn something about a technology you can probably find the person who invented it in this room and that's what makes it amazing this is entirely for the ecosystem these are not contests these are not events where you have to come before a specific prize these are pure opportunities for you to learn and kind of just say this again this is a hackathon not a conference way less emphasis on on more talks this is about building showing what you're doing and to kind of continue with that theme we prefer showcasing over telling so even if you're working on a project this weekend and you don't get to make it work or get it to be in the final form that you want it to be you should still present to the judges because it's about progress not about having a polished product and we really care about you getting better at building and getting closer to what you want to build so we've done these events all across the world and this is why we're here in in the UK and these events include anywhere from having talks and workshops to opportunity to talk to to the people in this space that are making this ecosystem better from anywhere from New York to Cape Town to to India to San Francisco these events let thousands of people come into this space since since the beginning of a global over the past 18 months we've had over 10,000 people at these events we've seen over a thousand projects and hosted people from over 75 countries and this is what makes this community great and diverse and really cool because they experiment and build all these projects some of them you've heard of anywhere from miss adapt to Krypto kitties to set protocol to 1 inch exchange all these have come out of these hackathons in the past and we can't wait to see what all of you build because these are opportunities for you to dream big and we want to be there to help you achieve that so I'm super excited to see what comes out of youth London on Sunday and and let's move on to the rest of the show so with that I want to call actually two people from this community Josh stark and Evan Venice who will come here and go over this new segment add to all of our events and it's called the yeren theorem so far and Josh and Evan will sum up what's happened in this ecosystem in a handful of slides and and tell you what's what's actually exciting so with that please welcome Josh and Evan on stage [Applause] everybody thank you for coming thank you credit for the kind introduction I'm Josh I'm one of the cofounders of youth global and in my spare time when I have it I write a blog post one blog post a year with Evan and it takes about the whole year so yeah and it took between us because it's we take so much time at it and Evan you obviously know from the weekend aetherium news.com I popular newsletter that I'm sure all of you already subscribed to so what we thought we do here is just you know rather than wait till January 2021 you know let's update the community more often about just a few cool things that have happened already this year so we just picked six things to kind of throw out there that we thought would be interesting to you in this building so let's get started number one in no particular order and Evan you've got the clicker number one so a lot you probably know this already but the total value locked and defy crossed 1 billion I believe on February 7th which is an incredible accomplishment for an ecosystem that barely existed a couple years ago for those of you who don't know D Phi refers to decentralized finance and it is the term we use to refer to many different financial applications built on the theorem so things like decentralized exchanges stable coins ways to trade your crypto or leverage it lending protocols insurance protocols and much much more and the total value locked in it all that means is there's all these assets that you know might serve as collateral or liquidity pools that exist inside these applications and today today it's a little less than a billion dollars but it did cross a billion dollars already this year number two the ecosystem support program launched this amazing wish list and this is particularly relevant to the hackers and builders in this room ecosystem support is a program by the etherium foundation to provide financial and other support to projects across the ecosystem and there's now a wish list of things that the EF would love to see people building so if you're curious about how to get engaged in the etherium ecosystem check out this list and learn about what you could work on I should note too that all these links will be posted in the official discord later so you'll be able to find them number three Heath Denver happened some of you I know were even there it was an amazing event with you know over a thousand people at it and a lot of great stuff got built if you are still thinking about what to build this weekend and want ideas check out their blog post with the winners and also their blog posts with every single submission from the hackathon it might be a great way to build on top of the work that's already been done and now I'll turn over to Evan yeah so Spencer Dinwiddie who is a guard for the New Jersey Nets he tokenized his contract on on ethereum there's some pretty cool stories there the team was doing something else before they got into doing this and also like the NBA tried to fight him and he kept pushing forward and eventually got it to a place where he could do it so it is something that is only open to accredited investors but it was a very cool like way of seeing like a real world person who's famous outside of crypto getting into into tokenizing things on a theorem so we also saw flash loans which was very exciting and maybe a little too exciting um especially if you you know hold die so it we've seen so flash loan basically is within one block the idea that you can basically get a loan from somebody and pay a small amount as long as you pay it back within that same block that same transaction so the atomicity is you know is there so there's a lot of things you can do when all the sudden capital is not a constraint and I've seen people say things like you know it's the democratization of you know like being a whale or of being rich and being able to do things like latency orb so that's really neat and it unlocks a lot of different things like you know having to have a governance security module in maker so and then like you know there's a lot of stuff that's already launched this year I think like calling out a few that are just here as well like Aztec of course launched confidential transactions on on maenette that's super cool there in the back at the table there if you want to talk to them you know another couple other things is like you know set came out of one of one of the heath global events loop ring launched the first ZK stark roll-up which is super cool they actually on their exchange which is a trustless layer too they're doing like thousands of transactions for a second so there is a you know scalability is starting to really be here and block chains and then you know there's also stuff like our trees which is really cool which is just using your your your die in compound you can plant trays I'm using the interest from your die that is locked in in defy and if you don't know what any of these terms are I failed to explain them and I'm sorry but you can come asking me about them and I'd be happy to talk to you and if you want to find out what happened last year please read the blog post that we spent a thousand hours writing again the link will be in discord afterwards and with that what does kind of wrap up is the last slide all the links again will be in the chat and if you want to keep up with aetherium subscribe to Evans awesome newsletter he's very unwilling to shill it so I will it is the best most granular way to keep up with especially technical developments in aetherium it's incredible go sign up right now I want I want him to tell me later that he had a real bump from this evening so thank you for everyone I hope you have a great time this weekend happy hacking [Applause] Thank You Evan and Josh I'll say it again we can get there iam the best update on the secret system please subscribe because you won't tell you - next up we have a couple of sponsors who want to share what they're doing in and sort of tell you about exactly why they're here what they do what they want to actually contribute to the secret system and just generally support everybody that's here from a mentorship from an SDK and and their tools standpoint and I want to start anybody them on stage you can assure those words so with that speaking of fleshlings I want to call up Jordan from our way to tell you a bit about Allie and what there are - please welcome Jordan on stage hey guys okay so I've streaming it I will try to be quick if you know not familiar with Ave and beside flash phones we do a simple boring and lending allowing you to earn in on your assets or to leverage your long positions but to present what to present the price of this week this weekend this will be quite nice we have a 2500 a died prior sorry we have a 2500 a diet prices for the coolest icon on Ave and the cool thing is that it's actually in EDI and ADA is our token when you deposit in other and we just deposited so by the end of the weekend actually you will earn at the current rate in the FI of 8% on die that will make you $1 more by the end of the weekend and you can keep it in the protocol to keep earning so it's quite nice we are also swags a special site for occurs and we have open swag for everyone at the booth but beside the price is like what what brings you but what is interesting if you want to a con are they we we try to help you with many things we have a quite cool documentation we have also a large community of open source contributor the protocol is all open source everything we do is open source and public and actually if we like what you build or if you want to continue building on an ecosystem there is possibility that we help you to get funding or that we give some small grants just to support your work actually we have here within the room people were already built on Ave but actually beside that we will help you in marketing branding swag like I said and love support therapy like we all need it in a theorem but maybe something that we are the strongest that we can do memes for you [Music] this is actually the flow of calm David was here in the in don't know David are you here yeah David is here it will cotton swab basically that allows you to change the long position into your makeup walls let's say that you were long bat in your vault and within one transaction you can be long eth and with without having the capital needed to close your position so it's actually quite nice you can do a lot of things with flash on within one transaction but we will make memes for you to reach out Hodgins if you want to learn more about flash one we have a talk tonight at nine emiliana store and on the way well somewhere in the room will speak and give a more technical presentation on what you can do is flash saloon and we also have another talk tomorrow at 2:00 on composability within defy with Ave and actually this is what's a Couture now it's like it's not just like technical compressibility it's like human composability we are you are going to make teams you don't know each other so this is all about what this weekend is and if you need a up this is our telegram if you need to contact us during the weekend if you have more need for technical help you have here some of the devs and you have stunni is your event which is in business and the head of the operation if you need anything feedback well we are all pretty multitask so we even technical you can ask trying to be quick so respecting that cheers guys thank you Thank You Jordan I'm super excited to to hear about both fleshlings concealing and what all of you are hack on with flash lamps next up I want to call Tom from a speck and Tom's gonna tell you about what I said kiss and how you can use them for your hacks please welcome Tom on stage hi this is Britton so we can't afford a slide show I give you a 30 second intro to the Aztek protocol may be aware we earned this Evan just said we launched on brexit Day 31st of January that certainly wasn't deliberate we currently handle confidential transactions but we're a privacy network with much greater aspirations than that so at the moment you can do as ed kadar you can integrate that right now into your adapts and we certainly hope to see lots of those over the course of the next couple of days we're then going to be introducing later in the year user privacy so we get rid of the transaction graph and then finally a code privacy and scalable privacy towards the end of the year so that's our that's our roadmap and we have a great SDK so please come and speak to us if there are going to be lots of us tech representatives because we're on home turf here so come to us about that we've got 2000 decade die as a prize pot and particularly good prizes on offer if you integrate two main net and we also just can be giving out 2,000 SEK a day we're feeling very generous so please come see us and we'll give you give you some slips which have some random amounts of SEK a die some of those notches $50 which is a lot of money these days anyway thanks please come and see us we're right at the rack and look forward to meeting you all of course weekend thanks so I might even like they can tell from a sec thank you okay now now I have my microphone back I feel better okay so thank you so much and as second Ave but of course they are not the only sponsors because as I mentioned before there are many others making this possible and what I want you to do now because you didn't do great on the Queen thing I don't hold a grudge but maybe a tiny one I want you for the fur next four slides to start clapping and not stop so everybody let's let's show them love so people start where diversify orchids consensus liquidity network Aztec ENS bible' 1kx Taurus meta present deaf hero pillar AWS in furor kick back Acropolis endorse T Phi prime K CL blockchain and the cerium London without your support these events would literally not be possible and it's not just about its kind of being here and and or anything financial it's about actually being here being part of the team and making us helping us make this event better by giving all of your support and time to the rest of the hackers and that's what makes this this is amazing so thank you from the bottom of her heart I want to move on to kind of the main part of this ceremony and that is our keynote address and a lot of you will need either an ecosystem a lot of you are super familiar with this and it have kind of been in anywhere from previous eatable events to other events in the space that around the web three topic and it makes this super unique as an ecosystem is that it is an open permission was platform and not just from like a technical side it's it's the fact that anybody can come in from any background and start contributing oftentimes there's a discovery process a process to understand what's going on how do I pass contribute but largely it is one of the only ecosystems that are out there not just about crypto not just a technical thing just in overall that he is ready to accept audiences from anywhere from research to development to marketing to to like you name it or any category but how do we actually make better use of anywhere from guiding people to contribute better to understanding how do we highlight what these problems are that are worth solving or focusing on can we do that can we do a better job at that and share some of these thoughts on this topic I wouldn't actually call up Albany from the internal foundation who is connealy going to give his talk on he theorem from multiple tables and with that please welcome all Bernie on stage do these work okay [Music] hey everybody thanks a ton for coming as Karthik said my talk today will be about aetherium from multiple perspectives but first my well my name is Albert and the most important thing you should know about me is that I am really jet-lagged right now there's a few other things that may be worth knowing you know I studied math and si si had a pretty cool startup experience and that led to other learning experiences and eventually led me to work and help the etherion foundation today now for today's talk for those of you who saw my talkative boston the first half of this talk is mostly a redux of that I've tinkered with some parts and the second half I'm excited to present some new concepts and tie-ins with each London so the fundamental premise of this talk is that in order to improve our understanding of complex topics we should consider a wide variety of perspectives this doesn't guarantee that we'll have enough understanding you know one of the tricky things about power laws is that you can get 99 things right but the hundred thing you missed might dominate everything else but considering more perspectives also increases the chances that we hit on the most important thing now one of the most complex topics is forecasting the future and one lens for thinking about the future is to look at the past after all we are in the future compared to the past so to start I collected some quotes about the internet back from the 1990s so this first quote is from Robert Metcalfe 1995 the inventor of Ethernet which has nothing to do with aetherium it's kind of an ironic quote if you think about both the timing and this particular technology that has been vital to the adoption of the Internet this next quote obsessively I think it's pretty reasonable that says that most things that succeed don't require retraining 250 million people of course we know that it's now much much more than that then we have another quote about all these promises of what the Internet is going to bring you know airline tickets restaurant reservations sales contracts and of course it makes this note that the local mall still does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month that might sound familiar to some of you in etherium land lastly we have this somewhat infamous quote about the Internet's impact on the economy versus the fax machine and I almost felt bad including this because I believe the context for this quote was actually to to make a somewhat contrarian statement at the time so I do think it's important to put some of these things in the appropriate context the other important context to put here is I'm not trying to actually compare if the a.m. or blockchain to like be the next Internet I think doing that would be similar to the type of mistakes that these quotes made now the moment that we start thinking we know it's going to happen it's also the moment that we're at the highest risk and so that's why in almost all of my talks I like to cite the parable of the blind man and the elephant most of you probably heard this parable or some form of it in the story there's multiple blind men they're touching different parts of an elephant for whatever reason and since they each have a incomplete picture they make different and incorrect assumptions about the object they're touching so it's obvious that the blind men are making a mistake with their statements in this picture but there's actually two bigger mistakes going on first they aren't considering that they're directly interfacing with something that like may be much bigger than what what's there that they're able to experience second they are communicating with each other now I won't fault somebody for being blind that's out of your control but given that they're talking I don't think they're deaf so this part I think is on them that's why when trying to grok etherion or anything being complex I think it's important to take multiple perspectives and communicate about them well note with a better picture even if it's not perfect and that's the dual of this talk as well to improve our picture at least an expectation improve it by looking at a theory and from different perspectives and so the first perspective is history I don't mean watching history or cryptography history or digital cache history those are important but even further out now like the first four quotes which had to be broadcast by a newspaper as magazine articles or recorded presentations I got this quote directly via Twitter as a tangent I still think about this sometimes I I grew up in the Chicago area I was a big sports fan and back in 1995 Michael Jordan announced he was coming out of retirement to return to basketball if it was a big thing back then this announcement undoubtedly would have broken it but instead MJ had to send a fax to various newspapers and TV stations so that they could announce it in other words one of the most famous people on earth couldn't make an announcement directly because the technology essentially didn't exist it does make you wonder what dynamics might exist 25 years from now especially in light of efforts like Twitter's blue sky to centralized social media protocol and all the other things that I'm sure will be explored between now and then so back on topic a type of thought experiment I've always liked is imagining what it must have been like to be at certain points in history here at that point in history is typing on a keyboard attached to a computer terminal now the funny thing is when you actually walk through it it's not experiment you realize that without the benefit of hindsight the reaction might not have been that positive you might go well okay you're typing and it's showing up but I've already been able to do that with this typewriter and that's been around forever another lens that I take is thinking about moving data around and how much that's changed over the years most people in this room probably haven't even used most of the technologies on this list I know for me I had some experience with floppy disks and CD ROMs but I never interacted with a Memorex 8-inch floppy for instance another story that I like to tell is how back in 1989 my parents spent $600 to buy a 20 megabyte hard drive I've joked before that it's still way cheaper than storing the amount of data on at the but I do wonder about the parents out there who might be utilizing at the end today in spite of its limitations just as my parents did for me and something that I'm forever grateful for so another lens with which to view history is to identify places where imitation occurred as the saying goes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it gets especially interesting when it occurs in situations that otherwise don't make sense these in a way that gives you more precision into the thought process at the time than anything else my standard example of this is the history of JavaScript as some of you may know JavaScript was originally named mocha and then it was renamed to JavaScript because of Java's popularity something that it confuses people to this very day as the two languages while having some overlaps are really very very different of course javascript has long since overtaken Java as the most popular and widely used programming language in the world if there has its own interesting parallel in solidity slily was built to interface with the if you're in virtual machine and its syntax was at least partly motivated by Java scripts due to Java scripts popularity that said I think coding in sylheti is probably better thought of this akin to writing bash scripts than it is to using JavaScript you know Java scripts often in a context such as a front end context where you can get away with certain mistakes or other issues with what you're building something that is a lot less true for solidity and while we're at it there's this fun fact that you know the creator of JavaScript now works on the brave browser the brave browser was funded by an aetherium token and as I noted at the beginning of this section history might not repeat but it does seem to rot another rhyme that I enjoyed digging into is that a performance optimization so I remember when I was in school there was this discussion that someone have about how important performance optimization even was anymore there was a time it seemed like computers just kept getting faster and that any improvement in performance optimization skill would be dominated by improvements in the speed of computers as a whole of course what happened next was the smartphone revolution occurred and all of a sudden everyone had this slower computer and slower internet connection again and so of course performance engineers started matter in that context then we had block chains where performance optimization matters even more and really I think that the takeaways that will always have more use for computing power I expect to see things like homomorphic encryption computing become more popular and more common as we continue to improve those technologies and as we continue to have faster computers after all the goal was never just to be able to do computation so that leads me to the next perspective on a take which is engineering one thing that I found really interesting about the last 10 years and really the last 30 but especially in the last 10 years is how software engineering has changed I had this really fun conversation with this 20 year old who remarked about the blockchain in a theme specifically that it seemed impossible to have to write code that you couldn't change afterward I then introduced this person to the cd-rom and talked through how once upon a time in a galaxy far far away you actually the ship software on these fairly immutable devices most people didn't even have the internet and so you actually had a very similar dynamic where you pretty much had one main shot to get things right what's cool though is that software engineering companies have become increasingly safe coding environments you know coding schools become much more common people can often learn to code for three to six months and start to contribute and it's really great because it just greatly increased the accessibility of software engineering I remember one of the hardest things for me when I was working at Dropbox was that I knew that it was possible to ship a bug that killed the company you know as a file syncing program if you lose someone's files it doesn't matter if you can patch the bug afterward and we see some similar aspects with blockchain engineering it is a pretty unsafe coding environment one way I like to think about it is that you know computing I'm watching is kind of like imposing some laws of physical reality on to the virtual world and so one thing that I also like to point out is that maybe thinking of writing software and aetherium as software engineering might not be the most productive lens in some ways I think developing for a blockchain based computer is more like building hardware than software now that's not necessarily a bad thing after all we can build cars we can build bridges we can build skyscrapers we can build space shuttles the list goes on so I do believe that we can build systems that are complex and reliable on blockchain the key is that we're gonna have to take approaches that are maybe more similar to the approaches that go into building complex real world machinery and utilize different best practices the key point is also that you know people don't start building cars like by using raw metal they don't start building houses by chopping down trees there's a lot of things that we need to build up along the way in order to improve the potential of what we can put together the next perspective I like to take is the computing stack this perspective was motivated by a question that a friend asked me which was what is the most interesting technical environment you've ever worked it for me actually one of the most interesting technical problems I encountered was when I was 12 I built my own computer and I built my own computer I mean I got my parents to buy the parts that I could then assemble for a new computer so that I could have you know a shiny new computer and fulfill a school project it was really genius by me I think in a lot of ways but this experience left me with a really strong memory that hey a computer isn't a black box it's something that you can take apart it's something that you can kind of assemble and reassemble and disassemble that was a spark that never left me now it's been fascinating to me since then is how few opportunities I've had to work with a new computer even at a place like Dropbox which had pretty high technical requirements you know there was desktop web and mobile support the this requirements were high the scalability requirements were high the latency requirements for were fairly high but even there you know most of the work was confined to a fairly narrow slice of the computing stack there was never enough motivation for instance to build new programming languages operating systems or virtual machines now with programmable blockchains it's really cool to see not just motivation but probably a need to reinvent the entire computing stack for instance no one's going to use a new programming language today unless there's a new context where it's especially well-suited smartphones were the most recent example of that and you could argue that some of the machinery used for the AI is a form of that as well but overall you need to find you context in order to get to work on new parts of the stack again along similar lines there's going to be a necessary redesign of the entire developer experience one that's already happened a lot in etherium and that comes with its own opportunities to make us dent and hopefully save us from unintentional bigger dents along the way overall this is the first time in decades that so many parts of the computing stack are simultaneously accessible to be worked on in a practical context as I mentioned earlier I think it's interesting to think through points of history and what it would be like to be there I think what's exciting here is there's an element of being present for all of these things the early days of the internet early days of operating systems and even the early days of computers themselves I certainly wouldn't have guessed that building a truly new computer would make more sense today after so much development and adoption has already occurred then it actually would have when I was 12 years old you know assembling that desktop box but as exciting as all this is it still misses what I think is a significant perhaps most significant perspective on what we're all working on here so for the next perspective I'm gonna take more of a legal or a game theoretical or mechanism design perspective as a prop question like to ask what is the purpose of the legal system or any legal system for a long time I thought it was to enforce laws I mean after all that's what it's there for right eventually I realized that a bigger effect of legal systems is that they establish or attempt to establish society wide confidence that laws will be enforced this is pretty significant because Society wide confidence that laws will be enforced shifts the equilibrium for how people behave at scale and so speaking of equilibria this means that the legal system is fundamentally an example of mechanism design now people talk a lot about game theory but I don't think they talked enough about mechanism design mechanism design inverts the question of game theory instead of asking how do we play this game to maximize our aims it asks how do we design the game so that when people play to maximize their aims the result is better whatever that might mean Nakamoto consensus itself is kind of a break through application of mechanism design thinking now one of the most exam well-known examples and commonly cited examples of game theory in action is the prisoner's dilemma most of you are probably familiar with this but for those of you are the key idea is that there exist situations where individual irrational behavior results in arguably globally suboptimal outcomes it's often cited as an example of the limitations of game theory however once you put on a mechanism design hat I think it gets much more interesting in particular the prisoner's dilemma is actually solvable just not directly this is what mechanism design thinking comes into play it's true that the original game yields suboptimal behavior but we can also think how do we change the game that's being played now this isn't always going to be possible but changing the payout matrix or turning the prisoner's dilemma into an iterated game instead of a one-shot game can both lead to substantial improvements in the outcomes for players that leads to my next perspective which is a deeper dive into credible CIM it's incredible commitments are a really underappreciated element of the world they're almost like atoms in a physics like sense they're everywhere and their properties affect everything but we also don't think about them directly very often commitments of varying levels of credibility are all over the place for example given the choice between buying a TV from a brand that you recognize and an otherwise indistinguishable TV that does not come with a brand which one are you going to prefer brands are a form of credible commitment behind the quality of a product there in essence a form of proof of stake and proof of stake itself is used as a form of credible commitment in addition to its main role of civil resistance of course another form of credible commitment is just money itself we all know that paper money has basically no intrinsic use maybe you can burn it for heat or it looks cool artistically but that's about it so it's value is almost entirely tied to being a credible commitment which you know encapsulate the authority of the issuer and the difficulty of counterfeiting so one of the things that blotching is fundamentally enable is for a wider range of credible commitments to become possible for example anonymous parties can provide credible commitments using block chains traditionally this has required a mutually trusted third party even though we all don't always realize that it's there you know the legal system the government or just your run-of-the-mill company so let's consider the question that people both frequently ask and probably don't ask enough which is does this really need a blotching when people ask this question I think they're really asking whether the increased space of credible commitments that are enabled by blockchain related concepts is being utilized along those lines just as how blockchains are fundamentally credible commitment technology aetherium is fundamentally an attempt to harness and leverage the potential of credible commitments a theorem enables making credible commitments or explicit flexible easy-to-use and widely applicable this is the crux of all programming blockchains at least in my opinion and it has some really powerful implications for example we've seen how aetherium has made it possible to harness much more of the potential of zero knowledge proof based technology and applications than was previously possible on Bitcoin it's one of the clearest demonstrations of where additional flexibility and ease of use can be leveraged to a lens of credible commitments also shapes the way I think about the supposed transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 I think that a lot of web 2.0 will end up interfacing with programmable blockchains but I don't think most of it is going to be outright replaced one way I like to think about is that computers didn't enable typing because we already had typewriters computers did enable spreadsheets and accessible internet for people similarly smartphones were terrible at word processing and spreadsheets when they first came out and may arguably still are although it was even worse than some of you may remember you couldn't even copy/paste on the first iPhone but smartphones did enable new default expectations you can now default expect a lot of people to have connectivity to have camera access and location access Ben Horowitz has an interview where I think he does a really good job going deeper into this and I think you can find on the Athenian org website along those lines programmable blockchains are also going a lot better but I don't think they're gonna be better at these quote web 2.0 things that web 2.0 currently cares about because those things have already been optimized for rather parameter bar chains enable us to build with credible commitments and brand-new ways as we first saw with Bitcoin money itself can be issued by a random anonymous person in Satoshi Nakamoto this is a concept that would have been inconceivable before now speaking of Bitcoin it's worth noting that if there's increased flexibility comes with an important trade-off it also increases the surface area of risk that actually can impact the credibility of the commitments on top of aetherium after all if you're sure that a piece of code is going to run but you're not sure that it's free of bugs it might still not be that credible in your mind this nicely segues into how aetherium and Bitcoin attempt to harness credible commitments in different and complementary ways Bitcoin doubles down on its core commitments and trying to make them as credible as possible by having a narrower more mutability centric focus now that actually comes with its own trade-offs just as the potential of bugs reduces the overall credibility of a commitment the immutability of a system even in the face of changing needs or security requirements can also reduce the credibility of its commitments there is no optimal point on this spectrum just a series of trade-offs and I in the world is likely a better place with both of these approaches being taken as well as others now another one I said earlier about the prisoner's dilemma ultimately programmable bought chains aim to provide a new primitive on top of which new systems can be designed you know we might be able to use this to shift matrices turn one-shot games into iterated games overall just that with new systems comes new equilibria for behavior remember we're talking about the ability to do entirely new things it's pretty hard to predict their long-term impact in a language what's the news thing numbers were anything legal systems electricity the internet smartphones the list goes on for things that even if they look big at the time ended up being much bigger than we thought and so with that I view programming on top of the block chains as well there's a substrate for a new type of quote language one that is built around guarantees instead of promises and as some have noted there's a hope that this would transform concepts like don't be evil into can't be evil now for my next perspective I want to talk a little bit about the talent in this space one claim that I repeatedly made is that the amount of town and blockchain is going to grow a lot I was Dropbox's head of engineering hiring for a few years and I spent about as much time on the recruiting side of things as I did on other aspects of Dropbox during those years I would even make covert visits to other company offices to chat with people I was trying to poach and did a lot of tours of college campuses now there's a few concepts that I learned along the way for analyzing talent migration the first one is that top talent wants to work with other top talent especially when you get to work on challenging problems that also have an opportunity for impact the second concept is that top talent is actually rarely looking for new opportunities this is pretty this is an important concept because there's this assumption that you know the best people are always in the most important fields but that's actually not true because the best people are often in a situation where they're very happy and therefore less likely to be exploring because of this top where top talent is is often a lagging indicator and so one question that I like to ask friends is I know you're not looking for a change right now but if you were then what would you consider asking that question I found is helps you learn a lot more about what does what might become more interesting in the future than asking people simply what they're doing right now so yeah like I said top talent can be a lagging indicator not a leading indicator of what's interesting along those lines seeing one respected peer become interested in a new domain is probably worth more than a thousand days of hearing about it otherwise actually hearing about it repeatedly otherwise often as a counterproductive effect and I think just like the startup world between 2008 and say 2012 or 13 we're seeing this happen increasingly often in crypto when I saw that Dropbox back in 2008 and it started well looked nothing like it does today I often like to call it startup village because everyone actually knew each other at the time and like certain villages it definitely didn't feel modern it definitely didn't feel developed back then people thought you were crazy to start or join a startup and when I told friends at MIT that I wasn't coming back for senior year they reacted as if I was told them I was going to like Hollywood to become a movie star or something and believe me nobody at MIT has what it takes to be a movie star so by 2012 the narrative had become this begun to shift you know that's true Dropbox founder and four years later he's on the cover of Forbes part of it was that the nuclear winter that had been left by the dot-com bubble was finally flying and move forward a few more years the startup community will become the startup world at that point people would actually look at you funny of you said you would not consider ever going to a startup now I think something similar is happening in blockchain but like with many things in this space it's going to take time while also happening at warp speed before you before you know it and then what ensures that the dam is going to burst is just how interesting this space is like these aren't empty calories here you know most people do get distracted by unsavory superficial aspects of say cryptocurrency speculation but if you look at what watch-chain based computing is an interesting environment for the list goes on and on this is one of many reasons why I'm so excited about a theorems future and so that takes me to my eighth and final perspective for this talk now the word composability has gotten thrown around a lot in aetherium land lately especially in the context to decentralized finance that got me thinking what does composability look like in aetherium across all levels the first lens that I'm going to use is composability of the applications on the network or the applications on the global computer itself now it's the year 2020 and people have been talking about cross blockchain bridges for almost as long as watchings have existed great progress has been made but they're still pretty limited and decentralized finance has been a great example of the importance of being kind of within one system you know the reason how above about flash loans are a perfect example of this because it's probably going to be hard to achieve total atomicity in a crosswalk chain way and therefore and total atomicity is going to be irreplaceable in some contexts and as flash lines have showed Toa lesson is atomicity allows users to provide a type of credible commitment that is otherwise impossible it's an example where the difference between your excuse me where the difference between being a hundred percent sure about something and 99 percent sure is enormous that said I do believe most examples of the composability of applications will not require you to be on the same network all better off for that there's give me a lot more examples of that I remember even at each Boston there was work on using prediction markets to hedge against Black Swan risk and we've had things like crypto dragons that consumed crypto kitties even though they're not actually built by the same people the second lens focuses on tools infrastructure and standards every software engineer knows how valuable it is to not have to write your own programming language or on IDE your own code review tools or even most of your own libraries you gotta focus on the differentiated aspects of what you're trying to build while standing on the shoulders of others for everything else and beyond tools there's also infrastructure such as not having to sink an entire node just to tinker I'm not saying people shouldn't think nodes in general just that it's nice to not always have to do so and browser and smartphone support is another example of that education materials tutorials and functional tests nets are also a big part of it another thing that I think is underrated is standards now standards don't think it associated with bureaucracy and bloat but that's because we tend to only notice them once they make life harder we don't notice the standards that have made life much much easier in my opinion concepts like ERC 20 or C 721 continue to be underrated and they allow people from around the world to benefit from each other's work and get compounding leverage for their efforts even the simple fact that a token adhering to certain aetherium standards is massively easier for an exchange whether centralized or decentralized to integrate seems to be regularly overlooked by investors and pundits for the third lens I think things start to get really interesting once you actually have a vibrant ecosystem magical things start to happen consider them consider the following flow say that you discovered a theorem somehow and then you started to tinker with it and maybe along the way you decide to attend an eighth global event you know now at the global event you might have even built some cool stuff and met you've met some co-founders and so next up is to get some support for your new project and as you can see there's a long list of ways you can do that and once you've been building it you'll start to showcase your effort maybe it's through online groups maybe it's do more in-person events you might find other people that want to contribute and you might even hire some of them there's also stuff like get coin bounties and other things that make it so that you can get help without always they didn't make full hires and that's where maybe you come full circle and become a neat global sponsor I swear they didn't tell me to put this slide in but now you have even more builders you know contributing to your project and maybe even meeting their own future co-founders and the cycle starts again now I might not work exactly like what's described here but every single step in this flow happens and has happened surprisingly often look none of this stuff is new by itself open-source isn't new composability is it new hackathons aren't new and talent flow isn't new but the way these things are coming together in a theory and I think is quite special now for my final perspective since taking things full circle has been a bit a theme of this talk when they take us back to one of the things in the beginning I'd like to remind everyone that we should never be overconfident in our understanding and to state once again at the moment we start thinking we actually know what's going to happen is the moment that we're at the highest risk for example the expanded space of credible commitment sounds really cool the cool doesn't necessarily mean good similarly I'd like to remind the folks in this room that almost everyone interested in the theorem of watchings today crossed an intellectual chasm to get there I jokingly like to call this the acid trip epiphany that we all shared unfortunately acid trip epiphanies don't scale usefulness is what scales and so that's why I think it's really fitting to give a talk like this at a neat global hackathon so with that note I can't wait to see what happens this weekend and I can't wait to see what happens over the next five years thank you and have an awesome neat one there everyone [Applause] thank you so much Albert that was amazing I have taken so many photos of those slides that I might as well just ask Albert for the presentation I have all of them and I think that was amazing mainly for me where we've been looking at how people come into this ecosystem and their journey and how easy we make it for them to come into the ecosystem learn build and then support the people coming in to deliver the projects that you know we now use in love and hopefully the ones that are going to come after them so that was amazing and I hope you were all as inspired as I was by by the stuff that he was chatting about yes yes awesome okay so now we only have about 20 minutes and then you guys can be unleashed to hack so logistics this floor is this is where the fireside talk tomorrow is going to happen with vitalik and Joe the workshops as I mentioned are to your left you have some toilets up here but actually downstairs is where you get water refreshments food you have the chill space and more ample toilet room so just so you know that okay on a serious note again like we said thank you all for coming here and you know braving the news and so on but actually London is pretty low risk for now but saying that let's make sure we keep it that way you all would have received an email from these global guys with detailed you know precautions but the main ones are regularly wash your hands if you don't already what is wrong with you please start doing that also sanitizer is more abundant than water itself it is at every table at every corner there is more at the helpdesk literally douse yourself in it and also in your swag bag more details if you are unsure about anything if you're thinking should should I do that there's the link to see more tips and tricks official announcements this is the discord go there if you have questions if you want to chat to mentors if you can't find a team this is where you ask all of the questions and hopefully find all of the answers join the conversation as I mentioned earlier you can ask questions for tomorrow's talk but also we are going to have a lot a lot of people sharing their experience that if London I would love for you all to join our community it is on people it's a video format that you can share and on that channel as well we will have hack tips provided for you guys literally throughout the weekend by the guys that consensus Academy and the team at 1 million deaths if you have any questions again and you're not shy about showing your face please ask them there and somebody will hopefully answer them from the wider community not necessarily people who are physically here these are some things I mean we all love the internet connection at a hackathon it's our second favorite thing after not being able to plug laptops in when we present our projects on stage these are some of the things that you can do to keep us nice and connected and enable us all to have a wonderful time so definitely no 4k videos or anything like that thank you very much secure your Wi-Fi you can chat to the guys at orchid orchid wave there so protect your video and there are VPN partner going chat to them let's say safe and then full schedule on the main website if you want to check any of the talks any of the workshops when you should be back here for our closing ceremonies which will be equally as entertaining just check that and again we cannot you know let you go about in hack without mentioning all of the goodness of prices again over a hundred K of dollars there 20 plus companies and we have Taurus is 2500 British pounds we have diversify instruct we're five thousand US dollars aspect mm of a five thousand a die dap hero is one thousand died in prices people is four thousand iron prices EMS one thousand dollars and then the assyrian foundation is going to have a special e 2.0 and price which pura here is going to tell you all about here here hello our own so I'm super excited for this hackathon for because this hackathon you'll notice be able to just hack on something now we have people from the film research team from different client teams here offer for you to hack and to learn about the film to and so we have $5,000 u.s. dollars in prize money for the best 3d hacks and I will split between the best three acts and so you can find details on hack dots if to dub WTF where our firm left hackathon there's lots of interesting stuff Genesis to look into you can also do your own thing if you like just come talk to us fight us on the discards and happy hacking [Applause] awesome did everybody get that URL maybe oh there yeah so the price is literally this is where you find all of them if you missed any of them any of the amounts that wonderful URL it is all here for you to check out at your own leisure thank you so much I hope you oh yes Otacon I'm just assuming everybody is super nice and wonderful so be respectful harassment will not be tolerated let us keep the wonderful aetherium culture nice and rosy and warm and wonderful but use the sanitizer if you're looking to join a team we are starting a little mixer downstairs where I mentioned the refreshments in the food are starting in what is it now like 10 minutes so everybody in need of a team go downstairs in 10 minutes and hopefully we'll find you a wonderful team and you will create wonderful things together and let's get hacking thank you so much everyone have a wonderful weekend and I'll see you [Applause]
