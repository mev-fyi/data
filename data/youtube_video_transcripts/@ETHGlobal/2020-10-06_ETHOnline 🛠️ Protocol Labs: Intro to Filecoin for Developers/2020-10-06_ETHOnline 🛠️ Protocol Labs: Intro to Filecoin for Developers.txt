great okay i'm gonna let people in now hey everyone thank you so much for joining us uh the last workshop for today uh we have pooja from filecoin who's going to give us a a presentation on how to integrate filecoin into your hacks and without further ado i'll give the floor to you pooja awesome thank you heather um super awesome to be here i'm really excited to hear about all the great projects you're all going to be working on um i'll do a brief presentation i think we have an hour actually so maybe a little bit more than 30 minutes 30 40 minutes and would love to leave lots of time at the end for any questions that you may have um if you've already taken a look at biocoin and have questions about how to integrate it into your project um so a brief introduction to myself sorry let me move the hmm sorry it's like i can't see my cursor i'm gonna move this out of the way all right okay so this workshop is called intro to file coin for developers and um for those of you who maybe have uh are not familiar with filecoin as much or don't know me uh my name is pooja and i'm the filecoin project uh sorry product lead um so today i'm gonna cover five main segments um i'll do a brief introduction about what filecoin is um kind of the core features that it has and what that can enable for projects and some of the core ways in which people use filecoin in um for various integrations i'll then talk about the um the ecosystem of developer products that exist in filecoin give a little bit of developer um starting guidance there it's a broad ecosystem there are lots of different pathways and so um i'll just provide a few starters if you're you know if you're just getting started like how how should you start thinking about filecoin um some inspiration and examples and then i'll talk a little bit about how you can get support for your project on filecoin during this hackathon and also beyond so first what is filecoin we have lots of definitions of filecoin out there but i like this one which is basically um you know filecoin is a decentralized storage network that provides data persistence via decentralized protocol and publicly verifiable storage proofs on a blockchain there are many different components to this definition we can dive into any of them that you'd like later on but filecoin was really built to um to accomplish this mission which is to build to create a decentralized efficient and robust foundation for humanities information we really believe that the way that we've um that file coin has been built the the fundamental protocol can be this foundation to store all of the valuable data that exists in the world today um we've we're really motivated by some statistics that you know exist in the world that something like only seven percent of all data that's generated in the world today is actually saved the remaining 93 percent of it is is thrown away and we think by building a really efficient marketplace for storage and having the features of decentralization we can build a marketplace or a storage foundation that can basically save every scrap of data that is created by anyone in the world and that will be a really wonderful thing for for humanity going forward some of the core problems that filecoin seeks to address um are you know this idea that there are obviously many cloud storage providers that exist in the world but we've seen how brittle some of these solutions can be and um filecoin aims to address some of the problems that exist with centralized cloud solutions by building what is essentially a decentralized cloud um because filecoin is it is again a decentralized network users have full control over their data and so some of the problems that we've seen in the past with platforms making choices that aren't necessarily in the best interests of all of their users and that leading to app death and all sorts of other things that sort of situation can't really happen on file point and we've explicitly designed the protocol to prevent problems like that filecoin is an efficient storage market so what this basically means is that you know we try to allow both sides of the marketplace the supply side and the and the demand side to set prices that are affordable for them so that anytime anyone is entering into an economic contract on the platform they're doing so at prices that they find affordable so that means if you're using filecoin for storage there's a whole market of storage providers out there that are offering their storage services at various different prices you don't have to enter into an economic agreement with anyone that's too expensive or is in a geographic region that's you know um maybe too far away or you're you don't want to store certain types of data in other countries things like this um so we allow for greater differentiation in the storage market and then also efficient pricing so that so that people are making sure to pay first for storage that they can actually afford um there is one uh thing here as well which is that filecoin's unique construction allows for the um allows for these storage receipts essentially so anytime you store a data to the filecoin network you are provided with a receipt of the data in the form of a storage proof and this data uh this this data receipt is stamped into the file clean blockchain and that enables some really interesting use cases around verifiable storage so that you can actually you know give this receipt or this proof of storage to anyone in the world and they can independently verify that indeed your data was was stored in this particular block um on the blockchain and the last one here is optimizing okay i can't minimize the faces [Music] but anyways i think it's sorry let me just fix this um yeah so it says top to my storage and this is again just recognizing that there is a huge um there's a huge amount of storage capacity that exists in the world that is not being utilized um this is just you know think about the massive data centers that um even you know even the centralized cloud providers but also you know medium-sized data centers that exist throughout the world uh most of the time are not operating at capacity um and in addition to that just people like us you know we have on our devices gigabytes and sometimes terabytes of spare capacity that we're not using um and filecoin aims to optimize this latent storage that exists in the world and provide a market for it um so these are some graphs to kind of support this you know so we're seeing also just the rate at which the amount of data we're generating as a society is growing at insane exponential rates um i think there's some some crazy stats it's like the amount of data that we've generated in the last few years is more than we've generated as all of humanity in like the previous 200 years before that or something so you know the rate of data generation is just growing increasingly um really really quickly and the amount of storage that we have you know if there is idle storage capacity we want to be able to marry these two trends and um just create an efficient marketplace for storage so that's something that filecoin really does aim to solve um great so i wanted to touch base quickly um many of you may already be familiar with how filecoin works but at a high level we think of the filecoin network in this way um there are roughly you know two sides in the marketplace there are clients that want storage they want to store their data somewhere and there are miners which are kind of the supply side of the network and they provide this storage capacity um and you can kind of think of the filecoin network or the filecoin network protocol as the intermediary um that manages the interactions between both sides of the marketplace so the first thing that kind of happens in in the system is that when when a client decides that they want to store data on the network they will sort of send send their data and also lock up some file coin tokens in um different protocol actors and the protocol will sort of you know and the clients will have also specified which miners they want to be storing their data with the protocol will send say in this case you know the the client is saying they want to store three copies of a particular file the protocol will send these three copies to the chosen miners and over time the miners are going to be asked to repeatedly generate these cryptographic proofs to show that they are storing that same file that was originally sent to them correctly over time and we've developed over the last few years a couple of different bespoke cryptographic proofs one is called proof of replication um that's performed sort of the first time the data is is transferred to the minor and then there are these ongoing proofs that are called proofs of space time and um that's basically currently in the protocol it's every 24 hours every minor that's storing a file needs to generate this proof and submit it back to to the chain and as these proofs are submitted um the initial tokens filecoin tokens that were locked up in in the contract to be distributed to miners over time are distributed sort of like linearly um so in this way you know it's it's kind of like an escrow account um miners aren't given all of the filecoin tokens for um storing the data upfront they're sort of like paid out over time over the length of whatever whatever the deal was like that the file coin asked if if the file sorry if the client asked for the miner to be storing data for six months say um these tokens will be distributed gradually over the period of six months so the miner doesn't get all of the money up front um and it's really important you know that the clients and miners and just everyone in the system needs to be able to trust the network to actually preserve the data so there have been um you know a lot of really a lot of really interesting research um in both mostly focused on our cryptographic proofs and inner crypto econ mechanisms to make sure that the network um as a protocol is extremely trustworthy and if you're participating in this system um you know that it'll do the right thing you can generally trust that you're you're getting what you're paying for as a storage client um and miners also are you know being uh treated honestly and they're being sort of respected within the structure as well one interesting thing also to note which not everyone is immediately familiar with is maybe many folks are already aware of ipfs and one of the unique features of the ipfs network um is and the ipfs protocol is this idea of content addressing so um in in the ipfs protocol data that's stored um is not addressed by like where it's stored it's not location addressed but rather a unique content identifier sort of like a fingerprint of the data is generated every time a new file is added into the system and um that is that content identifier is what the entire system uses to to retrieve data to refer to data anywhere else and the same is true in file coin and in fact um ipfs and file coin content addressing is is the same it's the same protocol so some of the core features that are useful for developers to be aware of a file coin i've mentioned some of these before but just to summarize quickly so so one of the core features is is that as a developer you have really granular control over the various parameters of data storage that you might care about today this looks mostly like you know you you as a developer if you want to use filecoin for storage can choose where exactly you want to be storing your data so um what geographic region that the miner is in you can choose how many copies of the data you want to store um unlike in you know centralized cloud services there may be some default replication factor with filecoin you have complete control over all of these things um you can also choose how long you want the data to be stored on the network and things like this and obviously the price as well so these are some of the different parameters that you can choose today and over time we're expecting there to be a much richer market where storage providers are differentiating themselves along a number of other dimensions so for example you could imagine storage providers deciding that they want to be gdpr compliant or have hipaa compliant centers or something like this and they're being secondary markets that crop up where miners can advertise these certifications and ways in which they're differentiating themselves so that clients can then have just like a richer variety of options when it comes to storage which i think is pretty interesting um today you know we think the storage is pretty commoditized and it certainly is and file point it will be as well but over time because we're creating this really efficient marketplace we may see a lot more variety and think of storage as a as less of a commodity and more of like a differentiated product miners may also differentiate themselves on the basis of sla and things like that too so it's kind of interesting the second core feature is this idea of the storage receipts that i mentioned um and i think this is an interesting one because uh file queen sort of just bakes in this idea um of fighting misinformation almost so you know i like to think of the use case where say that you want to store a particular document on the filecoin network and when you do that content identifier sort of like stamped into the blockchain at a particular block height and if someone tries to doctor that particular document at some point in the future um you could always ask that person you know for the the cid the content identifier for for their doctored document and compare it to the hash that was sort of like stamped into the file coin block chain um at block height x and if the two don't match you can sort of you know let the person you could basically say well this is this is not legitimate what you are trying to share with me because i have proof um i have this like receipt that sort of tells me that this particular file was stored on the file going blockchain at this moment in time um and i think that opens up a number of really interesting use cases as well related to this idea of verifiable storage um i think we're familiar with this already in the context of maybe ipfs and the ethereum um ecosystem a lot of people are sort of doing similar things with ethereum uh filecoin sort of bakes this in and exposes a number of other features around it um so the third important very important thing about filecoin is i mentioned before but you know obviously as a storage user you have complete control over the prices that you are willing to pay for storage on the network the fourth is content addressing so all data is referenced by content identifiers um and this in the context of file quinn is especially useful when you're trying to prevent broken links to information so that that's not really like a concept that really applies in biocoin as long as the data is there you should be able to retrieve it no matter who has it and then the last is uh is this idea of data persistence so one of the one of the problems that filecoin was built to solve that i did not mention earlier is this idea of data persistence so you know we've had ipfs as a network for a long time as a peer-to-peer decentralized storage network but um ipfs does not have this notion of data persistence baked in and so there have been a number of second layer solutions on top of ipfs that have been built to try to counter this problem but with filecoin data persistence is is a core component of a file coin so it's like you know storage clients will enter into these storage contracts these deals and they'll specify how long they want to be storing the data and over that period of time the data is not going anywhere it will for sure you should you are guaranteed it is a core feature of the protocol that the data will be there for as long as you want it to be stored um and so i wanted to include this here as well because as a developer you may be interested in using filecoin for data storage that's by far the most common um use case that's really what filecoin is built for is as a data storage solution but there are a couple of other ways that you may choose to build around filecoin as well um so you know in the in the data storage use case really what what we've seen given the way that the network currently works um is file queen is a really is is um really suitable for this idea of kind of having like affordable and frequent and versioned backups of of the data that's being stored um and this is primarily because filecoin i mentioned backups instead of just kind of like the idea of hot storage because um because of filecoin's cryptographic proofs it's not the hottest storage layer that you could use today ipfs is a much hotter storage layer and so if you're using filecoin alone for data storage generally developers will use it as a backup layer but if you pair filecoin with ipfs or some other sort of caching solution um filecoin can kind of be considered like the primary data store and you can use ipfs or something to like retrieve the data as you need it into a hotter caching layer and and then serve it back to the user who's requesting data so anyway so there's there's kind of this um you know use case of using filecoin for data storage um another use case as well is using filecoin for payments um so you know in addition to being a storage network and a storage protocol filecoin is also a cryptocurrency and um it's the medium of exchange for file coin storage so if your application uses file coin storage um accepting filecoin for payments for either that storage or for other services that your application provides is also something that we've seen some applications do that's um that's a really good use case as well um and then the third is you know all the various like tools and services around filecoin that make it extremely um useful for other developers and other participants in the ecosystem and we've seen dozens of these over over the last few months that are just invaluable so you know it includes developer tools to make it easier for for other developers to um to build their applications um there are network analysis tools like chain explorers and um you know like chain state chain state databases that will then expose queryable apis things like that um there are also wallets and financial tools and then a lot more so um yeah those are some of the core use cases and in addition to being a decentralized storage network a payment mechanism and so on um just you know the technology of what filepoint is filecoin is also a rapidly growing ecosystem with thousands of really really talented people who are working towards this common goal um the mission that i mentioned before which is to build a robust decentralized and efficient foundation for humanities information um you know obviously filecoin builds on the incredible ipfs ecosystem which over the last several years has become kind of the storage solution of choice for for many people in in the web3 space um we're working with many many different projects with an ipvs ecosystem today that have also chosen to adopt filecoin um in addition there are over 1500 cumulative oss contributors who have contributed directly to the protocols or to various projects that have been built around the ecosystem this is sort of a diagram that we use internally to just kind of map some of the core collaborators um around filecoin so you know it's split between these applications on the network token infrastructure developer tooling collaborators that are mostly kind of on the research and protocol side many different protocol implementations and then also infrastructure so like hosted solutions that make it easy to build your app on filecoin just a brief survey of some of the really awesome programs that we've had around filecoin in the last few months um i don't know how many folks follow filecoin that closely but we're actually about to launch the network um our mainnet launch is coming up next uh it's on october 15th which i believe is next thursday um and so you know over the last few few months we've seen in just an incredible amount of activity um around the ecosystem in the lead-up in the lead-up to launch and um all of this is kind of around this uh this banner of events that we've been calling filecoin ignite and um one of the just incredible events that we um that we had was in collaboration with the eth global team which is throwing this wonderful hackathon um and that was called hackfest it's run by each global youth global and it was one month hackathon that occurred in july um there were i think something like 470 hackers that participated with more than 130 projects that were ultimately submitted across 50 countries 19 time zones there was just a huge number of events i mean really honestly kudos to the eve global team which is just like incredible at throwing these great hackathons um but yeah there were some really really awesome projects that came out of this um i think some may be participating in online as well um and if you haven't seen the showcase from hackfest there are some really really inspiring projects there that could be an interesting seed and inspiration for for your projects as well another hackathon that we recently participated in is called spark hackathon which is run by spark university um and you know just similar like in terms of it's just an incredible um event there were more than 800 participants 100 teams 40 universities participated across you know um all six continents excluding antarctica um and 30 teams specifically built projects on filecoin we've also recently run it it just ended actually this git coin apollo program which was a six week mentorship program kind of an incubator there were 130 fellows and 50 teams in the program um and this was just a really great event to kind of help projects that were have already started maybe have some traction take their projects to the next level and another really really exciting program uh called file coin launch pad um which is in partnership with consensus tachyon um is starting shortly may have actually just started um and this is an accelerator program that is for a few teams that you know receive 80 000 investment um three months of intense mentorship and and a demo day to um actually take their you know we're ready to see like real businesses being built in this ecosystem too and so there are lots of opportunities like this that have happened in the past there will certainly be more in the future um one one small example of this also is you know we have the filecoin developer grants program um which is administered by the queen foundation we're awarding um grants across many different categories of proposals but um to date have awarded something like you know six hundred thousand dollars to more than 30 teams and so we've seen some really really awesome stuff come out of that as well um this is also i think we just closed the um wave five but there we run a wave every single quarter so if you are excited by filecoin um after the end of this competit of this hackathon please definitely take a look at the developer grants program too um and then the last program i'll just quickly mention is what is uh what we're calling file queen's slingshot and um this is something i personally am spending a lot of time on uh over the last few weeks but um it's a kind of a really interesting competition structure it's a collaborative and competitive competition um it's intended for anyone in in the world who wants to store valuable data sets and build interesting applications on filecoin um so actually if you end up storing data to filecoin over the next few weeks you might end up automatically becoming a participant in the slingshot competition and that makes you eligible to earn filecoin rewards so the general idea is that the entire participant pool um will com will work together to unlock progressively larger prizes um the largest prize pool is five hundred thousand file coin for um if we you know collectively unlock 10 petabytes of data that are being stored to the network and um and then you know participants will like divide the will be awarded the um those funds kind of proportionately according to how much data they've stored onto the network and so to date we've seen um 200 plus teams on the network there's almost a 100 tubby bytes that have been stored and 140 000 storage deals made so we're about we're running this competition a few different phases we're about 10 of the way to having a petabyte stored on the network so um really really exciting progress and definitely if you are interested in participating please take a look at the website slingshot.filecoin.io and it's not too late to register so you can definitely do that um even today and there will be as i mentioned you know just always more to come we're we're really really excited about this ecosystem and there are going to be so many awesome programs that that come in the future um okay so i'm realizing i'm a bit behind time so i'm going to try to speed through this section um i wanted to give a brief overview of the types of developer products that exist for devs who want to use filecoin there are five main categories of developer products there are the core protocol implementations developer tools that are kind of layers of abstraction on top of the core implementations various different networks a few different hosted services and then this blanket category of sort of other useful tools which are use good for you to be aware of so starting with the core protocol implementations there are currently four vertical implementations of file coin in progress one is the primary reference implementation is called lotus if you've tried to use filecoin before this is probably what you've what you've used um it's written in go there's also another go implementation called gofilecoin which is is maintained by a community team called ipfs force the forest implementation is written in rust and is maintained by chainsafe and fujon uh is our c plus plus implementation and um it's maintained by the soromitsu team so all of these core protocol implementations they basically implement the filecoin spec which can be found at spec.filecoin.io um and lotus in particular so this link is a bit outdated but we have on the filecoin documentation site which is docs.filecoin.io a huge number of docs that explains you know how to download and setup and configure lotus if you're building on top of lotus we have a build section that will tell you kind of how to get started with that so would really recommend that folks take a look at the filecoin docs if you want to start using the core protocol implementations um and lotus actually comes with two main api clients um so there's kind of the the core json rpc api this is if you want to talk directly to a node and lotus itself has a couple of different processes there's kind of like the core node there's also a mining process and the the mining the mining software can also spawn other processes that are related to it and um the core communication between all these components uses uh just it's like an rpc implementation and so lotus exposes this json rpc api to developers as well um that's how a lot of if you're looking to integrate with lotus at a very low level we would probably recommend you use that api um but there are also other api clients for lotus as well um the more the most flushed out one that's uh is is basically a javascript api client um but there are a couple of others as well i believe there's one in ruby and i'll send uh i can definitely share links to all these resources with the youth global team afterwards so we can make sure that you can find all the resources easily and i just wanted to surface you know kind of one common architecture that we've seen when developers are using lotus for their applications um is it's kind of just it's informed by the lotus as a node even even if what you're primarily trying to do today is syncing the chain and sort of making storage deals managing a wallet things like that um lotus is not extremely optimized to be like there's no there's no concept of light client you know we're pre-made net launch and so all these things will come but today um running lotus and staying in sync with the chain requires a pretty hefty machine so the recommendation that we've been giving to developers is make sure you have at least 32 gigs of ram an 8 core cpu and then 200 plus gigabytes of um of ssd drive so that's you know not accessible to everyone but um if you are interested in you using lotus directly um we'd recommend you know having one node that you're sort of hosting yourself and then every new user of your application um for each for each new user you could do something like creating a new file pin address for for each user and your application front end could communicate with that node via one of the various api libraries um there are also other libraries like remote signing tools and so on so that you could allow your users to kind of have um control over their address and send funds from their address if they wanted to or whatever without having to have each of them use a lotus to run a lotus node themselves um when we look at developer tools so given what i just mentioned you know um if you want like the bare metal this is real file coin i want to like try all the cli commands myself i want to really understand how filecoin works um i would recommend you take a look at the core protocol implementations um but that's you know in a lot of cases actually not the most it's maybe not the best pathway um if you're really looking to just build a really really great dap and so there are a number of developer tools that i think are really useful to consider if you're looking to build an application on filecoin um probably the most uh the most popular and kind of most widely used developer tool right now is a tool called power power gate um and it's built by the textile team um textile team is really really awesome i don't know if they're doing any workshops here but they have done a number of workshops for for some of the other global competitions and hackathons um but powergate basically i think there may be yeah here um so powergate is a uh it's its own daemon but um also includes an ipfs node or it's configured to work with an ipfs node and a lotus node um so the main idea behind powergate is you sort of have this like one interface to both the ipfs and filecoin networks and this one interface is intending to be it's intended to abstract away a lot of the complexity of interacting with either network um so when you want to store data to file coin or to ipfs you don't have to specify anything like different um to work with both networks you just say you know store this cid three times this is how much i want to pay for it and then kind of powergate will take care of the rest um there are a couple of different ways in which you can use powergates you can either run one yourself but then that kind of is subject to the same resource considerations that i mentioned before it does involve running a full ipfs and a full lotus node and so you'd end up you know having to have kind of that beefy machine in order to stay in sync with the filecoin chain um but there are also hosted options as well so i'll talk about that in a little bit but um by far we've seen this be like just an incredibly valuable tool and the main reason is because um you know you kind of get the benefits of both ipfs and the filecoin network through through one interface um instead of having to deal with like the colder storage and backups just on lotus and then kind of the high high availability that you would get and faster retrieval that you would get from ipfs powergate allows you to have both of those benefits from the various different protocols um in in one interface um so powergate is a really awesome solution i would recommend it to to most developers um there are a couple of other really useful tools too so the truffle team which has done just amazing work within the ethereum ecosystem is also building a number of tools for ipfs and filecoin so um truffle now has a tool that they call truffle preserve which is basically you know a simple cli tool that allows you to directly preserve an ipfs sorry um a cid to an ipfs node it pins um your your cid that your your data to like an ipfs node to have it be persistent but it can also preserve that same data to filecoin via filecoin storage deals and again it's really nice because it sort of abstracts away some of the complexity of dealing with filecoin um and then the other really really exciting thing that i'm excited i'm looking forward to seeing in a few months is um a ganache integration for filecoin um which is basically if you're familiar with ganache for ethereum it's the same concept for filecoin so um it'll just basically be a local filecoin simulator that will allow developers to um just in a completely local environment just develop their applications see how it would kind of work with with filecoin features and do so at smaller scale before deploying to live networks one other really useful developer tool which is more recent is called space daemon and this is built by the fleek team fleek for the last several years has been a really big part of the ipfs ecosystem um most many people today will use fleet to deploy their websites to ipfs and um and we've actually done that as well you know with the filecoin website um but freak is now the fleet team is now producing a new product called space and the space station unites um ipfs and filecoin um a couple of different decentralized identity solutions and textile apis all into one daemon um and the idea is that you know you as adapt developer can use the space statement and get access to the benefits of all of these different systems um united in this one api or one interface and then essentially use that however you'd like in your different applications um and it really space david really wants to be a complete solution for adapt developers um so if it's early days for this project it's really really exciting but if there are features or protocols that you'd like them to integrate that you don't see here um already i'm sure you could reach out to the team and and they definitely take a good look at it um because it's early days still but has already proven to be really really useful okay so touching quickly on the various networks so you know obviously filecoin is a network um and so what are the which networks exist how do you use them and so on so um first in many cases before before you want to deploy your application to a live network you probably want to test it locally um and so there are a couple of different solutions that we have to run your application locally and kind of simulate operation on a live network without having to use a live network one is called um lotus.net or localnet which is also built by the textile team and um this basically allows you to use almost all of like the final features the only thing it does is just sort of mocks out some of the time-consuming storage proofs that i mentioned before um so it sort of fakes the proofs and that allows like all of the other functions on the falcon network to run super quickly so that's one really awesome um local devnet solution another one is um maintained by the lotus team and it allows you to just within your lotus node go through the full set of file coin functions but again just locally it doesn't fake out the storage proof so you can really get kind of a good sense of how long each of these steps will take as you're interacting with filecoin um in addition to the local networks there are a bunch of developer networks that we maintain as well um you can see the latest status of of the different networks at network.filecoin.io and today there are three main networks um one is called testnet and so this is essentially um the the closest to mainnet conditions uh type of network that we have um and if you want to do real scale testing of your application we would recommend that you test it against testnet there are also a couple of other networks too called butterfly net and nerf net which have different parameters respectively and all of that is kind of detailed on this network's website and then lastly um the super exciting thing is we're launching mainnet next week um so you know starting very very shortly um there will be a a real live network with real live money um that you can use once you're ready to like deploy your your applications in sort of a production environment i suppose so the timing works out really well i think for this hackathon um and if you happen to be building on filecoin um you should definitely join us for a series of events that we're going to be hosting um the week after the midnight launch it's called filecoin liftoff week it's october 19th through the 23rd and there will be definitely be some really awesome workshops um for filecoin developers too okay hosted services so i mentioned before you know powergate is this product that essentially will allow you to use to have one interface to interact with both the ipfs and filecoin networks um we kind of refer to the to a class of services that does this but like in a hosted way we call those file queen backed ipfs pinning services it's kind of a mouthful so we shorten it to fps which is also not an amazing acronym but it is but it is um and so the benefit of these fps solutions is that you get this the same benefits as kind of like a powergate style solution except you don't have to actually manage your own nodes um and they'll uh you know have other really nice things like these fps solutions are really really geared towards making sure that the developer experience is as friendly as possible um so they will you know have the nice performance of offering sub-second retrieval but they'll also have really nice apis with um just like friendly concepts like standard auth tokens and things like that that you can use to interact with ipfs and file coin storage um there are a couple of different fps solutions that exist today the textile folks are they have a solution called textile hub which has a storage product called buckets which is essentially an fps the pinata team if you're familiar with them from the ipfs ecosystem they run a really popular ipfs pinning service and they're currently integrating file coin support as well and then train safe is another team that's also building a file coin backed ipa fascinating service um and so and then in addition to that you know there are also these hosted powergate solutions that are currently mainly provided by the textile team um there may be other providers of use in the future as well but again it's all the benefits of powergate without having to host your own nodes and you get full control over the powergate instance um these have been really popular in prior hackathons uh i think in the last in hackathes we saw something like 20 plus teams using hosted powergate instances um and so this is this is just a really great way i think to i recommend powergate to most folks and i think if you are not interested in maintaining your own nodes at this time i would recommend hosted powergates um okay so lots of stuff lots of information and just one more thing for you to be aware of is that there are lots of other tools um so those are kind of i talked about four main categories of things that i think all filecoin devs or you know people integrating filecoin should know about but depending on your use case you might actually be interested in a number of other libraries and tools so we have this this link is that's listed on this slide um includes some of these resources and includes things like docker images and hosted lotus endpoints block explorers chain databases and other sort of network status and analysis tools all the different api clients that exist the various cli and gui products that exist as well all the different wallets and wallet integrations um remote signing libraries and a lot more so um if this didn't answer your questions i would recommend looking at this list because i'm sure there's something somewhere in the falcon ecosystem that will make your life a lot easier if you're looking to integrate filecoin um so starting guidance um i think i'll probably skip this one but just you know high level thing is um for those who are just starting out i would not recommend going straight to using a lotus node um it's kind of hard to as i mentioned requires sort of a beefy machine in order to to run and stay um stay in in sync with the rest of the network um so if you're just getting started and just looking to experiment experiment with filecoin i'd probably look to a solution like powergate um either a hosted powergate if you don't want to run your your own nodes or um just you know local powergate if you're okay with that or the textile hub or any other fps solutions i think these are the easiest ways to get started you get all the benefits of using filecoin as a decentralized storage network in your application and uh you don't have to deal with a lot of the complexity and there and these solutions have some really great apis as well that are very nice so i would recommend most developers get started by looking at these so um some uh really quick inspiration and examples of cool things that we've seen in the ecosystem recently um so i mentioned some of the the various programs that have been run over the last few months in that same time we've been working really closely with more than 80 organizations that are like close collaborators um who are building really interesting either applications of file coin or important pieces of tooling around coin as well so just to highlight some of these um this is again this the same ecosystem diagram if we take a look at some of the um interesting applications and use cases that we've seen the the fleek team which i mentioned is building the space stamen is also building this really cool gui product that they're calling um the space app and this the idea behind this is that they basically want to build a fully decentralized dropbox solution so it has like all the really nice ux that we've come to expect from some of these types of products but it's built on like you know fully decentralized stack including decentralized identity ipfs and filecoin um cares a lot about preserving privacy for users and so on so this is a really exciting app and i've used it it's really really awesome um there's also we recently announced this was recently announced i think was last week um filecoin is getting closer to d5 um so d5 plus filecoin equals d phil um there are a couple of new of new products kind of in in this space um one is it's um still finding a name for it but we're working with the codabyte team um to provide a solution for collateralized loans for filecoin and also a minor marketplace so that storage clients are able to find minors that meet their requirements um a lot more easily and have richer sources of information like some of the certifications that i mentioned you can see if you know a minor it has a gdpr certification or something like this um there's uh there are a number of different projects that are using filecoin for video storage and um one in particular this this project called vodify um is using powergate actually as their as their storage solution storage solution and it's got a really simple interface anyone can um upload you know a video and it will make it onto the ipfs and five networks and uses life here as well for some interesting like transcoding processes the um ob1 haven product is actually using filecoin as a payment mechanism so that's kind of interesting i think they've open sourced a bunch of that implementation so if you're interested in using filecoin for payments that would be a good one to take a look at filecoin discover is a project that that we started a few months ago and the aim with this project was to store as many extremely valuable and like important cultural and scientific data sets on file coins so um we've been working with a number of groups over over the last several months um to to get these like massive massive data sets i think it's you know several petabytes worth of data onto the filecoin network um there's also a project called slate um which we've been developing over the past few months as well and slate is just this really beautiful gui um it's hosted that you can use to store beta to function and on top of that you can um build these really cool slates which are kind of like public um public boards that you can use to to organize some of your photos it could be like a personal photo album it could be just like a mood board of some sort um and you could organize all sorts of documents like pdfs and images and videos and share it with uh with anyone in the world and again this this project is also using filecoin for storage um some of the developer tooling that's being built by close collaborators we've already talked about powergate and truffle um there's also uh this recent collaboration to um with the uh with polkadot with the polkadot team essentially um and we're working to create a unified api between these two projects so look for that coming soon um and also this uh a recent um announcement from the ethereum classic labs team to add support open rpc support for file queen lotus um and there's also proto school which is just you know protocol has been in the protocol labs ecosystem for a really long time has had a lot of really great tutorials about ipfs and ipld and now also has these really really wonderful tutorials on filecoin um so that's just proto.school and their number of courses that help clarify tricky filecoin concepts like verified storage and ncids and other things and then really quickly through token infrastructure so as of today we do have uh file point support on ledger um there are there are also self-hosted web while solutions like glyph metamask support is in the works and should be available very soon same with trust wallet and we've also been working with a number of custody partners and um gemini anchorage and others have announced that they will be supporting filecoin at launch um and then i wanted to kind of like close this section with just a quick question you know what what are you looking to build and you may already have um lots of ideas around this but in case you're looking for some inspiration um for hackaths we created this list of kind of i don't think it's actually 100 but many dozens of hackathon ideas um there's also for the slingshot competition a number of really awesome data sets that we'd love to see stored to the filecoin network some ideas of you know generally file coin is great for it's it's kind of the perfect ideal solution for storing like uh user data for web3 applications um data marketplaces are an interesting application we'd love to see as well using filecoin for this for its feature of like data authenticity fighting misinformation using filecoin for verified storage um building smart contracts over very large data sets using filecoin for video publishing and distribution um yeah this is you know we love games and just really really cool assets um and so storing virtual world data on filecoin as well um and actually using filecoin as a game distribution platform or even just for for actually just storing games on the network distributing packages and containers as well and so during this during this hackathon there are a bunch of different resources that you can use to get support from from the final coin team and just learn more about how to perform your integration um in addition to the discord channels that you have for for this hackathon um the file queen community also has a really active file coin slack workspace it's successful at filecoin.io slack that's how you can sign up for an account um we spent a lot of time here so if you're not getting a response for us anywhere else this is this is where you can definitely find like all of the members of the team um there's the filecoin spec which i mentioned before if you're looking for a good technical detail into filecoin the filemaking documentation site um filecoin proto school tutorials and um and then again you know over the last few months we've had some really really awesome events that have generated just really good resources for developers um so one of these was the ipfs pitting summit which happened earlier this year and there are some really great talks on filecoin as well um we have a number of filecoin master classes that cover various topics that are interesting or useful for developers including introductions to powergate and other textile technologies from hackfest there were a number of just really really awesome workshops including several that were focused on file coin um these are some of the hackifest workshops that were relevant to file queen um and then as part of the slingshot competition as well which is ongoing there are some really awesome events and workshops here too that i think would be great for folks to take a look at and that's it this was me talking for a very very long time i will stop sharing and um if any folks have questions you have about 10 minutes so happy to chat about anything hey puja thank you so much um i see we have some questions here in the chat from light client how will filecoin hosted sites be able to compete with aws cloudfare etc if i'm building a consumer product i want very low latency and so i'll distribute my data to cdns around the world is this possible how do i know that filecoin nodes hosting my data have the latency and bandwidth to provide my users with high quality service yeah so this is a great question um so basically today as i i may be skimmed over it but um today the performance of file coin on its own is is it's better for kind of like a backup solution um we don't generally uh recommend that it's used as like the primary solution um unless what you're trying to do is like backing up or archiving data for long-term storage um and that's again just because of the cryptographic proofs that we've had to use in order to have high security in the protocol that's the reason it's like that so in most cases if you're trying to use filecoin for hosting a site or a website or something we'd probably recommend that you use filecoin in conjunction with ipfs through one of these products like powergate or textile buckets or something like that and and then in that case you can sort of expect the same type of performance that you would see if you were just using um ipfs alone i'm not sure if that helps yeah yeah it's just a direction a file coin is like interested in going because i know that a lot of people have been excited about ipfs for a long time that they can you know deploy a website in this like decentralized manner um but you know just like you said ipfs and filecoin on their own without these you know layers on top of it that provide those sort of cdn services um it's not going to provide the same sort of a service that consumers are used to today but is this something that filecoin in the future wants to integrate more back into it's like like uh l1 protocol or something that will always be services on top no one like 100 yeah i'm glad you brought that up um yeah that's definitely uh so it's always been the intention for there to be today we focused a lot on sort of the storage market component of filecoin um but it's the intention has always been for there to be a retrieval market as well um and you can think of that as kind of this the intended cdn layer because um we're where we may see like the storage market the miners on the store the storage miners basically um you know they are in many cases like data centers or um like just large yeah i mean it's most a lot of it is data centers um less like individuals but they may be locating their centers in places that are like in more rural locations or areas where it's like a little bit cheaper to operate large data centers but the idea behind the retrieval market is that you can imagine literally anyone in the world and especially like people in cities who may decide that they want to like run a retrieval client program like in the background of their computers um they're sort of caching frequently requested data off the network and then serving it to other people who are requesting it from filecoin um and so if you imagine that like it's it's almost like anyone could be an edge um distributor of of content and uh and that's definitely the direction that filecoin is planning to go in very very shortly um it's not very robust for mainnet but there are some kind of mvp solutions for what that retrieval layer could look like um that exists today but yeah but it's not super fleshed out right now but i think within a few months we should see it start to have really really good cdn like capabilities as well cool thank you yeah we've got one from stephan stephan if you want to just jump in and unmute yourself you can go ahead and ask pooja your question yes absolutely it's a little bit late here in germany but i'll do um so there are some colleagues of mine who are currently running um the customer ipfs cluster and i'm always telling them people you know you know what these ficon people are running mainnet in within a week or something would you recommend if you uh if if you are about to to run a productive application um would would you recommend to to go all in filecoin now or would you still go the ipfs cluster way and pin things locally good question yeah um so i think today again depends on the use case but i think realistically if you're looking for um like fast retrieval of data uh file queen alone is not going to be a good solution for that um one important thing to note is that i've been talking about like our cryptographic proofs as being like the reason for the performance that we're seeing today um we have basically completely implemented like a new type of proof of replication um which we're going to be upgrading to at some point in the next few months and that should basically make the um like retrieval performance for filecoin comparable to ipfs so it's something that we're like definitely working towards i know that it's an important thing for filecoin to have fast retrieval um as an option but today it does not so you know if you're i think that's why just knowing that this is coming like down the road on filecoin i think these like hybrid solutions that use ipfs and filecoin today are really really great um because then it allows you to already have done the work to like understand filecoin um start storing your data to that network and then once like the faster retrieval becomes available on filecoin um you can start to use that feature from the network too um and it never hurts to like also have um have it sort of like redundantly stored in ipfs but once the retrieval capabilities are there maybe you could start to like pin less data to your own cluster or things like that so that maybe saves on some of the storage costs there um but yeah so i think probably today i would say if you just want to use one probably still stay with ipfs cluster if you are open to like skating a little bit to where the puck is going maybe starting to invest in some of these like hybrid solutions would be the way to go pretty much my idea thank you yeah uh i see a question from leandro andrew we do have the youtube video streaming now and it will be posted later if that's your question great awesome i had another quick question go for it okay um i was curious like what sort of guarantees do we have for saving information onto filecoin like do i know i'm going to be able to get this data back if i if i can't get it back at some point in the future what happens to the person who's supposed to be holding that data yeah for sure um yeah so this is like a core core thing in file coin is just like how do you how do you actually trust this thing um it's a really hard question we've invested a lot of time uh years honestly in solving it um and so there's basically if if someone if you're like storing your data with someone and um at some point it just you you can't get it back um then either you directly can trigger like slashing that that minor or the network will do it like when it's kind of automatically going through its repeated challenges to get proofs of space time back from the miners so if the miner cannot cannot like produce the proof of space time when they're being challenged um they will uh their sector like their storage will be considered enough in a faulted state and if that state persists like for some period of time then if essentially that sector gets terminated the the protocol recognizes that they're maybe not behaving honestly because sometimes like that you know the outage will happen it's just an operational failure it's not really like the person behaving maliciously um and so after some period of time uh the that storage will be considered terminated and the person will lose like all of their um that they have to put collateral up in order to be able to accept storage deals on the network and they'll lose all of that collateral and it's it's a huge huge um financial loss and so there's some like really strong economic incentives for them to like keep the data online um right but yeah but but if you if you like try to retrieve something and you can't get it back you can you can like slash the miner basically um and then there's also like deal collateral as well that you would you would get as a compensation for that i see uh so have you guys like also thought about what some sort of like worldwide um catastrophe would mean for filecoin because i think this is something that's really interesting about east 2 and like we saw on the badasha testnet about how there was this catastrophic error with the time servers for the prism knows and the network was able to come back to a stable status then a handful of days for file coin like what would that mean if you know one continent was knocked offline yeah it's a really good question um i don't personally know i i i know we have definitely thought about those sorts of scenarios um i'm not sure the extent to which i think if you know like i mean so so as long as there are like nodes on the network that are like able to maintain consensus with each other even if it's a very small number of nodes and if everyone else is offline um or because there's like some catastrophic event the chain would be able to progress and the network would still live but it wouldn't really be able to do anything useful if you know if all of like the people who are providing storage um are just like you know something happens and they're no longer online um so in a case like that there would be like severe financial loss for the people who kind of go offline um after some period of time like i was just saying um but then the network would sort of just like continue but yeah if every single node was wiped out i think it would probably have bigger problems yeah yep cool um unless there's any more questions oh we had one from youtube which i meant to ask earlier apologies um the question was if my website is hosted on ipfs why would i choose fileclaim in case i need a database adding they add i can't use ipfs to store the data the data [Laughter] is already hosted to ipfs then really what filecoin would provide additionally is just like having this this like backup that's on a truly decentralized network um in most cases when you're like you know using ipfs if you uh are not maintaining like a cluster of nodes yourself like we were just talking about or something um you're probably maybe using like a centralized pinning service and most of those are like hosted in a in a cloud provider like aws um and so really like filecoin is just a way uh today to like do these um it's a fundamentally decentralized network and so if you wanted to like back up your storage to a decentralized network that would be the benefit of that um and you may get it for free actually like a number of a number of like popular ipfs hosting solutions as well like fleek and others are also like integrating filecoin for for um just storage to like snapshot um websites to filecoin and preserve them there um so if you're using one of those providers like that you may just kind of get that for free at some point in the near future very cool thank you so much puja this has been great thank you really exciting stuff and congrats on the launch on the upcoming launch very exciting thank you yes um wish us luck it'll be definitely exciting it's gonna be great it's gonna write your life yeah awesome thanks so much everyone and if you have questions um yeah definitely feel free to i'm on the discord um is that is that the right place heather for supporting that's the best place uh and failing that your uh slack which you mentioned earlier perfect awesome cool thanks thanks thanks pedro thanks
