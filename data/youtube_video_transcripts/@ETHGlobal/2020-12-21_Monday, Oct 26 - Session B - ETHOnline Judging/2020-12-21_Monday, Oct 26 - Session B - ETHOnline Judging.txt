so welcome everybody to east online judging day two no this is day three when i'm getting confused day three of judging we've had an amazing month of hacking and learning and if you hadn't seen the stats we had over 700 hackers a thousand applications 65 countries 19 time zones huge event and definitely with a global population of hackers which is amazing to see like i said 175 projects they've worked together for three weeks and ended up submitting some pretty wide-ranging uh projects everything from e5 to personal tokens and everything in between um today we're going to [Music] get the chance to actually see what people have built so the format for today uh as you are all probably aware but just a quick reminder four minutes for video demo from each team four minutes for questions from the judges or clarifications and then we'll do a 10 minute break halfway just to give you a chance to stretch your legs or you know a glass of water whatever you need to do um another reminder for the criteria for what judges are actually looking into these would be technicality originality practicality meaning um you know how how accessible it is for this project to actually be implemented and then the ui how people use it and then the final thing is the wow factor which is the wild card um we want to emphasize that it's not a competition a lot of people this might be their first event so they're just dipping their toes into ethereum and web3 and they're here to learn uh not every project is necessarily becoming a business so we just want to keep that in mind and we're we're very happy to have projects that are you know trying to pursue this after the event but people that are here just to learn is totally fine as well and the big thing is that hackers are here to get feedback from our wonderful judges speaking of we have three uh excellent community members with us today um peter pan from 1kx linda g from scalar capital and fernando martinelli from balancer so welcome judges hope you're ready for this session and let's move on to the first demo i think the first team is already promoted that would be james and i'll let you take it away all right thanks okay introducing flavor a spicy new twist on defy savings the goal of flavor is to provide the stability of dollar pegged stable coins savings from your tokens earning a yield while they sit in your wallet and a fun twist to make things a little more interesting by combining stability savings and a fun twist flavor provides a simple low-risk way to bet on your favorite assets it does this with a daily contest based on tracking changes in cryptocurrency prices the winning asset each day is the one with the largest price percentage increase flavor uses pool together's no loss design where only interest earned from deposited funds is used as prize rewards and not the deposited funds themselves flavor replaces pool together's randomly chosen raffle with a contest decided by chain link price feed data for supported cryptocurrency assets using flavor is simple first exchange usdc tokens for equal amounts of flavor tokens from the flavor finance website first unlock your wallet then select one of the supported cryptocurrency assets and a completed deposit of usdc in exchange for an equal number of flavor tokens when you win a daily flavor contest the balance of flavor tokens in your wallet automatically increase the increase will be the interest earned by all flavor usdc deposits in the last day split proportionally among you and the other participants who bet on the winning cryptocurrency and finally flavor tokens can always be exchanged back for an equal amount of usdc withdrawing usdc is as easy as depositing usdc flavor tokens are always fully collateralized and this means that one flavor token should always be worth about one usdc some next steps for flavor include listing more crypto assets as well as non-crypto crypto assets to bet on anything with a price fee provided by oracle can be supported and this means it should be possible for bitcoin and d5 tokens to compete against tesla and apple shares or any other type of asset other next steps include optimizing for decentralized exchanges like uniswap and balancer so that it's easy to trade up any defy asset directly into flavor tokens instead of usdc without worrying about slippage we'll make use of arbitrage bots to help maintain flavor's price peg and flavor token liquidity mining will be used to farm flavor's governance token to encourage liquidity this governance token will play a key role in converting flavor into a decentralized protocol owned and operated by its community you can now check out flavor at flavor.finance all right um i realized that um i think the meta cartel which peter's involved with i think the chili pepper might be one of your icons didn't realize that connection copyright infringement i'm just going off of the knowledge of like adding some spices this is like you know a really great platform to like you know experiment with different other sources if you will right i mean you could use the uh interest for like you know allowing people to basically you know bet on state production markets maybe you know no loss betting no you know like this is one example where like you could kind of um save up a whole month's worth of interest rate and allow people to kind of allocate it uh based on that and this is just one example right so i generally really like the idea and i think this could be a really great platform for a lot of creativity to kind of emerge from yeah um absolutely that's that's certainly the idea um and i i sort of think of it as sort of a mash-up between pool together like auger uh or poly market and something like origin or usd where the it's a stable coin that increases balance in your wallet yeah i think this is really cool um and something that i would actually play with it sounds really fun um so are the payouts daily sorry if i missed that yeah payouts are daily although uh subject to change because of gas fees and so forth yeah i was gonna say probably don't want daily payouts at this stage and then also like i don't know if the amounts are gonna be large enough for people to get like super excited so like maybe some version of accruing it later or something yeah absolutely so i think we're going to want to look at the tvl and um the number of crypto assets that we have right now it's only three it's basically bitcoin uh ether and d5 like a d5 index and so the number of assets that we have and also the the rate of payout is going to probably be a factor of how much how much volume there is in what ways do you see yourselves using amms like bouncer and unit swap and others for the system yeah so i sort of touched on that in the video but i think the idea is that people can go to flavor.finance and get flavor tokens there directly but i think for a lot of people once they know that these flavor tokens exist they're selling some other token they go to balancer and they say i want to exchange you know my whatever other token directly to flavor tokens so flavor tokens just becomes like a wrapper for a stable coin so it's it's you know earns shavings automatically and it's kind of has a fun element to it another question you said that each flavor should be worth about one usdc because it's always collateralized why why is it about uh well at least or exactly or at least yeah so about because it it it might not it's difficult to maintain that exact peg on you know balancer for example but it should be very close to it thank you thank you all right any any final questions sounds like judges are satisfied uh thank you james for presenting and i look forward to seeing what emoji you end up transitioning to okay well we'll i'll i'll be in touch with peter about the copyright case sure okay all right so next up is the zenbit protocol and i'll let the next team take it away we aren't able to hear so maybe try it again without muting first and then you can mute after if you'd like sorry i had my audio hi this is the same protocol we are presenting from the for the eat online 2020 hackathon we are um i'm a bakbera and i work on the front end and the main concept uh my name is mario i work with the solidity contract with my contract and with the machine and we what we built we built a protocol prototype that utilized the italian skills as left rewards to lose financial inclusion in mexican jungle zones so why rebuild it because in mexico 68 of mexicans don't have a bank account and plus eighty percent of people living in urban areas with internet access are excluded from digital economy because a lack of digital skills so these are the main barriers for people to enter a digital economy we pretend to reduce this this gap by teaching ethereum interactions with our mvp for speaking spanish-spoken users where users receive digital skills and nfps and fungible tokens as rewards and the gain details nfps are required to access the following tasks so the live demo once a user has has been logged in in the application he has to watch this video of course there's a lot of work needed in the landing page in order to to make it more user friendly because now at the moment we are only trying to demonstrate this basically sorry so once the user has has watched every single video he has to do these tasks in order to become familiarized with the with the functions he can do in a small contract so first in order to complete this task and to win a certificate a digital skill certificate looks like monetary reward he has to base uh his public key the one filterized and click here in the button which says get certificates after watching this demo we will explain how it's made this is an mvp for a proof of concept that we can digitize the detailed skills of our users with three tasks for developing these digital skills we have used an rc 11 55 contract to create the the the nfts and the fungible tokens which are minted after the users are complete the task so in the backend a javascript is a javascript which we have metamask integrations so what uh you can find the live demo on on our site sending.city and well our roadblock from from now is to well it's uh it's necessary to have a front end and user experience overhauling in order to have a more friendly interaction and further we want to add tasks for defy and government digital skills and of this as well as an rc20 for an smb for governance interactions and test with the real world interactions and assets in urban environments and once we get to this point uh probably it's it's time to go made to mainnet and start to detail its value on cities and thank you for your attention you can find the that the documentation of the project in sending dot city on our uh social media are at same bit mx so visit us and know more about this project thank you for your attention um i like that you're focusing on mexican urban zones that's an area that i don't feel like a lot of people have been spending a lot of time building so i'm really excited to see that and then i'm curious as to like what do the nfts like actually look like and then also you mentioned znbt um and like what is that used for so trying to understand like what people get from this so uh we want to take advantage of the 11 55 contract capabilities to make a batch of a non-valuable token and a fungible token so the certificate it's a non-fungible token that gives the user that digital skill that they can use a product or an interaction like in the example it's like use their the public keys so in the other part in mexico it's the lack of access to bank accounts make an interesting thing to to keep a fungible reward in order to start to interact with digital assets and get uh more familiarized with the environment and how interactors interactions are with metamask are and all the things users need to know first [Music] to interact with uh more complex protocols cool thanks have you thought much about how you would onboard users into like i guess in terms of key management um because you mentioned just then but like have you thought about you know integrating things such as like burner wallets that allow you to kind of like hold these like nfcs temporarily before someone says well it's supposed to be uh permanently uh some basic interactions i think uh they the user must the first the first time is the the most difficult time that to interact with these things but uh other that require detailed skills that get updated uh get updated like uh like coding or or other implementation probably the the nfd will require to to get an expiration date or a validation date until the user get updated on that on that part and then again start uh to use the service in order to avoid uh mistakes and i don't know lots of capital that the users actually don't want and the ignorance to to know how it works probably the main the main case for for most users great idea though love it quick question like do you do you see what ways do you see those nfts being valuable and useful like ideas for the future well i think in mexico the the lack of knowledge to on digital skills could give a reference to users how they can evolve to interact like uh i don't know compound a compounding interest products like balancer or all other complex more complex user [Music] interactions but my experience with people it's like they they lack a lot of digital skills they they the barrier the first barrier it's it's it's uh i mean it's difficult to people understand what they are doing and i think uh this part could be uh uh a great uh uh uh a great moment to implement because well uh my country is on the verge like the cases on argent like in argentina or venezuela and i think like preventing these scenarios and have education that can actually get a user access to other services or more complex services i think it could be a good point to start thank you i think that's a great summary uh right where we can end it thank you for presenting all right all right next up is llama dot community you may not have shared your sound do you want to try that again okay i built llama dot community which is a tool to manage your crypto community treasury i help manage the treasury for a crypto community that i'm involved with and i've found the tragedy management and budget tracking process pretty cumbersome the first step it involves is the community proposing things and voting on those proposals on snapshot when a proposal gets passed then the treasurer and the signers of the multisig wallet then execute on those proposals and finally the treasurer updates the budget based on what is spent from the wallet typically on a spreadsheet i'm trying to make this workflow easier making it easy for a treasurer or someone else from the community to set a budget for the community treasury to track inflows and outflows and to maintain the community's runway what i've built is a version one i have a lot more to do and i would look at what i built as a very initial version of what i plan to do so now if i go to lamada community um i'm first going to enter some inflows that this community treasury is going to get [Applause] so now we have this community getting 13 000 tokens of income in october 2020. i'll now enter some expenses we have 8 000 tokens worth of expenses which is 62 of the income coming in in october and so we're left with 5 000 tokens at the end of october now i'll talk about what i plan to do which is in the near term make sure the user can enter their ethereum address and automatically track inflows and outflows as well as tag certain expenses based on what they want to be represented in the budget and then also assess their projected runway for the community treasury over a longer period of time i would like to add an option for users to make payments via say player and also earn yield from the token balance in the tragedy uh first i love this project because i would use it for like half the thousand part of and uh you know so like i think there's a few tweaks that definitely request as a potential user right like maybe uh you know managing the treasure in eve you know obviously uh i guess tracking like proposals and the i guess even stuff such as like when we make proposals right um it's like it's often requested in usd terms even though the actual amount is an eve and just like um yeah i think there's like a lot uh this is a big problem space for like daos so like i recommend just like further talking to more doubts talk to more coordinators see i think it's a big problem thank you um by the way i can't share my video i think the host has disabled that but um but yes thanks for the feedback i i agree with that yeah i also really love it um i mean dows are obviously going to be huge and just more frequent and people are going to be having to manage their treasury so this is a very useful tool for them um i completely agree like having it in each obviously would be really helpful but i know that that is a future integration and then when you like start having the like enablement of payments um it could be interesting to have some sort of um like system where people can like permission like check that this is like a good payment or something like i know there's um like in these kind of like traditional world systems that there's a lot of like auditing and permission process um so that could be interesting in the future so it's not just like one person controlling all the funds side note sorry uh just it one idea came about which is like most styles always have like kind of like a hot wallet a side wall at multisig if you will right where like it's you know dallas access funds very uh for quick and quick use right and this could be i could definitely see a part of where like you know you deploy a nurse's multisig as you know we're sharing the same interface right and you can kind of see like um hot wallet usage as well and who's managing that too so idea do you see that as a standalone product or more of an app that could be used inside aragon or nose is safe and why sure is um i'm not sure yet i my initial thought is um a standalone app that that i guess uh communities can sort of um on you know just input their budget into this and sort of this be the place that they track what's going on um but i i do think there are limitations of doing that because it's harder to enable payments and other things if you don't say connected to um like a wallet diagnosis um so i'm not sure i don't know if you have uh thoughts on um on what you think is about as well yeah my feeling is that there's so many things around this idea for example controlling who can spend the money and um kind of connecting that to the actual funds that i think it would probably make make more sense to use existing infrastructure and build on top of that then kind of creating the whole thing from from scratch so that's that's my feeling but of course it's just my opinion thank you anything else maybe uh like we're from fernando's comment i feel so like building these uis for these dows like actually pretty hard and complicated by themselves and they actually all suck right now um so like you know uh like even aragon they're doing arrogant sdk to to build you know to allow it to build like ireland interfaces very easily uh pokemon for moloch's so i think the interface like area for dallas is actually wide open right for someone to do it really well all right very cool looking forward to see uh where this goes after the hackathon do you plan on continuing to build it yeah i do um i'm actually you know instead of the very early stages of learning how to build things so um so yes i mean i'm excited to continue to work on this is a longer-term project very cool yeah you should connect with peter uh after this they're running a sort of an incubator grants thing uh after the hackathon so definitely talk to him great we're going to move on to the next project which is coin chat i'm going to play the video for them i just want to make sure they're all here and ready to go can i get a confirmation from the team hagnel or dominic okay yes in the chat that's good [Music] [Music] welcome to the demo uh it is hosted at coinchat.search.online so now i'm entering the secret and logging in with metamask it takes few seconds to login this is the first user i'm going to the second user to copy his address and i'm pasting his address and i'm telling the message to send along with the message i can also add some link from textile bucket so i'm uploading some file to textile bucket copying the link and pasting it here i can also send ether along with the message so i already sent ether so i'm just pasting the transaction ash and i'm sending the message the second user has received the message and i'm replying back to the first user and i'm again i've already again sent the ether so i'm just pasting the transaction hash so yeah the first user has also received the message the main advantage of this is that you can like filter messages based on it so we can avoid spam messages from teeth if someone has paid for sending a message or any other cryptocurrency yeah 22 in cryptocurrency it's less likely it's more likely to be a real valued message yeah so that's the main feature of this um i i think the whole east filter feature is really interesting for inbox so you can see like what what's um kind of higher signal um how do you how do you ensure like people are um like reading this and actually like not just getting paid um to receive messages um like i because i know that like earn.com like they had a very similar um thing in the early days and like they would make you do like a task at the end of it um like yeah how do you ensure like do people have profiles where they're saying like hey i'm actually actively reading this or like i guess how do you like connect people who um are using this feature and who you'll make sure to actually read this message yeah so like uh to identify the real user uh one can be one thing which we can do is we can like uh possibly get the user by phone like your email id or when provided so this way we know that okay uh the identity of the user say uh we get an identity and get an electric frequency your headphones are not plugged in all the way but there's some some uh static coming through okay i think there's some signal issue here yeah i thought it would be loud uh uh so uh so one thing is we can uh identify user just like gmail does the email login and phone verification and provide an nft token after we verify the user and so this will be that's there's some credibility that is one thing another another thing is we can use page rank like algorithm so first we can identify a creditable user and based on that if he rates the user and then uh based on that algorithm so through weights and graphs so we can identify like most like okay so to summarize i think what you said was you can issue an nft to people who have signed up and then you can also run something like page rank over the social graph of people who have actually signed up to give people higher trust scores yeah yeah yeah okay cool just wanted to clarify cool thank you i think we'll type it in okay perfect uh real quick uh does the user have to enter their private keys you said like the secret is that like the 12 word mnemonic or secret or no do they have to type here it is uh the secret is just like it can be a cigarette can be empty also so it's like through usual mammoth authentication and uh based on my three models we generate a new address a new private key private key cap it's not ethereum it's just a public private effect if there is a secret uh it adds like another limited to the activity so we don't know that they are this ethereum address is like this public key privacy guys so there is no more anonymity it's any random pair public private right yeah got it thank you yeah not uh fully random based on the ethereal matters and the secret it's deterministic from the matters on the secret for the same secret and same with address the public privatizing got it thank you yeah so you could also just like figure out how to integrate with like a bridge to do like telegram notifications that's one other option i think you also mentioned chat bots yeah i know this sounds like your audio has cut out so maybe answer that in the chat but peter was suggesting to look up abridged i think their url is abridged io yep that might be another solution for you to integrate i think that might be time for the session so if there are any final comments for the team if not i want to thank again dominic for presenting sorry about the audio issues next up is sorry let me double check which one is next steak legends hi everyone uh can you hear me well okay cool i'm going to play the video if there's any trouble with the sound please let me know hi everyone and welcome to this video i'm going to show you my project that i've worked on for eth online called steak legends steak legends is a protocol that allows users to participate in a real world video gaming competition for anyone who doesn't know apex legends it's an online multiplayer hunger games on the ps4 i'm going to present you the basic flow and interaction with the protocol through the interface as with nad app you need to connect with metamask or any wallet but right now only midi mask is supported first every participant needs to claim their psn username just put your eth address in your ps4 profile bio and call the function claim username on the contract to verify your identity then everybody stakes a fixed amount of eth on the ave through the contract and then plays apex legends on ps4 till the end of the season the top players with the best rankings win all the interests of the other participants the initial stake is then redistributed to everyone so it's an entirely no-loss game now we can go behind the scenes a little bit how is it made the protocol uses ave to stake founds of participants in the learning pool it sort of acts as a proxy real world data retrieval is done with chain link a custom oracle was built to verify any address username pair and to compute ipx legends player rankings relative to the contract participants thank you very much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed the project and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out thanks ath online and happy gaming all right um so one thing i forgot to add in the video was the next steps so right now apex legends is the only game supported but i i really want if we're going to move forward to move with you know custom oracles for i don't know every big game like overwatch of this or this kind of thing um yeah and and maybe for the verification part uh also add nfts to verify that the user is the owner of the username uh this is cool yeah i mean i i think this is going to be a very popular concept in terms of people having tournaments and getting paid out in eth uh how frequent are the tournaments and then also are you able to like private ones or is it just like a free-for-all like regardless of rank yeah so right now the the thing is that i built a custom oracle to to fetch the rankings directly from the real world apex season apex seasons are uh three to four months long so it's it's around four seasons every year um so right now it's all real world anybody literally anyone who plays on the ps4 uh can join in and and be in the pool and and earn other people's interests cool oh sorry so like it's like um i could imagine games where like they set this i can imagine crypto native games like axi infinity where they set this up for their own players and it's like a way for them to mine right like uh yeah of some sort it's maybe like slp tokens right or whatever like the in-game currency has uh-huh yeah definitely yeah sorry sorry oh please go ahead please go ahead i was just curious uh i so you said you created this oracle but it also uses chain link how how does that work exactly and how trustless is that and how kind of gameable maybe you you just create a user and then you want to steal everyone's uh interests and you say you were the best even though you weren't how does that work yes so when i say it uses chain link it doesn't use the price feeds that are built in the protocol it uses a custom job so kind of http requests to a custom built oracle this oracle in turns uses the official i mean the the unofficial psn api to retrieve the usernames and the and the apex legends api to retrieve the rankings so right now the the api is is hosted on my personal domain so it's uh so it's not fully decentralized but we could imagine hosting it on on some kind of serverless you know decentralized stack with even an ens domain name this would solve most of the problems cool thank you you're welcome all right anybody plays apex before i have not but i could see this yeah i could see this idea being super powerful so i like the idea yeah move on with this and kind of look for funny or a team are you alone yeah so so that's the thing to be honest i i i worked alone during this hackathon and i think it's it's quite hard to to continue like this i would kind of like maybe a co-founder and maybe raise some founds after that to to really you know extend to a more decentralized solution and also extend to other games like overwatch cs go whatever one thing i noticed uh do i still have a little bit of time yeah one thing a few seconds yeah okay so one thing i noticed is you could today you could you can bet on protocols for esports um but it's only on external people so you can't bet on yourself so this is why i wanted to bring to the ecosystem thank you really cool thanks congrats yeah definitely like peter suggested um try and look into some of the crypto native games it might yield some interesting outcomes and definitely it will be easier to integrate their community their communities might even be more receptive to something like this yeah right great definitely thank you so much for your feedback of course [Music] all right i'm going to get the next video queued up um give me one second the next team is unite dot community so sorry one second social tokens have been blowing up lately and brian flynn who has his own social token recently tweeted a list of questions a big one was what are the best ways to do social token distribution our team was thinking about the space so i jumped in with the idea of giving away social tokens in exchange for engagement and alex mismatch who tokenized himself replied saying that he thinks it's an amazing idea the next day he tried my suggestion with a tweet saying he's giving away five dollars in alex tokens the first hundred people who retweet he got the retweets and in 17 minutes grew the number of token holders by 25 he added that the twitter algo stopped him from sending dms for the winners near to manually do the distribution in phases which brings us to unite the tool to automatically distribute tokens to your community and essentially automate the slow manual process that alex massmesh had to go through with his experiment to distribute social tokens it works like this first you connect your wallet and log in with metamask then you enter your twitter handle and verify your twitter account by signing a public tweet then you complete verification and land on our home page where alex mesmeash would create his first campaign we want to offer many campaign types including retrospective airdrops and different combinations but for now we're implementing rewards for retweets you begin by entering the campaign details the erc20 token address the tweet url which in this case we're replicating the tweet that alex did and so we entered the tweet url went to the number of people to reward we enter the number of tokens per reward and we click create campaign and send tokens to reward pool which opens a metamask transaction to first allow us access to manage his alex tokens and second to send the tokens for the reward to our reward pool contract we see that the transaction gets confirmed and he sees his campaign on the home page a few moments later alice sees alex's tweet and retweets she then goes to unite our community to claim her tokens similar to alex she has to connect her meta mask and log in she also has to verify her account so she enters her twitter handle signs a public tweet to verify and completes verification in the background our twitter bot has seen that she's earned the rewards and they're visible on the home page which she can withdraw by confirming a minimized transaction now her withdrawal is complete and her alex tokens are in her wallet she goes to his website and sees that she can join an exclusive chat on telegram because she holds alex tokens she goes through a process to connect her metamask and check that she holds the tokens and instantly gets access to alex's private telegram group meanwhile alex can see the progress and that the tokens have been claimed so we were testing our dap today and while we were testing something interesting happened people saw our verification tweets and started to use unite including coin artists who has their own social token and 37 000 twitter followers so we started speaking to some of these users many of whom have their own social tokens already and are very excited to use unite to automatically distribute tokens to their communities and the users on our waitlist have more than 100 000 twitter followers combined we're really grateful for all the help from the sponsors we used pocket network to fetch token data from the blockchain and did a lot of work towards using chain link for our bots and by economy to subsidize gas for frictionless withdrawals unfortunately we couldn't get bi-conomy or chain link adapters working in time but are in touch with the teams and are almost there finally we want to say thank you to the organizers and judges we had a great time working on the hackathon and really look forward to your questions this is awesome um so i think social tokens are going to be huge and you definitely address the problem that people have um and i like the presentation style is awesome uh one thing though is that twitter is full of bots and like when you incentivize people to make money like they're gonna just come out running and so how do you is there a way that like the creator can like like look at accounts and like flag if something's a bot and prevent them from claiming or is there some way of managing that kind of um claim process hi linda uh yeah that's a great question um so we've been speaking of the bright id guys and that's one possible solution to this um we also have a capture on the landing page that we haven't deployed yet but that's another way to try to address spots my thinking is it's kind of like trying to secure your house like you can make the wall higher you can add a fancy alarm system but if someone wants to game it they're gonna try to figure out a way to do that um but yeah i think having the creator being able to sort of interact with the rewards is a great idea but i mean yeah that's that's one of the big sort of questions that we're trying to solve and something we were hoping to get uh judge feedback on as well yeah i i love this and like i if you want to like dm me or something i'm happy to like brainstorm i think it's really cool and it's going to be a quite popular use case awesome will dear yeah i kind of agree uh another uh other use cases you can solve for maybe like using bi economy to like or at least about to almost like send uh mass and nfcs so like this is just like problem in general of nfts it's like there's no 12 other way to like um mass send them easily right um so like you know for previous events you know uh i mean there's like reviews with previous events i've like copy and pasted like a bunch but i guess co-app like basically generate nft uh user side but what if you don't want to do that um so there's like yeah this is like uh i could imagine you automating a lot of the stuff away perhaps as well yeah we uh we actually wanted to apply for the untitled nft hackathon as well but we're also submitting for seed club and it's been a really busy two weeks so i don't know if we're gonna make it um but yeah that's a great idea um i mean our thinking with distribution generally is it should be pull instead of push so rather than you having to go and do a bunch of dms like a person should come to you and claim that you're like a miracle drop sort of idea have you considered other social networks or other type like types of channels where people could verify their messages yeah that's a great question so we're focusing on twitter for now because you know crypto twitter is on twitter um but our roadmap is basically to add more campaign types on twitter and then expand to other social networks so you might have a reward where you need to follow on instagram and follow on twitter and do something else in order to get tokens and the verification part yeah i mean that could happen across those different platforms too that's something we're still trying to work out but yeah it's a great idea i mean i should say the other thing on our roadmap to consider is not only doing distribution but being full stack social tokens so allowing people to issue tokens and also be the place where they're redeemed so you know you might burn 50 tokens in exchange for a one minute video call with someone you know it would be weird if uh you paid a hundred dollars to have like a five minute video call or someone but if you earned some tokens and then spent those i think that would be cool so yeah we want to make it full stack and that's the other thing that we're looking at but kind of scared of the sec and and waiting to clear up some of the legal questions on issuance congrats really cool idea thank you yeah you already hit the two things i was gonna suggest which is the bright id and having a caption on the page um sorry did i jump over somebody oh no i was just gonna add something else go ahead go ahead uh it might be worth looking at um councils uh c and sl reuben um had created and one council token you can redeem one hour of his time and he's he was a lawyer at coinbase so he like already did the regulatory due diligence on that so it could be worth like reaching out to him or just assuming that like you can issue tokens that are worth your time and that's not like an sec concern yeah that would be awesome uh we actually already bought a ross campbell legal engineering token and had a call with him um and also bought we're like dog fooding ourselves on social tokens we also bought a boy token gonna get into help with design and maybe get a mean to tweet it out when we're ready but yeah uh we did look at ruben's token um and yeah hopefully gonna get his input as well cool that's awesome yeah i i'll just echo what everybody's saying this is a really great idea and i just was thinking that this would be a perfect uh i could use this for one of my personal projects so maybe i'll reach out great job guys thank you thank you everyone thank you okay next up is oligo and i think we will take uh a break after this one let's see we have 15 so yeah we'll take the break after this project i'll let max start hello everyone welcome to our short showcase of our project oligo oligo allows the buying and selling of voting rights in governance token it does this using two pools on the left side you can see the pool with the voting token here you can see various stats such as how big is the pool currently in relation to the total supply of the voting token or how many tokens you yourself have deposited how many percent you have etc in the middle you can see the current proposal being voted on here you can see the current votes already being cast and this is the size of the current pool those votes are not being cast yet they're only being cast at the end of the voting period here you can see the current expected outcome for the voting and here you can see the expected outcome for after the pool votes so you can see there's quite a drastic shift in the expected outcome how the pool votes gets decided by the pool on the right here you can see the current relation of yes to no votes these votes get decided by how much money you put into the buying pool so one die equals one vote whichever side has more money basically decides which way to pull the vote so here you can see currently the most votes vote no so the pool will vote no after the vote gets cast the winning side pays their money to the voting pool and if you're in the voting pool you get a percentage of the total amount paid out so right now i would get 10 of 200 die which would be 20 we can create a pool for basically every governance token for example you can see uni we also have an example for compound which looks quite different currently as you can see i didn't put any votes in and it's currently voting yes also the pool is much bigger we mainly built this project to show the dangers of the current governance mechanisms which are basically oligarchy so we want to encourage the community to build something better and until then you can farm your votes if you're too lazy to vote thank you very much okay very smart i i like the twist that it's like this is purely a means to you know get protocols to reimagine you know and improve their governance and to move away from the cell of coupling um very cheeky i like it yeah i was not expecting that like at first i was like i have a million questions about this monetization of voting rights and um but i like that twist at the end and i think that's really creative yeah i mean um it should be usable so it should be designed in a good way and usable in a good way otherwise it wouldn't really threaten the current model um but the idea is to make it really public because i believe like in behind closed doors something like this probably already happens i don't know in the future maybe so making it visible and showing that it's actually a real danger is i think very important what are the next steps max for this project yeah the next steps is of course mainnet first um and then i would like to until then we we still need to change quite a few things so right now you actually deposit the token but i would like to move to uh delegation for example uni i think supports delegation so um to make it safer for the vote holder so that the money doesn't get locked up and after this of course adding more token like maker or something union compound is basically the same from the mechanism so it was quite easy to do both but in the future i would like to add more um sorry if i missed this but was there somewhere in the interface where you could actually say how much you were going to pay for a vote like i i wasn't sure like how that market price gets determined yeah market price was a very interesting question we ask ourselves so um we can't really decide a price so ideas um we um yeah you you put as much money as you want into the pool and let's say um in the example we had like 104 and 200 against so i could deposit 101 and then it would be 201 4 and 200 against and then the four side would win because it's bigger than the against side so through that you kind of get a price feed um if it's very under uninteresting then probably there's just maybe i don't know one die in there four and no one buys against tokens so we try to copy the idea of of uni swap with the pools so we don't um have like an ebay for votes because that i think would be very uninteresting yeah i was just going to say this i think one of the first experiments around this was from mariano conti last year he had a project a little experiment he did called sellout dao where he sold if you're familiar with it or for anybody on the call he sold um i think it was voting rights for moloch um and it was one of the first ones i remember maybe there are others but i linked it in the chat if anybody's curious it's a cool it's a cool concept i look yeah his major takeaway is like we need to enable this bribery now because it's going to happen regardless yep very cool project though any other questions okay great great job max thank you okay so next up we will have the 10 minute break so take some time turn off your video and audio and maybe we'll see the sun when we get back from peter fernando we're having a 10 minute break thanks i just cut off for some reason cool thanks i don't see any sun peter no uh it's like it's still you know like 4 52 a.m so i think sunrise is 6am give it a bit more maybe we will finish the session uh finish judging before the sunrise yeah i'm just getting a little nervous because we're halfway and i know you didn't get to see the sunrise um you don't normally wake up this early do you oh no i sleep at seven or eight a.m uh so wow so you normally yeah okay you're on like in a completely different time zone basically i don't really explain them in sydney i just say i'm about time zones and okay sure yeah well whatever works for you and we're obviously we're happy to happy to have you awake for this all right looks like everybody's back let me just get a confirmation from mix mix are you ready to go yeah can you hear me yes you can start when you're ready uh were you guys gonna play the video or uh i in my notes it just i just said that um you're talking live over it but i can play the video for you if you'd like okay yeah that'd be great all right let me pull it up okay here we go uh the notes say that you're talking live over yeah yeah that's fine okay cool go ahead uh yeah so we i made a mix which is a prediction market um so it can really be used for anything but it's built on top of the gnosis conditional tokens um so this is a for the demo i did uh one for the world series um so you want to set it enough time in advance so that um they can arbitrate it and decide uh who actually won the world series so there's something that's you know going on now um but at the time it was uh even series so i had set it to 50 50 odds but it doesn't necessarily have to be and you can also do multiple options or custom probabilities for this and then i had also uh have an example that i'll show uh when we're done with this uh that's using it for um kind of a like voting contest of uh video of the year so but for this one um once you set the probabilities and outcomes then you have to fund the market and then these conditional tokens are issued and people can purchase them on either side um so if you thought tenbay would win you'd purchase that token and then that actually can affect the probabilities over time or how these tokens trade um so yeah one thing we wanted to add uh for this was uh yeah being able to um batch the transactions with something like bikonomy um as well as also doing like a uh nft for for the prizes as well uh okay yeah so we can actually do this screen share now of the other project or just like the other kind of contest that i thought was like a little bit more novel of for the production market are you going to show that video yeah yeah i had to wait for that uh so this one was actually for like a video of the year um so i did it for these artists um and then each one has a video that corresponds to it and then for the voting um i had actually wanted to use pool together uh to create the voting mechanism based on like how big the price becomes based on how much like tokens are deposited and then that way it's also something that's like secure and people can get their funds and it has this like ticket mechanism um so for one artist the baby so for like his video was the rock star and so then people would be able to vote on that for it which would uh goes to this pool together and then people can select these would be the terms on it so it's set to the end of the year about and then has a symbol and its own uh eoc 20 token and then the baby would be like the artist that's like behind it and then you can yeah buy tickets for it from there um and then one thing we had actually also explored as part of the hackathon was uh creating like synthetics then for the artist so we built that on uh uma but we didn't really get to finish it out to the end so but it was using their like emp tools um yeah but we don't need to go through it the whole way but this was part of it wait do you want to move into q a now yeah we can take questions um i'm just trying to understand the pool together and gnosis part so are were they two separate projects that you were building or is it that there's a prediction market and then the funds going to pull together like i'm trying to understand the like how those interact with each other uh yeah so we had actually wanted to do the uh pull together uh so the pulled together was the voting mechanism for the contest uh and then that's how that would be decided so like there's like a prediction market of like who will win that people can like bet on who will win and then there's a voting mechanism of who actually wins oh okay gotcha so that's what pulled together was used for us like who has the biggest pool for the biggest prize this could do really well for like double xl uh freshman of the year like sort of stuff it's like everyone's betting on like who's you know going to be the freshman anyways right yeah yeah and there's a lot of like debate about like who gets included and who's not and then yeah like who actually is the best of that or you know who's trapped yeah the worst cipher you know like like or you know yeah little mosey you know like memes about him anyways yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah and and the comments actually are are built into it uh so it can it's all decentralized so it's a free range what are the next steps um yes the next steps i actually kind of wanted to do it like a live run of it like for this i thought it was like something that was contained enough you know like people want to debate it you can have difference of opinion um but it was to actually do the pools uh for the artists and then actually be able to make their uh like synthetic tokens that could like have some sort of like longer term uh demand after yeah but yeah i i thought that the interesting thing was using pulled together as like a voting mechanism as like a way to like collect interest as opposed to just having like things where like people can just like either buy it outright or like kind of like gamify it um this was something that was like a little bit harder to manipulate right so you actually need to put funds in and hold it um to like see the outcome and like obviously you know more people come in but it's not something where like um you know anybody can just make accounts and spam it and just like vote it like swing it like that so yeah thanks thanks guys and like it really there's really introduced uh interesting protocols to work with so it's a good time great job well thanks how far out do you think your uh uma integration would be like was it part of the way there or do you think it would take like how much work do you think uh it was like part of the way there so like yeah so like it was really kind of figuring out just what the mechanics were but i kind of actually wanted to use their uh ususd um as like kind of like underlying tokens that back the artist tokens and like the video tokens too potentially so like it was it was like part way done but i wanted to test that out um before releasing it yeah it seems like every every time we see a concept like this it's getting closer and closer to reality and like peter said there's a there's a huge demand or maybe not demand uh people don't know that they want this yet but they will once once a concept like this is live it's a really powerful idea like yeah prediction markets for contests with public figures it's going to be very very huge i think so great job cool thank you okay the next team is blockhead i'll let darryl start it off give me one second i'm starting the video is there supposed to be audio here yes can you not hear it yeah why don't you try it again with the make sure that the box is checked or share computer sound welcome to blockhead a decentralized wallet manager trading interface and blockchain explorer blockhead aims to provide a comprehensive provider agnostic interface that allows you to perform common blockchain related activities in a fun flexible and transparent way let's start with the portfolio screen here you can add your wallet address to your portfolio by pasting your address or typing a name from ens i'll provide provider like metamask or portus you can connect it on the right like so in the future you'll be able to simply drag this wallet to your portfolio and aggregated statistics will automatically be calculated for you portfolios you create here on the left are automatically saved in your browser even if you refresh the page they'll remain there next let's look at the explorer clicking on an address or ens name from your portfolio will take you to the explorer view so there's no need to switch back and forth currently the explorer's ens names powered by the e s subgraph hosted on the graph has plain ethereum addresses and area transactions notice these two drop downs up the bottom of the screen when possible blockhead will fetch data using the blockchain provider and price oracle that you set here so you get to choose where your data comes from support for other networks and assets to make this explorer as informative as possible finally let's look at the training view blockhead helpfully organizes many popular trading options in one place so you can make an informed decision so far i've integrated vega the fully automated decentralized derivatives exchange here's a live view of all the trades are rotating place and we can slow it down more clearly future i hope to integrate block head providers and products blockchains to give users identities or ceramic and define approachable and more user-friendly through blockhead's unified interface thanks for your support hey judges hey this is this is neat and it's um it's cool that you built this all during a hackathon um and i like that uh you get to choose your price feed i thought that was a creative feature um yeah what so uh i guess what was the most difficult part about building this um definitely it was a it's a huge software engineering exercise to integrate all these different apis and they all have different ways of fetching data um and doing all that and another technical issue i ran into is that the web framework i'm using which is uh sapper built on it doesn't support um many browser-related variables in the libraries like if there's a library references window or the document it'll the server side rendering will completely fail so i had to have a workaround for that yeah it's a pretty wide like scope in terms of what you're trying to build it's it's a big big project um have you ever have you thought of like any areas that you might want to double down on or focus specifically on um there are two things i want to double down on uh one is that it's a fully decentralized interface so um ideally um after i'm done you would end up with a static interface and you could upload it to ipfs for example and anyone could access it and it would be uncensorable and all those decentralized features and the second one is i would want to build in a visualization so my actual thought for this uh this was my original project idea and i didn't get to implement this but uh it's the idea of a metaverse built on the blockchain so like every blockchain such as bitcoin or ethereum could be like a floating island in this universe and it moves up and down based on the price of the asset and if you own a address on the well on the if you own an address holding that asset then you would own a piece of land on that island and you could go from there there could be a lot of trading visualization going on you know moving between islands and so forth and i think that would be very engaging interesting yeah i actually really like the visualization you got you know i felt like that would have been a really cool way to just visualize you know uh unisopt trades um like you know in a real-time fashion like you know the first um hour pool you know to whatever you watch everything go in this chaos yeah but yeah good job thank you any other questions what what do you think are the main advantages over xirian and zapper and other such platforms for sure uh i thought of that so the last i checked all these different services my either wallet xerion you can only log in with one wallet at a time and i think we've all had that problem where we're using all these services and we have all these metamask wallets littered everywhere and they're you know your funds are kind of scattered across different places and you want to see them all in one place so if you saw on the portfolio screen you can actually connect multiple wallets at the same time and it will aggregate them for you so that's that's the use case there thank you great yeah i really appreciate the how polished it is it definitely seems like you spent some time on the ui thank you all right uh if there are no other comments we're going to move to the next project thank you daryl thank you next up is mile and i'll let thomas share his video hey hey we're mile and our goal is to improve the content retrieval experience on the falcoid network so retrieval is the process by which a file stored on the falcoid network is served to a client by a retrieval miner and it's a crucial component of the network as it allows for people to access the data they've stored but currently it's hard for miners to collect payment for retrieval deals even after successfully retrieving data for a client so miners can only collect payment after a 12-hour period and personally we've had difficulties collecting these payments resulting in us losing fill to solve this the mile app automatically finds retrieval deals for our users and manages payment collection so we take our users payment channels as collateral for loans and more liquid coins such as ether die so that our users get paid immediately for retrieval and currently we're exploring solutions using multi-sig to enforce this collateral so to get a behind-the-scenes view once we've sourced a deal for one of our users we trigger a function on a mile loan contract on ethereum so this function uses a chain link node to query a file coin lotus node verifying that the newly executed retrieval deal is valid and if the deal information passes this test we hold the user's payment channel as collateral for an ether die loan and this means that our users get paid immediately for retrieving we'll now show you this process in a demo and the first thing i'm going to do is to trigger a retrieval deal i will cut some of the retrieval wait time out because creating a payment channel can take quite a long time and so if all things go according to plan my ether dress seen in metamask here should have more ethernet by the end of this process so let's go ahead and trigger that retrieval deal so when that's completed our user triggers a function on our eth loan contract this function takes in information about the new retrieval deal and triggers a job on our chain link node which itself calls on an external lotus node to verify that the deal information is valid and that we can safely issue a loan to our user if the chain link node gives our loan contract the green light our user should receive eth immediately and this is exactly what you can see happen in metamask we've received e for executing this retrieval deal and in the terminal you can see all the steps that led to this and i want to draw your attention to the payment channel here this is created after a retrieval deal and it's one of the core pieces of information that we use to verify that a deal is valid and so behind metamask you can see our chain link node and if i reload this runs page you're going to see this new job that was created just a minute ago if i click on this job you can see all the steps that led to the completion of the issuing of the loan the very first of which is a post to our lotus node and the chain link job then processes the returned information so that the loan contract can decide whether or not to issue a loan thank you for listening this is super interesting i like that you were trying to solve a problem that you were dealing with yourself i'm trying to understand so is it that you guys would be providing this eflone yourselves or are you creating like a kind of peer-to-peer marketplace where others can provide that loan um and is there like interest on this like how does that process look like uh yeah so i mean it could be it could be us it could be others um we still need to work out some of the the financial details so that it's favorable for someone to actually loan youth in this scenario because you're dealing with quite a volatile currency right which is bills so you obviously need to take that into account when you're learning but once we figure that out um it could definitely be directly peer-to-peer and then to provide basically that liquidity i can jump in what what if any current solutions are there for this or is this sort of the first solution yeah this is the very first actually um and we're kind of and behind this we're also kind of pushing on on making retrieval mining a bit easier for miners too because it's quite an involved process so even behind just like beyond like getting paid just like executing retrieval deal is actually quite complex as well so we're trying to streamline that too do you think that they that fi coin could not implement this natively um so actually in their vision they so they implemented the storage part and this is the the idea where you store on falcon and retrieve but then there's the room for this secondary retrieval market and so our layers like uh the hot storage so it's more about retrieving content really fast so there's room for actually many types of different markets where you can find content and find the peers that will be closest to you to retrieve from and currently that uh falcon protocol labs has not implemented and and they want actually the community to implement different types of markets in order to decentralize this further uh and so we're kind of the first implementation uh to do that and and so on top of our retrieval market we want to make this whole process very easy and add better incentives so there's less barriers of adoption for for minors yeah and we've we've actually spoken directly with the the valcoin team to validate some of our assumptions and this is something that they've supported um in the way it's been implemented pretty cool another question is there are no just so i understand correctly there are no funds actually moving cross-chain this is just chain-link the chain link node is just transferring data right yeah exactly okay i guess you know what are your future plans after this you've got a proof of concept you've validated it you know have you talked to many other kind of like operators who have the same problems um well so we actually are working right now on a simple um kind of finder application where you can just exchange files uh so it's really kind of like a first simple front-end for for this retrieval market uh and the idea is we want to really focus on making this file sharing experience stable and then once you actually onboard more people to with an application who run those mile nodes uh then you get this layer where you can use as kind of like an api for any kind of dap so then daps can just use our network uh to uh store any type of content and use file coin on top of it as a back end so uh the data is stored on the long term for the long term on thought on uh like a storage miner and then uh is available on our uh market kind of like a decentralized content delivery network so we're basically like a decentralized uh cloud flares something like that three i think that's it for q a thanks thomas and alex great thanks next up is elastic chain hello everyone hello today we want to talk about our project and what problems we want to solve uh actually the main idea is to help the ads scales fast and meet investors and we want to establish a trust relationship between the apps creators and investors what we actually doing is putting a platform where uh the apps creators could come in and put their mvp uh and explain their project put a description the sponsor could put prices uh people will have the choice to vote for the app they want the most and if investors can step up any time to invest once the the winner is determined he gonna receive the funding but the smart contract will actually send him funding every time he completes a mindset we want to showcase some deals because the goal is to put the light on the drives at the apps and make them uh more uh accessible to people we want people to start using the apps because we think it's the the next uh thing uh we explain how it works from pulling your mvp until finding an investor and we share with you our philosophy the team is coming from different countries which is also great diversity always came up with a great idea so let's just get started let's just type the name here you can see all the categories we have different categories social for example uh sport uh you can see the the sponsors here i'm gonna just go ahead and click on d5 for example we can see different projects that uh put their uh that accesses this challenge the t5 challenge we can see some descriptions uh we can click more so once here you can see the project uh you can see the team the number of volts the number of interested investors what this project is doing you can even download the white paper uh you can put up comment as well uh and it's very interesting because we want people to uh be able to vote to choose which app they want to see in the near future and we want to give them this power so in order to vote it's very simple you can just answer a few questions we want to make sure people that are voting actually really want to vote for this project for example i can put anything it's an amazing concept i like it we use the sea up the overall rating and then you can vault and the vote will be processed and uh added on the blockchain on the other hand people who create the apps will have like a different page of course they cannot evolve on their pro project but they can still look at the funding status let's say this project had one so he will have like received 11 of the fund at the beginning the smart contract will release the 32 funds after he complete a milestone and the other 57 from for example in the third uh in the last part the last hello i just want to take a moment to to talk more instead of just showing the video uh you guys can see me as well hello again so the idea is like incubation based on milestone so the idea is to help the apps like better manage the fun they get and also give like this uh community engagement between users and are coming in so we're giving the user the possibility to vote uh so the the idea also will have like this place where we can showcase like all the projects that are coming in all the projects there are winning like prices investors can also invest and they will follow the same process which is also by milestones um well that's pretty much the idea and i will let you guys uh have you checked out um giveth so giveoff was like a very early project trying to basically figure out a way to create a system for projects to put up projects i guess you know needs a funding and the funds would be you know distributed uh on a milestone basis right uh by the community and it's like i i'm not sure what the status is i'm sure it's like still going but it might be good to um check them out again and understand like what issues they ran into right yeah i know that there is a lot of issues you know uh com that's why we want to make it like uh we want to give more uh parameters for example even while choosing the winner it could be directly by choosing the one who has like the most vote or the sponsor can always have the hand to choose which which winner either to get the winner directory by default or actually he can uh but on like which project will be uh winning the price so we know that there is a lot of problems and we're trying to fix one on on a time i can say and by giving more uh parameters for the sponsors and also uh create that engagement but uh yeah i think there is other platforms that are trying to solve these problems and that's what we're also trying to do um i think the voting mechanism is really interesting for signaling to investors like this is definitely a tool that i would use to look at interesting projects and i know that um like in the traditional um tech space uh pioneer is a is a like a project that is kind of showcasing different work that people did from all around the world and then people can vote on which one they liked and then like the top voted ones end up doing like a demo day to like a huge group of investors so i think it's really cool concept thank you yeah i just want to say that it's really cool too oh thank you for sharing oh perfect peter i was just about to link that right i think if there are no more comments we're going to move on to the next project thank you thanks for presenting hello everybody i'm trying to share hello let's okay the video is a little bit longer than four minutes so i'm going to stop it in the middle if you guys don't mind hello everyone i want to introduce our project in this hackathon card called carbon credit project as you can see we are a diverse group of people from all over the world as you can imagine we had some challenges regarding coordination because we are living in different time zones and also all of us are pretty new to ethereum and smart contracts so it was a little bit challenging but we eventually managed to deliver the project my name is sohail i kind of i started the idea and collected the team together and uh worked with every individual we had abdullah al qaeda who was the front developer for us view we had peter andre too who was the back-end developer in this project here's the vision behind this project we want to bring a carbon credit ecosystem on ethereum we will avail that there are other attempts of doing that in the past but our vision is different we specifically want to target energy industry because um we believe in the future energy industry has to comply with the new tighter regulations of carbon emission and therefore they will be a big customer we want to involve the renewable energy producers or industry we want to involve government and ngos that that produce carbon credits currently and we want to have a certified network of validators that help us to validate these projects or of the offsetting uh projects um the other components of this system is a tokenization mechanism that we put in place and also we use the we leveraged the recent development in the d5 space such as automated market maker to create a market for carbon credits here's how it works we we have a registry for to register verifiers carbon credit hold holders and customers on the blockchain and we initially want to transfer the physical carbon credits to ethereum by tokenizing them digitizing them hopefully in the future we could have ngos or government entities directly means their carbon credits on the blockchain there's a smart contract that does that job means and distribute carbon tokens the rc20 based on these physical carbon credits there is a we created a balancer smart pool car carbon die to strap in liquidity and creates a trading market and get a uh on real-time pricing for our carbon token then we have another smart contract that burns carbon token for whoever wants to offset this could be individual could be an industry to offset their uh carbon footprint uh then they do that in in uh as a certificate we mean erc 721 tokens and as nfts for these individuals or companies to have a record of burning or offsetting their carbon so that's the big vision behind it now we want to show you a demo of how this works so we have a carbon credit marketplace and we have created a registration template for our three groups one is carbon credit holders another is customers and another uh other groups are verified so credit holders are uh the organizations who already hold the carbon credits in the emissions trading systems customers are the people who are interest in offsetting their carbon footprint through buying carbon credits and buying the carbon tokens another group is verifiers who validate their credits from credit holders they verify carbon tokens bond and the and validate these things so to register a carbon credit holder we need the credit holder name credit holder id uh how much credit does it held price per credit and validated period suppose 24 months once we add this credit holder our metamask window metamask confirms the transactions and we find this list in the in our added list so these are the right sorry everybody we had we just submitted our video seven minutes before the deadline so just like i did we did not have really time to edit or anything so we were a little bit longer than required so one of the challenges that we had at in the last minute was to to use the balancer pool we created the pool but then we if we v our decimal was not standard decimal based on the balancer requirements so we uh we couldn't make the pool necessarily work but now we have an idea how it works and in the future we are trying to fix that uh what do you use like sorry so these are uh so at the moment we are basically planning to manually import the carbon credits and mince them on the ethereum there is not automated way of doing it yet for us that's i understand that's a big challenge we need to deal with in the future hopefully the best way to do it is to get these entities to come on ethereum and then mince them directly on the ethereum that would be a longer term goal but but we need to find a solution in the meantime um so that's an idea just curious if there are different types of carbon credits or is it just like one thing or is there like the european carbon credit the american and there's like many where then balancer pools would be helpful to get all of those like together in the same market exactly so that's that was the reason we choose balancer pull because at this point in time the contract we written is for one carbon credits and we we thought maybe there's different pricing at this moment there is no standard way anywhere you know european as you said there are different entities have their own carbon credits california as a state has its own program and everything right so we might end up having different type of carbon credits and the balancer will help us to have compared to unisof these are the two protocols that we looked into that's why we chose balancer over unit swap because it allows us to create one pull for everything nice thank you thank you yeah i i'd love to be able to see something like this get actively used in on ethereum so this is neat that you're working on it also just i wanted to say i think it's awesome that it's such a global team and then you guys are um working and building on ethereum so it was really exciting to see that yeah i mean i i enjoyed a lot of my teammates also so it's just our first pretty much interactions with this kind of hackathon well done thank you very much everybody yeah just a quick question what was the most interesting thing you came across if this is your first event um so the most interesting thing for me was uh just connecting the front end and back end that was for me in my mind it was completely impo i couldn't really wrap my head around it because i'm again very new but having one person that has this expertise a little bit from the front and back end and trying to connect you know we had several video calls trying to share screens and understand what the other person is doing so that was like challenging at the same time interesting to just have this communication yeah definitely it can take a while to wrap your head around all the different parts of the ecosystem that are required i'm not a dev but from what i hear it's getting a little bit better over time yeah all right thank you for presenting great projects hey guys how's it going hey how's it going jack i'm just going to give a quick inventory it looks like we have four projects left so we're well on our way in the second half i'll let you start jack cool yeah let me share the screen here [Music] this works let me know if it doesn't work hi everyone my name is andrew rodnick and i'm excited to share our ethonline hackathon submission 20pay the idea for 20pay is to improve the utility of erc20 tokens by allowing users to purchase items on e-commerce stores through whatever tokens they own when comparing our idea to current products we've been thinking of it as a similar platform to stripe but for cryptocurrencies this was inspired by our past experiences in crypto ecommerce currently some platforms like the brave and kuiper stores allow you to paint a few different tokens but these options are still limited and often require users to go through multiple transactions just to complete their purchase 20 pay aims to provide a one-click user experience where the buyer will select the token they want to use and the 20-pay platform will handle the necessary conversion for completing the purchase and send the purchase item back to the buyer to show how this platform could look we'll go through a quick demo of what we've built um yeah so we'll start off with a typical ecommerce looking experience let's say today we are interested in buying some crypto collectibles maybe we want to get this little axi here for five dollars so we can see that we now have the option to use erc20 tokens to buy it let's do that that'll take us to the widget which will eventually be dropped in that e-commerce page um so here we are we can see the seller is requesting die five die for this item we are going to go ahead and use some uni let's say we just got that airdrop as you can see it auto populates how much uni it's going to cost and then let's take a quick look at these metamask accounts so we have 100 uni in our account we're the buyer let's take a look at the merchant real quick the merchant has zero die in his account so let's go back to the buyer and execute this transaction you can see here complete the purchase and it's going to ask us for permission we're going to confirm that it's going to ask us for the gas to send the uni to the contract we're going to confirm that and then it's also going to ask us for the gas for the exchange swap to actually happen we're going to confirm that as well and then we should be able to look back in our account and see we now have about that much uni taken away so we spent the uni and we'll check on the merchant here and we can see the merchant now has the five die in his account in order to gain access to more cryptocurrency types 20pay leverages the 0x api to receive quotes and then once the transaction is confirmed the api performs token swaps through the centralized exchange identified by the api once the swap is complete the 20b smart contracts will complete the purchase and send the item back to the user we are really proud of the progress we've made in the past three weeks taking us from a vague idea to a functioning proof of concept and already see so many ways we can improve the solution in the near term we want to improve the gas efficiency and build integrations with popular stores like wearable and open seas in the longer term we are excited to explore how this platform can be used by merchants as well also an idea called buy now pay later which is a credit-based version of the platform thank you for your time we look forward to continuing our build in the future and appreciate any feedback you have for us what do you think is an immediate way to kind of like play with this and test it out right um you know yeah oh sorry all right my bad um okay we're back sorry can you say that again what's the oh he's asking like um my immediate faults were like this could be this sounds like something that would most likely be used like in an offline environment but you know um i'm curious like how you think this might be used and just like played around with you know maybe like what's the initial like way to just like test it out demo it or you know in a mock environment mock use case yeah yeah we're thinking a lot about that right now because obviously this can be taken in so many different directions from here um so we're thinking about there's some interest with people who are trying to promote a new token and maybe they want to spin up an e-commerce store and sell t-shirts and hats for it and literally you can have people buy t-shirts and hats and also be buying that token on the back end and spending it which is like another way to support the token and there's a couple other cool twists to this like being able to maybe use ave on the back end and you know put in a certain token and not actually pay for it and then have it come out the other side you know in a loan and pay for something so we're still figuring out exactly what like niche we want to go after um the last three weeks we've kind of just been making it work sort of thing so that's a really good question and we're still figuring that out i guess how did you come up with the decision to use xerox api like as the tool for finding the best trade and what have you considered other otherwise like other other tools or aggregator apis have you have you looked at yeah so we actually started out using uniswap um on the back end and we were going to switch to one inch and we sort of looked at one inch and zero x and did um kind of uh you know compared the features of each which our back and guide could probably talk more about but we decided also because one inch and zero x were in the sponsors so we're like we might as well use a sponsor for the initial um thing and then we'll integrate with more dexes or more dex aggregators later on cool thanks thank you i think this is um this is a useful tool for people um and i could see it uh being used for online merchants um i guess like one thing just from my experience when i was at coinbase there was this huge push like early on to get um people to use bitcoin for like payments and one of the big challenges was just also like taxes and like being able to keep track of that so just one thing to consider is like maybe either you guys uh work with somebody who's able to like or recommend like here's like a way to keep track of taxes for the merchant or you guys are keeping track of that just something to consider because that was like a big problem that people were running into yeah that's a really good point i think i think that comes into play more when you're doing like on-ramping and off-ramping from fiat um which we're not quite there yet but token to tokens uh yeah and so you have to keep track of the initial purchase price of each yeah okay that's a good point we definitely need to consider but i mean for very small transactions like i think in the future like hopefully there won't be like taxable events in the us um there's like work being done on that but that is something right now yeah okay that's definitely something we need to get up to speed on then all right i think that's right on time q a is up cool thank you so much guys appreciate it thanks for presenting jack next up is who paula digital identity peter welcome back i think we had you for either hack money or hard fast maybe both good to see you good to see you i'll let you start oh wait i'm playing the video for you yep sorry about that let me grab it [Music] [Music] greetings humans we are upala an anti-civil system for the apps and the decentralized identity of the future today there is no reliable way to tell humans apart from ethereum neither there is on the traditional web and in apollo we believe that over 1 billion people without any id is a part of the same unique human problem existing solutions out there measure the probability of personhood in percents we don't do that in upala instead our account score represents how much it would cost to forge this account and we have dollars instead of percents let's see how it works the first concept is a group users join a group they put their deposits in a pool and the group assigns scores to all of its users notice that the score here is is higher than the deposit and this is where the second concept comes in explosive bots protocol it ensures that anyone can delete their id at any time and grab an amount of money corresponding to their score here a malicious user is able to get 10 dollars from the pool and sure enough other members will feel will feel the trade and they will not let this person in again the third concept is stacking the same way users join groups troops gather into hierarchies superior groups may require deposits from its subgroups and in turn in turn add extra scores to their users the same scores will be paid as a bot reward to an exploding attacker groups at the top may acquire large audiences this way and they may then charge the apps for providing user scores to them the last concept is paths both an attacker or a good user need a membership path through group hierarchy to prove their scores these four concepts incentivize groups to gather large low explosion risk audiences and users are incentivized to get the highest scores for the lowest investment of money or reputation and a market similar to insurance emerges but instead of trading coverage for premium in upala scores are traded for deposits the user score then roughly represents the efforts needed to acquire such a score or the price of forgery and it is a very reliable matrix for the apps to assess human uniqueness with upalla is a protocol a variety of identity systems can be built with it like the one based on friendship or on down membership it can even wrap over multiple identity systems or communities enabling scores that are even higher than a black market cost of a state id so it has a potential to become a substitute for that and yeah that's our goal but for now we made this minimal viable anti-symbol system the top group here is called blade runner and it provides scores to the app the the apps the other groups are entry tests that auto assign scores to members of existing communities a universal basic income app requires a human uniqueness score about five dollars to access rewards so let's see how it works uh let's see our balance uh our ubi balance is zero let's write a claim we can now we need to register an id and join some group to have a score now we have a score of 15 die and we have an option to explode and run away with this amount of money but we'd rather claim our universal basic income so here we go uh right now our balance is 10 points and so this is how it works thank you very much great presentation yeah thank you um i'm curious like why would i guess you know from the perspective of like you know another community member of the tower like how would someone on board everyone else into this sort of like you know civil system right like you know how how would i explain like everyone on board in here we're gonna trust each other and then we're gonna go trust other entities and and communities you know like what would be the main motivation for onboarding people into this stuff that's super cool question uh for sure for for a system like that there is a huge adoption gap and uh there needs the main as the for the full-blown system the main motivation is just to have a score but when we don't have any app that uses this score there is no motivation right to to enter this so i'm looking for platforms like bitcoin uh which are very interested in anticipate system right now uh so a good starting point i think right now is a git coin platform and onboarding their users and onboarding their users and users of existing dows so yeah this is what i'm thinking one recent use kind of case study or lesson to learn was like uh you know on xdi there was a project called honeyswap right it's like fourth between yourself government's token and they did this like distribution where you had to like sign up with bright id and then you know and then go on next time and do the network change and such and the fascinating thing was like this on this dj community found its way like and discovered this idea of like of honey swap and they saw that they were giving tokens away for free and of course like this community basically helped one another on board into bright id and then switch to you know like x die and this group was doing it altruistically well like with a for-profit like motivation but it was like they're helping one another get on this like lifeboat right if you will so like it kind of it shows that like i kind of need like definitely a monitor incentive like i i think at least it's a strong driver right or fomo of some sorts right uh yeah i think like you need like that strong uh anchor there to like kind of onboards on onboard people into this um yeah yeah sure thanks and one of the uh participants here uh needed a anticipal system as well so probably it's a good place to start as well um yeah i i just think this is like a really important problem to work on in this space so glad to see you're working on an entire civil uh platform and uh yeah i would love to like keep up with what you're doing do you plan on continuing work on this sure yeah i have big big plans for that i'm heading for the mvp right now so for the testnet first is the testnet deployment and then then upgradeability and then you know moving on to mainnet and uh maybe first to bitcoin and other uh things as peter mentioned right yeah this is an area i'm like particularly interested in so um like if if um helpful like i'm more than happy to brainstorm like if you want to like dm me on twitter or something just putting it out there sure sure yeah i'm i'm i'm very interested thanks i think i i have no time for a question but yeah just wanted to say that it's a it's a problem that a lot of us need help with and yeah we we need a solution for that or many solutions for for civil attacks and yeah to echo that both fernando and linda it's it's very very early i'm sure you're aware of this but it's super early for identity solutions and we're just starting to see even though some of these projects have been in development for at least a year or a couple years some of them they're just starting to get integrated into projects so it's encouraging to see you know unique takes on how this can be attacked because it's going to be important as more and more value gets gets uh pulled into these systems it's going to become a real big issue so it's cool to see a unique approach to it uh what would you say is the biggest weak spot of allah we're gonna be broken uh as i see um and as was mentioned in one of these papers by democracy earth probably you saw that one uh the the main uh nightmare for me is a what what is what i call a avalanche exit so if there is a if some if we have a solid user base and then people will eventually will explode uh in in avalanche and just drain all the system so this is what i'm afraid of and but i i don't think this is very realistic scenario if we keep working people will not do that no way cool oh yeah that my question definitely put us over time so thank you peter for presenting um thank you progress thanks okay this is the last project of the day i'm excited ooh peter the sun has come up i know i like how you noticed that yeah um yeah so the final project is earth stall and they are promoted i believe and are ready to go so i'll let them start all right let's start the video welcome to airtel the first trusted execution environment enhanced plasma solution current roll-ups or plasma solutions are great but they either require complex cryptography or have high use augmentation resources or frequent on-chain transactions or have a model trust on the operator agile on the other hand provides all the features of rollups of plasma while only requiring simple cryptography little computational resources only a single cpu and only have rare on-chain transaction we observe an amortized transaction cost of zero gas per transaction and we do not have any checkpoints this is achieved by leveraging trusted execution features of modern cpus the architecture looks as follows we have an operator which is basically an untrusted message broker message forwarder and the users of the system first send a deposit transaction on an ethereum smart contract the operator has to forward all blocks to the te and then the trusted execution environment verifies all blocks and then extracts deposits and also later withdrawal and exit statements from the users the te then generates deposit proofs which are then followed to the users users are then ready to transact in the system sending transactions to the operator who forwards those transactions to the te and then the te verifies those and at the end of each epoch generates balance proofs the balance proofs are then forwarded to the users again and if you're wondering if this is all secure it's based on cryptographic research from the chair of applied cryptography at tu darmstadt and the related paper is currently in submission and now demo time okay so on the top left you see a ganache blockchain and in the bottom left we're going to start the operator so when the operator starts he deploys the contracts so you can see here so here we see a contract deployment transaction now we start the clients so here are two different clients and now you see here the command output here's some logging output regarding the blockchain and the epochs and here is the operator status so here we are first gonna deposit 100 here and here as well and now what's happening is that both clients send a deposit transaction here you can see the the contract calls so here is a deposit of 100 eth and after a while they receive a deposit proof and then the balance proof and then the balance is updated here and both users know that they have a balance of 100 in the system now here we can send let's say 50 now to the user at the bottom oh and and now what's happening is is that this user received 50 well it was a quick update but that's because only after an epoch is updated you see the new balances and in between epochs the te caches all the transactions but you can still send many many transactions within a single epoch so now i'm going to run a benchmark so here i will send a thousand transactions so here you see all the thousand transactions just happened um and here you see the stats so this was actually 1159 transactions per second and those were immediately received by the operator forward to the enclave so the enclave is actually running inside of the operator because it's a trusted piece of hardware and then the the enclave verifies all those transactions and then finally sends back the balance proofs here again so this is the final balance yeah thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed edge style yep that was it this is a a really great uh technical solution i think um so curious like what uh te are you using are you using intel sgx and like what are yes so intel sgx would be the like the most easiest to use because the tooling around or the sdks and everything is very good for intel sgx but like the whole protocol and the concept and everything is very abstract so you can also use it with any other te solution and you could even replace it by another let's say abstract third party by let's say a committee of secure multi-party computation um protocol users or something like this but of course as a very first example the trusted execution environment is just a great like abstract trusted third party to use here but like intel sgx is definitely the first one we are supporting yeah very cool is it just useful for handling balances or can you also do execution of smart contracts that's a very good question actually and the nice thing is you could quite easily offload a complete evm into into such an system like an sgx and then really operate like similar to optimistic rollups you can then really operate anything in the in the trusted enclave yeah so that's also definitely something we are going to look into in the near future um but of course for the hackathon it's uh we were happy enough within two weeks to get this whole thing running and on balances but yeah we were quite happy with the like uh whole performance and everything was running quite nicely already the proofs today for a ck uh vk snarks or zk roll ups it takes like 20 minutes for a normal cpu or computer to to create your new kit cryptography how like is it faster or how does it compare to existing zk roll ups yeah it's a good question so the main bottleneck really here is how fast can the trusted execution environment generate lo verify signatures and generate signatures so that's really the bottleneck here so let's say you take a modern intel cpu and you actually have many threads several threads in an enclave and then it actually could be like thousands of transactions that could be processed within this enclave so it's it really scales very very well um yeah so that's really the bottleneck there's there's to be fair a little caveat here so when you put something into an enclave you have a performance hit so it's not like it's exactly like a modern intel cpu it's a bit slower because for example we have to take extra care if this is to run in production for having side channel resistance so we can protect against the operator but in general this can still be very fast and also you don't need like super special hardware like i don't know for i don't know gpu uh uh speed up the zero knowledge proof or something but it's really like a one consumer types intel cpu and it could scale quite significantly already cool thanks congrats any any other comments or sebastian if you wanted to season it yeah i just wanted to add like this is uh it's like based on on very very recent research from from the technical university of darmfat so we're actually from a from a research group and doing a spin-off right now actually we're we're into channels so we are also the authors of the gopro framework but now we're also looking at other off-chain solutions because it's just very interesting and since our research group was working on this we just said hey let's just try to hack this for if online so this is why we even came up with a solution because before the papers even out so this is like really cutting edge research but yeah really looking forward where this is going i'm really excited to see you building this and like uh i think that really helps further the space so awesome i'll thanks sure to pass this on to liam i know he works with the state channels team uh he'll be interested to see that great that looks like time is up for this uh this presentation and actually the day as a whole um let me make sure we had a couple teams that were delayed okay they're now canceled so that means we are done done i want to thank everybody all the hackers who you know worked for the past month on their projects um it's been amazing to see them develop from the start we had you know idea validation sessions people who are unsure what they wanted to build and then they really committed to it in the second week and now we have some pretty amazing showcases um so i encourage you to all go to i'm not going to remember the url exactly but it's it's the eth online showcase where all the projects are listed so if you haven't had a chance go poke through there you can see what everybody else has been working on other people have shared in the discord and it's just a really great survey of the huge variety i know there's a big devi focus but we have other things like what we just saw this off chain scaling there's personal tokens all sorts of really interesting projects were built so um that is it for our session b eat online judging thank you again peter fernando linda um you guys are the ke a key part of this uh we couldn't do without the judges who donate their time so thank you uh the only thing i have left to share is um so we have one more session that we need to do before we can actually reach out to finalists so if your hacker still on the call and you're wondering oh my finalist uh we will reach out to you i think the latest by tomorrow so just keep an eye out on the discord and through email we'll probably reach out through email if you're a finalist and then we'll have some more instructions for friday which is the the big finale where we have the 10 finalists come present to uh another judging panel um on a live stream and then we'll also hear from sponsors for uh which projects they're awarding their prizes to on friday that starts at 12 and you should have received a calendar invite if you haven't um just reach out to an eath global team member in the slack and we'll get you added to that calendar invite so again friday at 12 noon uh it's going to be pretty awesome and then directly after that is our final online summit we've been having weekly summits every every friday in october so friday just after the hackathon finale is the uh ethereum's impact summit so we've got a bunch of great talks including a fireside chat with tyler collin and chuck buterin okay i'm done talking thank you everybody uh don't forget about friday we'll see you thank you guys bye-bye
