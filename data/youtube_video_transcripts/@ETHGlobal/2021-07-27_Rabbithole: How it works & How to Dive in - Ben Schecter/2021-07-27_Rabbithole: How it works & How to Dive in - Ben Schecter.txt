so i'm ben um the operations lead at rabbit hole um rabbit hole is a platform that guides users um for lack of a better upon going down the crypto rabbit hole um and helps them learn about how to use different crypto applications while earning uh crypto for for doing so um i'm here today to tell you about how we're enabling um the future of work so right now um crypto is exploding in interest um getting more and more mainstream traction publicity media coverage um and it's really great um but if you if you look down and you start digging into the details only a really tiny fraction of people are actually using uh crypto products and and d5 specifically um if we look at this chart there's almost 150 million ethereum addresses out there just under 50 million of them actually um hold ethereum and then um even a smaller percentage of that um are actually using the crypto products and the d5 products that are so important to the ecosystem if you look on ether scan they say that there's only about 200 to 300 000 daily active users right now um which is which is a problem um you know if if we want crypto to reach its full potential we need people using these products and we need people figuring out how to learn to get involved and to contribute and to to really start becoming crypto native users now even for people that want to use crypto products um it's really difficult to do so there's dozens of projects launching every week um millions of dollars flowing into the ecosystem whether that's uh through venture capital money or speculative um investments uh and and this creates a lot of noise um and as a result projects can't find the users that they're looking for and users are getting confused on where to start and if if we take a look at why this is happening the current system is not inducive for people to use and get involved the memes and all the focus are on speculation um that's going to perpetuate a certain a certain narrative and unfortunately people don't realize that um a lot of people don't even realize that there are applications to be used if you ask the average person um they think crypto is synonymous with currency they don't realize that there's actually applications like uniswap that you can be using um that are that sit at the basis of all this um hopefulness uh for the future of web3 moving past that even if you do want to get involved onboarding is scary crypto creates um a lot of a a lot of difficult situations for new users you have to figure out how to set up a wallet how to make sure that you're using um the right platforms how do you know if this is even a smart contract that you can that you can trust um it's a it's a big shift in having to take on the responsibility as a user that crypto gives to each user and and that can be tough for for new people that are looking to get involved and then from the project side acquiring users is highly inefficient and especially the right kind of users uh you know uh most of our acquisition channels that we typically go to are not crypto native you think about um ads or twitter um that's all based in the legacy web 2 system it's highly expensive and there's no real guarantee that those are going to even result in uh positive outcomes for your project so rabbit hole is trying to fix all this what we do is we create quests that users can complete quests are essentially time box challenges where we say if a user goes and completes a certain task or multiple tasks we will reward them with a projects token for doing so this solves the problems that we've been talking about in a two-sided way for projects we help them increase participation on their platforms and help them find the contributors that they're looking for for individuals we help them learn about use and onboard into crypto networks and all the while um they're earning crypto for doing so this is incredibly exciting where we've seen great results in i think especially where we're doing this in a crypto native way crypto web 3 in general opens up a number of new paradigms and possibilities for what we can do and we're tapping into those new possibilities for our solution um so we're paying people people are earning for learning and onboarding into these networks with projects native tokens we're using gnosis safe we are actually verifying that people complete the tasks that they say they do and we're using subgraphs on the graph to do so and then we have the issue of civil resistance it's the one of the things that people often think about is well how do you stop somebody from just continuously completing the tasks and collecting all the rewards well we actually use bright id for proof of a unique human so that we know that all rewards are paid out to actually unique individuals and we've only launched six or seven months ago but in december but since then we've delivered a some really exciting and impactful results for some of the biggest projects in crypto over 10 000 individual addresses have completed a task on rabbit hole we've distributed over a hundred thousand dollars in rewards and just to give a a bit more of a sense of what we can actually do for a project i'll highlight the recent quest we did with pool together which wrapped up about two weeks ago so pull together for those who don't know is a no loss lottery uh platform what that means is you deposit into pool together's pools um which is essentially functions as a savings account um but you're entered into a lottery so that every week or two weeks someone wins a large chunk of cash pool together had a pool that you know was not necessarily as big as some of their other pools on polygon layer 2 ethereum solution and so they wanted to drive new users to deposit into their polygon usdt pool we worked with pool together to design a quest to do this and we drove a greater than a 300 increase in unique depositors in this pool which is a very substantial accomplishment this in turn when these users were rewarded for doing this quest increase the number of pull together token holders by over 12 which in our opinion will have really strong um impact on their community longer term so these are the types of things that we're really excited about delivering for both projects and users and we look forward to doing more of in the future obviously we're here at the uniswap summit so wanted to give everybody a sneak peek of a quest that we have that will be launching in the next week or two we're not sure on the exact date yet so you'll have to stay up to date on our twitter or if you want join our discord uh for updates uh on this quest but we will be partnering with uniswap to run a quest where we incentivize users for doing two tasks one make a swap on the uniswap platform um for any token and then to provide liquidity into any token pair um on the unispot platform so we're really excited to be partnering with unifop on this um and and really we view this as just the start of a much longer term partnership um as you know the rabbit hole platform grows and evolves and really as uniswap's needs evolve over time we look forward to to being able to work together and incentivizing a number of different actions which we will get into a bit more shortly so this is just the start right now we're using quest to incentivize users um to participate and contribute to crypto networks at a really early stage um but soon uh rabbit hole will be your on-chain resume so if we take a step back and and we think about what quests are fundamentally doing really we're we're taking an on-chain action verifying that it occurred and then rewarding people um for doing it and and credentialing it and enshrining that it actually happened when you think about a quest this way it becomes clear that there's so many more possibilities for for what you can do with this this type of process really what we're talking about here is building a foundational level of reputation where we're able to verify actions that took place credential them and make them legible and composable all across the ecosystem which is incredibly ambitious and something that's never been done before but it speaks to the the amazing capabilities that are enabled by um web3 so it's the first step in that direction we will soon be launching launching skills on our on our platform so what skills are if you if you think about quest quests are time box challenges where users come to our platform and have a certain amount of time to complete a task and get rewarded for it skills are now going to be evergreen tasks that users can come to rabbit hole and complete and earn an on-chain credential which shows that they know how to do something they've mastered a certain um action and that they're able to then use to represent that they know this to the outside world that's really cool not necessarily in a vacuum but specifically the things that you can do with this this is going to unlock very unique opportunities that are that we're really excited about so for one if you think about token distributions um when a project is new they're trying to distribute tokens to their user base or i should say who they think is their user base and they don't really have a good way of doing this right now most projects use retroactive airdrops but these aren't particularly targeted they cast a very wide net and there's no way of knowing if those tokens are going to the right people our sense is that they're mostly going to people who care a lot more about speculation than the actual communities so we see a path where rabbit hole can help uh different projects with token distributions and that they'll distribute tokens to a user after they have verified that they've provided value to the actual platform or network or community on the other hand the quest that we're still doing will be able to enhance their power and their abilities as we continue to build out the platform if you think about how skills can work into quests you can only open up quests to certain people who have a specific skill so for uniswap um you might only want uh people participating that are expert liquidity providers so that you can help filter and service the right people for your platform so a bit more on the specifics of what is actually possible um with an on-chain resume with the platform that rabbit hole is building um if if you're a platform who wants to do a token distribution um you know you could both filter for a certain type of person and based on their actions so you could only open up your token distribution to expert yield farmers who have both deposited and staked on your platform that helps you verify that these people are actually one the right people that you want in your platform and two that they've actually helped and provided value that they such that they deserve to be rewarded with your token um two let's say you're a platform that is um your your community has been a bit quiet as of late and you really want to increase the activity that's ongoing in the governance process you could use a rabbit hole quest to attract people who have been verified as protocol protocol politicians meaning these are people that have that we've verified as having created and passed governance proposals in communities and you could use a rabbit hole quest to attract them to your community so in this way um rabbit hole and the system we're creating is really poised to become a talent and reward allocation mechanism for the larger web3 space but that's a extremely difficult vision to uh to execute on and not only that it's one that's pretty foundational and uh creates a lot of dependencies for others in the ecosystem and we believe that's the type of vision that's best to be decentralized there's a lot of questions that we have to answer internally before we do that we have to figure out how to move a lot of our manual work right now into smart contracts we have to figure out how to maintain quality and a certain level of work with the the quest system and the things that the core team is doing right now but we are really excited because we just announced the first step in this decentralization process and we're calling that the pathfinder program so through the pathfinder program we are starting to involve external contributors in our core function of creating and executing on tasks so there's four ways to get involved in our pathfinder program you can be a steward which is someone who goes to communities creates proposals and hopefully is involved in the entire governance process to pass proposals to approve rabbit hole quest you can be a navigator which deploys subgraphs on the graph which enables rabbit hole to query data this the subgraph is how we verify that people take actions uh complete certain actions and we can't verify if there's a verify in action if there's no subgraph so this is an extremely pivotal role in allowing us to create new quests we have the craftsman role which is a role to design nfts that can be awarded as trophies to users who complete quests the the craftsman role we're really excited about because it can further enhance the rewards that we're providing to users and really strengthen our community and then the the pioneers um which will create content that guide users through completing the quest if you think back to the early part of this talk um starting to use crypto products and applications is a really scary process and we want to provide the necessary content and guardrails that are necessary such that people can use new new applications with confidence big picture vision though this is also enhancing our main goal of further immersing more and more people in the more and more users and contributors in the web3 world so if you think about what we're doing first we are creating quests for which that we are receiving a fee in a project's governance token that enables us to become a governance delegate in different communities across the crypto ecosystem what we'd like to do with this governance voice is to be an advocate for the users and contributors that we're creating our product for it's hard for users and contributors to have much of a voice simply because it to have a bigger voice you need to own more and more governance tokens um and that's not easy for the average person to do so rabbit hole hopes that with as we do more and more quests and we gain more and more governance uh tokens that we can be the voice for the users and contributors in the larger community then over time as we decentralize into a dow this power then gets transferred over to the stewards of the rabbit hole network who are the actual users and contributors themselves this enables them to get further involved in governance to further advocate for themselves and to help design the web3 world that they would like to see and be a part of which is incredibly exciting for us so thank you for for attending and listening if you're interested in being part of a quest earning crypto for learning building your on-chain
