everybody thanks for joining and today's workshop is with g from circle and the workshop is how to build a modern payments experience for your nft marketplace um and with that i will pass thanks for joining and today's workshop is with g from certain sorry about that there was a bit of like an echo there but yeah let me pass it over to g and he'll take over the workshop cool thank you um i'm guessing everyone can hear me fine quick nod i think so okay um okay hi everyone um i hope you're all having a great day so far i know it's been an early set of workshops for people on the west coast like me my name is ji chuang and i'm a product manager at circle i oversee the development of our apis and today i'm going to walk you through how you can leverage it leverage our services and build a modern payments experience for your nft product or marketplace so i'm sure with the audience we have here today we've all seen and witnessed over the last several months nft is really going mainstream we've seen nba top shot get a tremendous amount of media attention we've seen well-known artists and musicians put out great nfg content we've also seen large companies celebrities and athletes respond very quickly to the recent surge in interest i think it was just yesterday i saw news about charmander toilet paper company had toilet paper themed nst art i think they called it nftp um but i think luckily i saw that the proceeds are primarily benefiting charity so i see that as a good thing um you know building interest but you know benefiting people in need so i mean while some some people are treating this as like a marketing opportunity and perhaps they're trying to make a quick buck i think a lot of others including most of you here see the longer term value around nfts and are looking to build a product or service with long-term value and at circle we think that part of that long-term success comes with having a very seamless user experience and in our particularly particular case um around payments so my goal today here is to hopefully nudge you toward letting us join you along for that ride so first a little bit of intro about circle and what we do uh you probably know about uscc um where the it's the world's leading fully reserved regulated stable coin um along with coinbase circle is a founding member member of the center consortium and we developed and launched usdc in 2018. we've seen you know similar to nft's tremendous growth over the last year and as of this morning we find ourselves approaching close to 10 billion usdc in circulation another thing we do and kind of the focus of the talk today is that we also help companies leverage usdc and blockchain in general to create really flexible and powerful payment solutions for their online businesses so as you'll see through the rest of this talk we help companies bridge the on-chain ecosystem with traditional banking um giving your company and your customers a lot of flexibility when it comes to how they want to transact a great example that showcases our apis at work is deeper labs and recently they're very successful product nba top shop so if you guys are like me you've probably made countless attempts waiting in line for nba top shot pack drops i believe there's one in two hours hopefully you've made it through a few times and if you have you've likely gone through their circle powered checkout process so if you've ever used a credit or debit card to buy an nba topshop pack or moment if you've ever used your credit card or debit card to top up your dapper wallet balance then you've used circles apis indirectly so using our apis dapper labs has built their entire checkout flow um on top of crypto native infrastructure customers card payments settle to them as usdc which allows dapper to use those funds in very very flexible ways before getting into a few sample flows of our api i think it'd be helpful to introduce the api at a high level and explain why i think it fits very naturally into nft products both today and into the future so if you're participating in this hackathon your end product is likely an nft or an nft type of product or marketplace that token is of course native to the blockchain and so it inherits all of the benefits of being on chain that we're all familiar with um in the ideal future world we all hope to see sooner rather than later payments hopefully are all fully crypto native too we're not quite there today but even today for your customers who already do hold usdc and are kind of crypto savvy circles apis allow you to process on-chain payments and payouts that settle within minutes payments are as we all know irreversible once sent so there's no such thing as chargeback risk and that perfectly mirrors how you would transfer nfps as well once you send it once someone receives it you know you can't you can't you can't get it back and lastly because our payments are denominated in usd through usdc you can combine the benefits of all this powerful on-chain payment infrastructure with a consumer-friendly way to price things marketplaces do price eath do price things in each sometimes and i think that works really well for certain crypto savvy audiences but for a mass-market product like nba top shot for example i think usd pricing is going to be much more widely both by buyers and sellers so before we reach a future state you know where everyone has usbc everyone has ethereum wallets we need to make sure that we play nice with existing rails as well so along with unchained usdc payments circle also supports a variety of traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards ach transfers and wire payments with more coming soon so with a single integration with our apis you can serve both your crypto savvy users as well as mainstream audiences and we think that providing this type of optionality for your users is very subtle but it's a super important part of a great user experience that we talked about earlier so we're going to jump in a little bit to circle apis so first along with a few other resources we have in the apis payments payouts and wallets are sort of the core building blocks of the api payments are what we call the incoming transactions you'll see either from your users and buyers or from your own deposits from your own funding sources payouts are when you send funds off the circle platform so that's when you pay out sellers or vendors or when you wish to withdraw your own earnings your own money wallets finally are a core part of our subset of our api is called digital dollar accounts and what they allow you to do is build out a digital wallet infrastructure for your business and we'll touch on that more in a couple minutes so we can start off with a really simple payments flow here um where a buyer purchases a product with their credit card and at a later time the seller withdraws that usd that usdc to their bank account so jumping into the api uh implementation i've sort of kind of redacted some of the requests and responses just for for brevity here um but you know creating a card is super simple you make a request to our card's endpoint you pass in encrypted card number details and what you get back is essentially a resource an id that points to that visa card in this instance using that save card making a payment is also super easy you pass in the id of the card that you just created you pass in the amount in this case 50 what you get back is a payment object with an id uh the status initially is pending um what we need to do you know is reach out to the bank reach out to the card network make sure the the credit card is good make sure there's sufficient funds and everything but within a few minutes you'll typically see um through web hooks that we have set up that a payment has been confirmed so you'll receive a payment confirmation to a you know web hook notifications url that you set up with us will ping you whenever a payment reaches or changes state so in this case you'll see that the status is confirmed what that means and what and that typically happens you know soon after payment is that the card is good the funds are good it doesn't quite mean that we've settled the money with you yet but it's going to succeed and so at that point you have confidence that you know you can release the nft item you can process the payment you can credit your user's balance a couple days later i believe it's maybe three or four business days later you'll see a separate event coming through web hooks that says that payment has settled settlement means that not only was the card charge successful but you've now been credited that amount of usd along with all the other payments that happened that day into your circle account so once settlement happens or either i mean even before settlement happens at any point you can check the balance of your account in this case if we remember the previous charge was for fifty dollars after you receive settlement and you query your balance you may see that you now have fifty dollars available um let's say yesterday or the day before you had another charge come in for twenty dollars that hasn't quite settled yet you'll also be able to see the amount that's currently unsettled so any amount that's available here is something that you can withdraw through fiat rails on chain et cetera so once you have those 50 let's say you want to pay out to a bank account um i kind of skipped over one step here which is creation and linking of an of a bank account in this case an ach account so we have an integration with plaid as some of you you know might be familiar with their services it allows you to take a user's like bank account information with them authenticating with their financial institution let's say it's chase or wells fargo or bank of america it's all done in a very secure way where neither you nor us have to touch their bank credentials they log in through plaid typically there's a two-factor two-step authentication process and we get a token you get a token that allows us to fetch their bank account and routing information and with that information we can validate you know that the bank account is correct that it's owned by the right person and then we can start to make payments and payouts from that account so here i'm assuming that's all been done already um you have an ach account that's linked you provide the wallet that you had fifty dollars on here i missed wrote 300 you probably don't have 300 based on the example that we have but if you were to withdraw 50 right now to that bank account you would see um you know a created payout object below that status is pending for ach payouts on our side it's typically the fact that you'll see funds available in your bank account as soon as the next business day similar to payments you'll get a webhook notification when that status of that that payout moves to completed so if some of your sellers or yourself don't necessarily want to pay out to a bank account another option is to pay out on chain so in this case instead of a destination being an ach account it's a blockchain type of destination you pass in your ethereum address you specify the chain you specify the chain because usdc is supported on a handful i think four to four different chains at the moment so you specify the chain and the address and then you specify the amount it deducts that amount from your wallet and similarly you receive a payout object that payout object looks slightly different from a a regular payout to a bank account in that it has a transaction hash you can check that on ether scan similarly the status is pending after i think maybe 12 or so block confirmations that status will flip to complete you can monitor the transaction hash you can set up webhooks either way you'll be notified when the payment has been received the payout has been received so that's a simple flow from you know one buyer to one seller they paid with their credit card the seller withdrew through their bank account or through usdc from there you can you can build out additional functionality and i talked about the wallets and the digital dollar accounts a little bit earlier so what that product does is digital dollar accounts handle your wall infrastructure you can create wallets for all your users whether your user is a buyer or your user as a seller essentially you create a wallet you attribute it to them what we've seen and i'll touch on this in a little bit is that giving users balances as opposed to just using saved cards improves the stickiness once they have a balance they feel like they need to use it and then they stay on the site longer topping up a balance is as simple as making any sort of payment they can use their card or bank or directly send in usdc if they have it what we've also seen is that you know when you have a payment flow when you have a checkout flow it doesn't ask someone for their credit card or doesn't ask someone for their cvv or doesn't ask someone to authorize an ach payment you can get a really really simple one-click checkout solution so i think the funny thing i was interested in last night was like i was writing this up and i was like oh you know wallets and balances can make your app super sticky because people carry value with them at the same time it makes your checkout flow super smooth they don't have to enter payment details they see their balance one click checkout so we can walk through a little bit how you would do that the wallets endpoint very similar in ease of use to our payments payouts and and bank accounts endpoints you just create a bank account you create a wallet here um you specify a description for it that's just for internal purposes we return a wallet id here with a balance initially set to zero so now you can take this wallet id four three four zero zero zero or whatever it is attribute it to a user on your side whether it's a buyer whether it's a seller or someone else that's now just kind of a an object that can store value to receive funds let's say in this case one of your customers has existing usdbc on ethereum you can request a deposit address so you pass in the wallet id you ask for an address and we return you a ethereum address that will credit this wallet when usdc is received since this is sort of a push payment where your end user your buyer or seller is initiating an erc20 send on their side similarly we will give you web hook notifications whenever a wallet that you own has received usdc and it's been confirmed so now in this case you imagine you've created a wallet for a buyer they funded that wallet with usdc so now they have a balance on your site transferring their their payment transferring their their um balance part of their balance to another user in this case a seller is also very fast and very very um instant so all you need to do is specify the source and the destination in this case the source might be your buyer and your destination might be your seller so you pass in you know those two objects you pass in an amount and unlike the credit card and the ach payments that you know go through pending for a couple days before their final transfers from wallace to wallets are instant so from there you can sort of imagine how you could build out a much more complex marketplace product you can have you know many buyers with stored value in their balances paying through any fiat or crypt or crypto means that they need they can transact with any seller and those sellers can similarly be paid out in crypto be paid out in fiat however they need things to happen um a very great example here again is with dapper labs so beyond the initial sale of a crypto kitty or topshop pack buyers and sellers can also connect on their marketplace to transact in a more peer-to-peer fashion so buyers can buy from any seller and additionally they have choice when it comes to their payment method for the sellers on top shop marketplace for example they can keep their funds on dapper maybe they're a buyer as well or they can also withdraw their funds on chain or to an external ustc wallet or to their bank account so and hopefully that has given you like a good overview of our apis so as you're thinking out as you're thinking about building out your nft product or marketplace you know over this weekend over you know the next several months and as you think about needing to create a flexible payments experience for your customers hopefully you think of us we'll help you bridge the crypto and fiat worlds will help you give your buyers and sellers choice and will also handle your wallet infrastructure for all parties involved hopefully this frees you up to really focus on building out the rest of your experience and creating that long-term value that we talked about so thanks for watching i hope you all learned a little bit about our circle apis if you are building something this weekend visit our sandbox link above and get access to api keys you can start your integration today if you've got questions we've got api references and guides at developer.circle.com or you can find me and other members of our team at the sponsor hashtag counseling sponsor circle channel on the east global discord server and lastly you know just personally i think this is a super interesting space i think it's super early what we're seeing today is really just a glimpse of what nfts could become over the next several years and i wish you all the best of luck during the hackathon this weekend thanks thanks so much g that was really great um yeah incredible presentation i see there's one or two uh questions in the chat um i can read the first one out which is is circle like a stripe for crypto you could say that um i think we similarly try to make payments super simple for your company we definitely have a focus on being crypto native um that's the direction we see things going and so we're always going to be you know moving very quickly on that front um additionally um and i think stripe may as well we have a lot of treasury products live and in the works where you know you can store your usdc you can make good use of it as well so i think there's definitely similarities but we have a really really strong focus on you know supporting companies that are building products or services unchained great um and the next question is from isaac i'm not sure if you want to unmute yourself and ask g the question live otherwise i can also read that out sure can the user wallets that circle generates be used to interact with any arbitrary smart contract um the wallets that you create for circle accounts are not they're on chain in the sense that you can create deposit addresses for them and they understand erc 20 cents um but the address or the wallet itself is not necessarily a smart contract that'll you know naturally plug into other functionality so we we generally you know over time as we need to interact with other protocols let's say will certainly add functionality on top of the wallet but the wallet itself is kind of like a you can think of it as a centralized wallet but we'll add functionality on top of it over time so i don't see too many things that wouldn't be possible i guess the root of my question is like today if i generated a user account could i and someone buys in the rc721 can i send that to their circle wallet address like i think you could send it i'll have to check with our engineering team and if you hop into the discord server i can make sure you know i get a good answer for you i don't believe today that the contracts that we deploy for your deposit address will properly be able to handle non-erc20 so it might be the case that it's there um but it's stuck so i can try to find someone on our team to really make sure you get the the answer to that okay thanks cool and then there's a question that came in from youtube which is can i exchange a token for usdc or die the circle wallets and their deposit addresses only today understand and they can all receive any erc20 token um i want to make sure i don't say that you can or should send any other unsupported erc20 token today but it is built in a general way where it receives erc20 tokens and so over time as we find the need to support any any assets beyond usdc we certainly have that capability but today our product isn't meant to kind of receive and honor and represent back to you tokens other than usdc okay cool um as if anybody else has a question feel free to unmute yourself and ask live or drop a question if you're a bit shy yeah um i have a question um i just want to start off saying like circle seems like an amazing product so super cool to learn more about it um one question i had is like i know crypto payments are like once you send it you can't get your money back so what if you like i'm kind of curious to know in this like uh fiat and like crypto dynamic what if somebody like disputes their credit card statement like who takes a liability there ultimately the merchant which is our customer in this case so we do you know experience chargebacks after the fact after you know four business days after usdc has been minted um and it's ultimately our customers responsibility to you know have funds to handle chargebacks in the cases we've seen because of the vetting we do on our customers you know we generally on board you know companies with you know strong business use cases and there is the possibility that we need to take uscc back um you're right that we can't do that on an unchained fashion but the usdc that settles with our customers and their circle accounts it is backed by usdc that's on chain but we can and we do need to be able to kind of take that back and then we burn the usdc that was backing that if that answers your your question yeah that makes sense cool and then another question from youtube is do you expect to support other stable coins at any point such as usdt ust etc or will things stay with usdc as you are involved with the development of it i wouldn't say you know never say never but i think our focus is definitely on um building out the uscc ecosystem we have you know strong reasons to think that you know the way we're implementing stable coins is a very um you know long-term strategic approach as for other stable coins outside of usd i think certainly um so you know whether it's you know euro australian dollar singapore dollar any other you know large market not necessarily a large market but any any global currency that's a stable coin um i could see that happening over time um as for other usd denominated currencies i'm not sure cool um thanks so much g if there are no other questions can i ask can i ask one more um i guess one thing i was also curious about was if i like create a circle account do i have to sign up as a company um so like in this nft hack i'm like gonna be just hacking solo so i'm just wondering like what how that would work especially like i know with like using braintree you usually have to like put in your company's like tax statements or whatever so just curious how that would work yeah so ultimately if you want to go live um it struggles not really meant for you know personal use it's not kind of like a kind of like a regional commercial product like that what you can do and what everyone should do um this weekend is use our sandbox so if you go to my dashtandbox.struggle.com you can sign up um it may or may not say you know business name but those are not fields that we need to kind of run through for you know the typical flow when we're on boarding like a production customer so if you go through sandbox and you operate in the sandbox environment it's completely self-serve you can get api skis you know within minutes and you can start start hacking um as you approach you know wanting to go live um i think that's when you reach out and then we'll work with you to get you onboarded um properly cool thanks g um are there any more questions from anybody on the call i'll just double check youtube no questions there cool um yeah as g mentioned you can always reach um them in the sponsor circle channel in discord um if you have any other questions and thanks so much g for the great presentation and thanks everybody for joining thank you
