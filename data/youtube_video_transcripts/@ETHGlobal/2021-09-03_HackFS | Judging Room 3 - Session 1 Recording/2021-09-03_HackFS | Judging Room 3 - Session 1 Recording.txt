um welcome to hack fs uh hackafest features 650 hackers across 61 countries and 18 timezone the judging format will be four minutes for demos three minutes for questions and after the sixth team presents we'll have a ten minute break judging criteria the judging criteria will be based off of technicality originality practicality ui ux dx and wow factor just keep in mind that this is not a competition people are here to learn here text 4 was possible and not everybody is aiming to become businesses hackers are here to get feedback here are our judges adrian labaz uh east blockart and pernicer county needs real ventures and now for the demos up first we have team meta cards we'll start off with four minutes of demos and followed by three minutes of q a okay nice and thanks and we cannot share our video like uh not the camera but maybe just the screen must be enough um i think that's what we do uh which one's sharing the video i i'm sharing i will share the video okay this works sharing your works but not not the camera it's fine for you i can just share anyways it's okay okay cool then hey if global and welcome to our presentation of media cards v2 so we are living in the creator economy many people living from the youtube channels or from the newsletters discord servers and now it's time to bring the wall greater economy to tokens to the um yeah web free space so what we have right now are current solutions esd20s like extra roll or rally and we have custom nfts air 70 20s like yeah you have your custom custom-made nifties like the logan paul ones or the ones by gary vee the v-friends and um the problem with disadvantages are they're not personal enough they're just tokens in your wallet and yeah they can be maybe good for dows but if you are a creator you need something which you can show off in the wallet what your fans can really be more tangible so it can be watched in your own showcase in your wallet like the nft by logan paul but to creating them you need an artist who does it for you or you need a wall a system like uh reference like a website and concept behind it it's um for many people it's taking too much time so what's the simplest way and we're thinking here about gamification and using trading cards which people know as nfts in in the free world so let me introduce you to our free app which allows you to create your own trading card collection to unlock exclusive access for your fans and these are just three simple stamps so you enter your data your name picture collection name quantity price of the nft and later also twitter verification you mint on polygon network and we meant it through unlock protocols so you can also after this add a specific and token gated links like to your website or specific um discord channels um enable specific discord channels through the possession of nfts once you have done this you can share the link with your fans and they can mint what works so let's go to trimetercast.com our website and yeah seriously our amazing team um and we now click on button create we get to our to the app to the to the dap it needs to connect to a wallet i'm already connected to the matic network and now i just select an image so i select this one i say paul and then it's um 2021 and the collection name will be paul 2021 description will be exclusive access for my fans i have i will set it quantity to free and the price um very very low so it's just for testing but it's on the mainnet so it's real real money so yeah let's do this now we paid the fee now it's using nft storage um and i'm using unlock protocol to create we're connecting now the contract the metadata so we do this with a second transaction now you can see my cards are created so here is the link which you can share with a fans to buy basically mint nft and here is the link where you can configure the whole thing in the unlock protocol just log in with your wallet i'm already logged in and here you can see the collection you can see the there are three keys basically three nfts people can mint and here you can add the functionality basically put a link behind it or you can integrate this scoreboard so now i just click on mint it's success so this is how it looks like and now i have a valid nft and i can see it of course on polygon scan so i just see it it's a new token i have 23 seconds ago here it is and also later i will be able to see it on my open c inside my profile and also trade it here so this is all thank you very much for attention and looking forward to hear your feedback so okay this is it um yeah i would like to hear your feedback and uh yeah i still cannot open the video for you guys but yeah i can just talk with you okay um team metacards thanks for your presentation now you'll be moving on to three minutes of q a if you want to go first uh sure yeah so super cool uh so cool presentation uh i'd love to see um people get get more social elements in into nfts but uh yeah curious as to um why you feel like these these would be trading cards per se and why um these these would want um rather if you french seen people essentially um use use this mechanic to kind of um yeah it's essentially kind of used use this mechanic in in in the uh the nfd space so i am yeah just kind of curious about what what um creative element is this brings when when you kind of look at um a creator in that regard yeah sure um so basically this is a gamification approach here so we're using the trading card metaphor because it's something people already know from the from the normal world and they trade it and they know okay all the football stars they have a trading card and of course when you think about this all the new stars will be the creators so why not having the the trading cards of the creators and you already have them like there are collections and the um projects which are like sauria right does it the the nfts for for the football players but here is this we change it and say okay you as a creator can win your own trading cards there's not a company doing it for you you do it yourself and your fans already know how to how these trading cards and fts operate so basically it's a very easy access to just basically in simpler representation and long term the idea is also to have it not as a static image but as a 3d model indeed so it's like really um like um i can actually show show you how it looks like um yeah that's cool awesome hey serge good to see you again yeah it's super nice uh hi hi adrian i had the idea already in kernel yeah thoroughly a quick question i remember seeing mata cards uh from some previous hackathons as well right so i'm wondering um was there something uh i guess unique they did during hacker fest yeah definitely yeah yeah so once we we did an mvp like a rinkybee it was like many months ago so it's really different to this time it's really using this unlocked protocol because we did some interviews and people said okay what's the functionality behind it and i said okay let's use it to unlock um some content so and also we're using uh now polygon network because no one wanted to pay the ethereum fees so this is basically the big change and yeah we rebuilt the world ui basically so we haven't used anything from from before it was more like a proof of concept so we're trying to iterate you know every every heck of fun a little bit more a little bit better this is the iterative approach which we chose so yeah this is these are the new things and yeah we're using ft storage of course um for them for the nfts i guess last question is it live on mainnet already it's what is it live and may not yeah it's the polygon mainnet so if you go out to trymetacars.com you can use it right now what we will do after the presentations and stuff we will do some more like fixes to like when your image is not like the proper size and stuff that looks better but basically when you when you have the proper proper size you can basically just go right now mint your own collection call it adrian de bras and say a quantity of hundred cards and you will have them on polygon if i can i have seen one minute more maybe i can share a share here's obviously this is how they look like on openc so this is mainnet and this blockchain polygon and then you have your card here and you can basically also sell it and trade it once it's loaded and maybe if i can just jump in here so basically the way it's implemented right now is it just checks what network you have selected in um your metamask and then based on that it just like chooses the network and also updates the ui any updates you have on the um on the dashboard side or any any particular social links or um things that you might want to include for the creators well you you can have you can have all the all the functionality from unlock protocol basically and you can hide like either urls or wordpress or like like everything they have here or would you mean something else yeah essentially all of the the uh support for the plugins in that sense for um for blogs or um yeah a wordpress sensor or other like so to speak in in terms of whether people like to publish stuff um yeah so for now we're just using the the functionality from from from the unlock protocol and uh later of course you will see how we can um also integrate uh more now from our own side right so this is this is the plan and maybe to use like my last few seconds i just wanted to quickly show you like how how this um how this template looks like in 3d so basically once the cards once we have our vision complete um this is how the cars would look like but this is a long way to go there nice nice hey awesome work man and hard to see with the credible yeah thank you very much guys and yeah well thank you if global that you can work here on it during the hackathon great work team meta cards okay now the zoom admin will demote you to an attendees where you could choose whether you want to hop off the call or continue watching the judging session okay uh up next we have team atlantis world uh i think they're already in so yeah uh atlantis world you'll have uh four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a all right guys yeah thank you so much i will share my screen right away and i'm also joined by uh my tech lead michael and julio our game developer hello everybody oh there's no audio oh um uh sorry to interrupt but i think you need to present with audio okay my mistake sorry guys no that's fine hi everybody thank you so much uh for joining us here i can't wait to share with you everything that we've been working on over the last couple of weeks with our fantastic team of hackers uh hackerfest and we actually started to build a virtual world where you can live work play and earn um so what we kind of identified is that existing virtual worlds uh can be difficult to load because they have a kind of 3d and immersive focus there's no talking getting and also there's no defy so what does that mean basically virtual worlds right now are inaccessible um because in order to have a seamless loading experience you need to go out and buy the latest ipad or gaming pc token gating is limited to platforms like discord and also because we're not implementing uh d5 protocols in a funding gamified we're inside of virtual worlds we really believe that we're missing out on a key onboarding opportunity of the space as a whole so we're building the first lightweight metaverse enabling interactive talking gated community spaces powered by gamified d5 how exactly does it look so we built a 2d pixel metaverse that's lightweight inside of the web browser we've started to gamify the discord kind of chatter and connectivity experience and we began implementing leading d5 protocols uh starting with with ave in a fun and gamified way um so how exactly does it work we built the game using phaser um we stored all of our game assets securely on chain using ipfs and built a front end for easily adding new assets and modifying the metadata of existing ones we integrated the morales api for wallet connect and talking gating we started to allow our users to interact with the rv protocol and made use of their subgraph we launched everything on matic mainnet i mean widget that links through to audience um i was joined by a fantastic team of hackers starting with michael uh in seoul who led the tech side uh sega in mumbai and dimitri uh in the czech republic led the blockchain and went through development side and julio over in seattle did an excellent job on the game development front uh so thanks so much guys i'm sure they will look forward to joining you uh a live presentation and anyways let's get over to the demo right away so basically i'm going to log in with metamask here and then every single game asset that you see is actually stored securely on chain using ipfs in the bottom here is the widget so that users can play songs of their choice in the background and over here we have the decentral band building um now this is where we started to uh implement the rv protocol um but in the future we're actually gonna do this in a much more fun and gamified way right where users can actually walk into the central bank building uh walk over to the rv desk and see like a pixel dashboard uh all these live kind of interest rates and price speeds uh we're gonna test out a little deposit here anyways just so that you can see uh how it works so as you can see here uh an additional die has been deposited uh and converted to an air token in my wallet so that right now i've directly interacted with the ave protocol uh from inside of atlantis and i will start an interest uh on that die um so that's fantastic yeah that's everything guys thank you so much uh also an additional point to add is that not only do we start all of the kind of metadata for the game assets on ipfs but in the game we're actually loading them directly from ipfs as well all right um thanks for the presentation now we're going to q a three minutes um that looks amazing congratulations it's really great thank you so much adrian thank you so much uh i guess one question that i had it's more like an open question um there's a lot of like moving parts here which i think are super exciting especially integrating like a game engine uh without this uh was was there like any technical challenge that you faced during period that was like an interesting challenge or maybe like a cool integration solution that you think could be made into like uh its own library maybe yeah i'd love it michael wanted to yeah sure uh so we built everything on phaser and then we had to integrate all those libraries like other protocol like audios to phaser itself and the most challenging and the recent one was audios because they have their kind of virtual player uh their kind of widgets that we can we could integrate as html web page we wanted to create something like it will be like uh really with phasor code so we basically made our own widget in game it took us some time because audios is not perfect some songs are not loading uh not loading all the time so we also have to check for each song if it's loaded and stuff so it's mainly fight with audios uh audible sorry audible oh yeah was really easily implemented with more or less api so it was really great that's amazing and yeah definitely i can see a cool plugin there for audios congratulations yeah later you'll actually be able to log in use your audios account and listen something library uh i i don't know if you guys checked out the the the game sdk that um chainsafe put out um to kind of get in unity elements in that might might be something that that you guys might want to kind of think about or just display around with but yeah like this this looks awesome really uh equal uh landscape and that's done um thank you thank you very much um other other game developers or how are you going to see people um shaping up the gameplay as it were yeah sure so i think we have like a kind of continued focus on like making those d5 integrations a lot more fun and actually gamified right so the other integration that we have right now is kind of basic and it's just like a ui opens and then you can kind of exit for us we actually want to create this gamified experience that can actually smoothen the kind of onboarding experience into d5 because users can interact with with those kind of protocols in a gamified way that's engaging that's educational and down the line we also plan to launch a web3 academy so that not only can users interact with these protocols in a gamified way but they can also do so with certain learning modules and without putting any actual funds at risk that's pretty cool and then we'd also love to add you know like other game elements like mini games uh for example we're keen to integrate in-game down voting so you can see on the demo like if you go to our submission page you can click through to the live link you'll see like a town hall style building there what we want to do is take the kind of dao kind of voting experience from how it is right now to meeting in a talking gay discord video call and then exiting to an external platform like our house you want to put that experience inside of a private and exclusive talk engagement which is next in atlantis so you'll meet because we're keen to also integrate video and audio calling so you'll meet with your dal members inside of your top of gate atlantic's world space uh you'll deliberate on the future of the project and then without having to exit somewhere external you can in a gamified way wander on over inside of the town hall building and engage in that voting and proposal making right there in like an actual gamified sense so maybe you walk for example to the left side of the room if you want to vote yes and maybe you walk to the right side of the room if you want to vote no so it's this whole kind of immersive experience but in 2d uh that's super engaging i guess the last coin for me is like i think what's really special about this um the collaborative element right like since it's like an actual game world you can see mutual participants you know maybe there's like 10 people currently at the ave shop or something like that right and i think that's social element yeah absolutely so what we really want to do is like gamify that discord experience like and take chatter for web 3 and crypto projects we're from discord and into this fun game environment that's actually personalized to them very cool guys congrats thank you man thanks so much for your time thank you very much guys yeah great job team atlantis world and now the zoom admin will demote you to attendees where you could either keep watching or you can leave the zoom call yeah okay nah wow uh up next we have team neburi they'll have four minutes for the for the presentations and then three minutes for the q a hi guys it's steve nabari yeah uh team number you will be next okay hey siri upload to web3 that's how simple nabari is but before we show you the magic let us tell a bit more about it we all love to share every single minute we upload 45 000 instagram photos we watch over 4 million youtube videos and we tweet over 400 000 times data storage is one of the main focuses of web3 while achieving great ux is one of its main challenges we molded these two concepts into our product nabari nabari is a ui less storage bridge between ios and ipfs falcoin it's designed to stimulate overall web3 adoption by using seamless ios integrations such as siri and shortcuts it's built on top of the exceptional foundation crafted by the application research group estuary i think that's enough for the talking let's go to gilliam to see a short demo enjoy all right first we head over to nabari.com download the ios shortcut from apple's icloud and add it to the shortcuts app then activate the app by saying hey siri upload to web3 it will open your gallery and ask you to select one or multiple photos or videos that you'd like to share here you make your selection and click add in the top right and just like that your media is being uploaded to ipfs ready to be shared in seconds a browser window will automatically open with a gallery of your selection and here you can either share the whole gallery by copying the url or copying individual photo by clicking the copy image url button since nebari creates a shareable url it is cross-platform and can be opened on any device on any browser as seen here on a desktop environment where we view the gallery or an individual photo that was shared with us and that's how nabarro works in a nutshell thanks for viewing listening from me gillian freya and my partner ryan shaheen wishing you a great day thanks everyone thanks jimmy aka cake for the astori invite have a great day um thanks for the presentation team nabari now we'll be moving on to the three minutes of q a it was a it was a really cool uh presentation good job folks to clarify uh most of the work is around a shortcut workflow right there is no swift uh or native app involved right oh no so for us to create the bridge in a ui less way so directly from siri the quickest way was to create a shortcut so we could have made a native app but there was no reason to so we were really looking for the most simple way and the most accessible way as well because shortcuts are open source by default when you download them from icloud you can actually see what's happening and you can see all the requests and you can see how the data how the data is being handled so that's also a benefit of using shortcuts nice very cool cool stuff though um in in that sense uh i mean yeah like storages is something that that we've always had um yeah issues in terms of making this this accessible and i forgot um how how are you basically thinking about associating um i guess accounts if one might bother that with but although the files that you kind of basically can pinpoint the service to are you thinking of introducing permissioning at any point in time where you know you basically have users files that are accessible um by them or groups of people um yeah just curious about how you're going to see the future going ahead i think that's a that's a great question um i don't know gilliam if you would like to fill them fill in on this one yeah yeah well to be honest we kind of approach this by not integrating any authentication especially when well we we started off by saying when you integrate metamask for example the average user doesn't even know about metamask or know how to use it so the simplest way to get this in the hands of the public would be the way we've implemented it right now by making it public as long as you have the shareable url and as far as authentication in the future maybe making it persistent and allowing users to view their past shared images for example or galleries that's not something we have decided on implementing just yet but it is maybe something we can think about uh while keeping the ux uh flow i guess uh simple for the average user to use so that's kind of a challenge for the future yeah so to add a little bit more on that it we could um store private keys inside the shortcut in that way we could use some form of ethereum account and and data could be stored on on public public keys but then you're handling private keys um yeah so you're sending your private key to a certain server which handles all the uh the back-end work um you don't have a such a server service on your ios device so that's kind of well are you sending your private keys to the api sir who would you do that and for for for that for now the answer is that's not too smart yeah um one last con question for me if you had more time or i guess after the hackathon ends do you have any plans on uh where to take the project or would you have added any additional features i think i can take this from i think as far as the the front end ui like the gallery you you see and the images um currently we're allowing photos and just general media to be uploaded um and to be seen on the gallery and i think in the future if we expand on that that feature and making it more rich except for instead of just being able to share the url uh for example adding a native share button to share directly with your contacts or adding to it by making other file formats available too so expanding on the the gallery uh ui front end i guess is is the next steps for making it uh a bit more usable uh yeah oh that's great guys i love the ui i love the branding okay great job thanks thank you thanks great work team nabari now uh the zoom meeting the zoom atom the zoom admin will demote you to attendees or you could choose to either uh stay and keep watching or leave a zoom meeting up next we have team moat uh mo you'll have four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a yes thank you i think more people should build things let's start with the assumption that a world with more creators is a better place web 2 connects one creator to end users there's no upper bound n creators together produce n squared points of contact so maybe we don't want infinite scale more web 2 builders results in too much information to filter properly content creators resort to cheap tricks for attention data streams reduce in quality but deliver similar dopamine and users become complacent in their gradual self-lobotomization low-quality attention-seeking information streams break bridges that could form between communities but this really doesn't need to happen when bitcoin maxis and ethereums collide on twitter communication devolves into memes and name calling we should really talk about the beautiful tech we're both building social media should build bridges between disparate communities increased read and write bandwidth during collisions could produce more helpful dialogue let's summarize more people should build things but scale is the enemy shard collisions can be positive but only with radical read and write access to each other so let's build it introducing moat podcast style one-on-one voice chat social media you can have a maximum of 140 friends your ideas are intellectual property with value and users filter information your account is an erc 1155 smart contract you have 140 friendship tokens to give out your friends are tokenized tradable and scarce good conversations are minted as erc 1155 nfts and these contracts hold tokens that can also be sold on a sigmoidal bonding curve only your friends can invest in your content and then investors friends can listen and invest in this way users filter the information so this is an ambitious project what did we finish during the hackathon well keeping track of your friends is something that's important once the network has scaled a little bit since we're small the minimum viable product involves speculation on the value of content if people use the dap and we see content with long lasting value rank highest we'll know we should build out our token based friendship system here's how it looks you have a live feed of posts ranked by the current value right here you can speculate on the long term value of any content you see there's a page where you can upload and pin podcast style conversations to ipfs using nft.storage posting content costs a small fee which funds development of a project and you can see here the new content is posted this is my first solidity project so the code is probably cursed flex your coding skills by sending a push request if you're not a developer head to withmote.com and give us your email we'll invite you to our discord let you know when we launch to test nets and then delete your email forever and lastly happy hard fork let's keep building things i think more people uh thanks for the presentation team mode now we're gonna move on to three minutes of q a um one i mean this this is a bit of an interesting idea i i must admit i i think i estimate to kind of wrap my head around this but uh uh how how is the how do you intend the feet to kind of function in that sense and um is that available only to um your your network of friends in that regard or are you planning on on broadening that and is that and how how does curation kind of work for a field like that uh yeah good question um so you know obviously if we're doing this on the blockchain then every single you know piece of content that is on the platform is going to be publicly available um so if we end up building any sort of filtering or anything it's just going to happen on the front end and so the idea is eventually if we have people who who use it the only content that you will get would be the content that your friends have fractional ownership of it could be content that they created and that way you could buy into it in an earlier stage if you believe in it um and if it's not content they created themselves it's content that they believe in enough to maybe spend a bit of their money and buy one of these tokens sold on a bonding curve and i think the interesting dynamic here is like for an idea to propagate across the network it has to be filtered by like a a pretty large number of people to get from like maybe point a to point b uh in the shortest route is is maybe like seven different people between those two um so i'm thinking like this is a system where like these smaller richer communities kind of emerge naturally rather than kind of just trying to force these things to happen does that sort of make sense it does thanks thanks for that really pretty cool stuff um yeah i was quite impressed with the presentation and then i realized it's about podcasts so you definitely have like the the right voice and equipment for that um one question that i had was one about the the bonding curve itself right is it really like a bonding curve where you have access to liquidity anytime if you ever want to sell this this token back um or is it more weird sale as we've seen across nft projects these days and the second one would be i guess a bit more rationalization around the accounts itself being an 1155 rather than just being an address right mostly around i i guess i get the idea of these being tokens but then wouldn't your followers be very much market driven like right like people be trading these tokens that represent following you so yeah just open questions i guess uh yeah so we'll kind of start on the bonding curve um if you're familiar with like bank or uh b-a-n-c-a-o-r i've never actually heard it pronounced so i think banker banker we use a very similar model um so i i just you know modeled a sigmoidal equation and because it's a erc 1155 contract we have one token in the contract that is scarce it has just a supply of one and but in the same contract there is another token that you can speculate on so that's that's sort of how the the bonding curve mechanics work um obviously you have a bonding curve you're going to subject yourself to um susceptibility to front-running attacks um so we have some ideas to once we deployed a test net uh try to build things like a a gas limit so someone can't front run um you know purchasing on the bonding curve and kind of steal your money that way um but i i don't know how it's going to look there might be a lot of problems here and we have to do some testing before we're ready to deploy to main nuts and to move on to your question about uh why we want to um have the accounts be erc 1155 contracts also um well so yes that they're because of a friendship is technically tradable um there might be money involved it might be someone with more money might have access to more people um but i i think that's like sort of how things work in the real world as well um so the great thing about having uh maybe a contract hold the friendships is is we could make it so it's it's opt-in if one of my friends wants to sell our friendship to someone else then i want to be able to have to approve that right and maybe that's a really good thing maybe that will bring me in contact with people who are you know maybe more important or more connected in my network right no yeah definitely i think these are good points to think more about um i love the project like i planning on going further after the hackathon like to see this in front of users would be really cool to see yeah so this is um kind of like the the first launch of something that i want to turn into basically a a startup um so we're recruiting devs uh i don't know what i'm doing uh so please help me um and yeah i'm definitely going to continue this project and try to turn it into something um something pretty good uh the the real end goal is to kind of remove metamask from the equation completely and turn it into a mechanism to onboard people into web3 very easily very nice and one last note uh maybe you have already but watch vidalik's talk from e2cc you might be super inspirational all right thank you i will do that okay uh great job team mo uh the admin will now be demoting you to an attendee where you could choose whether you want to hop off the call or continue watching next we have team whiptail uh you'll have four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a and i'll pull up the video for you hi guys yeah that'd be great awesome hi my name's orlando and i'm here to tell you about whip tail down a forecasting dial that harnesses the wisdom of the crowd this is a well-documented fact within the field of forecasting that the average of a group of forecasters predictions is over a long enough time frame better than any individual set of forecasts the pro the process of averaging out the forecasts will reduce the effect of mistakes in in single in any single forecasters model leading to a more accurate and robust forecast we therefore propose a forecasting dow to take advantage of this fact the dow would work as follows a group of forecasters will create forecasts for an event and send them to a smart contract the overall forecast would then be found as an average of all of all the individuals forecasts we believe that there would be interest in buying these forecasts from various organizations including hedge funds book keys governments and even other dows additionally the information could be used to trade in prediction markets directly profits can then be distributed via another smart contract to all participants public key cryptography is used to keep the overall forecast private to everyone except the buyer to ensure their ip is valuable to them to ensure that the forecasters in the dao are all high quality we need a way to test their ability in an unchained trustless manner we therefore we therefore propose a forecasting reputation score that is associated with your ethereum address which you can build up over time we can create a cutoff reputation score but at least x in order to qualify to forecast for the dow to allow people to build up their scores we propose a series of prediction competitions where users predict various events that will will occur in the future and receive positive or negative points depending on how close they are to the true answer when the event occurs this will be done through a commit reveal smart contract building the core functionality of this mechanism with our focus during the hackathon which involved the core smart contracts the front end and the decentralized storage on far coin jack will now demo the website where answers can be submitted to a range of questions and depending on how you do will lead to increases or decreases in your reputation score this is jack with woodpale so we have here some questions which we asked to the community that's what we have here what is your favorite number we have the time and ends we have the lower bound we have the upper bound and we have the total predictions on what would the best number would be um we have the same one here how many goals scored in the world cup final uh how much total ether we burned we have here finished one which displays all of the final predictions on a graph if a user wants to submit um what their favorite number is they can hit submit here confirm while that's confirming and we'll go over the leaderboard this shows off the reputation each user starts off with 100 reputation it goes up or down based on how well they're doing each question here's the about page and it's actually the readme document of our github file um still waiting on that robson transaction if i connect my wallet here because i'm an admin this is where i'm able to submit questions this is how these come about still waiting on the transaction ah it's just passed there you go uh we have two predictions on this one and hope you enjoyed this was jack with whiptail well yeah i hope you liked that presentation and yeah i'm looking forward to your questions or feedback from research i'm going to give an overview okay uh thank you we're now going to be moving on to the q a three it will minutes generally like be the ui in some some we shipping sense i i don't know why but it was uh in in some regard uh pretty academic if one might call it that um so uh but then in in that regard uh this is kind of curious as to um the notion of um yeah like ha ha ha ha ha how you basically feel that um well whether i mean there's this specific kinds of questions or categories that you feel leveraging might might be helpful for or not in some regard and and whether keeping things like private in terms of having a committed review scheme is going to be useful or whether you feel um laying things out in a more publicly available fashion as you kind of typically see in prediction markets is going to be more helpful in essentially engaging with the crowd uh yeah so good question um so i i think like the important thing is if we're gonna get buyers for these um forecasts um it's important to keep it private or there's just a free rider problem where um anyone else can just view the forecast which is produced by bought by someone else so i think that's that's like pretty important to have and then the source of questions it's all sorts of things so it could um like we're thinking like the i'm like a statistician myself and like it like forecasts go beyond like point predictions but it's actually about like the full distribution over um event outcomes so for example like it could be like a question that we were thinking about was like the what's the average gas price um two weeks after the eip159 update and and then and then users would submit like a distribution from say from zero to 1000 say and then um this distribution will be averaged and that allows so you can see the risk of it going very high and that's actually very important for like hedging tail risk because say small contracts will break if it goes over 100 if a gas goes over 100 it's very important for different organizations to be able to sort of um gauge tail risk and um suitably hedge against that um so yeah those sorts of questions then trading questions covet anything covered cases like just any sort of question any sort of right predictive distribution which um be useful in so many different fields bookies as well sports predictions as well i very much like the element of the reputation system we implemented here uh i guess what keeps popping my mind is exactly the relationship between this forecasting system and the prediction markets today um yeah so um yeah so the so the prediction market today allows you to yeah make money from um predicting events but uh and so like like we could produce these average predictions from these group of people and then use that to directly um um bet in prediction markets and essentially work like a hedge fund the wisdom of the crowd working together to um provide superior returns but i think these forecasts go far beyond these single point predictions in prediction markets like these full distributions could be used by certain different organizations in ways that it would take like a team of like quants like a lot of expertise to actually use the knowledge like and the hedge funds have like a lot of knowledge to be able to use these distributions essentially they can d like they can outsource their prediction their sort of forecasting engine to a decentralized group of forecasters anywhere in the world who already needs an ethereum address they can work fully anonymously but they could be the best forecasters in the world for say football um scores whatever it is um which could then be sold to bookkeez in that in that example cool yeah i mean the one thing that i really really like about this is there's some more and more of these credit score systems exactly yeah exactly like nutanix talk at fcc sort of really this is actually what motivated me to do this i think it really connects into social media and rv's discussion i think social credit scores although that sounds quite dystopian like the chinese regime version but i think like an on-chain version of it it's like it's going to be the core to social media on blockchains because you need somewhere your reputation for yourself and if it's fully anonymous we need an unchained version that's not just proof of stake proof of reputation is the next version of proof of stake in my opinion yeah yeah and i guess this combined with like proof of humanity and all the good stuff this can become exactly yeah yeah i think we would definitely need like clairos's proof of humanity integration in order to people sound like civil attack um addresses nice now the more i think about it it's actually really exciting awesome thank you looking at i guess exchange of uh like lifestyle management for enemies in that sense by and then see how that would actually work but yeah certainly but um great thanks a lot man and uh let's bring it to maine yeah also yeah yeah great work uh it's time uh the zoom admin will now demote you to an attendee where you could either keep watching or leave the meeting up next we have teamdump.org you'll have four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a it seems that uh hackathon is getting to an end uh my name is pedro i joined with uh miguel we are both from portugal and we decided to start to build a dump protocol it's a decentralized universal networking protocol and the idea is to apply this to my platform which is d sound in the future so um we started to build a protocol that enables anyone or any developer to start building decentralized application the main idea was to build the grounds uh for for d sound to have a data layer that is not connected to any blockchain the sound started with another uh with a blockchain which was team at that time uh and so i learned with that process that uh it's not the best way to um be be reliant on just one source for for your data and also for the users is not a very good option so um i decided to build something that where the users would stay in control of their data all the time and that's dumb dumb is using technologies like ipfs rbdb ethereum wallets the hd wallets um any vm blockchain can be connected and can monetize or build a business model around that and it's also connected with the weather storage and nft storage in pinata and filecoin uh through the through those services and also ens is uh um possible to be used to register for the users to register their own names and use those names for social networks for instance if you imagine that you could register in one time one name and use that name for youtube facebook uh and any any other uh social media that you use and the main the most important thing is um actually owning your data and sharing your data with other dapps that uh will present that data in a special way so you if you want to learn more about this project and we wrote a bunch of stuff just go to our repo and there is a docs repo there i will do a short demo right now i will change to my screen and here we have side by side one normal browser here on the left and one incognito browser on the right will uh be creating an instance and here we will log in with the meta mask we will choose metamask connect wallet and this will show show us a signature request and we sign it and here we are we have an ethereum account that is connected to this browser instance and right now we are not able to edit my profile because it's uh it's read-only because it's not my account there and you can see my posts here so uh on this right side i will log in with my account it will generate my ethereum address and now i can write something here and edit this but i can also uh make a post hello from ack fs demo video posts and you can see that it shows here and it shows here as well so everything it gets synchronized all the time and that's what we prepared just take a deeper look on our documentation and thanks a lot cheers thank you for the presentation now we will be moving on to three minutes of q a um definitely an interesting way of kind of doing and presenting things i i generally like the idea of using dids and and agnostic fashion and link linking those two to social profiles so that's super cool um which which um i guess did methods do you support today and um how are you thinking about i guess um life cycle management for for these are you kind of um basically enabling users to kind of store cluster data and credentials in an orbit db instance that they choose or how exactly is that controlled by the user well um the dav is generated when when the user chooses an account so we have an easy and easy login uh that we implemented like inspired on hedgehog from audios we created something different that doesn't need the central servers to start to store the encrypted uh package uh the digital identity or the decentralized identity doesn't need that uh that kind of uh uh uh where the keys the keys are generated uh to to just for your social interactions right it's not there there are no keys stored on the browser for ethereum account so you do your theme account is just like your username or something like that and it's stored on the browser so that the user can interact it with the browser just as a web to application without metamask being involved or having to log in all the time to approve transactions so um i think it's super cool to to onboard new users without knowing what the key is or metamask or anything like that because there is no money involved in this uh in this uh part of the the social media network uh like for posting and so on and uh and then after after that there is a a a a very big data layer that we developed for all all the kinds of networking like social networking or professional networking requirements we try to make something that can be applied to any so any social media or any professional media sharing application yeah my question was more along the lines of whether it was the id web or support for jwts and stuff but but no i i see your point um did you make all of that during this hackathon i mean this sounds like a pretty extensive project but super super cool though yeah we we we tried to uh build the most uh part of it during the avatar we can we couldn't finish there there are some things that we are still developing right now and we will because uh we want to uh finish this so that this sound can incorporate this project uh as the main data layer and it's on an open source project anyone can join uh if anyone any developers want to join in just uh fingers on github it's an open project uh we want to have all the help we can to build this and make this for the community yeah i think i would like to make a note because there's quite some thoughts about uh regarding privacy uh obviously it's the censorship and the easiness to use uh and to really to build a decentralized application because when you see some some dap around there it's it has some some sort of component of centralization around and we want to build the basis uh of a social net social social network that doesn't have that compromise so uh yeah and also the uh the resilience to to to data and uh the replication of data and availability um yeah that's quite some thought about uh on this layer well i think we're kind of like wrapping up uh on the time available i i was going through the github and uh yeah it's amazing the amount of work that you folks managed to do in this last week so congrats for that uh i guess one comment in general like it is a very large scope project which i think is it's also a very relevant project these days and i wonder if before this whole project can surface if there are any uh potential libraries or components that could be uh released because i think a lot of the ecosystem today are thinking about this and yeah this could be something that benefits a lot of people we already released uh the uh identity packages and we if you go to np and bmjs uh there you you can see dump identity is there already and also damp data which is the package that uh um has the the the data layer that we were able to build during ffs uh it's so it's already also released it's people can start working today uh if they want to build a social network today they can maybe after this presentation they can start building it no problem and uh we are really really keen to to put this forward so we are thinking about going to uh try try out some uh ipfs or falcon grants for this project i really think that this it's very it's very interesting for people to to have some ground layer like this i know how hard it is to to build these things i've been building on ipfs for four years already so um i i know how hard it is and i know that this helps a lot of people so i'm very very very happy about this project congrats folks thank you all right great work uh the zoom admin will now demote you to attendees and you could choose whether you want to keep watching or leave the meeting uh now we'll be going on a a short break 10 minutes uh judges make sure to mute and turn off your cameras and we'll be back in 10 minutes uh welcome back well i suggested uh judges please turn your cameras back on you might have to wait a little bit though okay so next up we have team shadow supercoder equals the game um uh you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes of q a oh um there they're not ready yet so we might have to move on okay we'll wait a bit to see if they're if they're ready and then after that if they're still not ready we'll move on i'll probably just say it's not loud um so can can team unstoppable clubs raise your hand how about watching super color of the game okay mohit what team are you on okay so next up is unstoppable clubs ready okay okay first we'll well next up we have a team unstoppable clubs you guys have hi guys yeah four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a hey so we are team unstoppable clubs i'm just going to share my screen and uh let me know if you are able to hear me censorship and we were inspired by unstoppable clubs yeah it's good we have bill okay i'm just gonna let the video continue now uh solution for creators to publish their content to their subscribers without any kind of censorship and we were inspired by vitalik's lecture on building unstoppable apps and we decided to build something that creators can use to have uh close communities where they can publish their posts directly to their community team consists of me mohit janvani and my fellow developer lakshya many what we have built is a way to push your content to textile uh in an encrypted way and then the key that we encrypt this content with is then encrypted with the public key of all the members and then push to ipfs as well because the key has been encrypted with the public key of all the members only the members are able to decrypt the secret key for that content and able to see the file we have our own smart contract on the polygon blockchain which keeps track of all the posts that have been published for a single club and we use unlock protocol to manage the memberships and as well as graph protocol to index all the posts and the clubs so now i'm going to show you a demo of what we have built this is our beautiful website and here you can see that i am connected using my using my metamask wallet and i'm going to go to the dashboard and i don't right now have any clubs so i'm going to create a club i'm going to make it a hack fs and the amount is going to be 0.2 matic and there's only going to be 100 members in the in the club right and then i'm going to click create and now i get a metamask signing pop-up i sign the pop-up and my club is then created using this uh using with this address and i can refresh it to see what are my clubs and you can see that this is my club hack fs and this is the address of the club i can then start uploading content to this club and it's going to encrypt the style and then send it to textile and then it's going to encrypt secret key of this file and then send it to the members and you can see that here i am going to put a transaction on the blockchain about the post and this post is then put on the blockchain where anybody can see uh what the post is but nobody can actually read the file so as a subscriber i can go to the site and i can see all the clubs that are right now with the number of spots that are left i can click subscribe and it will ask for my encryption public key and then it will create a transaction on the unlock protocol and after the transaction is done is confirmed i will be able to go to go to my dashboard where i can see all the clubs that i have subscribed to and once i have created a post the subscriber will be able to go and see this post in his dashboard where he can click on view and you can see that the meta mask is asking to decrypt the secret key and after it's been decrypted he will be able to view the file here so in our project we wanted to have a distributed decentralized way of sharing content with viewers we can then sell the memberships as nfts so that only a limited number of memberships are ever minted and the top creators can earn more money from the price of their membership increasing hi can i stop sharing now yeah thanks for the presentation now we're going to be moving on to three minutes of q a i really like the focus on creating smaller community dials especially around creators and especially around focus around continent um i guess one thing that came to mind and it's curious to ask is um if you have one of these uh clubs and you have 10 members in them um any one of these 10 members can view the content right so anybody can join this club and then just sign and then view the contents within the club it doesn't have like a a group um verification of sorts right uh no not at the moment so actually what happens is we encrypt the files with the public key of all the members so we encrypt the file with the secret key and then the secret key is encrypted with public key of all the members so we need to for when we want to start trading of memberships we need to add an additional step where the uh whenever the member changes the club creator will have to approve it so that he can view the past posts uh as well because the club creator will have to then encrypt the secret key with his public key and post it to the ipfs okay but if it's encrypted with all of the members keys how do you decrypt it with only a single member signature yeah so uh it's basically uh so suppose i have my key and i have 10 members in the club and when i am creating the post i encrypt the secret key of the file with the public key of the 10 members so i will have 10 different uh data in that ipfs file and then i have to when somebody trades his membership with somebody else then i have to go back and um you know encrypt all the files with his public key as well so that will be an additional step when we make these memberships tradable but there are actually new cipher and some other technologies who are coming up with solutions there's nobody that does it on evm right now but i know few people are working on uh the solution so later we can actually use those to make it more scalable cool i got to get it better now it's i guess what i really like about projects is the convenience of being able to form these groups and have uh this encrypted content easily shareable right yeah absolutely and we are actually we participated in hack money as uh buy me a crypto coffee and we and this is just one of our features that we are building uh and we started it in this hackathon itself and we are aiming to build like a gum road completely uh web 3 uh gum road basically very cool thank you super typical uh presentation and that that's in that regard yeah i was was a little uh yeah was was kind of taking a little back on on the key management piece which is something i still have to wrap my head around a bit in some regard but uh i think i get the gist of what you're doing um um but in in in that sense uh do you see that there uh what what kind of updates would you basically want to do on the um the dashboard so to speak uh from from wherever things and what what what features that do you feel um you have not yet been able to incorporate as part of what the work that you've done but um as part of um hackerfest yeah so this is uh more like a proof of concept and there needs to be a lot of different integrations to enable this to go to uh production for instance um right now uh when a member when we have a new member join he cannot view the past post because we don't have his uh we don't have the key encrypted uh with this public key and the other one is there's a lot of uh you know ux improvements that could be done to basically make the whole process much easier like for instance right now we do multiple transactions on the front end and we could deploy a smart contract to basically just have one transaction instead of multiple transactions from the uh front end so i think both of these ways there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to take it to production some super super cool stuff um yeah looking forward to see how this would pan out yeah thanks a lot yeah um great work team uh unstoppable clubs the zoom admin will now demote you to an attendee where you could choose whether you want to hop off the call or continue watching the judging session up next we have team team footprints uh team footprints you have four minutes to present followed by three minutes of a q a session i hope my screen is visible oh we can see your screen all right let's have a look at live demonstration of a decentralized application footprints since we have deployed our smart contacts on polygon network we have connected our metamouse wallet to mumbai testnet in the upload section the user can select the category of the nft which he wants to create that is a memorial nft or photograph nft here in the memorial section we have already a memory from the event of inauguration of statute of unity which was created by the organization of statue of unity let's go to my profile section here we have the option to make the nft premium after making it premium if any user wants to create a memorial at this location he will have to pay charges to the organization of statute of unity after making the nfd premium the option to make it premium again vanishes from here and the nft that is the memory appears under the premium section i have now logged into user one's account under the memorial section he will be able to see all the memorials that are present at that location and under the opinion section he will be able to see the premium energies at that location only one premium and nfd can exist at a particular location now let us upload a memory from the user one's account the user needs to pay one matic to the owner of the organization of statue of unity on completion of transaction one matrix gets deducted from his account and it is added to the organization's account address now under the memorial section the user would be able to see his memory along with the memory of the organization of statute of unity to check out the second category that is photography i have logged into a photographer's account and to save over time i have already uploaded a photograph from his account the user can go to my profile section and click on this button to add his photograph to marketplace the photo now appears under the marketplace table i have now logged in to buyers account whenever a buyer which visits the place where the photograph's nft was created he would be able to see this photo under the market section by hitting on this icon he can pay the amount to the owner of the nft and then the nft would be transferred to his account as you can see the owner's address have been changed and the amount has been detected from his account and the nfd is now been staged under the profile of the bias account to check out the feature of counterfeit prohibiting counterfeit nfts i have logged into imposter's account if the imposter goes to the photography tab and takes the screenshot of this image and then downloads the image and now if he wants to upload the duplicate image that is a screenshot and then if he tries to upload it the user will be prompted with an alert message that is prohibited you are trying to create a counterfeit nfc these are some of the features which we wanted to have in our app but in the lack of time we couldn't implement them the first one was when converting a memorial to premium nft we would we wanted to allow the user to set the radius of area within certain limit and then pay the contract owner to make it premium and the rate would be directly proportional to the radius of area he selects and the second one was create a virtual visit at some location like wildlife places because some photographers make uh click some wildlife pictures and then the users can see them by purchasing the virtual tickets and then people can enjoy the memoirs and photographs at different locations sitting at home thanks for the presentation now we'll be moving on to three minutes of q a so uh i gotta say i really really love the project name and the ui is also very much complaint um it's a bit of a light comment but there's this one saying that i had in my mind for many years like take only photos leave only footprints and uh it seems like a project perfectly captures that um the one curiosity that i had is how are you doing the counterfat mechanism here uh yeah so uh like the nft dot storage provides uh like storing the properties uh under the metadata so what we are doing is that uh along with the metadata like the name of the nft and caption related to it we are storing the location as well as we are storing the uh perceptual hash value of that image uh so what perceptual hash value then uh it calculates the hamming distance between two hashes and then it gets captured like if uh my if some logo changes there in the image or maybe the image is blurred a bit and then re-uploaded or if uh it's converted into black and white all these things gets captured oh that's actually interesting um i guess one of the reasons why i ask is there seems to be like an increased demand for photography in the nfd space um it's one of these underappreciated mediums that now is definitely getting a spotlight so uh i would imagine a lot of photography-oriented nft platforms coming out soon so it seems like your folks are thinking the right thing at the right time for a great project thanks a lot super cool uh super cool presentation um yeah i am very curious about the the aspect that you mentioned around the hamming distance between the hatches i did not anticipate hash functions would function that way but um looks looks pretty cool i guess and it's not regard um but i uh in in terms of i guess the way you're kind of thinking about um like i mean yeah the way you're kind of thinking about um uh creating these nfds i mean do you want uh do you feel that people would basically want to um to showcase um and create these as premium uh premium nfd's in in that regard i'm just curious as to what what the motivation would be for for a specific user to kind of make make that a premium nfp yes uh like see uh then if you consider if like the organization like recently the inauguration took place so at that time if the organization of statue of unity uh converted their nft into premium now whenever the tourists visit that place and if they want to have their uh memorial being installed permanently there like a concrete and a memorial cannot everyone cannot make it but if we try to make a digital uh memorial that would stay at that place forever and whenever some other people visit that same place so they would be able to see that this person visited so and so please at that time so basically that moment uh is uh your nft at that particular location so the organization would be getting benefited when the people create their memorials uh in that particular area all right no makes make sense um cool uh sound sounds uh super interesting what would be nice to kind of see a few of these actually get um get get some spotlight and yeah organizations get together to uh governments get there to you in that regard but yeah i really like the idea yeah thanks a lot great work team footprints the zoom admin will now devote you to attendees where you could choose whether you want to hop off the call or keep watching the rest up next we have team des crow you'll have four minutes of presentation followed by three minutes of q a um looks like oh he's here now all right can you all hear me yeah yeah pretty clear all right wonderful let me know if there's any sound issues oh i apologize i didn't hit the button all right hey uh my name is bradley this is roberto or descro basically built a decentralized escrow system because we saw that a lot of developers were getting scammed when they built projects in anonymous services like discord reddit telegram stuff like that so the system is pretty simple all you're going to do is first connect a wallet so i am the payer and roberto is going to be the payee so what he's going to do is upload a file or the code that you know he wants to essentially sell to the buyer so what we'll do is we'll put the payer address in here and then we're going to fetch the payee address to put it in here and then the specific amount so the amount that the developer requests for the job they did so what we do first is we create the agreement so what this does it creates a pairing and smart contract state so you're not creating a new smart contract every time and it creates a connection between the payee the payer and the specific amount based on the wallet addresses so there you go you'll see that the smart contract was created and you can also see that there is updated deposited amounts um we actually did implement logic so that if someone only submitted part of the full amount and tries to download the files they actually can't but because it takes an extra minute to go through we aren't actually going to go through it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to deposit the full amount so this means that the developer can upload the code the full deposit is ready to go um and then once that you know swap occurs we can download the uh necessary file on my end okay there you go and transaction has gone through so roberto okay i think we're good i'm trying to shine let's see i'm gonna to the screen so now i'm gonna be i'm gonna connect my wallet okay this is my address now um so now i'm gonna have to upload the file the payer uh i indicate the page because i may have different agreements with different wallets so i'm gonna upload uh for this one uh i would upload as a pdf in this case you can see here with a mask that's from transaction um so basically the as we explained yeah the payment has been done first but it could be that i can upload the file first and then the payment is done or half the payment is done then i upload the file and then the rest of the payment it doesn't matter the assets won't reach the other end until everything is in place so now the transaction is done you should see on your end i'm going to stop sharing see that the file is there there we go okay so what you see is the file has been uploaded on my end so now we'll do is release the payment meaning that you know we've on through a zoom call or whatever you know i verified the code we went through it we saw them upload the file to our desktop system um and so now that's been uploaded i'll release the payment to the developer um so they'll receive it and then what we'll actually be able to do is download the file on our end so whatever roberto uploaded we'll be able to see on our side so the last thing to do is we just want to end the escrow contract what this does is it moves it out of state so that the two walls can come back together and create a new agreement in the future so then roberto and i can do business again and that's basically it yeah nice all right that's it yeah thanks for the presentation now you'll be moving on to three minutes of q a sounds good i uh i really dig the idea of uh monetizing code contributions uh i guess personally i'm thinking more on the creative coding side of things but this is also like a straight up transaction um i feel like it can be used by a lot of folks uh two questions that i do have um one is i guess the encryption of the code itself the file right like is this uploaded to ipfs can't somebody maybe inspect the contract storage and pull out the cid some way and the second is uh is it really the case that if uh if two parties create a swap no other swaps can be created by those parties until this first swap is concluded yeah so to answer the first question yeah we're using all ipfs methods so whatever encryption is standardized in there we're using the second question the reason why we made it that way is let's say that you have one transaction where you have these two parties that interact based on their wallet addresses but the first guy tries to screw over the other guy that's stored in state so the reason why we have it set up that way is you essentially at the end of it want to shake hands say that was a good transaction by hitting that end escrow button um now the biggest problem right is the ux um it's out of order you know stuff is confusing um i'll ideally the end escrow would happen on both sides so it would be like an actual handshake i guess like one thought that came to mind as you're presenting it these the code could also potentially i guess live on unlock protocol or something like it um and the code could even be an nfd right that gets minted that gets swapped um yeah so and that's all to say like a lot of ideas came to mind as we're presenting so i think uh the project has a lot of potential in the future yeah exactly and you know we also want to make it such a way that it's asynchronous so we don't actually have to deposit and you know upload the code at the same time we have ideas with like a headless browser are you integrating git stuff like that um but yeah it's just literally just to prevent anonymous developers and these discord groups from getting screwed over think about the different direction um in some some regard uh when it comes to uh cool operators sharing in escrows but um the question that i kind of had was um around the the notion of yeah was it essentially the the the fact that that 18 was alluding to before where you do not want i guess one of the parties to kind of upload their content um is part of the same transaction as and when they kind of set up um the escrow in that regard or and basically prevent them from tracking the cid or um is that is there a reason as to why you had a separate um flow where you basically had people agree to the escrow and then um get people to deposit i i guess the the amount and the the actual goals good question so we actually wanted to implement that so you could do milestone based so one of the big things in um anonymous because i've been screwed over this is why we built it um you want to do milestone based so let's say that we do 20 of the projects we'll upload that to ipfs you deposit a specific amount then we can fulfill that arrangement and you can get that 20 right so you're actually paying for the exact amount of code that you're getting so we just left it in there as a way that we could build on top of it for milestone base that makes a lot of sense um agreed on i'm on that front yeah it would actually be very interesting to kind of see how that could even kind of go with um integration with git that that that would be something that that could potentially work essentially with with unlocked seeking resources exactly so yeah i thought that that'd be awesome pretty cool what's the other thing uh radical um yeah i have i haven't looked much at the radical but i feel like this could be like a perfect match maybe radical yeah do you know what they do it's like a decentralized version of github basically perfect yeah oh it's based on good yeah it is perfect yeah the part of the reveal happening later on and having more of like a step-by-step milestone base i think that makes a lot of sense for sure very cool yeah exactly appreciate it thank you gentlemen great work team describe uh now the zoom admin will demote you to an attendee where you could either choose to leave the call or keep watching up next we have team babel bible you'll have four minutes to present and followed by three minutes of q a this is babel babel is an on-chain generative and collaborative nft project at its core is a year c721 nft contract called works each words nft corresponds to a unique randomly generated five letter word the token id is the word the last 5 bytes of the joke 90 are the ascii encoding of the word so each word five letters all lowercase randomly generated and unique there's 12 million possible words we use chainman vrf to generate um with a custom algorithm that will allow us to find words towards the end of the minting process this is on hardhat network because it takes too long for the demo to do the actual remove so this is how i would do it i would request a word there'd be a request id the vrf will come back and in this case i'm going to fulfill that request myself and we'll keep going as we uh wait for that so each word costs one babel token to mint uh the babel token is the core currency of everything that happens in across the baffle contracts um words can be sold back to a ball contract for a rate that's worse than they bought them for from the words contract and conversely users can purchase specific cords that are held in the vault again at a worse rate than they would by minting randomly generated works and battle tokens are sold on a bonding curve with a time being okay so what can we do with words the main thing is the collaborative part of babble so a lyric is the sequence of three five letter words and users decide that they want to replace one of these words and update this main layer they do that through this auction process where where we make sure that lyrics can be updated more often than a fixed number of blocks so that's the minimum length of the option so i pick one of my words i'll pick the one that i just minted i'm gonna pick which position i want to replace so i'm gonna pick the third position which is position two and i'll pick a bid which is how much of the babble token i'm willing to spend for the right uh not only to update the sort of public facing lyric but to get that the corresponding nft which is unique uh so we'll place the bid um in this case we don't have other bitters and i have a short circuit but it will just end the round for me so you see we've replaced the last word with that new word that we minted and we got the corresponding nfd um the user does not need to give up the word so that's important they just need to own the word at the time of the bid and again with the lyrics the token id corresponds to the lyric itself so it's encoded with these five byte ascii encodings with um single zero bytes in between and this is all at the least significant digits of the token id oh thanks for the presentation you'll now be moving on to the q a um yeah i'm very biased i love all things generative using launching data and collaborative and with multiple participants so very cool project love to see it um i was looking up there was this old nft project on ethereum for forming words i think it was like syllabus or consonants or something like that but i couldn't find it but uh i definitely see like that's an area that a lot of folks like to explore creatively um i really really like the element of you have the the the individual pieces and then you compose those together into this other i guess you're calling the lyrics and of these they reminded me a little bit of a haiku in some ways yeah yeah um i guess one question that i had was a bit of a technical one well first of all technically speaking i think this kind of uh nfd project is very relevant for the space a lot of folks are asking for not yet another copy based profile photo project so even to do like a twitter tread around the exploration i think folks would love to see it the question that i had was the composability of the second nft right there is this 998 composable standard which is not widely used so just curious if you had any insights there on how to approach that problem i'm actually not familiar with the 998 composable standard but with regards to the token ids actually corresponding exactly to the ascii encodings um you could easily sort of concatenate things or um yeah just it'd be fairly straightforward to bring things to together in some composable way simply by using those ascii encodings let's start from the link here real quick thank you yeah i'm glad uh people are kind of looking at words again i'm more so uh personally biased um to look at um in in some sense text-based and textual content is the most visual so that you're definitely working on on something like like this and then in that regard um i guess i mean out of curiosity any any particular reason as to why you thought only owners should be the ones participating in auctions um as opposed to um anyone to kind of um help curate and put together i guess lyrics in that regard i guess i i wanted to incentivize this search for interesting words so i love this idea that there's 11 million of these quote unquote words but there's sort of a few much fewer that seem to be intrinsically valuable so to incentivize people searching for words that they find interesting or maybe finding interest in words that they would have found disinteresting to use them in these lyrics and feel like they're contributing to something bigger and feel feel happy about the words that they've collected that was sort of my my main idea all right yeah it might be interesting to incentivize people for mining words as such and um putting them making them available and getting people to pay them for that as well but uh oh yeah i see a point as well in some regard but um yeah it's a super cool um super cool presentation thank you i guess bullying on the tread um that is a poem that i've been thinking about as well like if there is they could probably do like a primary market like royalty-like system right where utilizing certain oh wait no you do you only use the words like oh right so that changes everything okay now mine um yeah i guess that's a comment that i had to make but uh i'd love to see it i think it's project really cool to go to maina thank you and uh um i'll message you later i think somebody would love to see it okay i appreciate that great work team babble now the zoom admin will demote you and you could choose whether you want to stay and listen to the call or hop off next up we have team shadow super code of the game you'll have you'll have four minutes to present followed by three minutes of q a hi my name is homie i created the game uh shadowy supercoder it's built in html5 it utilizes ipfs for posting the game all the game assets uh level editor saves dates things um like that i didn't get to add all the things i really wanted to get in there um i was able to utilize chain link um for the actual generation of the unique super saiyan characters um they're not currently implemented inside of it this is something i'm going to do after and yeah that was pretty much it like i spent a lot of the time just building a framework um that utilizes ipfs for a lot of the things that were uh in games so that's kind of what the hack for me is splitting where um what things are good for um you know what things were centralized in the game world and what i did decentralized and i found a good uh marrying of the two um it also has a level editor um so there's a level editor that will be um implemented so a totally decentralized level editor for games the whole concept later on is that you could build your levels and then have import them into a game as an nft or something else and have people paid to play that level um so other than that like this is running on ipfs here you can see it and you know other than that i'm going to you know continue to work on it thanks for letting me participate and um bye thanks for the presentation no uh there will be three minutes of q a is there maybe a um implementation or a demo excuse me i'm just wondering yeah yeah yeah so right now like there is uh there is a playable demo of the game the character itself is just kind of like a placeholder i wasn't able to get like the game art in so you can actually play the game there is um game state saving um i did have an issue with the unstoppable domains i did have enough unstoppable domain that was kind of working with it um but uh like the character that i was building from an example from chain link um i was able to compile the contract but i wasn't able to kind of get the ui in um i kind of i did as i kind of said i did build a i spent a lot of time building a framework and then at the end i kind of just built the game to kind of make sure that it actually was conceptually working um but my main goal really is to apply for a micro grant and to just carry on the project to the the next stage nice now i like that you're using the chain link vrf um and i know that the chaining folks are very much pushing that so i can imagine that they would very be willing to support you exploring this um yeah i very much love all things around game engines using web technologies and especially now with decentralization so cool stuff thank you um i mean this this this actually is we uh yeah uh i would would actually like like to see more um one more things kind of utilize um proper gaming um essentially getting getting gaming elements and to um to have three and and that regard um uh any any any particular issues in terms of um importing other kinds of game assets that you feel people might want to use um or say something of unity or something from other other supported game engines in some regard um and entering those well the uh addressables were easier to implement in unity um but uh i wanted to kind of build something that was from you know like a blockchain game development first and not something that was kind of like oh let's you know take a an existing engine and then throw you know blockchain type components onto it so i felt for a hack i was like i had enough time to um you know scrape out the parts of a you know blockchain first game engine um and i think i kind of uh did it but as far as um it was more of the time and coming from a centralized game development background um it was trying to think of like what should be unchained and what it should be on chain to maximize um you know playability because that's the the problem that i'm seeing with well for myself is that you get to the part where the game is really cool and then you have all these web free things that pop up and then it totally takes you away from that flow um so i figured that if i could just raffle a game where oh a lot of this stuff is hidden you just have your your accounts already connected you kind of just go through it and then once you're making the purchases for you know other uh characters or assets in the game um that's when that that layer came in so that whole web to the web 3 thing that was talked about is is uh something i'm also trying to solve but it was just great having fun uh using um ipfs and chain link and all these different things together and to see how conceptually they worked yeah no agreed on that front um trying to basically understand and see whether there could be specific elements about web3 that make game engines or specific again attributes of game engines um i guess much more different than what exists today um yes one can't probably play around with the physics or um um elements or things things that kind of have to do with specific kinds of um rendering um because they they do involve a decent bit of um computation but yeah like i mean yeah what would actually be a nice area of um i guess research and trying to figure out what about what three makes game engines unique or what attributes could be made unique but you're kind of playing around with with those ideas um so yeah definitely second that and i would even add that i feel like web technologies and javascript in general have evolved enough to enable us to realize like a full-on web-based game engine so to your comment about uh not plugging web3 concepts into something like unity so it's like a great moment and without the web 3 explosion uh to explore this front and i hope sooner rather than later we have like a full-on web 3 crypto native web-based uh game experience going it's really cool hopefully we can uh continue this on for sure great work and uh it seems like this is the end of the hackathon uh session so i'd like to say thank you to the judges and all the hackers that participated in this uh in this session goodbye thank you thank you thanks thank you you
