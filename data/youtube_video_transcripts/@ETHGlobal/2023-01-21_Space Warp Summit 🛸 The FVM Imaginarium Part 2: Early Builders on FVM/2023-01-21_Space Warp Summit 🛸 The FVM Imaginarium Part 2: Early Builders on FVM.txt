foreign [Applause] [Music] so yeah so jumping into our next talk um Matt's going to join us back and joined by a co-host Sarah from protocol Labs as well and this is really exciting talk it's going to be talking about now uh what is the early progress of people building on top of the fbm so we're gonna be joined by Lamont by Ren by Karen by nandit and by Ilya um who are going to be in a panel so really big panel hosted by Sarah Matt from PL about kind of the current state of building uh on the fdm and I will let them take it away and make sure everybody's onboarded here it's enough people that uh off my screen there we go it looks like Simon rsr are both here so I'll let you guys take the lead thank you Jacob um yeah once again really nice here um be here again with the youth Global Community um my name is Sarah and I can meet you if we haven't met before in the system somewhere um I am a developer Advocate with the fpm team um I also run the early Builders program for fvm and so that means like we have a whole host of people that came on when we had plans but things kept evolving and things are still evolving but they were brave enough to joined into the program and built and hacked and picked together with us and it started back in September and now we are about five months ahead now um they've had a lot of maturity in their project and so we wanted to feature some of the early Builders um today to kind of showcase what they do so far what their Journey looked like and knowing that could be you um in a few months to come so really looking forward to that before we get to introduce our panelist uh Matthew which is going to kind of stay high as if you were uh I will do I don't need to say much I don't think I was just on the on the last talk uh already talking quite a bit but so on the last talk JB and I talked about the kind of things you can build on the fem and I guess we're getting a lot more concrete now and talking to people who are building on the fem um already um early in their Pros get progress but you know we get to hear from them as to uh how they're actually getting on so yeah awesome okay so we'll we'll do introductions we kind of want to hear from all these early Builders and uh please introduce yourself and give us a good overview of what your project is about uh maybe we can start with Lamont hey how's everybody doing uh can you hear me okay sounds great perfect perfect yeah so I am actually one of the developers uh Jack Rabbit Finance is actually a decentralized exchange that will be launching on the fvm uh so you know we're running uh quite a few different features but one of the main ones is uh we also have we plan having a bond Marketplace uh utilizing on-chain storage bonds and tokenized debt um in the uh a more high level sense and uh yeah you know where for the most part we um uh our project is uh you know is moving along you know pretty well I guess we'll go more into that a little bit later on but uh but yeah so you know um uh we'll uh have a number of different features uh coming out to the fem version and we uh started in the East mobile hackathon as well that was just a couple of months ago yeah um yeah I remember that uh and then you joined the program and I was like so excited um yeah there are a few of you here as well that have come from the hackathon so the East Global Community some is is a really great Community to uh work together with um I totally forgot to also share all the logos of all the teams so I'm going to share that up right now I don't want to do it while you were talking halfway Lamont um just did this though that everyone can kind of see um all the different genes and you know make sure you look out for all these um exciting teams that their logos and you'll know when you see it and definitely check them out along the way um so we'll move on to the next introduction um Karen do you want to share and kind of say hi yeah sure hi everyone my name is Karen I'm the um Prada lead of standout so we also started at the FN uh hiker song in mid-november and then we joined the fam already Builders program so Spandau is a um data dial that allows consumers to monetize their credit card transaction date data um so there are three main problems that we're trying to tackle with our product so the first one is all the centralized corporate centralized entities corporate entities are extracting all the value from monetizing credit card transaction data which is the value which is a data market that's valued at more than 100 billion dollars right now and then the second one is of that there is like us ownership and governance cons for consumers to over their credit personal credit card transaction data so the the data the the product that we're building is trying to address the need for formulating a positive some Network so uh consumers and users to coordinate and pull their data together excited to be here thank you Karen okay Elia do you want to go next yep I'm always ready so I have this amazing t-shirt here it's actually the t-shirt from the first uh vvm hack uh that was happening like a couple of months ago uh so we are super excited uh to participate this time uh or with a stable test net uh thanks to the guys thanks to the team super excited Super thrilled so a we are building Market dot XYZ it's the platform for metaverse Builders where uh creators can perpetually store sell buy and gift any kind of 3D models and metaverse spaces and we really see uh filecoin as the essential like foundation of the interoperable metaverse and we see the metaverse as actually as the new 3D internet like the new interface for to access the world wide web for for the new generations um so we are super excited to build on pvm because we have absolutely like we have invented an absolutely unique feature we call it EFT encrypted file token so we have uh modified and if year c721 in nft and we have attached like a file one storage to it so we have invented an NF case with hidden content and for now like we have been researching pretty deep and for now it is only possible on vvm together with filecoin and we're super excited to be a part of this amazing community and we really believe that the fileco and team has has has has a unique concept and unique Vision since the like five years already we can see that but we also see that the community and and the team is somehow different from many other projects and we are super happy to be part of it awesome Yes um always feeling your super strong energy area I love having you in the community as well um all right do you want to go next yeah sure so hey everyone and at lighthouse we are building Perpetual storage on fine coin that allows you the ability to pay once and store your funds click forever and again networking to a lot of developers we realize that our building on storage systems can be done better Perpetual storages the key component that we have built and around that we also have the car encryption and CTA that can be used to store private data built token getting applications and also like a great ways that can even be used to stream 4K videos so but overall quite excited to be oh in this panel then uh have been in the file open ecosystem from last two years so great to see that now they are finally coming up with an fvm yeah um Lighthouse that Lighthouse has been carrying the Perpetual courage um you know area for fevm we definitely depart the more uh storage like you keep it coming up but yeah thank you so much for all the contributions from Lighthouse it's been amazing by the way we have integrated Lighthouse or Lighthouse storage and it's super highly recommended for everyone guys Lighthouse storage is super cool and gonna can save you a lot of time yeah I've actually included um so yeah really awesome to see like projects adopting across the early Builders cohort we've also included that restarts within the cheat sheet so if you want to check out that how it's in there as well and yeah if more teams come on different SDK that can be used this is what we'll be featuring um within our community as well um and then lastly when you want to go yeah so my name is neem I'm the founder of The Shield so projector film about the building the District of the computer over farrakhon so it's a market based on Avenue M and also the local protocols so it enables like a letter users to be able to spend the cryptocurrencies and and the rental Computing instant strong storage providers and to access their sales data local like a varied or high-speed local network so and then people can run some like a computation against the another amount of the data already made in the network and for example the first use kit will be the general deep learning models so we already know like there are already like the printing the models like either in the hiding tree or in the network so people can run to like until this instance and download the Facebook training models and just the new their own data to Point Unit Model and see the the results so yeah this is still a memory early and just stay tuned thank you so much Ling um Okay cool so like uh project show is also one of um the first projects that have come out the cohort to focus on decentralized compute I know there are a few teams that are working on it our project shell has a demo already running today um I think what we can do is uh we have well we have a huge community on flag the PowerPoint flag so if you want to get in touch with your teams or check out their demo um we will see you on our field Builders channel in the filecoin flag um yeah a lot of computation goes down there as well cool so we'll get into some questions about your journey building out your projects um from all of you this is open to anyone to kind of share what they think um and as well as met like if you want to come in as well with some insights because you want to watch it go hard like we've both been watching this cohort uh grow over time um so the first question that I'll put out there is why did YouTube build on fevm that anyone can go all right I'm going to be the first one as always I just cannot hold myself guys I'm sorry so uh for us um like our goal was that um we we were trying to attach this hidden content to the nft and um at one point we have realized that thanks to the vvm this is like the only Network right now where we can build this in a truly decentralized way uh right now the our Alpha version is uh running on on polygon together with filecoin but there is also like a part of our centralized backend which like is playing some kind of an oracle um helping to to transfer like the encryption keys to to the to the new owner um to decrypt the hidden content and uh as soon as actors Gonna Be Live on pvm uh we're gonna put it because we have it on Rust we're gonna put it just on the uh one of the smart actors of vbm uh actors that's the name for a rust smart contracts on on vvm uh so as soon as uh we gonna make it this like this our invention is going to become like a completely decentralized standard and we are also planning on uh making uh Falcon Improvement proposal uh Community proposal so we we re we really see like there is like somehow there is not enough of talking about that we need for the web tree like for for the funny feeling you'd uh Society for the justice and the new Society for the new internet for the new web 3 we need a decentralized storage as a foundation so file coin is playing the role of HTTP in the web3 and yeah I think we we all got to spread the word more about that because it's amazing and cool yeah and then to to basically piggyback off of what ILY was saying um a lot of uh pretty much my team's interests was very much exploratory um we were very familiar with fire coin before um have interacted either where you know data providers and some of us actually uh uh for the most hard build products uh with filecoin uh other dapps before and the you know just the just the idea of being able to to build smart contracts that you know you can build on top of and and use with the file Point network is you know it's kind of mind-blowing for us so um you know and and just go specifically with our own project uh you know a lot of it is kind of exploring what different D5 use cases now that we could really have for this uh you know where we're researching derivatives of Futures right now you know uh on chain um watching Storage and so uh yeah you know it's um it's for the most part we've interacted with 5.5 a bit you know before but uh given the the overall structure it was kind of a no-brainer uh for us in terms of coin Network and the chance to actually build something you know put smart contracts on it so yeah yeah um thank you for sharing that um yeah like actually that's also the first time that we're hearing from our early builders on why they chose fbm they didn't have old call uh how I want me to hear for us it's like a complimentary session I'm kidding um but yeah I really appreciate all the input that maybe have like one more position and then we'll move on to the next question if anyone wants to go no I I can do my choose it so yeah so thank you again Sarah let's go preventing the resources under the the wonderful SDK tools where you can make a new vehicle being like a smart contract on fdm so the Prudential so the project could like a shield exactly you need to borrow coins so it's just a highly Associated to the to the data and so so with the svm it it just enables the uh the use case all the capability that in the smart contract we can just access the manners like the data like the metadata and or not easily just to expose the ground truth to the like the the UI so it's very wonderful thank you actually I just like just quickly one last idea I saw one like one research couple of days ago where one guy was putting like according to his vision like the blockchains that have brought like the most value to the existing market and Falcon was like the first was Bitcoin and ethereum then the file coin because all other ones like they're pretty much are the copycats and we are like file coin team is delivering the real value to the existing market so it's amazing yeah thanks so much Ilya and thanks ning for sharing that as well um yeah I mean we we look forward to you know more more people building with our ecosystem for fall credit is huge um and we also see people building up different options so yeah totally encouraging that Matt so yeah I mean this is great to hear why you started uh building on a lot of the early Builders program why you started building on on Falco and fevm but how was the developer experience how has it been so far you know the good the bad the ugly uh we got all the praise just now you can be honest with us uh um how of uh how are things going uh so far maybe uh Karen do you want to uh kind of share how you how it's been sorry I'm mute okay um so I can share more about because I my my domain expertise is more in the in in on development of consumer facing um applications in the web series space so uh for building consumer apps um there's analogy that you are basically putting together their legal pieces from old various different uh solution protocols uh sdks in this space right it's put together a coherent solution that that works for for any end users so I think the the main challenge for Rd builders in the uh uh um building on FN or F even is that because it's so still early the lots of existing solutions that are compatible with other evm chains are not supported um FM yet I think this is the main main challenge so I think this is something that's about self hacker is experienced in the in the First Act in the previous hackathon in November and lots of people are facing in The Foundry cohort but I am pretty I'm very confident that well as this ecosystem um abroad another way on board allow more developers to the fam ecosystem um definitely the support for those SDK Solutions will be expanded yeah yeah I think that's that's a good point and partly the things have been just developing so fast and that's what we're hoping to be a lot better kind of going forward with this hackathon especially with the new hyperspace work um but even with that you know even up until yesterday we're still kind of patching uh you know issues last minute things have been found and it's great that we've been able to iterate so fast and it's great to have the early Builders program who've kind of stuck with us through all of this stuff so it's great and like you say hopefully going forward um this should all be a lot easier for people um Nanda how was your experience you've been I think a lot more on the like the nuts and bolts of things when you've been building Lighthouse how you found the experience so far building on fem yeah I think the good part obviously is like it's CVM compatible so we need not learn our new language like solidity can be used here and like the tools that we use on other systems like it's harder when you mix Etc they work here as well yes people want to go into like smart contract what it didn't work the tools that can be used to audit your code that can be used here as well so I think that's pretty good part um yeah I think one bad part is like the test Network getting reset so we're almost like okay but now I think this hype was this test Network which is coming up uh is now more stable one like the more than the previous wannabe uh whatever overall thing being evm compatible most of the tools are already available in a way but still now we are not figuring out okay what core things we can do with the filecon.soul library that's not possible on other VM based chains so that is one of our focus on the team right now yeah um thanks thanks so much for sharing that and uh how about how about name Elia lemon also checking in like um I think all of you came from different areas like I know a different point in time in meeting the teams um some of you have come from um acting a senior conferences and then slowly we started building together and then some of you come from hackathon uh what your experience been I can go and say finally for the most part my experiences uh and for others of my team it's actually been relatively I don't want to use this term easy but um it's been relatively seamless there we go um yeah I mean for the most Parts uh in terms of uh resources you know that we that have been available to us um we've been able to you know pretty much go ahead and utilize those resources uh the f ebm is ebm compatible so quite a few of us were um you know already uh solidity developers and for the most part just kind of moving over it wasn't um it wasn't that much of a problem for us yeah yeah I think she was that we we chose to be um compatible I think that made a huge huge difference I'm sorry I'll go ahead yeah I think that's just what you said Sarah that's super important that you guys have chosen the like first launch if evm that's super important because the solidity Community is huge and our whole background also comes from solidity so uh as Karen said like yeah it's going step by step so it's some stuff is still missing but we can see like the whole thing is moving quickly in the right direction and uh we have also great support for from the file coin team itself so we have no troubles but of course we want more but yeah that's no simple really okay that I remember all that competition um no no but I hear you on that yeah I think that was that's a uh that's an interesting um point there about kind of with the with the ethereum side I mean that was actually a change that was made originally it was going to be the native actors the rust and webassembly and all that lot that was going to be developed first and then there was a change to move towards doing the ethereum virtual machine ahead of time um as a first priority for exactly the reasons you mentioned that people could move over um they could Port stuff over um you know some people have mentioned you know yourself already that you're already running like part of it on say polygon or you know another evm blockchain and then moving over um as need be um so that's been I think that's helped people get up to speed a lot faster which has been great so uh yeah anyone else want to contribute about uh yeah uh actually so cooling great experience is very good it's also the plus one on the epidem their evm compatible so at this point we can just let our like smart contract in solidity exactly and use the just the the traditional sound of the HD like developing tools like hard hacks and the the the processing very smooth to me so far yeah so waiting for the like the the minor API in the right the actor called SDK to to come out yeah yeah for sure and I think one um important thing to know as well is that you know the fvm is meant to be via magnottic um it is right now I'm building for ethereum compatibility but if we get it right and we do it in the right way um it's not meant to be specific to ethereum only um we'll want to be able to open up to other VN um but I mean of course we love our ethereum community and we'll keep supporting and maintaining that along the way but yeah definitely more um compatibility to come and more foreign runtimes to support okay so we'll go into the last part of our panel I think this portion is like we have two questions here um big peak is around like how you would advise all these other excited super excited hackers we have a huge amount of registration that the numbers are still going up uh as of now so um a lot of people will be new a lot of people some some people are experienced as well um what is one really useful resource that you used in building fevm or or whether it was understanding FTM fevm or building it was one really useful resource foreign use this one I think it's yours right it's it's your work style right yeah yeah um which compiled it yesterday I think but yeah oh it's awesome I just checked it out it's amazing really that's the one and only you need guys thank you um but yeah with anyone else aside from the cheat sheet I I would actually say that you guys are the uh the fvm team have actually been a spectacular resource for us um being a part of the early Builders program just interacting with you not just on slack but you know Discord and any having some telegram groups it's it's been huge because for the most part the team's very responsive and you know it it that really kind of helps us because as as much there there are you know doc there is documentation out there but unfortunately there's not that much and so having a responsive Dev team out there that we can go to on a number of different um a number of different uh uh chats it's really great that means so much um not just to me but I'm sure to our team uh Matt has started and we're just two of like 20 black people that have and partners that have been working on top and trying our best to responder days I'd be understanding that building really quickly it's not particularly under the EVP to understand just off the cuff because it keeps changing daily and weekly um so yeah thank you so much for saying that um glad to know that it's helped it means a lot for you know like Sarah said there's a big team behind this um that has made this possible and the engineering team have just been moving so fast on building stuff um you know as as devrel's you know Sarah Zack and myself have um been trying to keep up and there's just new features coming the whole time right we've got to demo something and it's like oh there's something new cool that's coming in I mean I remember we turned up in Lisbon and literally like you know um metamask integration happened like the day before we landed in Lisbon and we were demoing it so um it's it it's It's amazing And the fact the engineering team are there and accessible we do all the work out in the open right well the majority of it you can see on slack so um it's uh it's it's great uh I mean we have a great community that just um that opened the tray so I would say a little before I go about there like there's just me putting in my two ten dollar advice um you'll try things out it might break if you think about like who has a responsive um put it in the Discord put it on the flat and we'll get through it ASAP so yeah thank you for try and think that with her but yeah sorry Karen you're about to play something oh you're unmute I think yeah um no I was just going to make a suggestion for all the hackers so um we talk about like a Meta Knight or perfectly talking about the challenges of building building on essay and um I think what challenges create opportunities for for hackers right so if there's something that you see it's not not available not supported on FM yet and build it build it and make it make it available to the community and that would be a highly valuable appreciated quotes of 2023. yeah yeah so for instance like a multistic genosis model 6 is now uh available uh not supported on FM yet yeah so the build one yeah that would be great and that that's been great we've seen so many of the community building talk around as well to help you know everything from the Block explorers the little tools and bits to to like demos and readme's and some fantastic blog posts and Twitter threads that have all come from the community you know and sometimes it's like the first time we see about them is when they get published it's like oh wow that's that that's awesome so it's great to see the community helping each other out and I've already seen in the Discord um you know people from the community helping each other out with information about filecoin so that's um that's that's yeah um so I know we're all the time I do want to do a quick exercise um just in case you know if you're watching there's been a lot of permission to absorb we hope you watch back or you've enjoyed it uh what is one word that everyone can kind of think away from each of you um that you know for advice for doing great in the 30-day hackathon then I also I have one quick message can I also add something yeah man I wanted everyone I just really want to use this opportunity because the second round of impact evaluator is coming so the Corey is going to be talking about this after us and I wanted to ask everyone to vote for our project mark3d.xyz because like I mean it's so hard to promote it somehow and we have this voting system where we are voting for each other so yeah I'm just using this chance guys so please vote for us okay yeah on the hikeathon okay uh in in that Spirit I'll let everyone also just stay their uh Team project name one more time in case you want to also promote your team to be voted on um so yeah one word one word advice and then your team names of the clothes off would be Juan or you know just have fun and build something that you can show to people just not stay at the local house make it live and just have fun they build with other developers and and keep continuing virtual even after the hackathon as well and use Lighthouse as GT don't miss that yeah if I was uh if I was making suggested for everybody the hackathon I would say just think outside the box be creative and uh you know there's a lot of other use cases not just for the fvm but you know blockchain technology as a whole and you never know your idea might be that one uh you know you may end up strike uh hidden lightning so right there be creative what uh anything yeah so my word will be one more to summarize the experience so it would be engaged so I feel so um though we're just working remotely like I'm likely uh everywhere in the world but I feel like a dollar experience like he's better in his like Channel I could just stay tuned and stay connected yeah oh okay yeah um okay great thank you everyone for sharing um super appreciate all of you again that was uh ning from Project shell the one from General Finance Ilya from Mac 3D um nanded from Lighthouse and Karen from Bendel um destiny check out all these projects um they have built a substantial amount of progress so far and they'll keep building through the tech as well um really quickly I will share um just one last resource that you can check out if you want to see uh you know not just these teams but what everybody else has been building um whoops all right I just want to share like do I have it oh no I don't have it but I will share in the cheat sheet um you will have a link that you can go look at all the other early bullets and what they're building because we have a total of 116 projects as of today um and more being added um the cohort rent for every single Milestone so we will graduate the cohort at mall at the main net launch in early March and then for Onyx monster like you're going to have another cohort so if you want to have a similar experience with all these people are building on definitely look out for that thank you everyone thank you everyone thank you amazing thank you so much to everybody on that panel I know there's a lot of people there but thank you especially to Sarah and Matt for co-hosting that panel uh and of course all the early Builders um I mean just to double click on I think the obvious from that panel but a lot of the people who are on that panel were people who were in the shoes of the viewers who were joining the hackathon uh that's kicking me off today um just a couple months ago so I think the protocol Labs team in particular if you didn't hear it from the builders already um it really have turned it into an art form of being able to support Builders and projects coming out of hackathons um so really really really um just wanted to stress that there's a lot of support both at the event over the next couple weeks and Beyond and I think you know using this opportunity to your best abilities and possibly you'll be on stage here at like hack FS later in this year so just wanted to double click on that so thank you again uh to all of our Builders uh and to Sarah and Matt from the team
