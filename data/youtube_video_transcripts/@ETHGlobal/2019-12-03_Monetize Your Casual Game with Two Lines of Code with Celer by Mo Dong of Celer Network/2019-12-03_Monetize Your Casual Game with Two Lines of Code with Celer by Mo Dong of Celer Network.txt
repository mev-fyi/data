all right that's our okay welcome everyone for joining the Hulk and today it's really a very hands-on workshop and Estonia workshops are talking about how you can do it on home better and make your game a eSport game to my eyes using the therapy might pique so you know first introduction about playing ball drop there and you know Center is this layer to construct and saturated locking doesn't even salaries of launching payments of action but also accelerated any kind of regenerative mark on production the under Lincoln opportunity uses is called generalized este channel and the general education is extremely suitable for the application area where there are love the interaction between parties like frequent payment paper Youth Services and paper use use cases and also you know this kind of interactive the games are like a test game like a Bunco game like any kind of board game or any kind of interactive game get involved afford to have people coming back and forth so the center architecture in general contains two parts one piece that technology consisting of the multi problem which solves a very very critical problem in the lair of the brown team and efficiently without actually causing a logical connection using our affinity towards that is the record are wrong the underlying Sarah okay so there are actually a lot more emotional you can realize evening the other life and Sarah equity of and just committing that point and then there's another full strategy in particle meeting in this topic which is they're talking about the economics background chatter network that is how a of chainstay is actually secured in the network so we recently launched our main at ARPA and in the middle are copied on straight exactly is reaching twenty factor and in a small very specific engine that he sport real my game and then we also launched a word you know commentator arbors non-talking gaming developers something cause their acts game SDK and this is a targeted for the normal game developer to launch their game on blockchain without any kind of audience with only two lines of code which is the stuff that we're not on one day and then the set of web has became which is gonna be replaced a very school invited Sarah Walker a three flight right now is better weaponry cloud SDK wrong pass you to run client local aid which is goal fight then your counselor has to get to this goal tiny between architecture vez but we are very soon going to change that format into a native of aqua into a pure JavaScript that you care which pure JavaScript client into experimental so what it is their acts just like a kind of big mean for Okinawa this is what what's that access looks like you can download this application at their ass and you know you can play with your friend or played math with anyone in the word with these games like it can be a single-player game where high-score wings or it can be this interactive game like a board game this game is like an agent that I have working called a connected five you're going home and you know in the end of the game what happens is that a Weber wing and we'll get the other guys you know entities actually so what happened under Lane is that if there is that a all chained conditional payment paid a towards each other towards the opponent generating Naples to enable additional payment options so service income process you see no delay no transaction cost know kind of got any blockchain stillness that is because we are all running this part under the air to construct which is a very important skating so these are like old data information we have everything wrong is that for about a month so right now we have processed at 1.4 million dollar prices total in total you know for about lemon cake players playing all 300 came at it from different countries so this stuff is actually being used as we're probably one of the most frequently used it you have around the world man many of the users in the application are not actually crypto be overstating previously don't have the crypto currency expenses we're trying to maintain on the party onboarding experience and also gaming to be honest is so familiar to them that they cannot distinguish whether they are using a blocking application or they're not so these are the distribution so these are some of the testimonials the way we receive the prompt user one one one word to sum it up you know at the user experience is very similar to me but they're apart also a lot of challenges we see an another lesson learned and this is software I'm going to talk about that he say they often won't talk to the messenger when we are actually operating this non decentralized network okay so the question here is that okay I shoot these two things we all build some game using sarah.hatton wrong answer as long as it's gentle on Michael do I need to understand setters technology 22 handle auction cameras ready to inside the option client - I need to would like open a channel when he's read an office park on track and manage users private cancel on support we got this and all of those questions are very simple anyway so what do you mean is actually just any html5 game out there any NGO fighter just poetic on the github and have two lines of code and you're watching as needed you know and then they can do a lot better and then it starts integrated their game is both fully decentralized right in fully optimized that you know before competition game so how does that work by the way we're actually offering a $1,000 monkey for the sake gamer reward and also will become creatures in the application with about 10,000 the others if you have to admit okay Linda is what I have a little feature that each department a special kind of feature in the front page of the application so well now we enter the hands-on part of this workshop okay so you know feel free to go to the Art Center Network and there is some example called stare at the example code better and this is a truly amazing so yeah like a to a very simple start and we have the game yes all right so anyone recognize me this game oh by the way this is this we just like to have a delta just uh you know thanks for drunk jumping game where like that when you between a prompt type you can play the side of the jumping game to give hundreds like we play with us to our this isn't just extremism for happen and you're kind of famous for all 42 so how can we change this not love change actually like they were launching touch the html5 into a Saturday well so to change it to you know by the way that developer colleges here developer center actual app you can always refer to the developer golf gear and you know just like the kind of compliment section and this is a kind of a solo game which is at most a simple way to do it etcetera that is you have a solo game that is playing football and you know there are a couple guys here where there's a better access car which actually underlying triggers all of the starting logical matching of you know cryptocurrency payment and they are pre logic on the night to actually set the stage for the game and then you have the sarin gas match will get you some of the basic math and operations one question you guys might immediately after that up okay you are playing with which basically identify is the stuff even legal are we actually touching on the camping space well no so there's actually a very distinct difference between cuddling and skill based game in the United States and also in 180 different countries so in 39 states if your game meet certain qualifications and probably go kamiya but like we will reveal the game's predominant has the case then you know your game is entirely people so for example for the fish on game you just saw the only requirement is that each two before actually competing against each other as long as the sequence of different cabins see that they are seeing is the same basically they are seeing the same thing they're playing the same kind of game or using the same first half of the join as a target if they're coming the same starting stage and with the same kind of referencing that's kinda generator still on the game that mr. huggable so the then you know what this function is here it's fine to - why not - functionality these to get to the share gonna see so we are actually implementing this in a freedom at the way that I said this chair going to see you all generated a 5/8 server but I actually generated by message exchanging between the two opponent with the community review process like basically you kind of mix this to commit committed to patch together and then it will do that you have generators they're flying sighs so there's no one character to the randomness of the game including that the server health so and once you have that shared when in series is kind of use that as your eminence that sort and then you know entertain you to tell you it's that mean to school so that's kinda like that mean they here there anything else no that's it there's literally like maybe three to live code so you know how do we actually mean for this let's say you know in this beginning of the game this one kinda skeptical like resetting is asking the state for aesthetic memory cameras and you know vision or fiber and what we need to do is just kind of get the match and also like you know from the patch you kind of a used as a go whole feeding functions you'll just you know Steve does in car it'll run in this process okay and then in the end what's gonna happen is you know there's unanimity game what happens that okay you just have 74 I hear like 50 people whatever for that just kind of all the minutes for you I mean again this is that's the whole problem of equating centers into your html5 game now I know there might be also another community question talking about here that is that okay what about you it seems that this function is very straightforward than anyone can call this function and then just a kind of book you don't have dressed up in the you know girls I mean to edit whatever it's for it so this is this is the part that we kind of go beyond just watching but actually also have a freaking countenance of managing to kind of gap generate to the distribution of all scores all thinking so if there are these actually an outlier you know the tradition will pick that out and we put that pocket basically were only not that automatically at each other so we actually already see this in some more games where someone is trying to cure about not necessary just directly by acting the game because the game itself also have authentication it html5 process the html5 game also once inside of all a you know publication this something sport is not it just JavaScript the call it actually goes to a okay you know application authentication process but even with that someone's trying to build a fall to kind of really postmaster it by the game now you know to week that out we have typically a single on these guys and then just not that much with each other so we kind of having different in that little off matching with difference here off of your abilities so people can all enjoy the game so if you're doing again now you know there's actually a very fair from before you lose the play now the unit seeing also to positive that okay so yeah it's very even is integrated but like what are the important developers well so instead of we're trying to create a sustainable developers ecosystem here to generate is a single micro vision quality rivers so it started from the end of October we are starting to kind of charge in the election process and the targets will go to the developer who's that makes the game so basically if there are more people playing the game you know they're two people are both moving in one order that we don't wanna get one more six dollars where are the boys has those what it does goes to developers so that kind of like the incentive with your positive app developer and it also has been working very well that we have right now we have about 148 150 3 games submitted and through our you know it's not reported that before actually that we can gain malware we have it the pipeline thought about 20 games there is that coming up that can be released that using the same time tomorrow no so the integration is multicam like basically the next country in the rough okay I have the Britain that's part of the code then how can I run this stuff actually so we have to do it extremely easy to use the you know sandbox environment or the developers so this is just a multimedia harmony can register your a compact portal of better apps go out and then create your own game and just go through this creation process gave your game name gaming name description and choose the device orientation that they wanted to landscape of we're doing this dinosaur game and it can like choose a different color of anything and in truce between so the game high school windows warming and also they encourage different class of game called turn-based game which actually use generalize the state channel contract which I haven't actually talked on how great they are on that and if you mean a postmark contra will actually you know allow you to connect to the camera at the state channel construct which is at the Advanta part or even more recently our offices that are at cinema became you know specify some parameter and just click quick now what happens if you click the Create is you are gonna see something like that so you know after a credit game you can upload NASA just a package of the code that they transferred to code we just have and pop over here and then what you can do is you can just immediately start cutting the game do anything happen to have certain accent although what you drive all right so the gist of the idea is that I mean satirize there is this kind of a magnifier button and you can click on this magnifier button to scan this QR code and immediately you will be able to cast it on your phone directly you know by trying out the competition with your practically so in this whole matter dear said deterring no part of the process that you need to interact with the blocking and also a set payment or do anything like that the entire process is just covered in part of names and hidden away from this developers so it's actually extremely with you your thoughts on open source game with the right license and maybe few lyoha very interesting brain teaser game you know and submit at the total cost error at hand and you know just to show that you know a developer and Senegal network or Afghan of any question that this court you know we're in of a sixty murder warrants are probably one of the easiest Avanti pneumothorax on but also pretty fun and also have quantization features that they're wearing a you know you know support in the future so and also like will release the game as kind of a feature came from the default endo so another advance for the fastest tempo is that for those who are in launching therapy you guys probably know about this game or if we have been using this everywhere to demonstrate the capability of something called generalized that they can home and generalize to a channel even constructor where you can put this in car game into a options for contract and this makes every interaction Authority factorize the interaction for today now you know we have open sources that can target of it and can reproduce this in car process for greatness game but looking at this poor report this people the first report see happy seen our github even generalize the state channels our contract template and also example which is basically this particular example and you can top this example and know about the template to build any concrete authorizes a general contract and then you have the actual example from a pool which is the html5 part of the program it is part demonstrated how to connect the front end to the back end of a camera at that stage at home and then you know open source and you can see all we have to utilize the under link of ability of this better SDK to build the setter access to the game in specific SDK and finally with all these combined you can just said against I mean according to the portal and the pasta the application on the developer portal so you know expensive they talked about the center effects SDK but we also have a well a stated today that is that makes a certain network itself they open platform and extremely easy to build you can do a financial derivative to derivative market is no the times exchanges and very importantly microcredit evolve any kind so if something called option conditional payment work you know if you are familiar with like what we can do often came in the with extremely low cost across the lake but instead of what you can do is that you can spend a altering payment across the network but the option payment is how the result is more likely to the committed this payment but that payment made depends of a condition of the project have a verifiable condition what is a verifiable a vision it can be a garden hose awkward and you can connect with vistas chain links article to say that okay and send you an option conditional payment Commission depending on whether its Laurel Ranger and you know it can't create this kind of a friendly so robotic applications it can also create a very interesting stuff like a a kind of a pure pure derivative the market that you were kind of just ascending each other the conditional payment and these kind of components they can cancel each other we will automatically merge them together to save the quiddity in the network so this is a this is a very very computing blog and we have already seen a lot of interesting use cases build around us like a unit with car insurance that carry electricity means bringing payment system and peer-to-peer social banking very fine weighted metering the hosting services that would stop surgeons all that does it not point basically thank her you're painting a hosting service and the hosting services already called there's the article two tasks testified the holding services of availability you're sending all of my co-payments call conditional payments based on the availability of the service if the service is not available for a certain feeling type the Oracle flips even though you're still kind of sending a payment the payment actually results apartment you're actually not actually sending the payment through them through the hosting services and many other that most like these so with I think right on time for the talk and you know you're very welcome to you know use our speak and I hope you rot in axon and also and also community on this board to support it before tonight so with that any questions so today at what part of the federal looks like this so you to the southern half work and [Music] therapies for section and including several acts of service became which is also access Peking and you'll find the web as the King had also a client lightly how that works today is we are now we make this client that has kind of a local point because in card the Batman technical staff if you are dope so is come out go client and the copilot post an RPC service for the Java code tries to talk to this goal line so to use a centered in a welcomer today we need to run a goal point and that what you know topless go right so up it almost was somewhere like that the alternative to doing but we are reviewing a pure web what what point you know there soon end of this month and a feel free and that what client self is going to be a standalone client that solid it's inside of the wagons on it like you know all providers and directly use that master yes okay yeah [Music] yeah I think that's a great question this is something that we also are talking with some other games but including micro payments into kind of a collectible buying process and you know it's definitely possible you can't like them say it at all you know you can there's also an option you could expand as ten cents we just like this they're falling - ended of all teams going to be like here you know it will be a you know a bottle and that's a perfect use case for opportunity to sing part is that it's something like okay I'm gonna pay you ten cents but that is nothing we immediately resolve that is gonna condition with it depends on the ownership of that collateral and you know that say I paid my nest and uh you know that the collectibles ownership actually change to me only when when that happens the auction coming okay actually go through so that is actually a perfect use case to have you know as is like a almost like atomic swap of opting payment and also the well so definitely feel free to be living is kind of Allah and will kind of be better than this is my you know literally the first time do we're trying to technology via gaming FTP and that's why I think that underlying but you know first field are using the native whether he takes especially using this generalized the mulching conventional payment all shot I know here today I'm gonna just be like you know generally the target there I have to talk to also scheduler this afternoon to talk about them like the operational aspect authorization oh let me get over here and also we have this for channel and this is this email that directly goes to the heart of evolution optically my yeah are you have an cut reduce the shrewdest others email or join the deported channel they are ardently the the parking is always [Applause]
