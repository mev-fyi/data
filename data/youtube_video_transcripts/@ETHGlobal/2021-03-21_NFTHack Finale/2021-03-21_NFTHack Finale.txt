hello everybody good morning good evening and good afternoon um i am super excited to be welcoming all of you here and uh welcome to the nft hack finale my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of heath global and i am super excited to be wrapping up this weekend with some amazing demos and an amazing set of updates for what came out of this hackathon just as a quick note for those of you who are joining us for the first time here we are doing this through a new creative way so that we can all experience this event together this is designed to be a lot more interactive you are looking at me through eatglobal.tv and if you put anything on the chat there we'll be able to read that and relay those anywhere from comments to questions uh to whatever's happening on the live stream so uh be sure to sign in uh just as a quick reminder we are going to be doing nft tokens for everybody who attended this event especially for those of you who logged in to the chat to engage with us so be sure to double click on your profile sign in and say hi and claim your pro-app token for being part of this weekend so nft hack was an eth global event and for those of you who don't know if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard 1000 developers into the web3 ecosystem and for this weekend we extended that to the developers and artists and anybody who likes to build we have come across such an amazing set of people that we got to work with and see work over the weekend and we participated in a lot of talks and summits and uh for for those of you who are watching this just today uh this weekend was set up as a hackathon and a summit we had a hackathon where people from all over the world participated and built something of their own choice and on friday we had an amazing set of talks by a lot of people in this industry whether that's nfts or investors or builders who are pioneering what's happening in the whole non-fungible ecosystem and talk about their perspectives and where they are and how they would like this place to be evolved uh the summit was proudly presented by zora and we're super excited that everybody really enjoyed the summit and you can now watch all of those talks uh live on youtube and by heading over to nft.edtheglobal.com so let's go back to the hackathon this finale is a showcase for some of the projects we want to highlight from what came out of this hackathon as a summary we ended up counting everything again from friday and i'm super proud to announce that we have just been blown away by the amount of excitement and engagement we got this weekend we had 590 over 590 hackers participate in this hackathon building designing creating and just really collaborating with people from all over the world uh for the summit we had over 1200 people join in and watch all of the talks and uh the hackers who are participating are in coming in from 55 different countries and this all spain 19 different time zones we saw 24 7 activity throughout the the weekend and uh there were so many amazing times where people were jamming and getting help or helping others at different times of the day and it was just so awesome to see that happening all on discord um and in fact when we mapped it out we were just blown away by how much diversity and representation we have from so many different parts of the world so we're super excited to be bringing everybody together and uh can't can't wait to uh get the show going in addition we had 70 different mentors available where they were our sponsors there were people who were really proficient to help out with solidity and front-end development back-end development specific protocols and we had sponsors from 26 companies who were there to help ensure that the developers and the designers and the builders and the artists are able to use some of their protocols and make their lives easier as they embark on building a project over the last 48 hours um and just to kind of put all that in perspective collectively we have over 75 000 in prizes that are being given away by our sponsors this weekend and will be showing and talking about who is going to win and who is uh what are they going to win um from participating at this event so stay tuned until the end of this stream uh to find out which prizes um have been awarded to what projects i want to specifically thank zora for being our presenting sponsor um they were an amazing host to work with they were also our presenting sponsor for the summit we had a really good time collaborating with them on getting all the talks in place and making sure that this weekend is specially uh designed to be super informative and and fun for all the people participating and then also i want to thank rare bull ethereum foundation protocol labs circle nftx nmt protocol unit swap e s dp covalent charged particles 8 block art polygon decentraland super rare near pinata the graph niftex superfluid boson protocol foundation nf tao ipvs main and niftify for being our sponsors and helping all of our attendees really get started and making their lives easier from getting their projects from an idea to a working prototype in just the last 48 hours and and honestly this event has been extremely phenomenal for all of us um we wanted to do this really small event for a weekend hackathon we originally were thinking about doing a 200 event and uh suddenly this turned into a 2 000 person event all in a two-week window and we were absolutely blown away by the the amount of love and the attention and honestly just the interest we got it was super hard to say uh no to a lot of folks from being able to participate in the hackathon and we learned so many things doing this for the first time ourselves as youth global as i mentioned we have over 590 people participate and what really amazes me and what makes me super happy is that 40 of them were super new to ethereum they were developers and artists and designers who have been in the web two worlds and they were finally transitioning into the web 3. and this just was so good for us to see that people were trying out different things and seeing what was possible and we have an amazing representation of what we're going to see today and what came out of this entire weekend and not only that not only just the interest was amazing this was actually our biggest event ever i am super proud to announce that we had 182 projects come out of it i was joking this with our judges that i think we have single-handedly doubled the number of projects in the entire nfd ecosystem in the past three days and i can't wait for all of you to continue building what you've done today and this weekend and really taking that to the next level and telling us about it so we can also share that excitement with you and with the rest of the community and before we go into the demos i want to take a minute to thank all of our judges who were there this entire morning and afternoon talking to all these teams talking to all these projects hearing how they've how they started what they did how the challenges that they faced and and what were they they were excited about and in all 20 of our judges i want to say it's tony alex patrick kingel jimani rob simona jake rachel justin alex joyce marguerite ben frankie billy scott larry el pizo and nicola they were there for the last four hours talking to so many teams and and doing the hard job for basically picking who the best and the most fun projects we should highlight today are so i'm super excited that we got to do all of that in a really short window today we have to scale up and do 10 judging rooms in parallel and i'm again super grateful for the interest we've had so from going through all the submissions and the past few hours of judging we finally have a list of 10 projects that we want to showcase today in this finale these are some of our judges favorite teams it it was a very hard decision for everybody to figure out how we get to determine this promote and find the teams and get them ready in a very short window and without further ado i'd like to congratulate nifty dm crypto corgis sold to drop hash link cipher blocks boson protocol funk rare pizzas drip and boundless these are the 10 teams they'll be coming on one by one just in a minute and we'll be seeing what they've done over the weekend and we'll kind of get to see all the creative things that have come out of this and just from some of these names i am personally super excited to see how cool these demos are going to be and uh and i want to get that started immediately and before we get to our first demo i want to just take a special moment and thank every single person here who worked on something presented it to our judges and just spent the time learning what was possible this weekend just because you are not one of these 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough or we didn't like something is just a way for us to make sure that we are there to give you the support you need to continue building on these projects a lot of teams continue building their hackathon projects over time we've seen people do this thing from weeks to months to years and generally overall our goal is to make a big community of all builders and and people who want to build new things and bring them together so we can help them succeed and really get unblocked if they need any help so you've all been part of our discord over the past three days and i encourage you to ping anybody on our discord to get help in the future and naturally please do not stop continuing to build this is the the really important takeaway here and i want to thank all of you for taking out your weekend and doing something fun so we talked about the 10 projects before we go into the demo i want to say that if you want to check out any of the projects from this event all 182 of them are available by heading over to hack.ethglobal.com you can just enter this url and you'll see the full list of everything that came out of this this weekend so with that i want to invite nifty dm and crypto coordinates to come up first uh they'll come on uh one by one they'll have four minutes to demo what they've done and because this is just meant to be a demo we won't be doing any questions we'll demo and we'll go through the 10 projects and then we'll get to invite our sponsors who are going to tell you about the prizes so with that please welcome nifty dm and i'm super excited to see our first very first demo for nft hack derek and team take it away hey this is a nifty dm my name is tech and i'm derek uh we have a project that enables communication and connection through nfts yeah so um the problem that we were really trying to solve with this project was uh being able to um connect uh creators um and collectors uh together so right now there's no real easy way for them to talk to each other uh unless you know they happen to know each other maybe prior they happen to have each other's emails or phone numbers or something but through our app they can do it totally um through the platform uh just by knowing who uh who the current uh wallet owner is of their nfc and sometimes uh the creators don't even know who the buyers are yeah and so we really think it's important for collectors and um creators to stay in touch so this way creators can update collectors with new drops uh and updates on new projects uh they get direct fan feedback uh they can take fan requests they can stay up to date with special perks um and um things like that uh also uh we thought about the case of uh you know reselling nft so creators can stay in touch with all the new owners of their creations so if they sold it to one owner and that owner sold it to another person and that owner sold to another person that creator can stay in touch with all of them if they want to um so yeah we also we have a demo um of our app so here on a platform um like we are a creator uh that created these nfts and uh and uh here's our dashboard of our app here's the created tokens that we have these are also nfts that we owned and we can connect with the creators of the as a collector connect with the creators of the nfts that we own and here we can talk to the owners of the nft that we own that we created so here i'm going to say hi to the owner of the doge on the rocket and derek is the owner so we gotta yeah we've got a connection we can continue talking here and yeah these are our other chats to different um tokens uh essentially we're connecting two different wallets and opening up a chat between them uh as you can see this is the uh wallet address um and this is uh yeah we can use a dns as the address as well and with if derek owns another nft that i've created we can continue continue the same conversation so this is uh our app and we'll go back to derek yeah so um yeah so right now you know it's basic app for a hackathon but we definitely see this um as being something uh you know bigger in the future uh so we want to be able to like give email notifications uh if you know creator wants to reach out to you or vice versa um you know chat with any ethereum wallet uh you know integrate with any nft platform uh we want to be able to mint buy and sell all through chat directly so um you know without even going through marketplaces um but more than that uh you know we want this to be a platform so um you know we want it to be extensible it's a third-party um third-party thing integration so like we can have bots like nft trackers to tell you who's recently bought your nft uh revenue sharing so if you know you have multiple owners of something that needs to be shared revenue with uh you can easily kind of contact all of them talk to them and even potentially pay them out um through the app um so yeah there's so many things in the future that we could have um in this application itself uh but yeah we're just getting started amazing thank you so much um yeah i think we're gonna see some really obvious pattern patterns on actually now using all the tokens you hold in ftc whole to form communities so you can interact with them so this is a super cool project and i hope you continue to work on it so without further ado let's welcome our number two demo of today and that's team crypto corgis so take it away bye guys hello everyone this is crypto corgis the first nfts to live and die on the blockchain our team is francesco and sarah crypto corgis is a generative art nft offering it's similar to avistar's or proof of beauty at any time there are 256 available crypto corgis to be claimed a crypto corgi must be claimed within 256 blocks so here you see the newest crypto corgi on our website it has 56 minutes remaining unclaimed crypto corgis die after 256 blocks so here you see the oldest crypto query on our website it has less than a minute remaining crypto corgi attributes are derived from the hash of its block number the block number is also the nft id here you can see the block number becoming a base attribute in this case it's blue in total there are 26 types of base attributes there are 14 types of attributes and there are 31 one-of-a-kind special crypto corgis in total there are almost four thousand trillion possible combinations of cryptocurrees we'd love if you follow us and join the community awesome thanks sarah now i'll be doing a demo of the site so this is the crypto progress website um this is on rikivi um the testnet but you can also go to cryptocookies.com and try it on mainnet and people are already buying the corgis and yeah if you want one just go stick mirrors there um so yeah this is the landing page we sort of already explained what critical views are but you can kind of get a detailed view of what the different attributes are here uh but jumping right in this is this is the main sort of selection page where you can view what cryptic queries are available at this time and and sort of claim one and as we mentioned there are 256 available at any one time starting from the most recent block number which you can see here and also up here down to that block number -256 you can see these last ones that sort of only have less than a minute remaining and and yeah so going on the detail page of the most recent one you can see that you can see the attribute table for this core view so you can see that space is great its mood is pleased you can also see how likelihood how likely that that attribute is so i can see that for tools if a corgi has a tool it has a one percent likelihood of having the lemon ice pop so i actually really like this guy so i'm going to buy him um yep bye and while we're on ether scan i'll sort of explain what's happening so this transaction is going to the crypto coies breeder smart contract which is an erc 1155 contract that we wrote um it's pretty standard mint but it just makes sure that you can only mint the block that that is within the allowed range um and then yeah it uses that id to sort of mint the corgi and send it to you the purchaser um but once once that is done uh you'll you'll be able to see your corgi here in fact you can already see it so there's this clan page where you'll be able to see all the corgis getting claimed um and that's it that's yours and if you want to see it on openc you can do that too this is the mainnet openc page but there's one for rent b as well so feel free to check that out thanks a lot that was super cool um that is extremely cute and i hope that goes to mainnet very soon so i don't mean that thank you yeah there you go so thanks so much and uh we are going to move on to our next demo and that is soldier drop so uh sold to drop team if you are here feel free to share your demo yeah absolutely thank you all for coming and uh we've got a little youtube video to show off here hi everybody and welcome to our presentation for a submission to nfp hack so what is the problem our good friend and living legend soulja boy of crankthatfame recently posted that he was looking for a place to sell his album in exchange for cryptocurrencies but no such platform exists right now taking this as inspiration we created a platform to purchase albums as nft collectibles where you can also have artists sign the album nft with a personalized message in terms of concrete functionality here's how it works first you can purchase tradable erc 20 crank tokens which you can then redeem for an nfp album soulja boy signs the nft then the autograph is stored on matic now we'll move on to the actual demo of our website okay so here is sodmg this is soulja boy's website stands for stacks on deck money gang this is where you can buy and sell your crank tokens so you can buy you can buy a fractional amount 3.1 3.2 or whatever you can sell and these are just er20 tokens and they're on a uni swap pool so i'll connect my wallet you can see enos support we have you know master bruce.e this is my art account and so once you have one whole crank token you know you can choose to either sell it later at a higher price hopefully or you can redeem it for an nft so let's do that redeem process all right so redeem one all right and on the left we'll have sometimes while it connects a little buggy there we go there's our transaction request we'll confirm so now that transaction is sending all right so we'll let that send and once you have your nft you can get it signed so this is what really makes it special you can have your nft signed by soulja boy with a personal message and his signature attached oh really quick we'll see this is working all right said it was uh all right reflected in a short while there we go so let's see yep so we sent a crank token to zero zero zero so it was burned and we received the nft back and we received the nft back so yeah that's great and you see we have some nfts here so now you can you know request a message a personal message from soulja boy and you can do a request so let's see what that looks like from soldier boy's perspective after you do the request he goes here um this is a private page only boy can see and he can sign you can say soul jeff write the message cool guy at autograph so this is going into the database and then uh this this is going on to uh polygon to be stored this signature all like all this data is on polygon it's not an ipfs reference it is on polygon and it will live there forever all right so we go back to the home page we can see other signed copies so these are messages that soulja boy signed uh you can see they're all the same these are just tests but uh yeah and we can see this is one of them you can see you can see that as the signature's going out and you can see it on the album art which is cool and you see a little message here so yeah that's it amazing thank you so much for uh for that super cool demo i think uh the two comments i have are we gonna make this for every other artist and uh somebody's gotta ping mike damaris from rainbow wallet to uh to ping soulja boy to look at this so i hope this gets uh in the hands of a lot more people and uh thanks again for doing a live demo definitely uh not easy to do a live demo and having work the first time so congrats um and with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and that is team hashlink so whenever you're ready kick us off with your demo yes hi everyone i'm philippe and well this is hashtag welcome to hash inc the modern version of signing autographs for celebrities i got a problem i'm a celebrity a very very very tiny celebrity most the big shows i did were in the 90s do you ever hear of a cartoon on nickelodeon called hey arnold i played harold the bully hey i know come here i'll pound you that's me i'm kind of like a middle class actor i work but i'm not famous and i need other forms of income because acting is really up and down fortunately for me signing autographs is one of the ways i supplement my income but there are problems i know that my fans want to create a personal connection with me and that's hard fraud is one of the biggest issues forgers go out there and they sign my autograph in fact the fbi said that over 80 percent of celebrity autographs out there are forged and that's 900 million dollars a year another problem physical autographs i've got to wait for autographs to come in the mail take it out of the envelope sign in the picture put it back in the envelope then go to the post office it takes time and it's a security issue for me because i got to give out my address also autographed middlemen they take like 30 to 50 of my profit and i'm on a multitude of autograph apps cameo autographs to you i'm going to in-person conventions doing virtual conventions fans are sending me autograph requests on facebook dming me on instagram they're buying my autograph on ebay it's like overwhelming and confusing to me and my fans fortunately our team has come up with an awesome solution hash inc is a celebrity autograph app that's modern on the blockchain all our fans have to do they go on the app they look at their favorite celebrities they send a request the celebrity gets signaled signs the autograph sends it back to the fan easy peasy lemon squeezy here are some of the advantages it's transparent and authentic it's on the blockchain nobody can copy it it's you can't forge it bye bye forgers there's a secondary market the fans can go ahead and sell that to another fan for a higher price and the celebrity gets a piece of that residual income privacy i don't have to give out my personal address and there's no more middlemen bye bye cut the fat we're really excited about the user experience we're going to build for the celebrities because honestly we know celebrities are not really tech savvy also our fans want to show off their autographs so we're going to have a digital notebook where they can show off one autograph or all of them and blast them out to their friends on social media now here's our team we have an amazing team with incredible tech deep backgrounds in nfts and blockchain they're developers entrepreneurs and then there's me in the entertainment business what the market the market's huge there's a two billion dollar autograph market in sports alone plus the app cameo which is a celebrity app they did a hundred million in gross revenue last year and it was just valued at over a billion here's another slide that just shows you it's a big big market we did market research we talked to fans and celebrities and we put together a survey over 30 fans responded and they were comfortable paying with eth and that's pretty cool because these are not crypto enthusiasts these are fans that are buying autographs from celebrities so the fact that 80 percent said that they were cool with getting a digital autograph that's awesome here's the future for the app we're going to have moving video a celebrity can do a personal shout out and then sign it and send it back to the fan another cool feature autographing an existing nft and here's one we're really excited about group sig having multiple people sign the same nft imagine a beatles cover you send it out to the beatles they all sign it that's pretty awesome in fact i think we coined the term group sig and that's a wrap thank you very much we had a wonderful time hacking together this project it was awesome we'd really like to thank the sponsors we used for the creation of this app zora pinata and protocol labs circle now we'd love to open up your questions and or your feedback thank you justin yep it was legitimately cool and nostalgic for quite a bunch of us that's really cool to see i feel like finally find a way found a way to uh make reunions on the blockchain so this is this is going to be awesome so hopefully all of us can use it when whenever this is ready for everybody to test that we'll be happy to share this on the discord and on twitter so continue building this thing and this is really awesome thank you very much thank you very quick message to soulja boy maybe we should talk hey here we go all right thanks guys thank you so much thank you so much next up we have project cipher blocks so uh cypher team whenever you're ready for your demo [Music] hi guys ready boy 3000 um based out of singapore i'm a generative artist i wanted to create a generative artwork and i wanted the content of the artwork to to live on the chain and not sitting on a server somewhere i also wanted it to be user generated and the user to have some control over the outcome of the r code so cypherbox is a 64 byte digital sculpture you can you can create it and design it like you want so there's 512 blocks and it's violent for sculptures um you can randomize it and the cool thing is that you can encode content inside inside the blocks still see that it generates a binary string and the binary string is um is hashed and that goes into the url of the um [Music] the content is still there yeah that is cycle box thank you so much this is super cool i feel like i'm just trying to understand the possibilities here a lot of cool ways to represent this so um i was looking forward to a lot of generative art hacks and this is definitely one of the best ones i've seen so thanks again [Music] and uh we are just getting ready to get boson pull up and going so um in a second whenever the boson team is here feel free to share your screen great hi everyone so we're three people working for boson protocol which is the open tokenized economy for dcommerce and our project for nft hack is a new pool created with pull together that allows participants to stake boson x erc 20 tokens as well as win boson protocols erc721 nfts which are encoded with game theory and take the form of promises that are redeemable for physical items or in effect real world products and services and we call these commitment tokens hey i'm ludo and uh to start we have deployed an esc20 token called buzz and x um to allow people to deposit buzz on x tokens in the pool so the pool we have created with um pulled together let's put together a builder ui and we can see here the the dashboard of pull and the contract on rigby and this contract the pool contract owns some nfts that comes from the boson smart voucher and so after we have transferred the nfts to the to the contract we can define this nfts as price for uh the the pool so it means that uh the winner of the pool will win this nfts it's committed nfts from buzan protocol here in the in the start tabs we see that people are staking bosonix tokens so on the general user front-end so if you're not an admin we have a clone of the pull together reference pool ui here and we've modified it to add functions that are specific to boson protocols nft namely relating to minting and redeeming so the underlying contract that we've modified for the nft hack is a hybrid erc 1155 ovrc721 contract what you can see here is are using minting um erc 1155 voucher sets so this is for people who want to sell or in this case gift multiple physical items and then extract an elc 721 commitment token from that set for sending to the pool um so we as ludo has mentioned we've transferred an erc721 to the pool as a prize for the winner in terms of redeeming the user has to redeem their commitment token when they have won it so when someone has won all of the prizes in a pool they receive all of the funds and all of the non-fungible tokens when we click redeem physical item in at the top here this triggers the delivery of the physical item that was intended to be gifted by the seller for the prize and in doing so this updates the commitment token state so you can see here we have the redeem activity pending and that will go through shortly overall we wanted to make this project to demonstrate how we can build on top of existing pools to layer on more nft functionality as well as join the pool up with real world items and more generally we see boson protocol being used for a whole range of use cases wherever transactions relate to the sale and purchase of physical items also real-world services amazing holly and team thanks so much for that demo and congrats on chipping this i feel like we're just getting started on seeing how we can merge nfts with t5 and this is a really cool way to uh get everybody to play with it and get excited about what's possible so thanks again and uh we are ready to move on to our next demo and that is team funk so whenever you're ready go for the demo hey hey well it's been a it's been a long time i've actually been traveling through space for quite a while now 36 hours to be exact no sleep sleep for the week i don't need it wait are you are you awake back there hyper dimensional orb hyper dimensional i don't know what the heck it sounds oh oh my one of my humans just sent me a link how did i not even i don't even notice this funk key the funk key what is this click it the funk key i don't know something's happening i can feel it something's happening oh what the funk nfts aren't just pretty they're also code that can interact with an unlimited number of apps funk is all about making nfts functional do you think they mean non-functional non-fungible tokens you think the humans are on to non-fungible tokens i think they might be on to wow they're taking huge leaps i go away from earth for 36 hours they're on the non-fungible tokens all right let's see what this is about i'll connect my my little my little wallet here you care about this at all no just sleeping huh okay oh let's take a look all right funk yeah yeah it reads my it reads my nfts from my wallet i don't even know how they can do that is this like some kind of these are andromeda originals these are straight from the andromeda blockchain so i don't even know how to whatever they figured it out view the metadata it's got all the info it's reading it right okay i'm trying to figure out trying to figure out how advanced they are let's see oh you can inspect it that's snazzy plenty good what's this you can drop nfts oh so i could i could probably i could sell this then i guess just i didn't make it but i could i could set a drop for maybe 20 24 hours from now that might be a good idea let's sign this thing see what this bad boy can do okay oh man i gotta come back in 24 hours what did i i don't know why i said it 24 hours okay what else can this thing do oh destroy yeah yeah that's that's my kind of thing that's that's what i'm all about i live in destruction wait no let's go back we don't need to go there what else can this thing do chat uh oh so i guess the token holders could all chat with each other okay that's that that makes sense trade okay one to one one to many i get it i'm on to this i get what you guys are doing on earth you don't you can't show me anything i've never seen before okay all right i'm i'm i'm a fan of where the humans have got to so let me see if i can understand what i'm looking at here and distill it i'm going to distill it for you orb what i think i'm looking at here is an nft interface that's designed to center the nft they're oh man they're like taking leaps and bounds so it's all about the nft and what can the nft do you buy an nft or you collect an nft and then the first place you go after you get the nft is funk i get it okay so and then you explore all of the functionality exclusive or universal that might be available to that nft that's it it makes a lot of sense i i i i don't really know what to do actually i feel like i'm missing out on something i i think i have to get back to i think i have to get back to earth pretty fast if i'm gonna well what's the what's the what's the what's the what's the confirmation time i'm from hyperspace i don't know it's been a long time it's been a long time since i've gone since i've pushed to the blockchain from from outside of the solar system okay let's see does anybody know does anybody know all right well you're you're boring orb i guess i just got to get back to earth no point in wasting any more time back to here well i think that is the most meta and the most creative thing we've ever seen i'm i'm just looking at all the comments we're getting on the chat and i can unanimously say everybody is enjoying how you presented this so congrats on making this super entertaining and uh i think just uh just to kind of give an overview of the project this was a way to make nfts more functional by getting them to integrate with other ways to work within ethereum and crypto so adding on anywhere from drops to time locks is such a cool way to do this thing so dream thanks again and uh hope this becomes usable by everybody else and we can share that on your behalf so congrats again on being one of the finalists next up we have rare pizzas so the rare pizzas team is here and whenever you're ready feel free to demo your project all righty uh hello everyone so we're opening technologies and we're part of the rare pizzas mafia uh and for nft hack what we built was a game called sly saver it's a no loss rare pizzas nft virtual reality game on polygon and so really quick for for reference what rare pizzas is rare pizzas is probably the most opened and diverse generative r pizza nft project and so this project was created about a month ago it has over 300 artists over 20 developers and over 1700 discord members and just last week when we opened this up for our soft launch we actually raised over half a million dollars and under five hours selling some of the rare pizza boxes and really the overall effort of this project is to kind of feed the people and feed the hungry and we're doing this we're actually uh giving away 10 000 free pizzas on may 22nd so bitcoin pizza day and so this is what really the rare pizza boxes look like and they're actually sold on a bonding curve which would peak at 10 000 bitcoin per pizza so if you think about how much money that is it's quite hefty amounts so we got to find ways to sort of allow people to get these rare pizzas uh one way or another and so again you know rare pizzas is really about using rare art for the community uh encouraging cryptocurrency awareness and adoptions and really experimenting with dow structures and radical open source governance and so going back to that problem of actually having expensive air pizzas that's what we're trying to solve and we built built slice saver to uh to be a no-loss virtual reality game where essentially people are staking to enter into beats every kind of tournament and then we apply pull together mechanics so go ahead and then grab this liquidity uh sorry grab the stakes and then put into liquidity pool and their interest and so at the end of the tournament then what we do with the actual interest earned we go ahead and attempt to buy a rare pizza from the bonding curve or perhaps open c and so here's a quick demo [Applause] and so the game was built using unity 3d and what you see here is a wallet connect c-sharp integration so we're using uh metamask we're gonna go ahead and hand this out it's automatic so the purpose of the demo we're just gonna go ahead and see but you can imagine that [Music] [Applause] uh by the way this is all available to try out [Music] for the purpose of the demo we're going to go ahead and show the mechanics it's similar to uh [Music] pizza slicing savers were custom made by actually anthony [Music] um um going to the the smart contract mechanics again is not that complicated essentially we have a vr year game we have the tournament contract and we're actually pulling everyone's staked and then actually then uh game oracle is going to say start the game end the game and also keep track of the rankings themselves and then we go ahead and put this into a money market or or a liquidity pool and at the end of the tournament we go ahead and try to purchase the actual rare pizza from the bonding curve itself and of course i mean try because the bonnie turkeys are moving fast so we're going to try to do our best to sort of yield farm and increase uh the revenue to buy some of these pizzas why we need this you know overall you know i think nfts need something to increase the utility and gaming and plus d5 kind of increase the utility of mfts in particular within rare pizzas the other part is that we want to make rare pizza nfts accessible and we want to be able to kind of cover for that 10 btc bonding curve and br nfts and d5 is fun and we use polygon for low fees and fast transactions this is our tech stack we use polygon we use maya blender to design the assets and unity for the game metamask wallet connect and ec5 for the liquidity pools this is a bit of a future road map keep an eye out if you want to see what we're going to do with rare pizzas and open dive please do follow us and reach out and that's it thank you very much guys don't forget to follow our pizzas and follow you know open dive and anthony who's doing a lot of design for rare pizzas thank you very much this was super awesome i know uh some people kind of miss that over the music but for those of you listening this is live and you can check this out by heading over to hack.ethglobal.com and checking and clicking on the rare pizzas page and you'll be able to go to the website and try this out so this is super fun i like the the animations and just a cool name slice saber this is amazing so congrats again and uh we are ready to move on to our second last demo for today and uh with that i want to welcome drip and i'm matt feel free to present all right can i share my screen here we go man if this is a video i think uh the audio is not coming through oh okay hold on uh let's try this one more time yeah sorry let me stop share and one sec sure sound okay one more time here drip is an affiliate marketplace for subscriptions using cashflow nfts it's built on top of the polygon network and powered by superfluid our team are all members of uniwhales.io a d5 analytics community built on ethereum we launched our web app in december and have over 8 000 free subscribers and 300 paid users in our token gated community subscriptions are huge ushered in by netflix companies as diverse as caterpillar and offender guitars are using subscriptions to move their business forward in the 21st century affiliate marketing is also a behemoth affiliate marketing is more integral to the global economy than ever before it helps connect with influencers and personal brands it fosters a closer bond between the company and its users in this digital era it also avoids the gated ad networks like twitter google and facebook ads there are many limitations to the legacy system of both subscriptions and affiliates subscriptions you have limited banking access or discriminatory bank access not everyone has access or equal access to banking there are multiple intermediaries chargebacks plague the industry and transaction fees prevent micro payments affiliates are permissioned again by the same type of banking system there's misattribution of links payments are slow and can take up to 90 days and it is very hard to transfer the assets which is the stream of income generated as an affiliate now the affiliate marketing for the web 3 universe can be powered by drip in their cash flow and fts is permissionless no financial or geographical boundaries between affiliate and company flexible customized commission rates erc 20 or 721 token requirements and affiliate links are minted on polygon so no fees and instant payments streaming payments by superfluid mean affiliates and the company get paid at the exact same time so let's pull up the drip affiliate dashboard as you can see we have art tools dot com with four open streams meaning four subscribers generating thirty dollars a month in our lifetime earnings so far or 503 dollars and here is the affiliate link that we can put across the interwebs to gain commission i'll meet a new one for sudan beats who make amazing soundtracks and sound effects on a subscription basis select the company and mint the nft the transaction is confirmed as you can see over here we have a new erc 721 token as an affiliate i can get my link out now and start earning commission that will show up back in the app once people buy the cash flow nft marketplace all these links the tweets reddit private forums telegram are siloed across the web but what if you could wrap them into a tradable asset with drip you can and sell them as cash flow nfts unlocking liquidity that's never been possible before and this is what the cash flow nft sale looks like in superfluid bob the seller has his stream cancelled and then alice has a new stream coming in this is the incoming cash flow that she purchased on the affiliate marketplace and here is the transaction hash thank you so much please reach out if you have any more questions and we are so honored to be part of this hackathon matt that was so cool i think you've i'm i'm genuinely surprised how much you've thought through this for just over the weekend so this is really cool i'm so glad that somebody's thinking about it from the perspective of getting more people into this and actually re-engaging these loops to get more and more people in through nft so congrats again on on this amazing demo thank you so much and with that i want to call our final project demo for the day and that is team boundless so boundless you are our tenth demo and uh we're super excited to see what you've got to show us all right boundless is an infinite exhibition of generative art a platform for monetizing generative art [Music] that can put creative and financial control in the hands of an artist collective uh for each ethereum block synthetic artists a general generative art algorithm take the block hash as a seed and output new and unique compositions the process starts at the genesis block will carry on through infinity or as long as the ethereum chain produces blocks uh i guess we need to check if there's an erp for dealing with heat death yet with several synthetic artists already on board we we are ready to start ramping this up albatron was the first inspired by jeff albers mondratica is the second inspired by pierre mondra uh mondrian uh and each time a new synthetic artist is added to the collective they're inserted into reality as if they've already always existed instantly producing compositions from genesis until the current block and they'll carry on producing unique compositions until the aforementioned heat depth of the universe in the meantime while there's still some entropy gains to be had only one copy of each composition can be minted compositions are sold initially with a simple no-nonsense dutch auction style sale where the price starts high and decreases linearly over time until it's either purchased or the price reaches zero and anyone can claim it for free not including gas after the auction compositions are owned via a harburg attack system that we're building using superfluid harbor taxes are also known as partial common ownership common ownership self-assessed tax cost for short self-assessed licenses sold via auction salsa for sure the frankensteinian results are reverse engineering a name to suit a fun acronym but anyway whatever you call it it essentially means that items are always on sale and the price is determined by the owner in our case the current owner chooses a patronage to pay for each composition they hold the current price that anyone else can buy the item for is a function of the patronage they set their super fluid flow rate these two market mechanisms dutch auction and harbor taxes can combine to form a market that one reduces the potential for third party value extraction two provide sustainable revenue streams for creators three has concrete valuations and is always liquid for buyers and four allocates efficiently in other words puts compositions in the hands of those who value the most for the hackathon we implemented an erc 1155 token contract that derives token ids from a block cache and an artist id a dutch auction style contract for selling erc 1155 tokens a beautiful view application to render explore and interact with the generative art for several synthetic artists it's worth noting that the two synthetic artists were produced outside of the hackathon and so they shouldn't be considered for judging or part of the submission unfortunately we didn't finish the harberger tax implementation so we can't demo that live nevertheless we can poke around some of the generative art and yeah just generally take a squeeze around the application uh we see this uh essentially becoming a dow based synthetic artist platform cooperative we might need to add some vowels in there if we want a good frankenstein acronym anyway the creators of the synthetic artists will share in the revenue and can vote to add new synthetic artists to the collective uh boundless was built by tommy cox colton brown and myself aaron macmillan uh and if we have time i'll jump over and just show you the live application we can do uh 60 seconds beautiful so here we have a live version of the application it's using some dummy data right now we didn't get a chance to wire it up to pull in real block hashes but you can see here that it's uh generating these hashes live uh it's gonna generate another random one here uh when i jump in uh but yeah it's it's uh well on its way to being functional uh the the next steps again uh wiring up our uh contracts that we wrote and then finishing the implementation for harvard taxes and that is all forum boundless uh yeah thanks for the awesome event guys i really appreciate everything you guys put on and uh yeah come and check us out if you're interested amazing thanks so much oren and uh good to see a lot of familiar faces here and uh this is such a cool zen demo i'm super happy this ended up being our last statement for today so congrats and uh i know we've been just rushing through all of this so i really want to just take a second and just get everybody give everybody a break and honestly just summarize that we have 10 teams that just presented to us in our finale and i want to congratulate all of them one more time so it's nifty dm crypto corgis soldier drop hash link cipher blocks boson pool funk rare pizzas drip and boundless i'm looking at the chat on on the live page and it is clearly a a race for claiming as many corgis as possible that's going on so i'm super excited that i'll be able to do that shortly myself and uh congrats to all the the 10 teams and all the other projects that spent this weekend working on cool things you can see that i'm so excited because i've been just talking about all these things for the the last two days that my voice itself is also suffering so i want to make sure that we get to wrap up this event really soon and with that um we got a couple more things left uh the most important thing i want to talk about is the sponsor prizes we have 75 thousand dollars in sponsor prizes that are being given away and i want to start inviting a couple companies here to tell all of us who won their prizes and why they're excited about these projects and then we'll kind of go over any some some final closing thoughts and uh all of us can finally catch up on our sleep so without further ado i'd like to welcome breck from zora to talk about the zora price welcome brian hey everyone uh it's breck from zora um i'll keep this quick just because i know it's been a crazy couple of days and everyone's probably sleep deprived and just looking for the winners to be announced um but i just want to say like thank you to eath global for putting this on it's been an amazing event and thank you to all the hackers who have built incredible projects um i know on zora alone we had over 40 projects submitted to us which is you know a lot higher than what we expected and you know to say like after six weeks of being live as a protocol we're already having so much developer activity like we couldn't be more excited about it um and so for our sponsor prizes we had three individual categories each of which had a 2500 usd prize or usdc prize the first category was developer tools and the winner of developer tools category was jordan overby who created the project zorb which was essentially a simple starter kit for using nexjs and some of the developer tools on the zora side to create a simple marketplace and a react app and this is a super powerful tool that we think will help um make the the time required for a new engineer to get um onboarded and on-ramps uh to crypto from zero to one uh a lot faster so we're super excited about the projects and congratulations to jordan for for making something awesome um and then our second um category was build your own marketplace and this is also 2500 usdc cash prize and the winner is um i ain't nash sorry if i'm butchering your name um he created a project called glitch which is really really cool it's essentially like tumblr-esque vibes for uh for creating your own marketplace i'll read the description out loud but it's make one web 1.0 web pages in web 3.0 style so integrate your decentralized nft ecosystems into your own style fetch nft from platforms call organize external apis and animate the web page too for fun and something that was really interesting that um that this individual did was they actually created a statically rendered version of zora in html and that like via their their platform or their projects and then they minted it on zora as an nft so you can go to zoro.co find their project minted as an nft and you can bid on it and then the last category was crowdx and the winner of this category was morgan moskolik with the project mnist to memory and this project created a generator for znft markets and it's using a mixture of uh artificial intelligence and like um in nfts in a really interesting way that we thought could be it could be really cool or essentially you'd mention an ft uh that would be the generator for a generative art algorithm and then that that nft also owns all of its future um generated art we think there's like a really interesting cross cross section for this sort of project with daos and so that's that's why they won um and yeah that's all three of the winners again thanks everyone um it's been a a whirlwind of the last seven two hours or so so everyone catch up on some sleep uh you know uh and have a good weekend or i guess good week uh thank you so much brett um just to kind of summarize it for everybody watching it's uh zorb glitch and memory you've all won 2 500 each and we'll be able to get you in touch with the zora team after this event after all of us have gotten some sleep next up i want to call eric from wearable and eric's going to talk about who won the wearable prize hey what's up guys all right um yeah thanks everyone who participated in the hackathon uh my name is eric um new addition to the wearable team helping build out the ecosystem and the wearable dow um we originally had three winners or three prizes and uh we changed things up um during the judging process so the four prizes now um surprise going out to collector's cafe uh for 500 which is uh building out a social network to discover exhibit and trade your nfps um third third prize going to mystery drop which is uh creating a these these sets of nfts that can be sold um as un unopened boxes and then only once they're sold uh uh and all the the the boxes are sold um the collection is revealed so it's kind of a fun way to to do these drops which are getting a little popular um rare volumes uh second prize for 1500 uh for augmented reality nft marketplace um they built a really cool product where um you can buy these ar nfts and then uh display them in your living room through through your mobile phone um all through the the marketplace app uh it's a really cool product we're excited about that and then uh top prize going to mai muse uh which is building out an app to allow instagram influencers to turn their instagram feed into an nft collection um using lazy minting uh so super excited to for all these teams uh and everyone else who um helped hack during the the hackathon um yeah we're excited to to work with you guys to build these out and uh hopefully any team uh can can start participating in the the wearable dao which is uh you know up and running and active so looking forward to seeing everyone there thanks everyone thanks eric it's a really cool uh summary of all the projects i'm definitely excited to check some out myself and just to summarize it's uh my musee rare volumes mystery drop and collectors cafe that are the winners for the wearable prize and i will be putting in touch with rentable after this day next up i want to call detroit from protocol labs and he'll be talking about the winners for pl [Music] hello uh thanks everybody thanks everybody who came by uh and presented thanks for all the people who built and submitted thanks for using ipfs and filecoin and limpy to pee in your projects uh we had a couple of prizes and a couple of winners uh the first prize that we had was the creator comfort prize surprise for making it easy for new creators and people new to the space and non-technical people to put their art and their work as fts to be able to publish and use those workflows uh the winner of this one goes to gift dot art uh this is a team that had a really nice design uh really thoughtful user experience touches they're also doing uh some interesting innovation around things like um engaging the people who engaged with the creators so uh error dropping to all the people who reply to a tweet for example uh and really meeting both the creators and the users where they're at in interesting ways uh congratulations really really cool project really interested to see what you do with it next uh the second prize the dreamy developer prize this one goes to rodeo this is a super simple tool for generating themed gallery views of nfts of your collections we saw a lot of different projects that came through that provided galleries uh even with some level of personalization but for the developer tool prize how to go somebody who actually was able to be integrated into developer workflows this is something that rodeo did really nicely uh they spent a lot of time documenting their project uh and also spent a lot of time thinking about the developer ergonomics of it uh css integrations were really easy a lot of thought into the markup uh generated so really really neat project that i think a lot of people are going to find useful and the final prize that we offered uh was the blow our mind prize what was the most beautiful or immersive or interesting uh thing that came our way this was pretty clearly the not not flamethrower project so this is a project that uh also interestingly bridged the physical and the digital world also using nfts you could give them an nft they would print it out and then record on video the author's artisanal handmade real-life actual flamethrower burning the art take that recording of the art being burned mint that recording and the original asset into a new nft and he wants to do this as a service something that really did actually blow my mind and something that i probably would actually pay for uh so thanks for everybody participating uh thank you for using ipfs and filecoin pdp in your projects uh it was great to meet you all and see you at the next one thanks technical difficulties i was just saying it feels like not not flamethrower just is a cool demo i want to check out and i think all of us should as well and congratulations to rodeo and gift.art i also want to say just relaying a comment from the chat which is i think the trick wins the prize for the best camera and uh we'll figure out what to send him on that ourselves um lastly i want to just re uh just kind of announce some of the prizes for the rest of our sponsors uh and uh just as a note we'll be communicating all of these teams um the next steps on how do you actually retrieve them and we'll be connecting you with the sponsors um shortly so for circle creator phoenix and hash link are the winners for circle prizes for nmt protocol it's trial for each block art we have dynamic rare either place nf3 polygon rare pizzas loot vault l and drip unit swap nft pool animal money and sold to drop covalent prize winners are burst nft collectors cafe and nf3 again super

and nftx will be deciding on one of their winners after this we couldn't get them figured out in time so we'll be following up on discord and over email and i want to wrap up today with some serious thank yous before we kind of close the weekend off and give everybody a chance to relax connect and enjoy everything that they've uh they've made and celebrate so it takes a lot of people to make events like these happen i want to especially thank our judges our speakers our sponsors our mentors and volunteers who were there throughout the weekend to help others learn and help others succeed in what they were building and of course want to thank all of you as hackers for really giving us the time and spending the time to build something that you are excited about and passionate about and seeing that through from friday to sunday and then presenting it to all of our judges it takes a lot of courage to present something that may not be perfect or you may not be proud of immediately but a lot of you pushed it and and made it really amazing for us to learn and appreciate all the things that you've been able to learn and accomplish i want to thank all of you for doing so i want to especially say thank you to our judges and our mentors i will there's a lot of names to to say here so i won't read all of them but there's so many people that were there for talks workshops our summit on discord as mentors helping people on technical sides our sponsors were there for doing the exact same thing for everybody who was trying to use the protocols for learning about how to do something in the best possible way and really answering anything that anybody wanted to know there's a lot of people that that are here that made all of this possible and they deserve a very special thank you from the global team and everybody else that participated on top of all that we had so many mentors that helped volunteers that helped run all of the judging process today we were doing 10 sessions in parallel that takes a whole lot of effort to get everything right and done in the same time to go through 180 projects and without the volunteers that we had today we would not be able to get this show up and running and stay on time and lastly one especially thank you to the global team um i want to just give a quick shout out to the team that's been behind the scenes 24 7 for the last three days making sure that everybody's unblocked uh catherine who recently joined our team has been an integral part of getting sponsorships and partnerships ready a lot of you interacted with her in making sure that all the sponsor prizes were on track and everybody was able to get the judging done and just communicating throughout this past few weeks to get this event up and running emily has been crucial in making the entire experience for how all of you interact with us as hackers amazing from answering and managing what's happening on discord to all of our communications while we're talking to you about how the weekend is going to go without emily's help this would not be possible everything you're seeing on the screen how we do the talks workshops how we manage all of our logistics for our transition into online is all thanks to andrew and andrew has been amazing in making this possible and smoothless and a really polished experience for all of us i also think jacob who has been leading partnerships for the youth global team and has been the person responsible for making sure that we have the best representation of the best people in the space who are here to help all of you succeed and really get to benefit off of making this entire ecosystem better for all of us one also thank liam uh liam has been a key part of making all of the work that we need to do for interacting with everybody here from the dashboard to all of our processes and making sure that we have the perfect information to act and make decisions as a team this will not be possible without the work liam has done and finally want to thank heather who keeps all of us in check and really make sure that everything is happening as we plan it and really that the experience that everybody experiences from the hackers to the sponsors to the volunteers to to our mentors is as perfect as possible so thank you to the entirety of global team and everybody else that made this event possible there are over 100 people that gave us their time and in dedication to making this past three days really amazing and they deserve that recognition so i want to thank all them and lastly um i know we've been calling them finalists and we talked about calling them top eight we had some 10 demos and i really want to wrap this up because i know all of you are a lot of you are tired but we call them finalists because that's the best word we have for how we do things uh here for each global equable is not designed to be a competition it is very much designed to favor people who are trying to learn more and really understand what could be possible so they can continue working in this ecosystem and we call them finalists because instead of having a first second third we want to just highlight some of our favorite projects that everybody is excited about and call them our top picks and in this case our first place winners so there is no first second third all 10 teams that just presented today are our equal winners for being the best highlighted project for this hackathon and each team member on these 10 teams will get 500 die from the ethgoble team and that easily brings up the entire amount that we've given away this weekend to be over a hundred thousand dollars that is a lot of incentive i would say but also just a way to thank all of us for really trying out the bleeding edge of what's happening in this space we saw a bunch of things around daos how they can be interacted with nf how nfts can be interacted with d5 how we can actually make community management better there are so many cool things that we're going to see that i think will become the more dominant and the status quo in the next three to six months and we're getting a glimpse of all of that here and i want to thank all of you again and congratulate to all the 10 teams that presented again we'll be following up with all the logistics very soon over email and over discord so give us a couple of days and we'll get all this rolling on distributing all these amounts and congratulations to everybody that participated and just to wrap this off this would not be an equal event if we do not announce what's coming next and i'm super proud to announce that we are finally ready and full throttled to go into our next hackathon which is going to be about scaling ethereum this is going to be our hackathon about layer 2 and privacy and scalability in general from a layer 1 perspective and this is going to start just three weeks from now so if you're interested in participating in this event this is going to be our standard three week long event where we will have a lot of time for everybody to learn find teammates really dig into what's possible and and build something super cool over the course of a month scaling ethereum is now live you can sign up we're gonna send a lot of emails about this as well and uh we hope to see you in the next hackathon and you can check out more by heading over to scaling.heathglobal.com so with that i would like to sign off from the global side and i hope all of you get some rest and enjoy the rest of your week
