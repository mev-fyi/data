Sean it's been three years since I've seen you last have you doing you know Gothic just uh persevering through the winter with a warm water and a cold wallet and Karthik it's it's you mentioned it's been three years since you came to India last how is India treating you well my body doesn't know what time it is but I feel amazing for your information it's 8 pm and you know Karthik it's not it's not that you get a chance to wish the whole crowd good morning in the night and get away with it so I'm going to go ahead and grab that opportunity and wish everyone GM gmgm welcome to Bangalore oh you know most people don't know this but we launched eth Global by publishing a medium blog post on Valentine's Day in 2018. and we talked about our plans to go to the rest of the world and get people excited about ethereum six days after I got a cold email from a person named Shakti gope saying there's a lot of people in Bangalore that are excited about this space and if Global should come and do an event that was the single most hand convincing cold email I'd ever received and a few months later we did the first ever ethi India in 2018. that event was 200 people that was the entirety of that space in the Bangalore and the rest of the country and the year after we came back and we got to 400 people and here we are standing in front of two thousand two thousand that's a that's a big number you know it's really hard it was really hard at least for me to imagine what it would be like to stand in front of 2 000 people so you know what I did I imagined a group of 20 people and then multiplied that by a hundred and imagining even that just imagining that was less intimidating than actually standing here today I haven't really been you know Under One Roof with 2 000 people simultaneously but I bet you have since you attended you know I think like you said you know with the first Ethan there came the awareness of web 3 and ethereum uh into India and you know people got to know about it and you wouldn't know but it was actually first time for me too during 18 year 2018 when I learned about the philosophy underlying web 3 the philosophy of decentralization and trustlessness you know that you can truly create something for the people something that's open source transparent and more democratic than many democracies and whatever I understood from that idea I actually put in a t-shirt that I designed a very few days ago before flying to East San Francisco in 2018 which back then was the biggest one we'd ever done and here we are twice as big twice as big and yeah here is the t-shirt that I designed it is very lovingly referred to by my friends and colleagues as the people t-shirt and also as the purple t-shirt by some severely intelligent people so yeah got like two thousand two thousand verified vetted and young web3 Engineers uh the youngest among us tonight is just 14 years old wow and you know as as we have grown from 200 to 400 and then to 2000 uh web 3 like any other technology has also grown you know through its stages starting from small rooms then smaller offices than bigger offices to hobbyist homes and finally ready to take over the world and I believe we are at that inflection point when we are ready to take over the world everyone is watching us and we are making the moves uh and if not at that point at least we are very close to it I definitely agree look at look at the 2000 people in front of you and you know at this stage we love talking about numbers don't we go like we love talking about that there's a two trillion dollar market cap we love talking about the salaries in web 3 is 100 000 and 300 000 and all that right numbers numbers have a beautiful way of abstracting complexity into simple trends like growth and fall and rise and decline Etc numbers are the most beautiful invention and a Bedrock of a society and economy but one of my favorite science fiction authors said that the only true way to achieve artistic wholeness is to create with one human in mind and you might say that's a great quote Nash and but that's for art uh we here are makers of software we make software is software art and I would say that yes software is odd and sometimes when software works well it is more than art it is Magic unless we forget that the only specie on this planet capable of experiencing magic and availing direct benefits of it are humans and I think if we just keep talking about the numbers we will forget about the people and not only it's important that we keep the people that we are building for in mind but it's also important that we keep in mind the people that built for us and like Karthik mentioned in most part all of us being here tonight owed to one man Shakti GOP the founder and CEO of defolio he's no longer among us and um you know this is the last time that I'm ever going to say his full name because he will always be Shakti sir for me because in a college uh we had this tradition of suffixing Sir at the end of a senior's name I don't know if it's still the case uh someone from the audience uh who is was also in my college can clarify that um but I never call him sir just because of that reason I call him that because he was my friend my mentor and possibly the only person outside of my immediate family to truly believe in my abilities and I would have been really happy if it was just me he believed him but he believed in the potential of entire young India the pulsating potential that dies if not given a nurturing Community a nurturing environment and opportunities and that has been our goal from the very first day since we started that folio the first seats of this Vision were sold in 2015 when we organized the first version of in-out hackathon at our College that was just 45 people in one room and the journey from then till now has been absolutely intoxicating was born in um small town of jhansi and he studied MSC physics from nit Surat not by choice but because at that time this particular College had the best one of the best internet infrastructure of the entire country and he really wanted to be there because back in 2011 having fast unlimited internet could open so many doors of opportunity for you and so that is how he found a way to be there to apply for MSC and not go through the Cutthroat engineering exams that you know plagued the country still he always found a way in the true entrepreneurial sense and I was also one of the participants of the first and out and I won the third prize there and no doubt it changed the trajectory of my life uh from then and it's just not my story it's a story of many many many Builders from India who have come in contact with the folio with eat India and everything else that we do and we've seen that firsthand as people have come to us in the last few days sharing this directly yeah and you know Shakti said was never fond of the Limelight you you've never seen him he was always sitting in the corner trying to put out fires pushing everyone ahead of him and never really asking for attention and he would have absolutely hated the idea of putting this big picture of his in front of 2000 and even more people you know but just for once if we can see I wanted him to see all the people that he worked for and I wanted you all to see the human that worked for you because it's all about people in the end and this is possibly the most naive and non-technical advice that will receive for the entire duration of this hackathon but as you are building please don't forget about the people Shakti was a great man and a good friend and we owe a lot of this to him it uh it started with eat India where we uh we took this uh typical photo every year behind this backdrop showcasing all the good things that we knew about it this is 2018. This Is Us in 2019. and I can't wait to see what this weekend is going to look like so with that I'd love to get started with ethania 2022. for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is my typical line telling you all that this is not a conference this event is an eighth global hackathon organized by eat Global in participation and collaboration with defolio and our mission is to bring in thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and this is why we focus on building this is a hackathon everything here is about Builders and this is a place for all of you to learn Mentor get help and grow as individuals and we really believe showing is way more important than telling you won't see back-to-back talks here because our goal is about empowering you and increasing your skill sets and this brings us to the third eat India youth Global has done this is Asia's biggest ethereum hackathon and officially eat Global's biggest event ever we have over 2 000 people from 321 cities and 34 countries in the building today on top of that 44 of them are new to web3 this is an incredible amount of audience that is getting into this ecosystem so please give them a big round of applause for taking the chance to build something that they're excited about we put everybody on a map to see where they were coming from but the best part of it is that for the first time ever we're going to zoom in and see the representation in India this is incredible and I can't wait to meet so many of you here and learn about what excites all of you on top of that we have 317 ecosystem mentors 13 technical mentors who are here to answer all of your questions and 27 workshops covering out all amazing protocols here work and because this is not a conference we're going to do just five talks all the talks are going to happen tomorrow we're going to have Jeremy talk about liquidity pools and defy infrastructure and how to take advantage of what's happening in this space muli is going to talk about how do we make our contracts secure and add formal verification so Smith is going to talk about pioneering RTC and making that more decentralized and Juan Benet from protocol Labs is going to talk about how do we build and raise for web3 startups in 2023 with everything that's happening in this space now I said five talks and there's only four here so to reveal the surprise we're going to have vitalik here tomorrow joining in Via Zoom answering questions about the future of this ecosystem that's going to happen at 5 30 on this main stage all talks are here going to be where I'm standing right now and we have 350 000 of prizes we're gonna give all of that away this weekend and we're going to go into all those details for all of you very soon I want to quickly shout out to the 45 incredible partners that have helped make this event possible so to give them a big round of applause I'm going to have all of you thank them with me so I want to give a big shout out to bichonomy polygon Quest Book World coin push protocol ipfs filecoin ethereum Foundation stack OS ZK Bob covalent come on keep clapping Cartesian connects inferior ether spot ey ens safe hyperlane Instagram Levi Doom live Pierre Mina Power Loom Valas the graph coin DCS knows his chain lands Moon B Marlin nft Port quick no router protocol shardium start on eigen layer revised huddle of one Chronos AWS the dapoli Simon die hashtag and coin shift all of these amazing people are here excited to talk to all of you and they're giving away a lot of prizes and we're going to cover all of that soon so before we go into all of this I want to make sure we take the next 10 minutes to talk about how everything is set up this weekend so let's go into what we're going to cover we're going to talk about venue and activities how you can get help for your projects all the prizes of course all the workshops that are happening how judging Works how team formation works we also have an amazing fireside chat here with you right after that so before we go into all those Logistics a quick reminder to all of you about security everybody must have their wristband and their lanyards on them at all times because this is a 24 7 venue we are going to tighten up the security at night so if you do not have both of them on you you will not be allowed to enter either of these buildings very simply no wristband equals no entry do not try to cut this off because we will also not be reissuing a second one for you so please please please keep your wristbands on on top of that this is a 24 7 access facility for the weekend so do not leave your belongings unattended there is a cloak room but there's a clear process for how you can keep your stuff there if you lose something and you were not attentive about it neither is global nor depth folio will be able to help you or be responsible for anything that you are going to misplace let's talk about value and activities you know there are two holes this is the new hallway you're setting it's got the main stage it's got the hacking tables or the partner boots are here the workshop rooms are here too and the most important information of them all is the resting zones are here but the resting zones in Hall one are only for females the hall the old hallway did your check-in has the resting zones for the male males only so again females in the New Hall and males resting Zone in the old Hall we've got more hacking tables there and we've got games food and judging all happening in the old Hall and we've got you've already seen the snack area outside and yes they do accept crypto no I'm just kidding it's all free how much ever you can eat and then we are going to have activities we have kite flying tomorrow right outside the venue four to six pm I suggest you join it especially if you have not flown a kite before it's really fun and then we've got meditation happening tomorrow from six to seven PM a great way to take your mind off coding and you know relax for a bit amazing and let's talk about communication all of you here should be on the Discord that means if you're an accepted hacker or a partner or a mentor or a judge all of you will have special permissions to see the channels that are only visible to eth India attendees you can go there you'll know this because you'll see I eat India sidebar section and you can do that by heading over to your hacker dashboard and connecting Discord and this is where you can talk to all of our partners and get help on any of the prizes or protocols that you're trying to work with and just get those questions answered by everybody that's part of that team here and also let's remember you're in person you can talk to each other just go walk up to the booth if you have any questions or just shout if somebody knows something and chances are you will get that help that you need and all the official communication will also be on Discord which means that when Sunday comes up and we are doing judging anywhere from telling you if something is on schedule to where things are to what things are not on track or us even contacting some of the teams to be ready for some demos we will be messaging all of you on Discord so please make sure that you are actively monitoring Discord and everything else is on the website the official source of Truth is the website which means whatever it says on the website is what we're going to be following so please keep an eye out on the website for all the details and for those of you who need a reminder on what the website is you see eth india.co all right so the most common question we get is how does this hackathon work and what can I do here and when can I start well the good news is that you can start hacking on your projects now and you can work with people of up to five on your team you are also allowed to and able to work on your own you don't have to have a team so you can have anyone from one to five people submitting a project you have 36 hours to hack technically 35 36.5 hours which is 9 A.M until until the submission deadline and I want to talk about what all that means and before I talk about how judging is set up and how submission Works a quick quick uh refresher on the rules everything that you are going to be submitting must be done from scratch you cannot build on an existing project you cannot add any features to something you've already done that would disqualify you from winning any prizes and if you are not a confirmed hacker which means that you do not show up on the dashboard we will not be giving any prizes to a person that's not listed on a team or a confirmed hacker so if you are working with somebody on a team please make sure that every team member is in fact a confirmed hacker if you have any other questions you can find me anybody on the devfolio team or send us a question on Discord or email we'll be monitoring all those channels and answering those things for you and there's amazing content that's available on demand for on the prizes page all the workshops are live streamed and recorded and everything is also happening here today and tomorrow so if you miss out something or you're sleepy you can just go to eat global.tv and just watch all the videos on demand and catch up and pause and zoom in on the code or anything else you want to do we're making sure that you don't get to miss anything because of any conflict and for those of you who are still looking to form a team or looking for team members in Workshop room one which is right behind all of you here we're going to be hosting a team building session right after I stopped talking in an hour from 9 30 to 10 30 and you get to meet other people who are also looking for other teammates or are looking to join a team and they have a particular skill set so the submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on Sunday this is how all of this works at 9am you'll be required to submit all of your projects and give all the details and then we will be doing two forms of judging there's going to be a main judging and a partner judging process both of them happen at the same time in parallel starting from 9 30 a.m and it goes until 12 30 pm once you submit a project you will go to the other hall for the main judging once you get to that Hall you will be assigned a room number and you'll be presenting to our judges on what you built after you're done you get to come back here find the partner and the sponsor that you are applying for a prize and go to that table and demo to them as well this means you have to figure out what is the right time for you to pick which one of these things you do first if you are too late in the main judging process you can go to the partners first and then come back to the main judging or if you are one of the first teams at 9 30 a.m to go to the main judging process you get to go that do first and then come back and do partner under judging you also have to do that for every partner so if you picked on your prizes three companies that you are applying for you're gonna have to demo three times to them and then one more time for the main judging so make sure that you are accounting for this time because we have to judge hundreds of projects in that same window to make sure that we are there to the same schedule because people have flights and travel plans so we cannot delay for how does that work everything we're given seven minutes in total to demo of which four minutes are going to be for your demo you can do a live demo of course and we recommend a recorded demo of your project so in case something goes wrong whether it's the internet or a mainnet transaction you can still just show what how it's supposed to work and you don't lose all of the hard work that you've done really really really reminds you to not do this last minute because this will take a lot of time at least an hour so make sure that you are writing yourselves and you can check out the project submission form and get all the things right and you rehearse some of your demos to really take the best advantage of the four minutes that you have all these details are going to be on your dashboard and we'll also be sharing all this on Discord and of course if you forget to specify that you're applying for a prize with one of our partners there is no way that we would know that you wanted that prize so do not forget to select that button because we cannot know that you wanted to apply there and if you go to them they will have no record of you because they will not see your project on the list and that would complicate a lot of things for you and them so make sure you check and triple check all the prices you're going for and just another reminder you can go to the partners before or after the main judging just make sure you are coordinating all the parallel processes that you need to do and lastly I want to remind everybody of the code of conduct the rules of being at this event are fairly straightforward in short please be respectful to everybody else here harassment in any form will not be tolerated and we will take immediate action and kick you out if you are behaving inappropriately in terms of the criteria anything that you build here is going to be fully owned by you and you retain the full IP of all of your work if you have any other questions or if you need any help or if you need to report anything please message anybody on the ethi India team and we'll be on it immediately so that's everything on the logistics now I want to invite a few of our amazing Partners to kind of come in and tell us about the things that they're excited about so without further Ado let's welcome Nikki from ipfs and filecoin to share some thoughts on what they're building hi everybody uh a very first eth India in-person hackathon and I cannot wait to tell you about the bounties that we are giving out at East India um so this time uh we are going to award bounties for using filecoin filecoin virtual machine fem and also bakalyao um so quickly for those of you who don't know what ipfs is it makes the web work peer-to-peer makes it robust and verifiable come find me at the booth if you want a two second 101 10 second 101 on how this happens uh filecoin is the biggest decentralized storage Network and is built on top of ipfs uh Five Point virtual machine the latest development in our ecosystem it delivers on-chain programmability to the filecoin network which means you can write smart contracts in solidity and deploy them on top of filecoin and do compute over it fevm is in testnet and we are excited for people to build a new new projects on top of it this is the very first in-person hackathon where fem is expecting fbm testnet is like ready to build on what all can you build practically everything data dials nft projects uh blending projects go wild take a picture of the QR code over here to find all resources about fvm there's mentors available around the clock on the sponsor channel ipfs filecoin on e-global Discord so please either find us at the booth or post on the channel there's somebody available 24 hours to answer your questions is a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload so this is distributed compute instead of it being in uh in like a centralized single server this is also a very new project and we are very excited uh to see what comes in now what are the prizes we are giving away we have two tracks there's the storage wizard track you can build anything using web3 Storage nft storage or buckaleau and qualify for this track the second is the fvm track build anything using fevm deploy it to wallaby testnet and you qualify for this track we have ten thousand dollars in prizes for each of these tracks it has top three winners two thousand dollars each and ten pool prizes uh for each of these tracks so totally 26 teams stand to win prizes uh we have a lot of Grants and other programs which you can apply to at a later stage uh if if two days hasn't been enough for you to explore all the Technologies um look for mentors on the sponsors ipfs Falcon channel on eat Global Discord uh after the hackathon the story never ends uh we if you're looking for ideas to build on on fvm the first QR code has a very long list of projects you could just pick problem statements that you could just pick and start building on and all the other post hack opportunities can be found on the hackathon's website do go there and we have a booth and we'll always be there to answer any questions you have thank you very much all of these resources are also posted on the Discord Channel um and good luck oops yeah thank you thanks Nikki next up we have Sachin from bichonomy please give sasheen a big round of applause hello everyone and thank you for the warm welcome and it's really great to see you know all of you uh showing up here that shows how well the whole web3 you know developed Community has growing so if we just you know go back in time a bit and see how the whole you know past one year has been for us I mean uh there has been a lot of volatility you have you must have seen and you must have heard about you know stories of crypto crashes happening centralized point of failures and you know people saying web3 is dead or you know web3 is over but that's not why we are here today right we are here because we believe in web 3 and we are all heads down and you know building towards the future and the building is all you know what we are here to do so we are really you know proud to uh you know partner with India as a sponsor uh just to grow the whole web 3 developer you know community and uh you know from the past events you must have learned you know till now the importance of self-custody right uh and how important the decentralization is you know there's a saying decentralization doesn't matter until it does and it does now so uh but how do you build these you know application uh that has the self-custody and it's really hard to build this application and that's why you know for the past majority of this year you know we have been heads down building this developer toolkit uh which is called by economy SDK that is you know solving uh the problems for developers to build these self-custody application but without compromising on the user experience and the decentralization and ownership so this by economy SDK you know you can uh find Solutions right from onboarding until engagement for you know on an application so you can find modules like social logins where you can so you know log in your users using the social accounts you can find solution for free ad onboarding and uh then on the engagement part you can utilize gasless transactions cross chain transactions and even the transactions where users are paying gas fees in erc20 tokens so all of these you know solutions from onboarding till engagement all of them are packaged under one SDK which is pyconomy SDK and uh we have three bounties you know worth ten thousand dollar uh you can just check the bounties you know on eth India page and uh our booth is there uh we are all here for the next you know uh two days uh just to help you out if you have any problems if you run into any queries all our engineering team is here who you know who have actually worked on the product so they are the best person you know to help you out and uh yeah all the best you know to all the developers out there and all the hackers and wish you all the best thank you thank you next up is Rahat from polygon please give Rahat a big round of applause thank you Lord what's up come on man that was what how did I say what's up and what did you Bangalore what's up there we go my names are hot I am here to tell you a little bit about polygon though a lot of you probably don't need any introduction to it but I'll do a little bit an intro here uh we're polygon ethereum's internet of blockchains here at eth India here to support all of you hackers all of you Builders out here and a little bit about polygon in case you know the 44 of you who are new to web3 uh polygon started off as a scaling solution with this Premier product which was the polygon blockchain um built on something called a public plasma checkpoint notes and uh this was awesome this was a great way to make building on ethereum a lot more accessible to a lot more folks all around the world since then though we have become what's called a Swiss army knife of ethereum scaling so it's not just the polygon blockchain that you have now we've got a whole Suite of solutions that you can build with just a little while ago I gave a workshop on polygon ID so if you want to go in learn more about self-sovereign identity ZK proofs and all that that's a workshop you can go back to and uh how do you start building on polygon right the cool thing is why do devs love polygon all of the tools that you already use in the ethereum EQ system map one to one right over to polygon so we already have the best developer ecosystem in all of web3 that's all of you that's all of that's everyone in the ethereum ecosystem your solidity tools your JavaScript tools all of the amazing tools that already exist are usable right off the bat and we've got twenty thousand dollars in prizes for you today so here are some of the bounties I'm just going to go through them really quick we have four thousand dollars available for best use of polygon ID top four people software projects built on polygon ID will be receiving a thousand dollars each um four thousand dollars for the best D5 projects our D5 team has given some suggestions on different projects that you can build so those are all available uh through the um eating their website and four thousand dollars for best public goods and four thousand dollars for best ux actually they did a ux uh workshop for a previous eat Global um hackathon so definitely check that out to understand what kind of ux we're actually looking for and the final one is four thousand dollars for best developer tools or without Julie so one thing to make sure that you do whenever you submit make sure to include a link to a deployed contract in your readme this could be deployed on the polygon Mumbai test Network it could be deployed on the polygon mainnet it could also be deployed on the ZK evm test Network which is available um right now for you to deploy on so thank you uh really really excited to be building with you all through this weekend I'll be available at the booth so all the rest of the polygon team thanks just uh yeah amazing well none of you should be strangers to polygon and we'll uh talk a lot more about that but up next I want to bring in harsh and not Richa from British protocol hey everyone I'm Richard hey hackers what's up so yeah as Karthik introduced I am Harish founder of push protocol let's talk about very quickly what we do awesome so yeah we are going to talk about what why and the bounties and hopefully and under two minutes uh let's get started so first of all why so if you look at web 2 you will notice everything starts with a notification whenever you pull up your phone you have notifications from app and that drives you their users back to them even when you're chatting on WhatsApp you're not chatting you are actually notifying the other person and that's how Chata go even if your FaceTiming someone again notifications but surprise surprise notification was not a reality on web3 before push and actually fun fact push was created and started from it Global 2020. how cool is that awesome from then to now we have 18 million notifications we have over 100 plus Integrations and notifications are flowing to 80 000 subscribers these are some of our friends or push and finally the bounties so yeah we have six thousand dollar for push shot anyone implementing per shot gets that not anyone we have first second third price same for push notifications but yeah we have a very special price eight thousand dollars split among everyone that builds on push thank you very much traps guys amazing it's always amazing to see projects that were hackathon projects and they're now full-blown protocols and companies in this space all right a couple more Partners to go I want to now invite flywheel to talk about worldcoin please give them a big round of applause gmgm everyone uh I'm flywheel uh I work at worldcoin and I'm so excited to be here uh it feels amazing to see all of you building today and uh we're so happy to be here so uh to talk a little bit about what work going is in case uh you don't know and you haven't seen this little thing called the orb uh world going started from the premise that you know crypto is awesome and unfortunately the value is being courted by uh two percent of the population so what if Bitcoin would have started by giving one Bitcoin to each person of course this is not possible today with Bitcoin so that's why we decided to create the worldcoin token so the worldcoin token is a limited Supply token 10 million tokens and every human on the planet can claim a free share of worldcoin just because they're humans uh course the very quick problem we run into is how to make we make sure that each person only claims their their share once uh and that's why we create a world ID so World ID is a privacy preserving proof of personhood protocol it's enabled by the orb uh it enables civil resistance at scale so it basically lets you prove that you're a real person that have never done something before like boating uh airdropped and minting nfts and a bunch of other things so think of actual Democratic boating and things like that um uh so this is a fully open protocol fully decentralized we're currently uh live on polygon mainnet uh and you can start building right away go to worldcoin.org India we have a bunch of prices twenty thousand dollars up for graphs in different categories including a prize pool so uh we wanna we wanna get as uh as many of you building on on worldly as possible and uh good luck to you all thank you just okay thank you amazing and one more to go please join me in welcoming I'll be Lodge from Quest book got a fan base here hello everyone uh I'm abilas uh what is uh Quest book Quest book for all the devs here I'm also a Dev uh Westbrook is your best friend before the hackathon after the hackathon quest book helps you get grants you can go to Quest book after this hackathon you can apply for Grants before the hackathon also you can go check out before the next hackathon so that's Quest book so we work with multiple protocols to run Grant programs so most of the grant programs that typically run by committees right now and they have whole bunch of problems and we came up with a spec uh to fix those problems so grants laws they're typically run by committees and the committee is typically do not have developers so they have huge blind spots they don't even understand which developer tools are going to be important next and so on and so forth so instead like what if we Leverage The Community of experts and what if the grandstander on time is a week instead of like months that is right now and what if the grants are completely on chain full transparency and accountability so we work with polygon away compound and a whole bunch of protocols to make grants process seamless so right after this hackathon you can go to Quest book and apply for a grant with any of the protocols so uh just uh today we put out a grant proposal we put out a proposal with compound to disburse one million dollars for Builders so this proposal just got upload today so yeah this uh one million dollars is going to be uh given out in Grants for developer duels uh governance tools multi-chain strategy and whole bunch of these things so all this uh is uh public data you can check it out and once again what is Quest Book quest book is your best friend before hackathon after hackathon if you want to continue building uh come to Quest book apply for a grant those typically slow things down it doesn't have to be that way so we work with protocols so that uh those can keep building so hit me up if you are interested in running fxk of community run Branch program thank you thank you all right those were just some of our partners um and the next thing I want to do is use this opening ceremony as an opportunity to bring on somebody a special in this space we usually use this hour to talk about what all of us are excited about in the future and today I'm excited to welcome Sandeep from polygon we're going to cover a lot of things about the future of the space India web3 and a man who needs no introduction of course here super honored to have the chance to share the stage with you welcome Cindy so we've known first of all when I came here and I entered this Hall my first reaction was what the did we do like you know I mean I was standing with the deaf folio people eat Global uh you know as we were talking about like 2018 when we started and look where we are today I was thinking like you know even taking a pic and sending to vitalik let's see what we need to do because I met him in 2019 somewhere and are saying that you know India is going to be the biggest ecosystem and all that and he's like yeah we'll see and today here we are so I remember you uh in 2018 back when uh used to be climatic handing our t-shirts to people the Thematic booth and uh here we are seeing an incredible progress and growth in the last four years uh my first question to you is uh focusing on the personal side tell tell us about your personal journey into web3 and how you got started yep so uh I started uh Back in the Day in 2015 when uh end of 2015 when I was like you know doing my previous startup and uh you know it was B2B and it was not scaling as fast as ever thought and I thought that I want to go into the deep Tech space and I had heard about Bitcoin back in 2013 but initially I like that time I thought that you know how like I just it did not just make sense to me right so then in 2016 when uh a 15 and then when I first went to went into AI a little bit and then you know uh heard about Bitcoin again I thought that what this thing is still alive this is still around like you know what's going on here so then I you know went into that Bitcoin white paper and all that and I actually did not see it as money and you know changing the money at that point in time I you know had a good understanding of geopolitics and all that I realized that okay you know this is this makes sense but what I I saw as an engineer I thought is that this is basically somebody built this decentralized network which is right now solving a small computation small logic which is payment logic you pay to me a minus B I mean amount and B's balance goes up and I thought at that time like what if we could do complex business logic you know in this kind of setting that could that could be useful for a lot of things and then you know I was on and off and all that and then three four weeks into this I you know stumbled on ethereum and I think ethereum then went from 50 cents to nine dollars and all that and I read the first line I read like you know generalized smart contracts and this and I said oh like this is this is big and that is the time I took two weeks in two weeks I sent a mail to all my clients I said guys I'm shutting it down I will still help you for next six months to make sure that you know it's transitioned out but I'm going all in into that and you know I left everything went back to like coming from my background where I come from going back to 0 little money making where I am the one footing putting the food on the table for my whole family parents everyone it was a hard choice but I think that it was very clear that this is going to be very very big and here we are that's a lot of conviction especially back then um what was the ecosystem like in India and and kind of could you share more on how hard or easy or hard things were I think like you know at that point in time it's you know it was only initially some uh you know crypto trading communities like there was almost zero development communities there were one or two researchers what year are we talking here this year we are talking about 2017 early also like mid 2016 or early like that was very early for ethereum also right like but even 2017 early uh there was nobody even two till 2017 and there were few developers who are working for future you know foreign companies and then we started in early 2018 and first time we received uh you know the uh we heard that eth India is happening in this one and you know we interacted with you know my brother like Shakti was not here now but uh what a man and you know we interacted and you know we said that this is absolutely needed over there and then when we were starting we initially were thinking that you know we will get probably 100 people registering and things like that like just that low at that point but the good part was you said 44 for people were new in web 3 that time I think hundred percent new to F3 so but yeah like you know here we are like I think you know you guys have done amazing job globally and in India like shout out to Deb folio team uh for you know after all of these these problems and all that striving hard to build this deaf community in India organic deaf community in India and uh you know I I actually like if you can give me one or two more minutes like you know I wanted to share like when we saw Shakti over there even like you know uh the deaf Holier team was here and we all got emotional you know looking at Shakti because you know the and that's the spirit of I think India's weapery ecosystem also like back in the day when uh you know after each Global also 2018 then we there was a big bear market and all that nobody would uh you know give money for hackathons and things like that and iron Shakti would have a lot of these discussions that you know Shakti is like you know I don't have in a runway for next three four months and all that and we would say okay let's keep trying we would give even we were like very small like we never got NBC funding and all that right so sometimes like you know ten thousand dollars twenty thousand or these kind of grants that okay you know let's keep pushing let's keep pushing let's keep trying more and then you know came this after all this bear market and all that after 2019 each India then came this kovid slump right like absolutely everything got destroyed and I remember that you know after second or third day after uh you know the lockdown Shakti were discussing and you know it looked like even for polygon things were tight right but then again we said that okay bro like let's try more time let's try it some more time let's try some more time we started like deaf folio team switched into online hackathons completely and then we started doing year monthly accounts and all that and then you know what like you know Shakti and I would you know speaking let's say and then he says that I have some sort of fever tomorrow I can't join this call and you know that was the time when he got covered and then he was in a tier three city in India and uh you know there was no like facility also in the hospital no medicine coming and I started that crypto Leaf fund right and we started like we worked very hard like I Akash and his team members and all that and in the last few days we even arranged a ventilator like somebody traveled from India for the whole ventilator to the to the hospital and he enters the hospital and they say that it's not needed right but one thing like you know I was very sad for multiple days but one thing I am proud of that we still tried tried really hard and that's the spirit of Indian web 3. we keep trying and one day we are going to make India web3 superpower super power in web3 we're gonna take a lot into that and um we yeah it's firsthand part of the the same story and um there's a lot that's happened in the last four years and I think the thing to remember is that we came out strong and United and bigger than we were even a year ago and that's what we should remember I do want to switch a bit of gears and kind of talk about how we see the future of this space um I want to ask a fairly blunt question polygon is not really a layer two uh what do you say to that like I and we don't really like as we said polygon is ethereum's internet of blockchains like we don't subscribe to this narrow definition of layer 2 which means that you know you have to keep all the data back on Layer Two you can you also need to have full Security on Layer Two and everything we believe that it is a spectrum even like like chains like polygon genes like X die nauseous chain they all have added a lot of network effects into you know ethereum as far as the communities are so maybe let's talk about how you're aligned with ethereum yes that's exactly why so you know we have we are like hardcore ethereum Community people and what we have done is like if you see in the last whole 2020 and Karthik like you know we have been seeing 20 20 21 22 like this whole L1 Wars like you know if you ask yourself who saved ethereum from this album boss like you know we were the ones who were fighting tooth and nail on the on the trenches uh you know against these like you know they completely run away uh into adoption and all that so but the thing being that like you know we want to provide this ethereum stack the evm stack to the Developers in the range of decentralization at the end what what we are doing at polygon is we are providing decentralized compute right on top of ethereum and that decentralized compute comes on a spectrum you can have like if you are a startup who has only 100 users right now do you need ethereum kind of security you probably might be okay with having your own let's say you are working on a side chain which has like maybe if it's a dedicated chain even two validators or if you are on a public chain you can have like you know like polygon POS 100 validators and all that decent enough security for you but if as you keep growing across the cycle you can actually be deployed on like zke VM today which has full ethereum security and that's also is I think that is our commitment to ethereum like you know we are the first you know in market fully available source code available zkvm fully built out all features and that's also is my message to all of you guys test out ZK VM like you know while all these bounties I would say apply them on ZK VM instead of like Mumbai test net and all that and you will see the experience like already we have we know like more than 2000 smart contracts have been deployed the user experience is absolutely fabulous and you know we have David my co-founder who has built this ZK evm like product head there you know he's there with you if you have any queries ask with him ask from him and that's our commitment to ethereum and you will see some of very big announcements from us which will you know which will show that you know what what are our plans for ethereum because that's the fun part of our theorem ethereum is not only with Alex or ethereum Foundation Network it is your network it is our Network and we also have plans for ethereum and you will see that's that's wonderful and uh and uh speaking I mean I'm looking forward to what these announcements are hopefully we get some Alpha here but um obviously ZK everything is is what the Talk of the Town is polygon has three ZK initiatives um why do you have three and kind of what's the thinking behind having these parallel approaches yes so ZK technology especially when we were starting like one year back it was such an early stage like although you know we have seen a hockey Street growth in the ZK technology but it was such an early stage that even betting on one out of three four approaches available is very risky and remember that we are coming from the burnt of heartburn of plasma right we remember plasma yes and we we were the only team like nobody respects the fact that we were the only team which built a production ready plasma everybody just left it like it doesn't work and all that no more no longer hyped up so we are leaving right so we we built it fully and but people ended up using the POS part more because it was easy to use uh now we did not want to take first of all it was very clear in our mind that we don't don't want to be stuck in one approach which fails eventually right so we are very clear so that is one reason second reason is that layer two as we say layer one is for decentralization and security layer two is for experimentation where apps can experiment at scale for with user experience and things like that is that the same as compute to you or or is there differentiation between experimentation and compute the ex I didn't get the question so you said Layer Two is about experimentation is that the same as compute because you previously mentioned compute would be honest yes like you know you have much more you know spectrum of compute you will have cheaper compute and you will have costly but more secure compute and you can experiment with it like what kind of application you are building right if you are building defy you probably need very heavily secure like ethereum secured uh capacity but if you are building a game a casual game where people are going to want five ten dollars worth of nfts then you are probably okay with like a you know less decent lives but or or not secured with ethereum but fairly decentralized uh this thing right so but what I was saying is that about these three ZK Solutions like these three ZK Solutions first two of them are working on evm compatibility only but they have the difference in approaches but the third approach and I don't want to disclose more over there but you know as I said that we have very strong plans for ethereum and ethereum's defensibility so next time somebody comes to you and say that hey I have this L1 and I am supporting rust or I am supporting this programming language that programming language you know we will make sure that you will get all those programming languages all those fancy programming constructs available on top of ethereum that's why these three different approaches and you're going to see some really fun stuff coming coming from us hopefully you realize this thing but you just announced something that you guys are working on so I'm not going to repeat it you guys have to watch and pause the video after this to really read between the lines that's incredible so in a way it's a good thing if all three approaches work and it's not just about increasing your odds to see one of the three yes yes and also like you know it was so early that uh you know out of these three approaches like that's why we were able to build this ZK VM in last like probably eight months which where people are working for last four years why because we had this cross-pollination of these ideas like you know and you might discuss this with David also that you know first what they were building at Z you know at Hermes borrowing a lot of ideas from zero and Maiden they were able to build it much faster much more efficient and much more concise like you know we have some other ZK implementations which already are running into tens of thousands of lines of code where we have like four thousand very crisp and efficiently written lines of code which can be very easily you know not easily but you know they can be fairly audited and we believe that this will be much more production ready much faster than anybody else I mean I can't wait for that because all the hackers get to try this out and break it apart so you get to fix it after um I think what a lot of what you just said so far is coming from the perspective of applying research and kind of making those things go to production and that's great but you're also at the same time talking about or talking to a lot of companies with Partnerships launches getting more and more consumer applications into this space um research stuff aside what is the biggest problem that the polygon ecosystem is facing right now or rather what keeps you up at night yeah so I think like you know with all of what has happened in the past few days uh or weeks uh it you know it's a good and a bad part both like because last one year there has been war cry that you know we need to go mainstream we are too Niche but I think with what all happened like the mainstream adoption will slightly become slightly slower but then we have to go back to our roots with the niche community and you know build build out and work more on these Niche use cases that's why I think this web you know this Eid Global and uh you know this Global hackathon eat India and other hackathons become very very relevant because here is where many kind of new ideas are going to be going to be taking birth right and those ideas are going to become very relevant that's why like you know I mean it's very important for you guys also to build differentiated products in D5 in nft and you know there is a very high possibility that you know you might get accelerated growth in some of those things because the focus has come back to these things instead of like you know only being on the Instagram and reddits and you know these big Starbucks of the world you know the focus is back to the developer here and back to self-custody and all the those core fundamentals of F3 and that's why it's very relevant like you know I hope that just like we have seen in the past eth India like you know we'll see some big companies coming out uh you know from from this I I totally agree with that but uh I'm gonna give you a hard time here you didn't answer my question what is the biggest problem polygon is facing sorry yes so the I I want to see more Innovation like that's what I said in this one also more Innovation uh you know it's not like specific to polygon but I would say in India ecosystem also more Innovative products coming out like you know which have some sort of differentiated product offering go to market offering and things like that like you know it's no longer relevant like you know if you guys come up like okay I've built a nft Marketplace or I build a lending borrowing system no what is the differentiation in your product and also like you know I want to give a message that you know across the overall like this polygon connect yesterday like 2000 people were there and and you know multiple events you know like that old model of like you know this like and especially relevant to web3 that you know you do a token and this token will do well and things like that that does not work not only it is not recommended it does not work now you're just going to if let's say you launch end up launching a token with a non-differentiated product and all that and you are thinking that I'll get listed and you know this token will do you know like Market dance and whatever I think first of all it is not work it doesn't work now because the market does not have that kind of capital we all had like 15 years of bull market infinite Capital that is no longer relevant and also the community is much more scrutinizing for everything so you know when you want to do this make sure you do it right don't do it for the sake of it for the heck of it and don't do it in a hassled way build a product build a community and then the community and you see a real relevant value value accrual value capture for the token then only you know go for those token related things don't you know Chase the token uh you know Mania that is going to you know be harmful for your longer term journey and it's not just uh that it doesn't work like I mean we know that factually because we've seen that from experience and uh exactly there's a lot of years of uh case studies here of proving this point uh yeah yeah no I actually I learned also from you like you know because I've been very focused on exponential ecosystem growth and I think I have you know debated with you also multiple times and I learned one thing always from you whenever I met you all over the world that you are all you are always thinking of like okay right now it works it's hyped up and all that but you would be like I don't see how it survives 10 years from now five years from now right and and I think that's why like you know people like you who have made investments in those things though those would have survived large part of your investment would have survived otherwise many of them got wiped out only in a paranoid survive yeah yeah exactly so you know I'm also like you know trying to learn more from that you know like even for the ecosystem we want to support those applications who we see that these are going to exist five years ten years from now and these are going to build sustainable business models not only about like this cash you know raise and funds and things like that this is an interesting thing right there there's so many Engineers here so many developers here and we're excited about just playing with the latest Technologies the latest Frameworks and we see interesting smart contract use cases as Innovative for what we think web3 can do but it's way bigger than that and we kind of touched on this thing so I want to actually go back to to something that you said earlier which is the impact of crypto is not just in software uh let's talk about crypto relief tell us about what crypto relief was and what's happened in the last two two and a half years crypto leaf for example uh tell us how it started I did when my sister traveled to to my place and even where I was having this huge like uh you know wave Delta wave of of covet and all that and everybody was left right and Center like I was trying to volunteer for a few people helping them with money things like that and then we would start with 12 people in the morning and then by afternoon six are gone right that was the kind of situation uh that was there and I was already like you know trying to do something but then my sister traveled to my place and she got covered and I also got covered like actually when I started and wrote that tweet that's a very angry anniversary yeah I myself had covet the second time as like you know screw this virus like you know because we had this fight and flight response right until now we were at that time we were flight you know we were in the flight mode just go inside the house stay there locked up everything I said screw this virus you know not only I'm going to fight with this virus with my family but I'm going to help other people also and I wrote that tweet I thought like probably we'll get like one million dollars two million dollars but then you know what vitalik ended up doing like you know with the Sheba coin with a pill in yeah even he thought even he thought like later on he said that you know I thought it was going to be 10 million dollars or something right then you know we ended up getting like 450 million dollars and all that and I'm very proud to say even though it's like slightly unfortunate for web 3 and crypto industry in India that you know it's like you know here it's like a environment of like slight uh you know distrust on it and all that because you know like governments fully don't understand this but an important statistics for you all like even in this room if you are an adult and you got vaccinated one out of every three of you guys are vaccinated using the syringe donated by crypto Leaf like we donated incredible that's a hundred what 200 million people 200 million syringes will be donated with UNICEF and at that point in time like India got vaccines but now there was a syringe problem like you know we did not have it so we liaised with UNICEF work all around the world and got in 200 million syringes in India that is an impact that you literally cannot compete with yes and I want to say like you know that is the impact of like vitalik also like you know not people keep asking me but people don't like realize that it's all because of italic that's the impact of vitalik and I would say eat Community also because he only gathered this thing so shout out to the whole ethereum Community globally ethereum is the ultimate coordination mechanism for the world and this is incredible incredible progress yep all right I want to just uh I why don't y'all wrap this up soon so let's go into a couple of specifics about what we should look forward to this weekend 2 000 people are sitting in front of us the camera can't see it but we can um what should they be thinking about and what should they be excited about to build in this space what I'm excited to I think like you know you know Indian developer fraternity right you know build Niche crypto use cases like you know I see the tendency in Indian developers that we are still going towards utility like okay let me build on this particular thing like a SAS like our mental model is more like you know building SAS building some profitable business and all that like I am saying that you know start thinking about Niche crypto use cases like you know build if you are building D5 build some you know these option models perpetuals and you know more optimized dexes and things like that like there are so many ideas going around even in D5 like think about that like if there are any Finance people liaise with them brainstorm these ideas and all that even in nfts and pfps I don't think like you know a lot of Indian developers have done big so right maybe as you're answering that like I'd love to kind of hear your thoughts on like nfts and Taos and T5 like are you excited about still those things or how do you see them now uh the nfts nfts defy Dao's like as topics do you think there's still room to ex to build more well sure like you know I feel that now they are much more relevant like if you were thinking of building a mainstream mass media kind of application now the focus has focuses back onto these new shoes that's why I'm saying that you know maybe spend more time on your idea even here and you know once you go go home because I feel like my mission is that how we are going to make India web3 superpower is by building multiple unicorns there are three unicorns from India and they will only be built if you build differentiated products you know in the and and right now the right time is for building those Niche use cases like you know if you are building like nft Marketplace like think like what pseudo swap Has Done Right can you solve those kind of use cases nft liquidity like you know don't build the state forward use cases like can you solve nft liquidity by some by some means right or in daos how do you how can you solve uh you know decision making processes in Dao like you know that's the biggest problem right think about like if Dao's are going to be running businesses then they would have to take some sort of privacy transact privacy uh decisions also how can you make sure that you know uh you know there are things which can be uh like highly confidential thing in the context of it now but still the Dao can take take the decision on that right think about these kind of things and even in D5 like for example how uh D5 product products can manage their treasury how they can uh increase the liquidity in their protocols and things like that like not the plain vanilla use cases because right now the markets we are in like not only in crypto generally startup markets it's very very hard to raise capital and you know in order for you to grow and go to the next stage you need to build these differentiated products in this market only only the paranoid Will Survive and only the differentiated Will Survive so you know make sure that you have those differentiation and build those Niche use cases like let's build most Innovative products at least idea level I know that in two days you can't build right at least on an idea level let's see some of the best projects some of the most Innovative projects coming out of you guys that's what I want you guys to do I know it sounds very counter-intuitive but you synthesize this is the perfect time for you to just try things because it might be cool and not because it can be a business this is how large change happens and once something is working or when something is interesting to somebody you will figure out eventually how do you turn that into a product or a business but especially when you have a small time constraint here the goals should be experimentation as you as you already talked about and it should be the weird crazy that that you really want to see that's why like you know I think I forgot when you asked that uh what is the thing that keeps you up and all that like what thing what is the thing you're worried about and at polygon also like you know we always as I was discussing with you that we wanted to build polygon as the business layer of web3 where the businesses are built but especially now the time is that you know again going back to the core web3 routes where you build things which are really cool they might not look like as a business today like uni swap didn't look like a business when he when Hayden started right we didn't know what amms could do like yeah now it's the default it's yes exactly and build things like that and because they are maybe they are cool you are like extremely thinking about something Innovative or think about building things which have an impact like you know this is what I like I feel for polygon Community I want to grow this segment where people who want to change the world not only build the business who want to change the world those kind of people uh you know into the polygon Community also especially I was in Europe and because like a lot of our co-founders like specially Jordy and all that Jordy is also a legend from the ethereum community like I saw a lot of like pride in a European community of polygon like even I heard I heard this term called polygon maxi yeah so I think that's that's what we call success yes so you know so people where this is public goods like how can you make an impact on the world with these things try to build those things not immediately focused on that this can be a business this can be a business this is the right time to build those cool experimentations ideas because some of them are going to be so compelling that they will be the ones that that will end up uh getting capital and growth opportunities I think that's a perfect note to end this on Sandeep thank you so much for joining us thank you everyone let's make it big guys all right now I'm going to try to talk really fast for five minutes and get all of you ready to hack the next stop and the only thing remaining is all the prizes so let's try to do this very quickly 350 000 of prizes to be won I'm going to talk about all these prizes are and then I'm going to tell you where you can find all the specific details for all of them so let's start with ipfs and filecoin there are two tracks one of them is General storage track and an fbm track each of these tracks are offering ten thousand dollars each so you can get two thousand dollars for three teams for the best General storage track which is just using ipfs or falcoin and there's a pool prize of four thousand dollars which means anybody who uses ipfs or falcoin will be splitting this amount for up to five hundred dollars per person then the fvm track is if you get to deploy your contract to the Falco and virtual machine you can also win six thousand dollars with two thousand dollars or three times of those prizes and a full price for anybody deploying on fvm next up is the polygon prize a lot of amazing categories and prices from polygon so the best use of polygon ID goes to four thousand dollars for a team the best D5 project will also win four thousand dollars the best public goods project will win for the best ux or devx project will also Win 4 000 and the best developer tool or Dow tooling is also going to win four thousand dollars next up is worldcoin so a lot of categories for World coin two the best overall app of world coin using the proof of personhood protocol will receive 4 000 the best governance app on worldcoin will be getting 3 000 the best social and most creative use case of worldcoin will be getting 3 000 as well and four honorable mentions of one thousand dollars and a three thousand dollar prize pool which means any project building on worldcoin will be splitting this amount evenly then we have Push protocol they have two parallel tracks for the push chat implementation you can win three thousand two thousand and one thousand dollars for first second third place and for the push notification implementations you can also win three two and one thousand for first second and third place and an eight thousand dollar pool which means as long as you use push protocol in your project it will be splitting eight thousand dollars evenly with all the other projects next up is by economy so three different categories for by economy prizes the best module on the SDK will win three thousand dollars the best transaction batching application will win two thousand and a pool price category of five thousand which means 250 dollars to each team up to 20 teams here can win a prize for just deploying and using by economy's SDK next up is Lee Finance so two tracks here for the best use of Levi's SDK for a customizable widget we'll get 2500 for the first place 12.50 for second 750 for third and a runner up for 500 and the best contract call cross-chain application will get 2 000 for the first place 1000 per second and 500 for third place they also have a full price for fifteen hundred dollars next up is the ethereum foundation prizes so they have two categories of really important projects they want you to build on for any browser base or wallet based application that uses erc4337 will win 2500 up to two teams and we also want a good developer experience for the EIP four three three seven to uh to come into play and there are two prizes for this category as well for twenty five hundred dollars each next up is ZK Bob so five teams can win two thousand dollars for just the best integration and using the ZK Bob API and this will be paid in Bob tokens next up is ballast a lot of prizes from valet so the best use of software licensing nft using the balance protocol will have one thousand dollars given up to two teams the best app or games deployed on ballast will get six of them will get 500 each and a five thousand dollar pool prize category that's going to split everything evenly with all the participants next up we have the graph so the graph has two two categories for the best subgraph Explorer you will get 2200 for the first place and 800 with runner-up and the best use of an existing sub graph on your project will get 1500 for the first place and 500 for the runner-up and
