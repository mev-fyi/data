[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right hey what the hell let's just start is this mic on testing one two three can you all hear it all right good afternoon everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to the closing ceremonies for east amsterdam [Applause] this took a while to get started and that's because we had one of the best scenarios you can expect at a hackathon which is way more projects than we thought we would get so we're going to get all into all of that and the goals for this closing ceremonies are simple we're going to bring on some amazing teams that are going to demo live what they built over the weekend and then we're going to talk about all the prizes and then any kind of closing remarks that we need to do about the logistics of what happens next and also everybody hello on the live stream so a lot of you are watching this online as well so you can still check out all the projects and everything that comes out of it on eatglobal.tv and uh hello to everybody on the live stream so it's been an amazing weekend we kind of started off with a quick uh fireside chat with vitalik on everything we're looking forward to in the future uh stuff about its personal life as well as kind of how we think about the ecosystem has evolved in the past decade there's a lot of amazing kind of people here hanging out talking to all of these amazing partners eating a lot of food doing a lot of talking collecting a lot of swag uh i think this is a shot from uh 2 a.m last night where people were just hanging out and trying to get the the projects working so it's been so energetic over the past uh two days that um it just it's just so amazing to see that again after all these years i got some more amazing footage from just the past few weekends and we kind of saw a lot of projects getting judged of the last few hours and of course i think this is my favorite uh people define the rules and with that we are at a close so we we submitted we the submission deadline was 9 am we waited for everybody to kind of uh finish up their project there was a handful of technical difficulties as usual and uh kind of bringing all that together with 700 hackers who participate in 47 workshops and it still blows my mind that we have 31 percent of people here who are coming in from what to web 3. and collectively they made 165 submissions this is absolutely incredible to come out of a weekend this deserves a massive round of applause this officially is the biggest number of submissions we've ever had in any in-person hackathon i am absolutely blown away by this and we're going to bring on some amazing teams up on stage so that's just the projects all the hard work was done by 21 judges today that sat and saw every one of these demos talk to everybody give feedback and recommendations i want to specifically shout out to give a shout out to gotham ken raff linda franzi stephen james scott robert shannon george wesley min anthony simona ryan evan veronica stani tess and alicia all of them were talking to all of you and uh without the time and doing all the actual hard work this we would not be here for the closing ceremonies so thank you to all of our judges and i also want to give a quick shout out to every single partner here that's been such an amazing group to to work with and really keep you as far as gearbox optimism dydx one inch yeah let's just get the clap going i'll i'll go faster avi grants slide peer ipfs falcon polygon wallet connect scale saturn mina toucans super fluid skill wallet lens protocol radical tribe dial wetriot volts tempest sweeney swap grass program coinbase wallet the graph gnosis safe ap wine connects uma xerion gelato epns quick note ck sync boba block demon amber pandora fmos student analytics bruce union urine finance flux fuel anchor coin spec swing stack os cyber connect and zk pad thank you so much i am surprised the energy you all have from uh no sleep all right so this is not a conference the goal for this event was to focus on building and prioritizing showing over telling so with that we had 165 submissions and from there we got 13 finalists we're going to bring them on one by one and they're going to demo what they built and you all got to see all the amazing things that came out and after these demos end it'll just be back-to-back 13 demos we're going to talk about all the prizes so i'll cut it short let's get right into it we have our 13 amazing finalists so please give all these teams a big round of applause in no particular order retro x nimi.ed hexagons democracy crazy flown tempera pfp native dara yieldgate detroit's activity dao creator site and collective action we're going to bring them on and before we do i want to take a quick second to thank all the amazing projects that were here even though you were not one of these 13 does not mean we're not good enough we just want to highlight some things that excited our judges so please please please continue building everything that you did we really want all of you to get the help you need and we want to encourage all of you to continue building and being in part of this ecosystem so congratulations to all of you here we're going to talk about the prizes there are still a lot of you that want a lot of prizes so don't worry and for those of you who are watching this on the live stream or even here in this audience if you want to see what else came out of it you can head over to showcase.edu and see all 165 projects and soon you will also see the list of prizes you want on your own project page so if you miss this thing or you're going to fall asleep in 20 minutes don't worry it'll show up on your profile all right demo time so let's bring on our very first demo and that is retro 0x without further ado let's welcome the first team on stage [Applause] you're all on that side yeah can we switch to the second stream [Music] there we go there we go so hi everyone um we are um retroarch and we've built a an on-chain platform for optimally funding public goods like vitalik we think public goods are incredibly underrated and we think there are not enough tools in the ecosystem to optimally allocate funds to them and we have combined two paradigms in our platform which which are retroactive funding of public goods and also regenerative funding of public goods to keep incentivizing people to build good things in the future and also to reward people who've built good things and this is where our names retrogenerative public goods comes from and the way our platform works is that we provide a curated set of uh set of users which are whitelisted and which are known as experts in a particular domain and they then perform quadratic funding and orlando will tell you how exactly that will then work so the so the protocol will be deployed on um optimism the core contract is the retrox um contract which implements the quadratic voting logic and the um fund disbursement logic so after a successful quadratic funding round has finished then funds will be dispersed in a two-stage process first of all the um [Music] the retroactive funding will be sent directly to each recipient's wallet and then following that the regenerative funding will be streamed to each recipient's wallet via the superfluid module so back in back in last october optimism did a sort of a test run um of uh doing a retroactive public good round and we've built a dashboard to sort of show all this data um so here we're able to go into the go into the round and see the live data inside we can see all the nominations here on the bottom bottom left hand side and um you can see the the all the description the website and see um sort of why they should get this money um we could also see um that in in in the pot in the pie graph we we can see um who voted for what and um what where the handle corresponds to um the the voter this way we can we can see trends in what stakeholders are voting for what projects um yeah um also um we can click on on the batch holders and and see every single stakeholder which um was basically in control the decision making process to make um to make all this funding um work and then we basically also um this platform can basically also do this in the future so we created a test category here in which we just have two nominations and you can see the two nominations here and click here and then when you basically here's a curated bayana curated a list of experts here and when we log in with a wallet that's basically whitelisted it's quite difficult to navigate you can basically select the project here and use quadratic voting to assign your votes and then at the end basically cast your votes which are then submitted to on chain for everyone to publicly see so here we can see the workflow that uh we have to create a new nomination so you can see that i'm connected with metamask um and i'm logging in and here i'm assigning a particular transaction i can i can verify the transaction has actually been passed to the smart contract so yeah here i'm i'm nominating someone to be funded in a particular round before i've initialized around and i also need to stake 0.1e to prevent spam from flooding the flooding in particular around so here i'm suggesting someone who should be funded or some protocol which is as a public good and then again i can verify that this transaction has actually been sent to the smart contract and i've staked 0.1 eth upon nominating someone and jessica will tell you something about the superfluid streaming yes siree deploys the contract on optimism testnet and here we verified it so you can write to the contract directly on this interface and you can see that these are the functions that are available so in this case we are just creating the round and the nominations and verifying the transactions are going through and then the most important one at the end is then depositing the funds um which we do here and when we deposit the funds 50 of it is for past funding so that's the retroactive funding and then 50 of its for future and that we stream using superfluid um and as you can see the metamask account um once we set that up it um it starts at 0.001 each and then it maximizes to 0.035 eth once it has the funds deposited and this is our meme if you want to find out more read our whitepaper thank you so much for listening congratulations please give them a big round of applause all right next up we have nimmy.eth whenever you're ready and we'll just kind of do back-to-back so the next team will be hexagons protocol so we'll just have you on deck so nimi.e please uh come on stage gm amsterdam hello so i promised my team if we were finalists i'd wear like a turtleneck sweater like eric bachmann in silicon valley but the lack of sweet sleep didn't make that possible but we good to go no tech issues you're good to go you can see your screen i don't have a good joke i don't have a safe joke awesome can we full it's fine like that i guess as well awesome so we are nimi my name is dave we have zed john and milan you guys also saw adam at the beginning who was hacking in the no hacking zone he didn't make it through the night but let's saw the presentation so who here has an ens domain i guess if you you have an ens domain right ens is awesome right first of all you can set up a profile pic on your ens domain so it connects to websites and you can see your pfp that's awesome if you use etherscan a lot you're on a multi-sig or whatever it also makes it a lot easier to actually see what you're doing right otherwise you just see long numbers and the most crucial part of ens of course and the most important part of uns today is flexing it on your twitter handle right but how many of you actually host some content on your ens so if we visit your ens website in a browser how many are actually hosting content so we went from like 50 hands to three or four and that's the one thing we kind of saw like a lot of people are actually not using it to host content right so if we look at kind of like the evolution of web domains we kind of went from like very basic uh html and css pages to like basic stores where you can buy stuff and web 2 where today you can buy anything a house a car and web 3 mostly looks like this today no one's actually hosting anything on the ens domain duh and here's a stat from trust me bro 97.4 percent of ens domains actually don't host any content at all and welcome to nemi so this is kind of what we hacked on at the conference so nimi is uh finnish stands for name apparently it's a cool thing to name your startup with a finnish word according to bloomberg so we just went for that and nimi is just an app where you can actually just set up your social profile page on your ens in a few clicks and i'd love to demo it right now but i'm not a macbook guy so if you can get up the the app we'll actually do a quick live demo and you guys can actually set up your own social page by going on nemi.if.limo are we in oh now i have oh this is going to be complicated okay so you go to the app you simply connect your wallet and here we're actually querying the ens sub graph to check all ens domains you actually own so they just be pulled up directly you choose any one you want to deploy on so i'll just go for carrot kpi.if for example you can insert your twitter handle here i'll just put mine as an example feel free to follow me and then it just pulls up all your data here in like a pre-formatted format and we actually upload this content on ipfs so if you click on i deploy to ipfs will actually generate an ipfs hash of this data it'll pull up a transaction i can't see how much the gas cost is but it should be quite low and by simply clicking here on sign or confirm you actually did everything you have to do so it'll take a while to go live just because limo takes a while to find the page can we go back to the presentation because this will take a while or the next like show them the demo page you go back on the browser quickly sorry guys i don't have the screen in front of me so it's a bit of a i don't see the mouse okay i found it so here you can see how an actual deployed website would look so we deployed this earlier on portfolio.if.limo and the next one in four minutes should also be live and can we go now back to the presentation last time certainly yeah and so right now we don't we didn't add too much stuff because of the hackathon we were time constrained but the main idea here is really that you can set up your own web page on your ens domain and if you go to conferences instead of sharing telegrams etc you can just share your e and s with people make a qr code out of it and then they have all your contact info there your profile pic and most importantly we also spoke with our friends of uh from lens so one cool thing we really want to do is like do a deeper lens integration where your ens could actually be your own profile page for your web free social media and we think that's quite cool and uh a cool way to kind of onboard people from twitter which of course is centralized into like the web free social media space and if you guys want to check it out it's live you can deploy your enf domains just go nemi.eve.limo and share it on twitter and you can follow nimi on twitter as well zeroxneemi and we have some cool stickers sitting around and yes we made them during the conference yeah we did like some late stick of night sticker production folks at ipfs told us this morning that if you turn it upside down it says i win which we didn't notice until this morning that's all set up your domain and thanks a lot for your time guys awesome all right we're gonna live adjust and paralyze a lot of this process so we're gonna happen is we're gonna do demos and get set ready back to back and then we'll we'll just switch the sides so next up we have hexagons protocol here and then on that side let's get democracy set up to my right so without further ado let's welcome hexagons protocol [Applause] so hello everyone my name is thomas and along with mauro and alessandro we've built the hexagons protocol so the hexagons protocol is both a protocol and a framework to build social media driven smart contracts so what does it mean well many of you may be familiar with the new linking of your twitter account with the hexagonal profile picture uh so with ethereum based nfts well if you have like a profile on a social media like in this case or on any other social media via the hexagons protocol you will be able to dynamically and automatically trigger smart contradictions so um during the demo we'll be showing one example of this live so you can check it out on twitter yourself to see how it works so you see that we have created like an account this stylish biddler and it has the hexagonal shape because as twitter itself will show us in a second uh hopefully it's an nft that is actually linked to ethereum okay so you see view nft details i can see here the contractor and so on now this is a specially crafted erc721 token which we have built on top of the protocol that is capable of listening to authenticated uh posts from social media so what i'm gonna do now is starting on the left um like uh the relayer which is basically a component of the application which is specifically built for this collection and for this use case it's built on top of the protocol that we have designed so it has just started let's see how it works in this case you see i have brown hair so i will just say write something like time to dye my hair blue for instance and like hexagons protocol and i will tweet it so what's going to happen now is that after the tweet is sent the relayer on the left will is listening for those kind of events it will filter out all the tweets of similar kind which are not authenticated so where the author doesn't belong to it and it will send a transaction on the blockchain after it has fetched off chain all the evidence needed so in this case it has fetched from the oracle an authenticity proof showing that according to twitter.com if you trust their api um there is a connection of the twitter profile with um like the on-chain address on ethereum so let's check it out on chain uh this is eaterscan offer it will show up great it has been confirmed already this is the transaction the transaction contains a standard hook format that we have defined which works for any social media so it doesn't work just with twitter or for this use case it can be used for example with lens protocol we'll show you we have done an integration with a reference module for lens and it can work with any kind of message any kind of proof it's very agnostic now this has changed the state on the blockchain and um in theory yep uh we have just forced for the interest of the presentation the um like metadata on the metadata on openc which is the api being used in this case and basically um if i force the refresh of the nft you will see the new nft has already updated the hair color so if the state has changed both of chain and on chain now let's see how it works so um let's go to the presentation great so um there are many possible use cases beyond nft and gaming such as gauging interest for dow proposals so if we had had more time we would have made for example a snapshot.org plugin so that you can do some pulls clearly with twitter uh there you cannot really do it high you know value transfers because there is an open trust line with them but it's surely a way to facilitate the transition from web 2 based social networks to web31 so that it doesn't happen all at once we don't scare people out and you know we we basically bridge the two words gradually this is the architecture you can see on the bottom the protocol there is the solidity component everything is modular so there are oracle modules social modules we've made the last one during the architon the twitter one and the application you saw on top is just one of many possibilities so you can do many other things on top this silly example with nft is just something that visually gives you the idea but you can potentially do anything around that concept next steps are to make it more general and to show more examples this is already live on mainnet clearly it needs a bit of polishing thank you for your attention amazing all right switching over to the other side let's welcome democracy [Applause] hi everyone um hey everyone we're a group of students um sponsored by paduan dao sent to you and we built democracy which is an off-train anonymous voting system and the main difference between our platform and on snapshot is that our platform our platform is that individual results are encrypted and only the public only the aggregated result is revealed through the use of zero knowledge and homomorphic encryption hi i'm andy and now we'll show a small demo of democracy democracy working i will connect my metamask and as you can see we can find different taos organizations we will view we can see the proposals and here we will be able to register a new proposal and when i do this i will be prompted to sign a message we will then be useful and when it comes to actually encrypting the votes i will create a proposal and i will and i will be prompt to sign the message after signing the message i can go back and choose any other proposal i want learn more about them check their end times and finally cast my vote and i will again be asked to when casting my vote i will be asked to sign a new message which as we can see does not contain my actual vote but rather just the fact that i bought it so talking a bit about like how this work a quick overview we use we mainly use the exponential elgaman description encryption scheme which has some properties very useful for us which is it's additively homomorphic which means that you can add the encrypted numbers and then decrypt the results with the same key that they which we they were encrypted and you will get the actual sum without decrypting the individual numbers then so when he created the poll when annie created the poll he signed the transaction that transaction like the signature is used as like a private key and here is a public key with which the users will encrypt their votes uh using this elgamal exponential encryption scheme a cool thing here is that it includes some randomness so two votes doing the same thing are not encrypted necessary in the same way that's for security reasons so then when you want to like get the results everyone votes they sign this message saying that they voted it's this is uploaded to ipfs to have like a verifiable registry of the voters so that anyone can vote twice or those things and only the authority has access like to the secret key to calculate the decrypted results but the cool thing here is that they know how to decrypt individual results because since this is additively homomorphic they can just decrypt the final result um so also this the secret key can also be like a summer secret key sharing like sharing within like a multisig or something like that to make things more secure and the another cool thing here is that we use three knowledge proofs so to prove that the votes that the voters submitted were correct like they were zero or one and not other numbers and just to prove that the decrypted result is correctly decrypted which is important so that this is trustable and efficient so let's talk about what's next first we want to submit all of our zk proofs on chain so that other contracts can read and verify them next we also want to provide our users a signed message so that they can reveal how they voted if they choose to do so and finally we want to develop on-chain voting capabilities as more mainstream and sensitive as more mainstream and sensitive issues are brought onto these platforms people will seek an alternative offering anonymity and that is where democracy comes in thank you amazing all right next up we have flown and on the other side on deck tempra please give a big round of applause for flown [Applause] hey hello everybody how are you doing uh we're flown uh flying loans that means um a borrowed sum of money that can fly across blockchains thank you thank you um just a little bit of context beforehand um this is the space that we defined for this hacking uh this hackathon cross chain dev management we are in the lone teleporter space really big the problem that we're trying to solve is that main net users right now want to migrate their debt position collateral plus debt to enjoy lower borrowing rates in other chains that they desire and right now they have to do each each transaction individually unwind the position bridge and then open it in the other side and no one has time for that so yes so our solution is is that good um one transaction to do it to to simplify the experience for for our users um so you click teleport everything is done in the background by us and then your position your dead position appears in the other side we were very much inspired by abe portos and we wanted to go a step further to not only migrate a tokens but also the debt position as as a whole so um we face some constraints to to connect the smart contracts with the systems at the end but um this is our prototype you connect your wallet to it where you can where we can pick up the positions that you have on that wallet here we can see that we have a position in ave in rinkeby of one wrap bitcoin with 10 000 usdc against it if we would click on it we land on the per in the teleport parameter screen where we break down what you have the transactions that you're about to pay we are using connects to to bridge from one chain to the other they charge a 0.5 flat fee in theory we would also charge that same flat fee to to bridge and here we can see that is grayed out on this side because the position already exists there and here in theory we would see all the all the chains that you you want to bridge to optimism scales arbitrarily all of them and also choose the protocol that you want to to to teleport as well there we're clicking um in intel transportation like i said we couldn't really at the end connect the smart contracts to all the systems due to limitations but everyone can imagine here that after all the transactions are done you can verify on chain one and chain two that the transactions were done and once you click in back to the positions the the loan the debt position is not in rinkeby in this case it's already in in cobin um lastly this is the team that hacked these last 48 hours and uh yeah here they are congratulations to the entire flown team all right next up we have tempra and on deck pfp native please welcome tempra you hi everyone so my name is victoria and this is oh well wait but my name is victoria and this is ian and we'll be doing the presentation today uh we're a group of five teammates from vancouver canada and we're so excited to be presenting tempra to you so tempra is a all-in-one encompassing [Music] we're almost there there we go all right okay so tempra is an all-in-one encompassing messaging platform and we were heavily inspired by snapchat as well as messenger to implement features like ephemeral content so stories that only last for a certain limited period of time as well as private messages and dms we want to bring the uniqueness of composable profiles that lens protocol offers and bridge that with privacy features like using lit protocol and limiting the amount of time someone can access content as well as being able to send direct private messages to our users and so i'll let ian take us through the demo cool i'll just talk about our stack real quick um so obviously we built on top of lens protocol and we're using lit protocol to enable privatization and encoding and decoding of messages and we also have coinbase wallet and wallet connect and it's all built on top of react so let's go to the live can't see anything okay this is tempra so um we're logged in as mackie mackie is a user on lens so that's an nft on the right side on the sidebar we have all the people we follow on lens these are all nfts as well so if we go ahead and view vandy's profile it'll bring up a conversation and if you can see real quick it showed that everything was encrypted but after a few seconds lit protocol will decode all of those messages and we can view the content um so um we also have ephemeral content so down here if you before you make a post you can choose how long you want it to be up maybe a minute maybe 24 hours and after that time has passed the message will become expired so we're taking advantage of lit protocols updatable uh what does it say we can update the rules for decoding so basically after maybe five minutes we don't allow anyone to decode that message anymore and for these messages we we basically check who the owners of the user profiles are these nfts so only that the owners of van dazzle and mackie can decode these messages um what else is there we also have stories this wasn't we kind of we kind of messed up a little bit here but uh basically you can upload videos to our platform we use the live peer api their short form api we meant to nft get that all uploaded to ipfs and then we make that into a lens post and we also use the ephemeral content functionality there so it's basically instagram stories your content will go away after maybe 24 hours and on the technical side uh all the lit protocol stuff is uploaded to ipfs so if actually we can show some of the so this is what it looks like if you were to just go on a standard lens implementation so this is this is a post this a post signifies the beginning of a conversation all the replies are included in the post as metadata of this nft and we have a key this is the encryption key that we need for lit protocol and we also have the ipfs url of the encrypted blob so we combine the blob and the key and the wallet address of the owner of this nft and that allows us to decrypt it on our front end here and yeah that's pretty much it thank you so much thank you amazing congratulations all right next up we have pfp native and on deck dara okay uh hey we are pfp native i'm here today with lauren and oh on the other one this works sounds better uh hey we're php native i'm here with laurent and we're going to present you what we hacked together this weekend so we're really into pixelated art and we love projects like nouns we would have wished we had a way to share something like nouns with our community but it's a bit a bit it's a bit out of our financial reach let's say so we were like okay it would be cool if you could create your own pixelated art super easily in a no-code way and cheaply most of all so we built this tool which allows you to create a custom unique pfps in a couple of minutes it's a no-code tool so we're going to walk you through it so here we're actually creating uh like some kind of pfp collection setting a mint price and you can actually select some parts that are mixed and matched and that results in like unique characters which are generated so this is just a preview this is actually generated on the fly on on mint so those are just some example of what your community members could end with all the sprites were generated during the weekend and we want to thank rose who is not here but who helped us draw those fun little figures uh so that's it i'm going to leave it to you later on all right so let's uh deploy our pfp collection so now i will deploy this actually deploy an nft collection with the trades that i selected i will just increase the gas limit a little bit to make sure that it doesn't fail on demo okay so now it's it's deploying nft collection with all of those trades and all of the artwork is generated on chain and also stored on chain and once it's created the pfp collection we can actually generate an invite link and send that to our community members so that they could start minting their pfp now let's just hope that it goes faster a bit that's that's the issue of blockchain demos right okay let's just go to the backup already uh so this is basically what you would end up with you would get a minting link and you could send that to your community and you could ask it to mint your pfp all right so now i'm a community member i'm minting my pfp here we go so i'm gonna go and that's what you would end up with it's basically an nft but everything is stored on chain um and it's generated on chain and you could be able to browse it of course in the nft marketplaces that's it so that was us so lauren and i also working on another project to help grow webtree communities so if you're either interested in using pfp native or growing your website communities don't hesitate to come talk to us later thanks thanks thank you so much next up we have dara and on deck yieldgate and uh just as a comment we are getting a lot of noise from the back so if we can please quiet down a little bit we'll just go through the five more demos and then you can all figure out what prizes you want all right welcome dara hi everyone gm i'm steph verpillia and i'm a web3 developer hi i'm christina polyuk and i'm also a developer hi i'm mabel chibiri and i'm a data analyst hi i'm chantal and i'm a product manager and hello my name is sunny saatva and i am a dow enthusiast and maximalist i'm the founder of the vegan africa dao one of the co-founders of the black leaders dao as well as the crypto lingo dao and we are all here today thanks to the amazing blue dao blu-3 dao empowering women non-binary individuals like myself and allies in the web 3 space and throughout all of this amazing work we're doing with daos we're recognizing some serious roadblocks we need to be more efficient we need to be encouraging community engagement in our taos and we want to know how can we measure the degree of decentralization in a dao and that's exactly what daora is working to do yeah so just like sunny said okay we recognized a real web 3 pain point in daos you know it's infrastructure and it's it's organization so our vision really is to boost dow performance through data driven decisions you know we didn't want to reinvent the wheel so we looked to web 2 we looked at the successes from web 2 and we looked at like agile methodologies so think of dara as jira but decentralized with blockchain dao analytics and we are called dara but really we're for every community driven project yeah so we're having a little bit of technical difficulty showing our dap at the moment uh but imagine a dab with a we've all we know what adapt looks like right yeah so on the upper right hand side we've got a connect wallet button and we used wallet connect which allows us to use any type of wallet on any chain so we have a cross chain product we're on ethereum and polygon right now but we have plans to move to solana as well um but what our dap looks like is it shows all of the dows that you hold social tokens for so we've onboarded four dows so far including blue dao devdao vegan africa fund and also friends with benefits so when you're connected with your wallet you can see the different dows that you're part of based on social tokens and you can also see tasks associated with those dows so any updates on that i could keep going but basically the tasks are associated to dows and we have three decentralized databases that christina will tell you a little more about yeah so to populate the data used by dara we built three decentralized data stores using ipfs and orbitdb and those represent the tasks users and dows a single dow can have many tasks associated with it but one task is always associated with a single dow and a user can also belong to many daos and obviously a dao can have many users associated with it so a task will contain information obviously like the name and description and also the creator assignee and bounty associated with completing the task a user will have also basic profile information as well as the dows they are participating in and adele will also have basic profile information as well as a list of administrators that can perform special operations like spam task deletion so the whole point of a dao is the decentralization but how do we actually determine whether a dao is actually decentralized well data data is very powerful however we saw that there was a lack of data analytics tools for dows and that's why we created our own reporting tool using june analytics and what we did is we used the fact that we have our users wallet addresses but not only that anytime a user completes a task they will also have receiver token so we used that transaction data and we identified what the each transaction what wall they were associated with and were then able to identify the contributors of the dows so in a dow in which out of 400 members only five like 60 or 70 percent of the tasks are completed by five members we would obviously know that they are not as decentralized as they should be and that's how we came up with our own uh data centralization scoring uh which is very very helpful for people trying to join dows but also for dao's metrics in terms of again making data dreaming decisions or even setting milestones in the future okay so just to finish off if you would like to see a dap you can follow us on twitter at dara labs that's d-a-o-r-a-labs thank you thank you just give them a big round of applause of course we run into technical difficulties from time to time but if we can make uh this work we'll maybe bring them on back again all right next up we have yield gate and on deck tetris hi there hello everyone um yeah this is healgate we're a group of hackers who just met at this hackathon we're from all over europe and yieldgate is new mechanism to connect content creators and supporters and donors of those content creators by a new mechanism so on yieldgate if you want to support a project you can stake some eth or medic or any other token and then this will generate yield but the yield that is generated is actually not forwarded to the one who staked but for the one to the designated project or designated creator and um yeah that's that's the core idea of it and um here you can see um yeah i think you can already go to the creators page yeah i'm going to do a quick presentation what you can see here see here is like a discovery of all the creators on the platform you can click on one and see the creator profile actually you see the content is locked because the user has not staked any magic yet we are deployed on polygon mumbai what you can see on the left is like the creator profile name and avatar how many supporters or even staked and how many posts he already has and the sponsors at the bottom and what i can show you now is how the user actually can stake some medic to unlock the content i will do it right now i can select the amount confirm and what is actually very interesting to mention here so in the background the smart contract everything is already fully implemented so what's happening here is that a new pool contract is generated it's actually like a shallow clone using eoc 1167 and this clone is then the entity that will interact in this case with other and then other we stake another and then all the yield that is generated is then forwarded to the crater and then the actual stake can at any point in time be unstaked by the supporter yeah so now what you see the stakes just finished and i can lock i've unlocked the content and can see everything i can unstake my medic at every moment and now i will show you the same page but on the view of the creator i will change my wallet and what you see as a creator you have different options you can post content which is stored on a on a database i will just make a new post is yieldgate the patreon or web3 maybe you can also mark down format your content so if i post you see no post added to the to the list and on the left you see actual generated yield that is available to claim for the uh for the creator so i will just do that and do a quick refresh claim it yeah whoop it's taking a moment yeah i've claimed my first yield nice and the user supported the creator like basically for free because he can unstake his amount at every time yeah i mean one very important aspect is that it's more of a psychological project really right i mean of course you can always take something you can earn some yield and then you could in theory just forward the yield to wherever you want to support but who's ever doing that right you don't really do that but with this mechanism you can just think maybe you have some some either on your ledger you're not really using it you can actually stake it and someone else will just get the yield and that happens automatically basically like when you need it you can just unstack it of course so what could be next we launch our mainnet on other l2s possibly expand to other default protocols or integrate with the lens protocol what's also be possible to make our pool contract erc721 compatible so that you basically can show off nft badges of the uh of the creators you're supporting and yeah some more settings and actually this can be expanded to be its own yield streaming payment protocol and sdk even yeah so i mean what we showed you here with this like block thing is of course it's just one application but you can make it more abstract and then you can use it for any kind of yeah yield support and also combined of course with the gating so that only your supporters your patrons will get access to some gated content so you can also think of it a bit of like yeah yield me coffee yeah so go to yieldgate.xyz on your desktop check it out follow us on twitter check out our code and yeah yeah and uh yeah create a creator profile or a mistake and some yields yeah thank you thank you so much all right on the other side we have dress and on deck creator site after this we got two more demos to go so let's uh keep it quiet in the back again and we'll get to all the prizes whenever you're ready dress so first of all uh thanks for for your time we are finium and we basically build tetris which is an application or in this case two problems that we wanted to solve first of all first was nfts we were all a bit tired of just images and videos or 3d models so we thought about what we could do to improve like interactive interactive ability and playability of an nft so basically what we built was the rust engine that compiles to web assembly and that basically generates a static site that we can play and basically build tetris on that so we deployed to ipfs so basically right now you can go to the ipfs link and you can just play tetris so that was the main the main thing that we wanted to do and after that we were thinking like what more can we do to have some fun with this and learn a bit of stuff so we don't have that many experience with layer twos so he decided to try something out and basically we tried to make this uh an nft that we meant on the layered one then we use optimism and we make we made a bridge that moves the asset across to the optimism network and then we started to think what if the nft that you are playing is like the interface where you are basically gathering a couple of interactions and set actions and then you can have a different game an on-chain game that could be instead of tetris like a puzzle game so basically your and your end result is a subset of pieces that need to appear on screen so the l-shape or the air or the column shape or whatever and you have to have a high score so basically what you need to do is play the game and afterwards you can just basically try to act it so you don't really need to play the game actually playing the game is the least efficient way of playing the blockchain or the puzzle game you just need to act the instructions and try to come up with the result for this given set of tiles and this ice core what can we do and how can we make that happen on screen so just a quick demo we basically we are sorry i think it's not showing so let me just go back here let me just technical difficulties maybe there no yeah so here we are what i was saying is that we have this so this is the epfs that we are running again you can just like play stuff uh on ipfs we are basically meeting the nfts and this is just like webassembly working on the browser so really this is a proof of concept about what we can do and how we can make like the next evolution of nfts instead of just being an image or an svg we can basically have doom running on the browser or have like windows but basically i think that the most interesting thing for us is just hacking things like going to openc and i think okay no not really sorry oh there we go okay so if i don't need to reload just a second live demos always funds right yeah so right so basically we can play on openc or whatever the the marketplace because this is just the uh the engine working on the ipfs and basically what we really want to do is to create an experience and think what can we do with this what can like what can nfts be and i think that this is a good proof of concept but at the end of the day what makes me like excited for this is what people can like think out of the box and try to do things so basically i i just want to take this opportunity to thank like the organization and everybody that participated in the academe because this kind of thing is really what moves the ecosystem forward and make us think about what we can do and what we cannot do so thanks for your time we are finium have a nice day thank you so much really appreciate this all right next up we have creator site is creator style here on stage we'll just have you all get set up hello how are we doing and on deck collective action please come on to stage left stage left can you be in the center i don't know okay let's go can we go oh we're waiting for ellie all right just to set the mood a little all right by show of hands how many of you guys are into the creator economy okay cool how many of you guys like podcasts okay cool so my name is adam levy i host the podcast called mint it's a web 3 native creator economy podcast and uh every single season i issue a series of nfts about hundreds of thousands of nfts with the soul of tent with the sole intention of kind of learning more about my audience on chain right so i've issued pull-ups on the x-side chain i've issued sites uh nfts on my site to mint but there's a problem okay i know nothing about my audience i have a bunch of addresses that have collected mine ft's and i wish there was a way for me to kind of learn how many of them hold board apes how many of them are in fwb what is their net worth and kind of tap into a series of data that would kind of help me improve my strategy my sponsorships and overall growth of the podcast so this is creator site and uh i'll let ellie kind of take it away as soon as we get the screen to display just over here did you connect bear with us bear with us awesome there we go this was what was supposed to be on the screen when adam was talking uh yeah we are called creator site um so what adam was alluding to is that he as an artist as a creator has no idea really what his community looks like um and so an example of this is for like let's look at a a marketplace that exists for musicians so right now there is a centralized marketplace for musicians called sound xyz where artists can go on and mint their their music but again they don't know exactly what their holders look like so if you look on here you can see a bunch of different songs we're going to show you an example of the one and only snoop dogg so that's why we played the track at the beginning to start um so you can actually take here what we've built as a tool to be able to take the contract address of a collection and be able to take it to our platform called creator site where you can enter in the smart contract and what we're going to be doing is providing insights for you as a creator so we want to give you the things that are really going to be most valuable to you to understand what your community of of your holders actually look like so when this populates here you can see that we have different stats for the token itself we have the total holders the the amount of nfts that you actually held but then you get into some really specific data about who are these these people in that are actually holding your nfts and so you can um look at the things that are most valuable like how many of your entities do they hold if they're holding 98 versus two that's something that you might want to know if they're holding um you know has a portfolio value of 1.4 million that might be pretty interesting to know as a creator but right now that data is just not accessible to most individuals another really great metric that is is important is what is the age of your uh wallet and so if you have a creator who whose nft holders are their wallet is maybe two months old versus five years old that might help you target and understand what should you do next in the space are you going to do something that's easily accessible to onboarding are you going to do something that's a little bit more crypto native um so the next thing that we actually were able to do so to collect all this data you know we're scraping um different nodes for ethereum mainnet and we were able to you know access some of the etherscan apis for now to gather all this information but we not only looked at the wallet address contents for my nft collection or adam's nft collection but we want to see what else that these creators or these collectors are holding and so that's where we actually integrate and add the insights section where you can see that what else are these uh individuals holding and so we we've been able to collect and scan and so our first metric here we show that 40 of our holders for that hold the snoop dog collection also hold the association nft and another one that you can see here is that this wicked hounds is it nft collections not specific to musicians but another collection and 50 of them also hold wicked apes which would make sense since they're like a partner collection so we have these insights we have the ability to track to see what else are these holders actually creating and that might help you understand what partnerships to look at that might also help you in the future when you can build out tooling for insights and we can have data maps that say like i have mine my cluster of collectors here they also collect these nfts over here and these nfts over here and now i want to scan all of those and collect all those addresses there and maybe i want to airdrop them something or i can use that those to actually like download into excel sheet or whatever you may want to have that data collected so this day is really useful for creators themselves but like i said when i first started with sound xyz which is a centralized marketplace you can't not anyone can just mint there how are they determining who gets minted on their platform so this is a really great tooling same way that exchanges use like centralized exchanges use uh data to be able to decide what's what coins to list this is a way to provide data for nft marketplaces to decide what what nft projects or creators that they should partner with to list now the beauty behind this is i don't know sql right i'm a creator i create content i create content for web3 creators i can just go ahead paste my contract address and within that i get spit out a bunch of data that tells me more about my audience on chain and note again i have a bunch of data coming in from web 2 based off what what's what platforms they're coming from if they're male or female but again i know nothing about them on chain so creator sites is basically the tool aimed for creators to learn more about their collectors thank you guys amazing next up we have collective dao oh collective action i missed up the last two names so our second last demo for the day please give a big round of applause for collective action [Applause] hey everybody uh we're collective action also known as coach just to introduce the team uh we're having some issues here but uh meanwhile we have justin here who is on the full stack side i am andrew on the front-end side and we have viewlab on the back-end side so for this hackathon we wanted to explore the donation slash ngo space because we thought that there was a lack of transparency around that space and with these certain centralization i think we can make it more interesting for the individuals i think that we can incentivize them to uh you know participate more in the process um to for the solution uh we thought that it would be best to create a platform where um users can pull their resources and then use those resources to create us some sort of an action that can be manifested in the real world and with that said a side thing that i want to talk about briefly is that because in the uh the ngo space because in the ngo space not everyone's in uh in in the crypto space we thought that the the best way to do it is to use web3 auth as authentic with authentication and then uh also use tatum and polygon uh with that said i'll hand over the mic to uln okay i won't go too much into technical implementation of how it's work so just briefly would like to emphasize few core principles that we were using while building this product first of first of all this is uh trustable uh not uh trustless product so all the data is available on chain and publicly verifiable for sure as we're targeting uh kind of social action it wouldn't be fair for us to take some percentage for our revenue out of user contribution so the idea uh to generate revenue is to use locked value of our protocol in some other for example other pool and basically everything that we are getting on top it's our revenue and we use some automation to automate payouts for our contributors and right now justin will do some short demo exactly so let's to visualize this have a look what we published so you can find our website also live with resell we deployed it and yeah we can go ahead and just log in and as oolad already said we can just log in with our google account so no matter mask no wallet address nothing automatically the wallet address will be queried in the background but for us as the user it feels like a fully web 2 product and once we're logged in then the tabs are loaded of all the all the tabs we can access as a octane user the first one is explore where we can see a list of all open bounties so here we see everything from for example someone wants us to host an educational event about web 3 up to yeah some options to deal with the ukrainian crisis but also one a good example is uh someone wants us to clean a beach in mumbai and here we have the title we have a more advanced description and we have requirements about what's actually required in our proof in order to be eligible for the price and then everyone can also participate in this bounty and can put some more money into the prize pool and then at the bottom we can see that here we already have a list of potential submissions where we can see the the user who submitted it the link to the proof and when we click on that they submitted this beautiful picture of a beach which could make us a bit suspicious maybe and then we can if we don't believe that actually this user cleaned the beach we can open a dispute in order to um yeah just say that we are not quite sure if this is correct and if we open this dispute here we can see in the dispute section the list of all the available all the open disputes at the moment where we see the creator of the dispute then again the submitter proof in this case the the beach photo and then was what the disputer listed as a potential proof that the submission is not valid and here we can see that they listed actually a screenshot from google where they can see that this photo was just copied from google and therefore potentially or probably not uh just collected from from the user who cleaned the beach and therefore in this case we could use our token balance which we received from contributing on the platform in order to vote for the distributor which we did here already in one of the previous pitches and after then the dispute duration runs out um yeah if the if the dispute proposal has enough enough votes then the submitter doesn't get any payout and if not they get the payout and of course we also built one to build on that in the future so we want to ask what other tokens not only matic um we also want to support mobile applications just to make the verification for it to our process with photos easier and we also then want to launch on mainnet you can find the project here and that's all thank you thank you collective action all right let's give a big round of applause for our last live demo on stage please welcome activity now [Applause] hey everyone um so to get started have you ever gone to a new city and wanted to join or create a community event such as a pickup soccer game but you didn't know how to get coordinated a time a place or even hold people accountable for going in an efficient manner that's where activity activity dial comes into place hello can you hear me yeah okay i can hear myself okay so we are on the on the main page so we arrive right here on activity activity dao we connect to the activity so when clicking connecting the so i have to wait a little bit okay yeah okay so now there's like some fancy profile picture associated to my account thanks to ipfs in the background but since it doesn't work right now so maybe just just go for the slide show maybe it's okay okay so we'll we'll pass on the slideshow to show you the whole the whole thing going on so we can just arrive here we connect we have got this fancy and svg hd to my account and here we can join we can either create an activity or join an activity an activity is just a dao in which people can join to organize for uh an event in which so they can propose dates and location and you will see that in a moment so we can either complete an activity form to create a new dial so you select the names take the number of participants you can also select some parameters like the number of the minimum number of participants to get the consensus or some staking fee that you need to take in order to commit for a decision so if i want to join the house i click the join there button and we reach the the main page with all the activities registered so i can just click on activity and see the dashboard of the activity so i click on activity arrived to this dashboard and it's on this dashboard we can see like the list of all the location proposed already for this activity and for each location there is like a list of dates associated with location so people can just either vote for one date in one location or several days in one location and or propose a new time and place for the activity to to to get going so when i vote i just select the i just i just click in a little check box and i select the date for a location i submit the vote and when submitting the vote i i'm forced to commit to my vote by sticking a predefined amount of the token of the dell when doing this we can we can do this during the the time allowed for voting during the define when the creation when creating the dao when the time is comes to the end when the the deadline is passed we can click on this button like to get the results of the consensus so this is the okay sorry this is the the proposed the proposing form which you can properly place in some date and time and submit so when we reach the consensus here we got this little little pop-up which which tells us if the cancers is rich or not and if it's rich it tells which location and place the dell agreed down for the activity the the tricky part of this was because there is a commitment in the in detail we need to be able to figure out how to to to know if the people that uh stake were really into the the live event so there is a gap between the blockchain and the and the live the real life so to do that we we implemented this checking picture so for all the when all the participants before the activity has to check in so there is the list of this part of the participant to the to the activity and they are to check whether they see the the participant in in the life in real life event when they check so it's like a presence registering that has to be completed by our users when the presence is registering is done there is like some kind of mapping in which counts all the votes for every user so basically for user to be able to claim his take back um he needs to have at least a certain amount of voting from other people that prove that he was here at the event live when he has reached this certain amount of of voting he can claim his take back and get his phone back so it was very important for us to do this commitment feature because if you organize an activity like for example a pickup game for circle soccer you suck a soccer game if you organize a game with you play on 20 people there's only five people going in it's really annoying so we wanted to implement this commitment feature and all this um little mvp my minimum viable product that we made here could be really extended to some real more ambitious project with some we could we can think about some creating some league dial in which there is some random matchmaking random team making in which each match in the league will be some little sub-dial as we can see here it could be really useful for for example esports or whatever competition we want to we could think of thank you very much [Applause] give all 13 finalists a big round of applause [Applause] all right i know all of you been here for quite some time so we'll try to wrap all of this in the next 15 minutes and the way we're going to do it

is three and a half weeks from now and with that let's get to some closing remarks so the best part of this is the people that these events bring in um and and kind of the interesting observation that um it's just gonna we kind of realized as part of these 13 demos was it's kind of awesome that we're now talking about projects and applications things we're excited about that let more people come in and use applications in this space almost everything here was around creators and consumers and bringing people in and replicating existing social behaviors that are now more weapon native that is a great healthy sign in my opinion on how the space has evolved and that we finally have the the structural infra that we don't have to worry too much about will things break under the hood or are they safe or are they still hard to use that is an amazing way to kind of think about how this ecosystem is growing and i can't wait to see more consumer and user friendly apps for the next few hackathons so with that i want to thank all the people that made this event possible we have obviously our judges there are so many people behind the scenes from the volunteers the speakers and the partners so that's where the applause begins first of all thank you all 700 of you for spending hundreds of hours collectively thousands of hours and building these amazing projects 165 is so big of a number i can't imagine how we ended up with this so many people behind the scenes were managing and making sure that you had 24 7 coverage of this entire venue so thank you to all of our volunteers for really being here and making sure everything ran super smoothly so many amazing speakers were here giving workshops talks spending the time answering questions and talking about all these things this week this list keeps getting bigger and bigger so i think by the next slide you will definitely not be able to read any of this but here are so many awesome speakers that contributed to really making the content that's gonna bring on thousands more if not hundreds of thousands more people in this space of course our amazing judges that spent hours today talking to every single project and learning more about why and how they were excited about everything that they were worked on and the amazing hundreds of partners here that were at the venue all time around anywhere from handing out swag to answering questions to unblocking anybody to recommending things that would save everybody so much time and hours thank you so much to all of our amazing partners without you this will absolutely not be possible and of course the ethereum foundation the devconnect team the agency that helped put all the logistics together from the production side and this venue it's an historic and amazing building and i am kind of annoyed that we've uh spoiled all of you for the next one so we're gonna have to figure out how to set more fires for the next so we can reset expectations so thank you so much and before i'd say the last thing we have to say i want to take a quick second to thank the rest of the youth global team you probably saw all of them running you probably saw all of them busy helping you going out of the way to make sure everything happens so much of this requires coordination that requires months of coordination and without everybody on this team on this slide we would not have this cement and and the sign for a good event is where you don't have too many things to complain about the fact that you didn't notice things going wrong is the the perfect signal for the fact that everybody here put in so much time and effort they made all this possible so please give a big round of applause for kevin cree huichi mini anna moaz luke emily andrew jacob and liam who's up with a small team and we can't wait to meet all of you again for 12 more events this year and with that we have let's go back to the final list so 13 people came on and they presented what they built and if you've been to any global event before you may already know the punch line but we try to make these events a way for people to learn and see what's possible and we don't want this to be a competition we don't want it to feel like competitive and this is really an opportunity for people to really get comfortable and see if this is worth spending the next anywhere from years to their life in as an ecosystem so the finalists who came on are effectively all first place winners so we have 13 teams that came first as part of this hackathon and as part of the prize the 8th global team will be giving 1500 to each member that came on on all these 13 teams so congratulations to all of you and we can't wait to see you ship all these projects to mainnet soon this is very much the end of
