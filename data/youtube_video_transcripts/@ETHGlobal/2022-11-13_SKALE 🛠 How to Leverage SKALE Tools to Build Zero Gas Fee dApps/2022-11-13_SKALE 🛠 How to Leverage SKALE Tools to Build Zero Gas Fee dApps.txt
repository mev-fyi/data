foreign [Applause] [Music] welcome everybody uh this is the scale Workshop and uh today I'll be speaking uh John Frost I'm the solutions engineer I run the validators uh help with the DAP integration and partner Integrations part of this presentation is also going to be with Sawyer who's over there to the left he's part of the scale team he's a software engineer and in the room we've also got some scale team members so maybe you guys can put your hands up and I'm gonna quickly go around so I've got Jack we've got Jace Nicole Fabio I'm sorry if someone's behind that lad because I can't see you there's Connor and yeah so that if you guys have any questions uh by all means come out come to speak to any of the team members or go to the booth as well um straight after this we actually have a lightning talk from well actually no 30 minutes after this we've got a lightning talk from Jack so I don't want to steal his Thunder on scale and its overview but essentially scale is the proof of stake decentralized infrastructure platform that is evm compatible there's a lot of key features um like zero gas fees it's very modular it's very flexible um and so forth but the agenda we're deciding upon what we're going to discuss today and I just wanted to Showcase a couple of things the title is how to leverage scale tools to build zero gas fee dapps what I wanted to do is just showcase how easy it is to Mint and Deploy nfts on the scale chain so just do a deploy and mint after that I'll showcase how you can actually put it up to the file storage we've got a GUI for that and just uploading the ones that I've minted and I've got some traits metaports that is essentially going from scale change to scale chain which is very new just released and the second part is soil where he'll talk about the Airfield station the skull chain UI dashboard which is also very new and we'll follow that up with q a so let's get to the good stuff as well uh we've got plenty of prizes here and if you're gonna impress anyone you've got Jace and Connor who are the judges Jace loves coffee Connor espresso martini uh prizes we've got five thousand so that is for one dap um then we've got 8 000 for metaverse gaming nft prizes 2000 for partner so that can be the graph connects any of our partners in our ecosystem and then we've got five thousand uh for the prize pool which will be evenly divided among the teams but I just wanted to highlight some important links as you guys kind of like go through um hacking and it's uh specifically on obviously scale we've got the hackathonscale.network that includes like the documentation some endpoints as fuel and fire storage uh scale space um that is essentially like developer docs that's just kind of our general website uh the blog and you've also got Discord where you can just reach out to us you've got GitHub so that's the scale Network so that's just the public groupers with a lot of readmies and then you've also got our stats page which is a lot of statistics and metrics um that keep going up which is awesome so let's kind of Kick this off so this is the demo that I wanted to Showcase today I'm going to close this presentation down and just showcase two things here so on the left we've got block Scout which is a block Explorer and on the right hand side we've got the repo that I actually created for this event and you guys can use it if you want to um the intended uses I've kind of written here is for this event um I'm sure we can use you can use it for other events but the project set up there's some requirements here you can clone the scale demo just npm packages setting the environment variables there creating a private key s fuel compiled deploy and then you're essentially just going to do the minting so it's a five-step process easy to get up and running for you so instead of making you guys watch me download all these packages and whatnot I've already kind of gone ahead and updated my EnV you can see here that I've already done the deployment of the address right here and just below it what I'm going to do is essentially just mince some tokens so what we'll do is I'll just run this and you can see and on the I'll bring up the Explorer on the left side and essentially you can see look at these transactions are coming through right here and what I've done is used MTM multi-transaction mode and essentially minted these um and you can see them in the block Explorer so that's the creation so I'm just going to refresh this and then essentially what it's doing here is you can actually see it's a refresh it again and then you can see there'll be essentially there's 31 here and let me open this up a little bit more it'll be on the blocks and then you essentially see the 100 that's there so you can see I just minted 100 tokens that's how easy it is and how fast it is to essentially deploy and mint some tokens on the actual minting I actually created some special traits you can add whatever you guys want to those um you know essentially use your own and one awesome thing that not many people know about scale and I've got it on the shirt here too is our file storage so you can upload any asset you want to the actual scale chain yourself this is um you know a simple kind of overview of file storage um and how it's you know decentralized um and you know it tells you about the space that you've got and it walks you through the the npm install but just on the right hand side you can see like how you can upload files delete files create directories and so forth so I did go ahead before and this is the GUI that we just uh released as well so you can go here you can essentially upload um files here and what I did is one of the nfts I minted is you just selected here and you can actually see this one there and then this is just essentially the traits and whatnot so I brought that up before and you can actually see hey that's the color that's the stamina and so forth so that was the second part of um where you know the second part of the uh talk and I'm going into the third part which is the scale chain to scale chain and this is the metaport again this is something fresh and new that we've just released this is our staging uh chain staging environment as you can see staging V3 right here we've got the dog chain which is essentially the origin chain and then the cat chain which is the receiver essentially cloned there and you can like click on these you've got the Explorer you've got all the RPC All That Jazz you can see mtms enabled up here and I'll go back here it's going to be exactly the same for the cat the receiver and you guys can go here um so metaport.demo scale nodes and you guys can play around with this um we've got a lot of cool stuff on the left hand side here sandbox so that essentially just opens up the widget for you to play around with all this is is just an interface whereby you know your application and you can implement the the widget which I'll show you in a second onto your application but you've got different colors different you know whatever color you prefer there this one I'm keeping on the nft theme you can see ERC 721 1155 there um but I didn't actually highlight these so this is Skull chain to scale chain I'll click on these um so you can just play around with these you can go to the sandbox at the top you can do the wrapped um eth there but yeah going back here for example I am going to move from dog chain to catch chain and you know you can do it back as well but you can see there's the collection I've got seven um of uh out of 100 there if I do you know for example two I want to move it oh that you what you can see on the right hand side is the widget so this automatically fills um the chains in here and then also the metals you can see this is token id1 token ID 2 token ID3 um and the amount see I just put in two it automatically does two and then I just do the transfer and I sign for this confirm [Music] and then what we can do is I'll refresh this and what you can see it there right there so you can see two that was the token ID one so you can see that's transferred to scale chain and the awesome thing is here you can see the post incoming uh messages here and you can see the two and then one and if you wanna you could just send it back um and essentially do the same process there but if you guys just want to play around with it use the sandbox and so forth lastly um I just wanted to highlight the repo for the metaport that you guys can use and um this is the hackathon scale.network that you guys can use here Jace did a great job of just updating this recently um it just talks about deploying on scale using file storage and you just put in your endpoint there and your wallet and you can get S Fuel and reserve some space um and Sawyer I don't want to steal your thunder this is essentially moving over to you with the S fuel station and I wanted to lastly just show you some awesome stats that we've got that's just refreshing here you can see the anyone can go to this it's not as if it's internal you can see the total transaction count the total gas fees and you know that's going back to their initial point where you know scal is gas gas free so um yeah to just recap you know what we did was we essentially deployed we minted some nfts we moved those nfts to file storage you could see it in the GUI and then you know we you saw the metaport where I was just moving the nfts between two different chains so I'll end it there on my half and then Sawyer will take it away with the rest of the community tools foreign and we'll have q a at the end and I'm going to invite Conor up to help with that as well all right everybody uh I'm Sawyer uh as John mentioned I am part of uh the solutions engineering team uh with scale and I'm going to follow up on uh the amazing uh kind of technical uh pieces available to the scale Network and talk a little bit more about the tooling that's available and how you can use to make amazing zero gas feed apps on scale so to start off user experience is key right so blockchain everybody knows whether you're a user or developer it's really complicated still a lot of people are doing amazing things to simplify that but ultimately sorry guys I just put the head on accident simple onboarding is a common trait in web 2. not so much for web3 anybody ever asked their their parent or their grandmother to use metamask it's not so simple additionally web 2 whether it's you know the twitters or you know different you know gmails and stuff like that generally they're free to use right or at least they have a freemium option and lastly they use just common things to onboard whether it's email or text right you get your codes through things that everybody has or at least most people in the world have them web3 on the other hand most blockchains require constant payment just for usage right gas fees and and all sorts of things there just you're constantly getting chipped away out additionally well we have this bleeding ice technology crypto wallets are not really friendly to the average user and so what I'm going to talk about kind of throughout the rest of this is one of the the key components of scale which is uh not just the Tooling in general but more specifically s fuel so s fuel is as many of the scale people know one of the things I love because I've worked on it quite a bit and you can actually see that top left picture is the S fuel station that John alluded to earlier and it's kind of a precursor to S fuel so s fuel is uh not gas it's actually stands for scale fuel and it effectively represents the ability for any user to transact on any scale chain entirely for free they don't have to pay money and that's a really really big statement following that up with skills infinite scalability you effectively have the ability for any user anywhere in the world to use a scale chain entirely for free at any time as long as the service is there in the running scale that being said getting started with scale right is kind of similar to many other blockchains except we have some way cooler Tools in my opinion because I built a lot of them the file storage UI I did not build but the S fuel station and the scale chain UI I did build the original versions and I'm very proud of them and I'm going to talk a little bit about them here in Greater detail so the ice fuel station and I have a little video here we're gonna hopefully make this work maybe there we go okay it's running so you can see metamask or rainbow kit is popping up and I'm automatically connected just like that my wallet's connected I click fuel wallet which is that little black box my address is in the field and we should see a spinning wheel in a second there might be a little delay there we go and now I'm changing the theme because I love dark mode because I'm a developer but if there's light mode or if you like light mode it's there for you and at about there we go we can actually see I know it's a little bit small apologize but um what those that little green text on the bottom was was the list of chains that you actually just got filled up on with us fuel uh it was crypto blades uh scale Community chain uh the clips on Ft Hub Europa liquidity Hub and the Razer Network and so what this basically means is as a user right instead of having to go to coinbase or go through a Fiat on-ramp or binance whatever it may be purchase ethereum or some other token transfer it out to a wall and then get started with D5 or nft marketplaces you can just go to the S fuel station connect your wallet fill up and go start using one of these dapps that does not require you to effectively be blocked by a paywall because scale basically removes that that blocker right it's a community tool which is really amazing it takes about three clicks fully open source and overall it's just kind of that first step in a really smooth onboarding experience to the scale Network that's kind of the user experience side now on the other side here sorry there we go is the scale chain UI right so clean user experience really important for a blockchain but on the flip side I'm a developer building on most blockchains is really really difficult most of the tools are either lacking in documentation they're Half Baked they don't work whatever it may be I won't lie the scale chain UI is a little bit Half Baked I'm the one that built it it's currently undergoing an entire face lift which I'll show you some mock-ups in a second but um I'm going to use a couple analogies here to kind of explain why this tool is so important to a scale ecosystem uh scale chains you can have a lot of them you can technically have an infinite amount of them and they can all connect together and the cool part is they're actually effectively dap chains right so technically every company in the world could have their own scale chain if everybody want to use scale which would be awesome that being said not everybody is technically minded in blockchain or in scale technology right this second to be able to get going right away the scale chain UI takes all this complexity and basically abstracts away for the scale chain owner or for the user that's in charge of setting up the chain for the company or for the DAP of the project it does this by basically taking all the amazing smart contracts built by the core engineering team at scale and putting a nice GUI on top of them I've basically alluded it to web 3 Ops so for any of the engineers here devops I'm I hate devops not a fan uh it's basically the the devops for web3 uh it's kind of taking all that functionality of administering something and putting it right in your hands that being said the pictures are small on purpose it's really ugly I'm not a front-end developer but where it's going is somewhere more along the lines of this which still a little bit small but one of the product designers at scale was uh amazing helped kind of redesign this we took feedback from the whole slew of community members and over the course of the next couple months we're actually going to be basically rebuilding the entire thing from the ground up we're going to get more community members involved and what we're going to effectively do is build the best administrative kind of tool available so that anybody regardless of technical ability can come to the scale Network use this tool with their new CL chain that they just got spun up and Deploy on scale and a couple more pictures uh you guys can see multi-sig wallet uh multisig is really good for security right uh there will be a hole currently there is an abstraction for it but like I said not that pretty that's much nicer and then scale chain manager things like multi-transaction mode that uh John showed off earlier you can actually toggle that on and off doing it requires touching a smart contract in this case connect mad mask click a button so things like that can just be you know distracted away much simpler and uh lastly just want to say thank you everybody it's a pleasure to speak and uh like I said these are you know Community tools that I'm showing off uh if you're a developer here this weekend and you're not really sure what to build instead of building a Dap try building a tool for the scale Network because there's plenty of stuff left to build thank you [Applause]
