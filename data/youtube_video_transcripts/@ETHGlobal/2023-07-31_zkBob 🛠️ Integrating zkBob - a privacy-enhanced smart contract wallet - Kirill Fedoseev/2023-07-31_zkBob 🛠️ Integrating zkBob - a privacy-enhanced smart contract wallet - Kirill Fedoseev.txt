foreign [Music] Workshop uh yeah I'm kiddiel fedesif one of the core developers at the sea keeper protocol and let's talk about how you can use the keyboard and how you can integrate it into your privacy applications using our privacy enhanced smart contract wallet which is what ckbok really is protocol we really believe in this fundamental concept of personal financial privacy we believe that it's crucial to have a choice to have this privacy and for people for users to have this option to decide which transactions they want to keep public and which they would prefer to really keep hidden private from the outside Observers but we also believe that given though the currently all the available blockchain infrastructures mainly support only public transactions and all the information is publicly available on a blockchain explorers and everybody is able to select the balance is the addresses the transaction amounts the history that is really inconvenient for most of the people who are getting onboarded from the traditional Finance world where something as important as Financial privacy is something that really exists and yeah we believe that this is one of the reasons that prevents the crypto World from getting widespread adoption which is the lack of privacy so at ziki Bob we are trying to address this lack of privacy by building our own privacy protocols which allows to overcome these challenges so yeah let's dive into it the ziki bar application is built on top of CK snarks and it really allows you to make this privacy preserving transactions which are fast and easy payments within the all supported tokens which you can perform by generating locally the CK pros and uh yeah within the Ziggy Bop you can make the private deposits you can transfer tokens freely within the pool which are completely private and hidden from outside outside world and then you can also withdraw it back to the public blockchain to your public wallet and continue using it in the defy from the already privacy enhanced tokens the way it works is that once you send a transaction on ziki pop to perform some deposit transfer or withdrawal only you and as a sender and the receiver of those operation which can be yourself or a friend of yours only they are able to access decrypt and actually get something useful from this data and to understand what really happened within this transaction so right now the city Bob is available on polygon and optimism layer tools with Mod chains come in with the within the nearest Future and it supports Bob and usdc stable coins which are mainly used for salary payments and each token on the optimism for anything that requires privacy for ethereum Native currency which might be the private contract deployments which is which happens to be useful in some specific cases so yeah and we plan to add more chains and more tokens within the upcoming future whenever we're finding the demand for for the ziggable privacy so that's the sneak peek from our UI we'll have a live demo of how it works later in the workshop but really yeah our UI is quite simple and by using it you can deposit transfer in withdraw freely by just as you would normally do within the metamask or any similar wallet just for other web browser the app without any need to download anything all the ziggyball proofs CK stock proofs are generated locally so that's it really that simple and convenient UI to use for your everyday needs to achieve this a little bit of iOS of course the opportunities you can use the easy keyboard for are nearly Limitless but we trying to come up with a certain way of use cases or which people are already using ziki Bob and what are we endorsing them to start using this keyboard for and this use case is typically involve anything related to the peer-to-peer transactions for example when you want to split the dinner bill with your friends after running around after the if Global hackathon you can use it for receiving and playing salaries and wages to your employees or from the employer side and employee it can be used for anything related with the grants donation fundraising crowdfinding or really any other use cases you just want to make your payments in stable coins either any other tokens private so yeah let's take the the most common example for now the the way how the salaries can be transferred with Tiki Bob so let's say we have our employer Carl who really wants to Pace his employees on the public blockchain because he doesn't trust any centralized exchanges and he wants to keep all his budget accounting and the salaries on the blockchain but his employees really ask him to do this privately and that they would be sure to receive the salary also on the blockchain but in some private way and so Carl found out about ziki Bob and now she wants to start using it for salary example so the way it works is that Carl just chooses the stable point he wants to use and can be Bob and can be used to see there like the then he deposes this stable coin inside the cable pool let's say once a month and when on the salary day he's able to distribute all the salaries within one multi-transfer transactions to his employee addresses he obtained from the from the invoices and yeah so he just needs to send once a month a single multi-transfer within the city Bob through our UI and then employees are able to freely withdraw in any amounts their salary on their public wallets once they once they want to do that something one of the features that zikiboki thinks is really important for Toyota widespread blockchain and privacy adoption is the good support for mobile devices when you can send and receive transactions on the fly when you don't have access to your desktop or laptop so we spend quite the time to actually optimize the keyboard application for mobile devices we made sure that the city block is usable on the mobile that the proof generation Works fast enough and now it takes only 10 to 15 seconds to actually generate a completely private CD proof in your browser on a mobile modern smartphone one of the also one of the cool features we have a tiki Bop is the integration with li-fi which allows you to actually perform any cross chain interactions from the chain and to the chains which are not natively supported by the sticky bulb application so you can really deposit and withdraw freely not only from optimism polygon but you can simply connect to any other asset or chain within the same UI just by opening up the li-fi widget which is really cool and we are really happy to see how it all works and then the last point I wanted to discuss throughout this Workshop is the our Accent on compliance side of things so as regulatory requirements as we've seen in the past couple of months they became stricter to towards any privacy enhanced obligation or protocol we believe that something that should be taken into account and as our mission we see this goal of finding the right balance and the compromise between the level of privacy you get as a user of the sigible protocol and the way of compliance the government or different authorities can expect from such kind of protocols so everyone kind of get what they want without hurting each other's painful points and so and think about we are trying to build this compliance friendly tool which still supports the Privacy within these transactions but then meets certain regulatory requirements and uh yeah so the way it works is that we employ several techniques within the ziki Bob to support this compliance say the things so the first one is the address screen so anytime you make a depository Bob we make sure that your address and your wallet passes the necessary email requirements so this way we can make sure that CK bulb is safe from the different malicious parties and users that can try to access and use the applications and right now we are using the trm labs provider for such email screen for automated checks but we're always looking forward towards any other Integrations and new protocols which does similar kind of things then the way it works is that our checks are not only employed on the UI side of things but they are deeply integrated within the sequencers code so that malicious party are not able to access the protocol by bypassing the UI somehow they instead integrated with the sequencers and sequencer is the only party which is able to directly access the cable pull contract then the next important feature we had at ziki Bob is the this notion of optional kyc so basically kyc is not a requirement for the for the ziki Bob user and you are able to freely use the keyboard application to the certain limits without any need in kyc but then if you're a big business who wants to pay the salary so you're a big user was transfer big amounts in order to raise those limits there is this concept of optional KBC which is something that you can pass you can meet some mean some soul bound nft on their wallet and then the protocol will automatically use this nft as your access key towards this enhanced and increased limits and right now we're using this integration with the open no your cut protocol and underneath that it uses the binance pub sold bound nft token and further down the line we are considering multiple approaches towards the further improvements on the compliance size of the Suzuki bulb we are looking forward how we can employ the and implement the selective genonymization of user transactions if they are willing to do so how users can generate the cryptographically verifiable account statements with their transactions how they can export and give someone read-only account access keys and yes how we can support multiple ways not only the binance Bob tokens but yeah more on chain kycs so yeah let's have a few words about the hackerton penalty we have so yeah one of the bounty is related with this direct deposit feature basically it's a way how you can integrate the deposits towards stickable protocol into any third-party protocol smart contracts open source wallet and its purpose is to minimize the required effort and the entrance barrier quadrant requirement needed for accessing these stickable deposits the cool thing about director process is that in order to make one you don't actually need to generate or communicate within our SDK to generate any start proof you just need to submit a simple smart contract fall which is something that you can do from any smart contract integration any third-party protocol and you don't need any SDK for that so yeah the way it works is that we have like a dedicated to separate smart contract which Aggregates all those direct deposits and then the which may come from all of those protocols on the left it can be anything related to taxes breaches aggregators wallets and you can relate it to the payroll and then after all this direct deposits are aggregated on the special contract the sequencer will uninstall and generate the batch CK snack proof and actually include those deposits in the AC cable pool contract where the receiver of those deposits and users will be able to access them a few minutes later so as I said the first bound is related with the implementation and the integration of those cable direct deposits so we have a basically any best use of this particular feature will get the price so we have three places three two and one k for each and then the second way of bounty if you are not feeling well about integrating the executable deposits into your own application because you have a bit different project that doesn't involve any stable coin transfers let's say then we have this open track price pool for basically any one any team that is able to just go through the onboarding flow in the city Bob application generate the receiving address open an account then we'll ask you a couple of feedback questions during the touching session and it really takes five minutes to be a part of this price pool so what we're gonna do is just we'll take this 4K and distribute across all teams which completed their onboarding flow and yeah basically created a zikibob account and yeah just once again a few ideas how you can integrate direct deposits into your packs is to integrate with with any open source wallet let's say mathematic snaps it can be integrated with different taxes breaches aggregators or any other smart contracts and yeah any awesome ideas of course are welcome here as well so yeah let's have a small demo of the the cable UI to see how it all works and what we can really do with it so yeah we're gonna log in into our TF we're going to select the yeah we recently deployed the ethereum pool for each token on optimism so let's use it for for the purpose of this demo but really all the pulls are very similar and you can use any of them in your Heights and in your workflows so we're gonna connect our CK account by using our web3 wallet so the UI is going to ask me to assign the message and then used my signature to generate the the private key from my account I'm going to skip the password for now yeah the my CK found is now synchronized and in the right hand right upper corner I can see that I have public balance of some eth and interrupt ethereum and then I have also private balance which is completely hidden and is part of the sticky Bob pull smart contract so now that I'm connected with my CK account I can make the deposits of both if and frap teeth I can transfer it to to different people within the pool for also created a CK account so yeah it just make a transfer to myself so in order to make a transfer I need to ask the receiver side receiver person to generate a receiving address so each time I click this button on the account tab it generates and outputs me a random address and so the number of total addresses is Limitless so you can just generate a new one each time somebody asks you to send it so this way it helps you to preserve some some way some level of privacy as well so yeah and just let's transfer some eth so yeah what right now is happening is my web browser is using our SDK to generate a start proof so on the laptop you should take about five to six seconds on a mobile it takes about 10 to 15 so yeah right now proof is generated this submitted to the sequencer and now sequencer has sent his transaction and yeah it's already included and if you go to the history tab then we'll see all the actions I have I have done a few hours ago and uh yeah 20 seconds ago I've completed this transfer and of course all the history I see here is only I and myself is able to actually decrypt this history and access those details to see what amounts to what addresses have been sent and so the rest of the information to the rest of the blockchain is hidden and stays private and so yeah I can access my history and see what have I done within my account so yeah let's now see how we can make the track deposit and how they can be integrated to your application so the simple way to test direct deposits is to throw the block Explorer UI so basically that's all we need so I'm gonna go to this awesome block Scout user interface to to see how we can send a direct deposit from there so basically in order to send the direct deposit I'm also will be required to get this receiving address which is a different form different one from the one we used before so I'm going to copy that I'm gonna select the direct deposit function I'm gonna pass my CK address here I'm gonna yeah let's say I want to deposit 100 of each and yeah as a fallback user I'm gonna specify myself as well so yeah basically these three arguments is all you need to send direct deposits on chain and as you can imagine this function call can be easily incorporated into any smart contract application any protocol and it's really that simple so yeah I'm gonna send the transaction you know let's see it's an anti-tails yeah and we see that 0.01 is will transfer to the Tractor plus it's more contract now it will take uh some seconds for it to be displayed in the history so yeah let's wait and test how much time does it take for the graph service to to synchronize this deposit so yeah it's already here yeah we are seeing I'm able to see that 30 seconds ago I made this deposit so we deposited 0.01 each but the some fee was subtracted on the Square conduit level and yeah now I'm seeing that my deposit is pending and it will be credited to my account in like 10 minutes so yeah that's how the direct deposits work and we have a more extensive documentation on all of that in in our documentation page within our docs on The ziki Bob portal so yeah feel free to try to yourself the secret application create an account apply for our bounties check out the documentation we are in direct deposits the SDK and the rest of the application on our stickable website if you have any questions please stop by our booth we have also we also have some cool merge you can ask questions have a chat with us and if we are not on site you can freely ask questions in the Discord Channel of the if Global so yeah and yeah I think we have a couple of minutes for on-site questions so I will be happy to answer so with direct deposit if I understand what you're saying is you can anonymize a transaction so maybe if we make an app here in a decentralized tab and we want users to run our functions from our smart contract without knowing who they are could we easily black this scene to make it work or not really yeah I think you can so basically the track deposit is a very very simplified version of the deposit plus transfer combination so if you want to do kind of similar thing in the UI the way it works is that you first need to deposit in order for that you need to calculate the slight proof and then you can make a transfer but trick deposit just allows smart contracts to bypass this complicated flow with the start proof generation and just call it a function on the smart contract level passing a few arguments and yeah it will do this deposit and transfer to the receiver side so of course this uh the sender address is public because the deposit is coming from the public network the amount can also be seen but then the receiver is actually Anonymous party so nobody can really know to form this receiver address belongs so what if I want the opposite since I have my smart contract with a function someone needs to call it um I just don't want anyone publicly to know who is calling my smart contract yeah for that uh so in the ziki buff we are using our own sequencer and some sort of account abstraction but uh so yeah for your own deals and smart contracts there are a few services that does the same and the similar thing so there are a few Frameworks for account obstruction or like Network transactions so yeah you can connect to any of those I think they also have bounty on the second console yet might be done yeah okay thanks a lot thank you foreign
