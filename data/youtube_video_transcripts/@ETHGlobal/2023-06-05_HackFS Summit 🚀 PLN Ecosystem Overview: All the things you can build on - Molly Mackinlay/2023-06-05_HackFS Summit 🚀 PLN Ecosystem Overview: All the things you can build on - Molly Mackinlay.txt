foreign [Music] I'm super excited to welcome our first speaker for today which is Molly welcome and I'll let you uh get started with telling us about all things happening in the pln ecosystem awesome thank you so much Karthik I'm super excited for this um and always super super fun to um get to hang out with all of these amazing humans um hacking and so um let's just jump right into it I have a lot of things to to share with you today um and uh many ideas for things that you can build so hopefully get a little bit of inspiration if you ever want to follow up on any of these or want to pitch me your idea and get feedback um feel free to message me on Twitter I'm omak28 and happy to keep chatting there um so here's here's quick agenda I want to welcome you all back to hackathast we might have a couple returning hackers in the room um but we've had hackaths the last four years which is gonna be great um give you an overview of protocol Labs PL Network what connect unites us as a community all of the amazing folks that we're seeing participate here many of them are part of the pl Network and helping contribute various different protocols and features to this wider Community there's some recent awesome new opportunities that are in the works that would love to seed some of your ideas with um and then give you an overview of all of the different things you can build on kartik has already talked to you about the many many many different bounties here um but some ideas on how you could actually harness and build on top of some of these Technologies and then finally if you want to learn more I'll highlight uh some of the onboarding programming we've created in the pl Network that might be useful so of course welcome back to the fourth hack up S we've been running this since 2020. um yes pandemic year and seen hundreds of teams come forward and a number of them actually turn into startups that have formed out of hack fs and are now coming back to sponsor full circle so it's just really amazing to see the growth that has happened in this ecosystem the amazing Founders that have been created out of hacks that started here um and very excited to see what you guys come up with this year so that hopefully our next huddle next Lighthouse next secured Finance comes out of this group today which will be really fun um the protocol Labs Network really is Unified by this mission of driving breakthroughs in Computing technology to push Humanity forward um Juan gives a number of great talks about this um but really it's building upon the fact that we recognize the internet is a huge superpower for Humanity um so many of our tools communication friendships um you know work has been massively Changed by the Advent of the internet and it's critical for our functioning today as a species and we see these huge phase transitions uh coming in the next couple of decades and we want them to be building upon an internet Foundation that is robust that is secure that doesn't have Central intermediaries that control our connections between each other and that is enables efficient kind of like individual peer-to-peer interactions ownership of data and that is a good robust foundation for all the work that we're doing um and we think think that we need to be making improvements here there's some really big breakthroughs that are coming in the next couple of years machine learning AGI brain computer interfaces and we want those to build on top of like a much stronger more robust foundation and so Juan's given some some great talks about how this really critical Century we need to be getting things right we need to be upgrading some of our core internet protocols with web3 to make sure that we can trust the data and the connections and the transactions that are happening in our networks and that we can secure digital human rights that we can all build on top of and so that's kind of why protocol Labs was created as this Innovation networks that has many different companies many different protocols um and and kind of this amazing swarm of improvements that can then empower the next set of computing breakthroughs to come with a better foundation for their information for their peer-to-peer connections um and for their kind of like you know trusted uh relationships with each other um and so protocol Labs spans the r d pipeline there's a number of research Labs across the protocol Labs Network many groups deep in the development phases of building um new products and new protocols a number of those are productionizing and scaling to New Markets uh and and even scaling significantly in production and things that differentiate this community are a highly collaborative Network oriented approach to many different protocols building on top of each other layering as a stack to help uh you know make it easier for others to grab modular components that they can then build on top of and just a very collaborative and supportive ecosystem so we're excited to have you as a part of it and feel free to ask for help because everyone here very much wants to see you succeed and to jump into this ecosystem and start building something amazing um there are a ton of different groups across the pl Network many folks who are building on top of ips FS the PDP and filecoin but also many many other programs and and projects that kartik was mentioning um folks from Mona and D Rand and Buckley and many other amazing components and most of these projects are actually having bounties today at hackaths and so if you want to go check out the pln portal which talks about many of these different projects there's also links from the directory for how you can actually go and have office hours with some of these amazing collaborators so that you can you know get a deep dive on the work that they're doing or get feedback on one of your hacks and so recommend that's a super useful tool that you can grab a screenshot to all right diving into some of the breakthroughs um here's a quick list that we keep in our PL Andres group on some of the amazing iqbs and Falcon breakthroughs that that we've been helping uh with and collaborating with folks on um fvm is definitely a big one in that list but there's a number of other uh really exciting ones bakliyao is super exciting I would love to talk more about that one today um Saturn and Lassie which is a component um that's being used by Saturn as well is really important for uh retrieving data very quickly from the falcoin network and also from you know it's a CDN for any data that's sort of cross ipfs file Corner elsewhere and there's some really amazing new components for ipfs boxo is a library for building new ipfs implementations Helia is a new JavaScript uh implementation of ipfs and so there's lots of exciting components to build on there um I'm going to give you a quick overview of maybe a couple areas that I think would be really exciting and then we'll go through kind of a whole list of exciting things to build on so a couple of very exciting areas in fvm you might have heard fvm's been around for just over two months now so it's still early in its early days but we've already seen over a thousand unique contracts be deployed on fem there's hundreds of people who are building smart contract applications and some of my favorites that I think are filling really really important needs within the web 3 ecosystem first is Perpetual or automatic storage Lighthouse is offering a number of bounties here they have great sdks for building and a few dot storage and web through.storage are also doing really useful work here but making sure things that users want are being able to store their data and have another service or application handle the monitoring the repair the replication of that data on their behalf and this is now possible with fvm you can build all sorts of exciting services that can enable those use cases on top of the substrate of filecoin which you know is already doing kind of the automatic uh checking of hey is your storage deal being persisted over time you can make it much more user-friendly and really help increase the accessibility of Falcon services on other chains to different types of use cases um you know things like nft forever is absolutely you know endowed storage use cases makes a ton of sense um there's some really awesome work happening around retrieval cdns on top of fem um the Saturn team is now uh the the rewards for retrieval providers within Saturn is now being paid out by fem smart contracts there's a number of groups who are doing things like retrieval Insurance um or or contracts that ensure good retrievability of data super exciting area super critical for all sorts of users who want hot fast storage in bellcoin um there's some really exciting stuff happening with compute and generative AI I literally was just playing around with water lily this moment or this morning because uh we just crossed an exabyte of data stored in Falcon and I was looking for what's my snazzy nft um that I'm going to uh mint to celebrate and commemorate that moment and that's a great example that you can also emulate um if you're going to create a compute over Data Network for your own use case um utilizing Buckley utilizing fvm um and uh you know really optimizing those compute networks for you know your heart's desire right there's a lot of really great building blocks that you can use to get started really quickly there and Sample contracts um like water lily that you could emulate to get started quickly and then finally there's some really amazing work that's happening around data Dows nfts anyone who's getting together to store data and persist data over time utilizing maybe some of the Perpetual storage contracts or retrieval Assurance contracts um to make sure that um you know say the Gutenberg library or other really critical DSi data sets are being kind of added to and governed over time and utilizing nfts within those communities um so I think I've hit on a couple of these but there's a you know active need within the fvm ecosystem for some awesome new services and tools building on top of those fdm building blocks um to and utilizing the fact that you know Falcon has an exabyte of data stored um and want to be persisting that data over time adding new data for those communities and so um thinking about the life cycle of of clients and storage providers and data and falcoin there's a lot of really valuable services and tools that can be created and launched here from monitoring a collection of data over time and creating kind of like alerts for different sorts of events to repairing data if a storage provider ever stops storing data automatically based on a set of client policies or requirements aggregating data across many different uh clients who all want to store you know tiny little nfts but bundling that all up into um kind of like a larger on-chain message which is something that Lighthouse and nft.storage have examples of how they're doing that right now um and some of the stuff around retrieval oracles or retrieval Assurance contracts are all really really useful and valuable tools that there's lots of demand for in the fvm ecosystem right now and from clients you know we have uh you know thousands of clients who are storing data in filecoin as well and want better tooling to ease that onboarding um data availability so with some new really exciting things like Lassie and Saturn um and the interplanetary networks indexer Network indexer ipni um uh there's there's now additional tools for making sure that your data is available and retrievable um and we've actually already been seeing smart contracts and um and chain data starting to be stored inside of filecoin itself so um you know it's now possible for you to use filecoin to build a data availability layer for other web 3 blockchains or Layer Two Chains um that don't want to be responsible for their own data availability so a you know great example of where you could offer this is Solana is actually already backing up their entire entire chain State onto filecoin as an ipld basically graph and so you could start with that to build a data availability layer for anyone who wants to interact with Solana or you could use the opportunity to build a web 3 chain transaction storage service that you know as blocks and transactions are created in another chain stores those in filecoin using whatever storage service of your choice web3 storage um alkaline data tools uh Lighthouse Etc um or one of your own creation um so that you have a really easy to use web3 change storage tool which would be super valuable for the entire web3 space and even better you can layer on these new tooling around fast retrieval to make sure that you store with storage providers who are offering fast retrievals we have I think over 10 storage providers that have an over a hundred percent uh retrieval success rate which is pretty good uh well not over 100 at 100 and a number of groups that are bringing additional um uh you know transports to storage as well and so that's something that you can do on behalf of those networks to make sure that they can also retrieve the chain data very quickly um so that they can then rely on it and use it as kind of like uh the default way of accessing chain State and data and you can augment this with all sorts of you know shiny data features like Erasure coding to make sure that you can get you know a small number of copies in order to to get the entire desired data set retrieval bounties to make sure that you can really rely on the retrievals ETC and this is a really really hot and important area right now for the entire web3 community and Falcon has all the things you need to be the the team going and plugging that Gap um we'd mentioned compute it's a really exciting time to be building compute in the Falcon ecosystem you have buckleya which is giving you all of these um you know critical reusable modules for building compute networks think of it as the ipfs for compute networks open source you can use it in whatever way you want um and you know you can use the lily pad Bridge or clone it in order to send jobs from fbm into your own bakalao powered compute over Data Network and then you can optimize it for your own domain there's definitely this uh critical Insight from Juan that um in compute over data we're going to see many many different networks optimizing for privacy or performance or verifiability and so identifying your own use case in your own community that you're going to optimize your compute Network for whether that's DSi generative AI ZK proves fully homomorphic encryption will allow you to really optimize your compute Network and get it up and running quickly you can also harness won't do it on you can also harness the early stages of interplanetary consensus to you know have your network very quickly get up and running building on top of filecoin so you can either utilize fem itself or you can start building directly on IPC to have your own layer 2 Network on top of Falcon getting started quickly all right so highlighting all the things that you can build on um and then I will give you some fast learning tips and um see you all on Twitter um so as we mentioned Falcon Virtual Machine is launched it's all evm compatible um there's a huge huge opportunity to be building within this new data economy um there's already an excavative data stored on Falcon a lot of that is open Public Access Data from um you know video recordings um to the open music library internet archive many open public data sets from various different you know government parties newer public data things along those lines and so it's a great opportunity to build the tools that these communities are going to need to interact with and continue onboarding their data more usefully out and lilypad are perfect things to build on if you're excited about compute and the whole massive AI wave that is taking off where you can actually run compute Networks triggered by smart contracts in fbm and harnessing bakuyao to run all of those compute nodes if you are an expert in thinking about how to incentivize computation and maybe do a useful proof of work around compute please come talk to me we definitely have ideas and would love to share um I mentioned interplanetary consensus this is the kind of L2 sharding system that Falcon has been developing um it allows you to create a hierarchical chain of compute uh or sorry of Layer Two networks or subnets as we've been calling them and we actually already have a one second uh test net subnet of IPC that is running right now that you can build um you know your own subnet and get up and started um or you can start utilizing spacenet which is the the net they have up and running and the concept of these is that not only can you um kind of like create subnets on subnets hierarchically but you can actually also regionally Define these networks so you could end up with a North America versus Europe versus Asia subnet or west coast East Coast Texas or you know whatever um uh division of networks is going to enable you to have really really fast block times and fast performance Within These subnets and that team is actively working with folks that are building new subnets today um as we've mentioned ipfs has a ton of different implementations I think there's specifically a bounty for Helia which is the new um JavaScript ipfs implementation um which has enabled the deprecation of the old JS ipfs so his ah but there's also a ton of other ones there's iroquo Estuary boost and 20 plus other ipbs implementations that you can harness within your applications or you know build upon or iterate upon in order to make them better for a lip P2P I highly recommend checking out this great video from Max from the ipfs thing on connecting everything everywhere all at once and this new connectivity demo that they um created I think they'll be reprising it later in hack FS but it enables you to do browser to browser uh peer-to-peer collaboration browser to laptop laptop to mobile phone etc etc um all within the browser all utilizing lip P2P for that direct peer-to-peer networking communication so very exciting definitely seems like a very exciting opportunity for folks that maybe want to think about service worker gateways or um kind of like better offline peer-to-peer collaboration within a variety of devices and modalities um and this seems very exciting to for example grab some old ipfs demos that have existed long before Port them into this new area and then build on them things like you know using a browser tab to share content peer-to-peer over ipfs or things along those lines there's some cool things with peer pad that you might go in and look up from before and get running in these these new applications um I'd mentioned Saturn and ipni but these are really useful tools for indexing and retrieving data quickly from both ipfs and Bitcoin nodes uh and so there's a uh both Kubo and Lotus and boost and other nodes um they're all ipps nodes uh but there's a very uh you know easy getting started guide to to jump up and run with these networks if you want to enable fast retrievals um there's polybase which enables you to have this database layer that can understand wallets tokens and ZK proofs you can absolutely utilize tooling like nft.storage web3. storage Falcon data tools and more as a fast storage on-ramp for whatever your use case of choices and you can even utilize the Big Data exchange if you're working with big data and Big Data communities to actually have a two-sided marketplace where you're both challenging clients for the storage of their data and charging SPS for storage providers for access to those large valuable public data sets um of course huddle um also one of the sponsors of this event but um doing some awesome work with uh kind of like peer-to-peer media infrastructure and making sure that you can have a great video communication I think they also have some awesome Integrations with live peer if you want to do live streaming within peer-to-peer video calls um and so some really useful tools if you're excited about having a video Centric application um for Life peer really useful Focus around um you know social networks and decentralized social so thinking about live peer Integrations into things like blue sky or thinking about content moderation for um how you can do decentralized video streaming or other decentralized social applications um it's really awesome to see this like open social map continuing to get filled out so if you're excited about potentially building social applications on top of live peer huddle Falcon fvm and maybe utilizing some of these retrieval tools like you know you're getting the the components that you need to start making faster and faster social applications that can also handle you know larger scale video storage potentially like the YouTubes and Twitches of the world would be really cool to see someone go and build in that direction and of course Lighthouse um definitely a go-to tool if you're looking for really quick and easy Perpetual file storage um and also a great uh you know Exemplar to look at in terms of making sure that that is available across many different chains and bringing that you know ease of access to things like polygon and elsewhere so that they can all store their data on falcoin and last but not least check out fission's odd SDK um it's you know an amazing new uh SDK that you can utilize for local first Edge Computing they also have some really really useful combinations of things like ucams dids ipfs and you know a great way with uh you know getting started building applications that are private and secure by default all right um so if that didn't spark your interest and you're still like uh I feel like there's 10 000 things I need to learn and I'm a little overwhelmed by the number of things being listed um I would love to recommend a couple of learning opportunities that might be relevant now but might be relevant in the future once you've hacked your way through hack fs and uh want to dive even deeper into all that the pl network has to offer um we run an onboarding program for all members of the pl Network um so anyone who's building amazing applications that push the space forward has received investment from PL Ventures or is an otherwise amazing proponent of this space we offer a four-week onboarding program to help train and develop and you know connect all of the amazing talent in the space so that you have mentors you have uh you know access to critical stakeholders any of the knowledge you need to be really really successful within this community we actually have an open source curriculum of curriculum.pr l-launchpad dot IO I believe that you can go and and review even as you're getting started right now um if you find that useful um and uh definitely get in touch with me if you're excited to attend uh we have a I think it's 500 for attending the virtual program and then if you want to attend our quarterly launch pad Summit um we have those once every quarter in a different part of the world um which I'm getting ahead of myself you should definitely come to those as well um we have content within Launchpad for all sorts of different um you know contributors whether that's Builders who are wanted to make sure they have the Hands-On hacking experience product managers who want to understand how to get stuff done in an async remote distributed environment um folks who want to know the fundamentals of how all of the different protocols and Dev tools within this space work and how you know the web 3 landscape itself uh lines up and then also how web threes evolve over time and how you can harness the basics of blockchain cryptography decentralization Etc um and so our next Launchpad Summit as I mentioned is coming up uh next month in July 17th through 21st in Paris over top of etcc um we just published a blog post on this so um if you are have attended Launchpad we would love to see you there um if you are excited to learn more about it you can kick off your Launchpad experience by attending Launchpad Summit and then joining a future cohort later this year um and so um you can grab the QR code here if you want to learn more about it but I also hope to see many of the hackers there it's going to be an amazing Gathering point for the whole PL Network community and webq community so that's it from me thank you so much happy building feel free to send me a DM with all of the cool things that you're building on and I'm very very excited to judge all of your amazing hacks in a couple of weeks I cannot wait
