good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of beef global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to the dow hacks finale thank you so much for waiting uh i know this took us a little bit longer than we planned there's a lot of amazing projects so uh without further ado let's get right into it so all of you are watching this thing on global.tv uh the goal here for us to uh use this is so we can have a shared experience around this thing so everybody who's participating in the hackathon can kind of come and sign in and say hi and kind of engage with everybody else out there and also for everybody who joined us for the summit and the opening kickoff as well as this this live stream will be receiving nft collapse so this hackathon is brought to you by eve global and for those of you who don't know what a global is we're an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons at summits so now hacks was a mix of both uh the last 48 hours have been incredibly fun for the hackathon piece we have 500 hackers over 500 hackers who participate in the last two days building amazing projects from 62 different countries and they spent 16 different time zones it was so much happening at all given times of today for all of us and that kind of got us to this closing ceremony we kind of mapped out where everybody was coming from and it's incredible to see so many countries and continents being being represented and in addition to all those 500 plus hackers with 26 ecosystem partners and 47 ecosystem mentors that were around helping unblock all these teams and with all of that combined we're going to be giving away over 50 000 in prizes today so uh right after all the demos we're gonna go into who won what prizes so um it was an incredible morning for us uh we had 128 projects that came out of this uh these are 120 incredible projects that just were built over the last or just this weekend in the last 48 hours so excited to see what uh some of these amazing projects have done and we want to showcase a lot of them here but before that i want to quickly thank some of our incredible partners that made all this possible and helped out and are going to be giving away a lot of incredible prizes so first off is filecoin and ipfs want to thank them for all their support and then superfluid the graph rabbit hole unlock skill wallet lens protocol covalent developer dao tally ling style friends with benefits llama coordinate reverie the taoist alliance style orca protocol parcel utopia labs factory dow gearbox ens and leica so without their support we want to have an amazing set of workshops talks interviews and panels and also some incredible prizes that you can win so let's get back to the hackathon i know all of you are eager to see what came out of it when we initially kicked this off we had these seven high-level themes that we thought were what we thought and we gathered from all these dials that we talked to to understand what they think is needed in this space whether it's for tooling or different ways to tackle how we can participate in dallas better so what we're going to see today and what we saw from these 120 projects was a mix of all these themes being tackled in really interesting unique ways and this is what takes us to what we're going to do now which is our 10 incredible finalists we're going to demo what they built so we had 128 submissions that kicked us off into 10 finalists that have gone through the judging of the last few hours and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be bringing on these 10 teams to do a live demo of what they built so you can all see some of these incredible hacks and then after that we'll be jumping right into the prizes so without further ado i'd like to congratulate in no particular order compound dial review doubt they don't know i own this song's nfc dow quest butter now serve refund license dial nft doll factory and dow power a lot of dowels and toolings around here so these are our 10 finalists they'll come on one by one and we're going to go into the demos to see what they built and then we'll cover the prices but before we kind of jump into that i want to quickly take a second and thank all these incredible 120 projects that came out of this event uh just because you were not one of these 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough we wanted to just highlight some of the products we're excited about and what uh everybody is excited about and what they want to showcase but there's a lot of stuff that you can and are and some of you were not able to in the last 48 hours and we totally understand that so we want to encourage all of you to keep building a lot of you already emailed us asking for more feedback on some of your projects so we're more than happy to share more feedback or connection with anybody you're trying to get in touch with so uh please keep building and if you need any help from the global side we are more than happy to help out with anything we can so to find out about all the other projects that came out of this uh you can all head over to showcase.educable.com that's where you'll find all 128 of these projects and then after this live stream ends you'll also be able to see what prizes you want on your own project page so if you missed this thing or well i guess if you're sleeping and you don't know i'm saying this you can just wake up tomorrow morning and go back to your showcase page and you'll see all the prizes that you've won so let's get right into it we have all these 10 amazing projects we're going to bring them on back-to-back there won't be any q a just a lot of demos and we're going to prizes so without further ado i want to welcome our first demo of today that is compound out and then after that we'll have they don't know i own this song's nmt so with that let's welcome compounddown and i'll ask you to turn your video on and get right into the demo awesome thank you let me just share my screen and whenever you're ready andrew okay let's get started so we are compound l so just to start i would like to introduce you guys to our rockstar team we got me andrew on the front end we got justin on the full stack side and then we have ulad doing the back end so for our hackathon we created an application to easily manage payroll for dials so what is interesting about our product is that we use a payment stream versus a one-time payment using our one of our sponsors payment solutions this allows new and interesting ideas to be implemented within this space uh with that said i will hand over the mic over to you ad okay yeah i will talk how it actually works your login with your skill wallet and then depending on your current role you have few options core team members can set up salary stream to other community members and also they are able to see current burn rate and last 12 hour bond rate if you just community member uh on our dashboard you should be able to see your current income and last 12 hours income this last 12 our segregates we are using uh we are receiving uh with uh the graph protocol and another option that we also provide to our members is to generate pslip and pin it to ipfs then later you can download it and what is really amazing about this product that we built it we was not required to write any smart contract and now justin will do some short demo awesome thank you so we've deployed our page to uh the url you can see at the top here and we can go ahead and connect our wallet where with skill wallet we're required to log in with metamask and then we are currently logged in now as the core team of our community and therefore we can see the burn rate of our community where we see the die spent over the whole last day and then how the burn rate varied over the last 12 hours then we can also go further go have a look at the salaries where here we are now querying all the members of our community from skill wallet and we also get their position like their their role in the community from skill wallet as well as their username and then we also get all the member addresses and use this to uh get the existing payment streams from superfluid where we can then see for example that andy currently has a salary of 10 die per hour and we can also say well andy did a good job he should be earning more and can change his salary and then once that happens we have to confirm the transaction and once that's confirmed you can see that the salary has been updated and then the third point is also very important because in order to comply with regulation of course we have to aggregate these stream information over a certain time period so here we can see that for example for one specific date we've now aggregated what has been paid in the last 24 hours just summing up the whole stream and using this we can also create a pay slip which pins all the all this information to ipfs and then opens it in a new tab and as this is known to sometimes take some time i've also opened it here so you can see that here we've got the wallet we've got the amount when it was paid and the username of our member and of course in the future we also want to build on all this so we want to move our version to production then most crucially we want to integrate with gnosis safe just to allow a multi-sig procedure rather than one vault paying for all the members um then also we want to yeah add functionality to add and remove members we want to accept other tokens outside of die for payments and then also we would just want to show more information for the community here you can find our project and that's all for today thank you amazing well thank you so much for uh going first and uh doing a live demo and this is this is awesome right streaming salaries is just it just makes everything more real time and there's a lot of things here to manage like a full team so this is this is great can't wait to see uh let's go to production with that we are ready for our second demo and that is they don't know i own this songs nft so whenever you're ready hey hi sorry you hear us uh yeah we can hear you and if you're gonna play the video let's also make sure you have the sound the name of our project i don't know my name is julie and i also have mark with me our project is about freedom and safety security is something we all need and by now almost everyone has someone among their closest friends and family who has lost important items due to the abundance of scams and viruses on discord twitter and malicious websites but how do you prove that you are a part of the club if you don't feel safe showing your proof we believe security issues hold people back from using their nfps in the way they were intended to be but what if you could store your nfts in a code ballot without losing the ability to use them in the services that support the protocol they don't know is a protocol you have been secretly waiting for since you finally bought your precious code balance but how does it work the solution is made possible with offstring cryptography signing a message containing your hot palette address with your code balance then using the hot palette this information gets verified and trained and stored in a smart contract this is where third party integration will get vital but how does it work mike will show you first you have to connect now i'm going to switch to a live demo yeah so here's the application and you will have to um copy your wallet address and your hot wallet address ui and this is the one point where you have to connect with your code wallet to sign a message and then you can disconnect forever then switch to your hot wallet and submit the transaction which basically stores the this mapping of the from the hot wallet to the code wallet and so for example here we have an ft you know the hot wallet and another one in the quad wallet yeah and if we check with our um [Music] contract now it stores now it shows the balance that it has actually two nfds when we query uh for the hot wallet um yeah so it's basically oops suck your way of storing your nfd's in a cold wallet but you can use them with your hot wallet with when integrated with the third party providers yeah so it can be used um could be used with snapshot.org for voting or it can be useful for um parental control and just keeping the urs that's safe thank you [Music] awesome being able to show proof of ownership as a proxy this is a super cool and if you are able to actually do that on snapshot and get those votes to count then this is this is going to be pretty big for all the dows um well thank you so much for for that demo and uh congrats thank you thanks all right next step is our third demo for today which is project butter so whenever you're ready i'll feel free to get started and i believe you'll be playing a recorded video because not all of your team is here so we'll uh we'll get that looked up too [Music] all right which is classic um hi everybody i'm uh vaughan oh not your handle from butter and uh here's kevin as well from butter um i'm going to just share my screen give me two seconds yeah so we're butter we uh we organized a couple of days ago um came with this idea and threw it all together um so the team who aren't here uh includes kevin who is uh who's doing the contracts myself doing the pm um and then uh and uh alex who on here at the moment um butter is focused on treasury management for doubts it's a really big problem we see massive treasuries across the entire space uh really really hard to manage and just going and taking a look through some uh discourses will prove that this is not an easy problem to solve so the idea is simple um spread the treasuries around right there's treasuries that have a lot of a single token typically their own governance token which means they're very overexposed to risk if they're token cards in price if there's a lot of volatility in the market and that's really bad for the treasury because there's a bunch of people who are relying on it and they need to make sure that you know they have the funds to to pay for their operations or you know exist in the future or complete their missions um so very simply spread the risk across assets with butter um treasury diversification is something that everybody talks about but actually executing that in a dow is very tough so we've got a bit of a governance problem i'm sorry actually did a an entire piece on this last year where they just kind of took a survey of uh the top protocols and found that most of them still hold most of their treasury in their native tokens that has changed a lot but still again it's not an easy thing to do there aren't really good tools for doing it and uh enter butter um so as i described if a token were to drop like 80 percent uh in value that could actually be fatal for many dials given the thing they need to do especially if they don't generate new new capital uh over time when you revenue which goes and feeds the treasury um so yeah we can come up with a solution for that uh solution here as we diversify the dallas treasury over time and the time part is important uh one thing that dao cannot do is just like market sell and dump a bunch of their own governance tokens it looks bad for the protocol it's bad for token holders uh and so on and so forth so um we think there's a potentially good solution there to kind of ease out of that token over time uh without kind of making any significant market moves and obviously you have the threat of outside attacks people watching the chain looking at the mempool uh seeing that a dow is about to dump a bunch of your tokens and then just like front running that so you know we want to kind of have some strategies to to protect against attack as well um so the other thing we want to do is we want to have multiple strategies also dowels don't really lots of dowels fight this idea of using their token in a very kind of like d-gen way um and so there's you kind of want to have some responsible strategies that are vetted and seen as being safe and secure and not really about um being aggressively uh defined just trying to like pull as much value out of the ecosystem as possible so the idea here is we would stream the treasury into multiple strategies um that kind of like diversify and rebalance over time and and with that in mind we started with what we think is obviously a a core piece of infrastructure for the entire dark community which gnosis safe so a strong multisig that works and people already trust and so we've built this as a as a gnosis state app so it inherits all of the security hypnosis um and then uh balancer we're using balancer pools to do rebalancing automatically and superfluid to stream tokens into those pools and one of the most interesting uh parts about that is this is kind of a novel uh a novel uh implementation of superfluid because we're actually uh streaming tokens into a pool over time um and the real benefit of this approach is is really that we get to um to like like see a token going over time and we get to control it so there's the component of putting tokens into a into a pool um which balances over time which gives you some controls but then also the governance controls to pause increase or decrease the flow of tokens in in kind of like a monthly cadence which would be really useful for dallas to have as a pattern um in how they govern their treasury um is the process flow about how we actually do that it's not something that's super important for right now so we'll move on we'll get to the to the demo um and the products as i said secured by knowledge and safe downstream tokens die f or uh or state diversification strategies so one you know just to go into stables once they're going to eat and want to go into like a state interstate for some growth um so i'll go to the demo so i'm going to talk through this part is a video it's going to talk through what's happening here so we're now in gnosis i know this is safe and as for anyone who uses this this is the kind of interface that most dals would see on a day-to-day basis whenever they're having to conduct a like a treasury transaction and a purchase paying for things like payroll and so on um they go into the app section load up the app and an inside butter instantly they would see their portfolio obviously this is work in progress and we would improve this over time but you see your portfolio see wow am i over balancing my own governance token that's insane um and maybe here we could do some projections around what that might look like given certain scenarios like what happens if the token doubles in value housing value and so on uh you pick the strategy uh you load it up you see the parameters and again what we're really doing here is solving an information problem we're condensing the amount of options that dao has when it thinks about government's treasury we're saying hey just pick some weights uh pick some some amount of time you want to to kind of rebalance over and um and then yeah and submit it inside of the pool so you're going to see us just setting the call but there's not much to show on the back and most of this is back end so we don't really have anything to show there but um but what we're doing is like setting this up and it will just now run for the the predetermined time and at the end the the dow tragedy will have rebalanced to be like say 80 20. so you'll have slowly just kind of diversified out of the government's token um so yeah um a few things that we wanted to do in the future was uh also introduced a method for streaming tokens back out and also introducing kind of in like an overclocking feature where if the token grew a lot in a small period of time in a very volatile period of time we'd actually just stream tokens back out of the pool so it kind of like ramped up in terms of how quickly it was uh it was diversifying and waiting towards the stable um but yeah that's it that's all we got done this weekend we're going to do some more it was really exciting and really good to hack for the team and uh yeah looking forward to uh to doing more thanks everyone amazing um well i think uh i'm gonna steal a comment from mark from the live stream which is this is a smoothest butter this was awesome um and it's a super unique case for streaming payments i know the whole uh super super blue team is watching this live stream and uh they're already excited so this is uh this is great i hope we get to use it soon too congrats yeah all right with that we are ready for our next time also without further ado i'd like to uh welcome project refund alexander whenever you're ready thank you kartik i have a pre-recorded demo video so here it is uh just uh just to check if there's an audio i don't think uh the setting was checked so you want to do that one more time okay i'm sorry i think no no it's now it will be better hi my name is alexander and i will show a quick overview of refund project those need to pay for real life goods and services such as food airplane tickets software subscriptions and so on usually a dow member would pay in fiat and then get a reimbursement in cryptocurrency refund is an expense management system for dows and the app tracks and files expenses such as fuel travel and meals users create requests by uploading the receipts and then get reimbursements from their dows to create a new organization choose a name and add dao members dao member can be registered either as an approver which gives the power to approve or deny expenses or a member a regular member who can create new reimbursement requests we need to add all the members and then click create approve the transaction in metamask and wait until the refund contract is created and the refund organization is created now we need to send funds to dallas account and we'll put the amount click send funds approve the transaction again and we can see that organization balance is increased next we'll show how to create a new requests to create a request the user has to log in using itsworld address and now we can see user role it's a member and we'll now create a new request first we need to upload a receipt photo using ipfs and web3 storage and after that ai will scan the image and automatically recognize the amount on the receipt then we need to choose category and fill in the description and finally send a request we need to confirm the transaction and after a few moments the approver will get notified that a new request has been created also a member can see its request in my request list and the current status of that request is processing the approver can see all the requests for the whole organization and it can see all the details for each request like creator of the request received photo that has been uploaded the description of of the request and finally the approver can either approve or deny pending requests in this case we'll approve it and confirm transaction and after a few moments a member gets notified that the request has been approved and also wallet balance is increased as well the status of the request is updated to it's showing approved and that's all for this demo thank you for watching amazing thank you for watching a whole reimbursement process that is uh web3native is uh incredible this is awesome i mean this is a problem that i definitely have on a day-to-day basis but uh this is great congrats thankfully we all get to use this here all right and next up we have nft dao factory so whenever you're ready hey how's it going it's going great all right cool yeah so hello everyone uh my name is teddy uh i have one other teammate whose name is theo and uh our project is nft dao factory and so we combine the features of an nft collection smart contract and a dow smart contract and makes it so that the nft holders become voters in the dow and um so you know we've been tired of like getting scammed in different collections you know so pretty much the you know owner comes up with a really good story and even sells out the mint raises millions of dollars and then you know takes the money and doesn't execute the road map you know just withdraws the money and disappears and you know kind of leaves the community hanging sometimes and uh so we try to build something that could prevent that and um so the community votes on when uh allocations from a treasury go to the owner so um say the owner raises a million dollars um someone in the community you need to create a proposal to say you know 100 000 will go to you um you know next week and you need to use it for this um so that's again the premise and i can show you how it works um so we have this deployed on a as a static site at github and then uh yeah you know we can do east global that's the name east and uh yeah total supply of the nft collection we'll go with 100 and then votes needed to pass a proposal and this is to prevent proposals with two people voting on it from getting passed so um you know we'll say at least 10 people need to vote on it for it to be considered and then yeah to create a proposal you need to own three you know this way you know not everyone is creating proposals um and yeah you know triggers metamask and then uh you you pay the gas fees uh i mean you know right now we're not charging a fee um it's a factory so you know anyone who wants to start a new collection um you know nft dao can use this as their their starting point and uh you know because we we've um had a bunch of friends you know who even paid us to help them launch a collection so a lot of people out there you're looking for these types of services um so we figured maybe this could be even become a business um and then i'll show some of the uh smart contract under some a couple other features there you can see in the um in the remix so uh you know this is the data model for a proposal you know keeps track of who created it um you know how many votes you know is it live is it passed um and then you executed is false and then so once it's executed that's when you know if it did pass all the criteria then the money gets sent and then voting is uh simple uh yes and no um yeah you put in the proposal number we'd say one here's the ipfs hash with the description uh and then yeah you know you can vote um and then so before you know i go more to that you know we also have a um you know discover uh area of the site and um you know the purpose of this is to uh you know index the different collections that um we helped create um and then it shows uh the different events uh that the that collection smart contract is emitting um so this way you can keep track of them you can see okay well there was you know a couple proposals submitted today and you know okay the owner got money on this day um she kind of gives you a simple interface and uh you know we use the covalent api um just you know to read events uh for this um and uh yeah you know we also tried to make sure that the uh you know nfc collection had the features it needs know where you can set the minting live um with the price you can turn it off if you'd like um you know it gives you the ability to change the base url so that you could do a pre uh pre-reveal i'm going to reveal at a later date um you know so i want to uh keep it simple um but also with some good little features um so that you know maybe it would appeal to a lot of different people um and uh yeah yeah i mean that pretty much sums it up so i think i'm done amazing thanks teddy this is basically community as a service or for any nfc this is this is great i'll help you kind of continue building this and now we get to use it soon yeah thanks all right that was number demo number five we have five more to go so without further ado let's welcome review dao whenever you're ready hello we are all double ups with a project called review dao okay let me share my screen piece for you first we got a presentation describing our project and gotta briefly introduce our demon local host hello everyone i would love to present you about our hack for dao x review dao is an organization managing countless number of token created registries we have two tokens reviewed our token based on open zaplin implementation of erc20 and reviewed our nft based on open zap and erc 721 and azuki 721a review dao is the master body and if the holders propose new lists one nft can propose one list per month each nft has one vote per week for proposed lists successful vote gives the owner a reward and review dow token once per week a new list with the most votes is created by the factory the owner of the proposal gets large reviewed outlook and reward this deploys a new dcr contract where people can apply for listing parameters in this contract are controlled by the settings contract and they can be modified by successful proposals in review daw let's consider a list called best rogue banks roger waters tries to apply for bing floyd they stake their tokens plus a possible challenge reward which is double the stake and registration period of two weeks begins if the registration period ends with no challenger the challenge reward will be refunded to them but their stake well you will go to the review doubt master contract for governance rewards [Music] they will be added to the list if anyone is brave enough to challenge pink floyd they match the value of the stake and send it to the contract then a challenge period begins any person with enough tokens can vote either for including or excluding pink floyd from the list each vote costs certain number of reviewed dow tokens but each voter gets refunded after the challenge is over pink floyd wins the challenge their stake goes to the review dow contract for governance and they get refunded the challenge reward all voters who voted for including them in the list then share the tokens of the challenger stake equally then the subject will be added to the list now let's consider nickelback tries to apply for the listing someone immediately challenges them and after two weeks nickelback loses the challenge now the challenger will get to challenge your reward and their stake will go to the review dow contract for governance remember the challenger reward is twice the stake meaning the challenger will essentially double their tokens every person who voted against during the challenge will get equal share of the subject's stake then the subject does not get included in the list there is no risk for people who vote for proposed subjects there is a risk for the challenger but they have the possibility of doubling their tokens even if a subject loses the challenge they can try to reply later once a subject is added to the list people with enough tokens can upvote and downvote the subject if the subject vote vote count reaches certain negative value they get banished from the list but can reply later again we are using ipfs to store images and descriptions of list proposals lists and listings we are curing data from the graph tokens are implemented using open ziplin erc20 and erc721 thank you okay that was our presentation now let me introduce briefly our application so we got a a few few main pages a new card representing uh each list and if you click on the list we get a few a few items directly to that particular list and uh the next pages representing apply for a new item and show current applicants we already connected if i input here some some list name and some list description for example uh someone walker so i'm gonna choose some image and it's gonna create ipfs directly to the applicant page as we can see we get here a structure of a json if we redirect uh to image we got our own walker image okay can go on so so we still yet have to connect the contracts with the application itself because there was not enough time to do that for ourselves the constructs the contracts are big uh we are starting with the review dow contract uh which is actually using the factory which is creating the new lists uh the nft which is the governance token for the review now and the token which is the governance token lists itself uh the factory can create a new list which is uh which then uh has the functions uh to uh excuse me uh yeah uh so we can create the new list uh and and and the list has all the implemented uh methods to actually list the item you want to list the challenges uh the voters and the polls are on or implemented so so we still have to connect the the back end with the front-end application but that's there was not enough time to do that during the little time of two days thank you thank you totally understandable there's only so much you can do in 48 hours but uh this is great and uh it's been a while since we've seen uh nickelback show up anywhere on the live stream all right well congrats and uh hopefully keep building this thank you thank you very much all right next up we have now quest so bit whenever you're ready okay okay so um we have we have been creating an app um because we recognize the dolls can be sometimes very complex and the info can be scattered all over the place and sometimes it can be difficult for new members or overwhelming to understand what the dao even is about so we wanted to create a more standardized and gamified onboarding process we approached this problem uh with trying to implement a questing system that familiarizes new users with idea and the structure of a dao by doing quests that are created by the core dao members and introduce well the idea of a doll to them so we managed to do this with the basic mechanism of question submission of proof of completion and the reviewing process where the quests can be or the quest submissions can be either accepted or rejected and if they are rejected they can be resubmitted um so i'll show you briefly how the app looks like and how it works so you can log in and enter and then you have the options to either search for a question if you're a person that wants to get to know certain dolls or if you want to create a question for your own daw or a group or whatever and then there is the overview of quests where you have access to your current progress and uh there is also a panel for submissions where you can review [Music] the quest submissions that were submitted for the questions that you have made okay so if we search for a question i prepared a question which already has five uh quests added i will show you how to add requests so we are adding the quest six do this and that here you can write what this quest is about and what the person should do so because we have set a limit uh to max five quests that are free the user can then select uh a basic plan where they have uh where they get more quests available for creation or a premium plan where they could just get the infinite amount of quests created so if we select the basic plan we can then create a stream so the stream is being created um [Music] we can now uh add the six oh no just let me refresh well we can now add the six quest anyways it will ask for an approval and it will take some time before it appears but uh we can in the meantime look at the overview requests where i have already submitted [Music] proof of completion for request and here it is waiting for a review to either get rejected or accepted or i can oh this would just let me log into another account this one okay here you can see that i'm missing the panel for quest creation because i logged in with another account and i'm not the owner of this question but what i can do here is upload some proof okay so you can write the description of what you did and you can upload any kind of media file and store it on ipfs again we need to wait for approval of the transaction and while we wait we can actually take a look at the other account which has created this question and [Music] see that [Music] we have some quests that were submitted and are waiting for our approval or rejection and here we can approve it and then the person who has submitted this quest [Music] well proof of completion will get it accepted so this was pretty much everything we have managed to do during this hackathon the follow-up idea is to mint an nfc or some kind of a proof that members or like trials or newcomers have finished a particular question and use this or store this in either skill wallet or some kind of a profile that can track the history and showcase that uh some well that people have uh finished and completed onboarding and uh showcase their skills um this is it from my site amazing thank you so much now hope to get more interesting ways of doing quests for different houses it's great all right three three more projects to go so next up is now serve so whenever you're ready [Music] okay all right i'm gonna share my screen now [Music] okay so [Music] we are dow surf so you could call us uh wave alert of daos and we have created a tool to help now scale and ensure its survivability so the main problems that we see for the dials is that um the dials are prone to getting attacked and getting fat because of their untransparency so now that excuse so now that we see the problem we are trying to come up with an idea of how to solve that so right now we have created a which will be plugged into the landing page of any dials and then you can see the query from equivalent and sub graphs so for the operation first that we will use colon subgraphs to query the data of treasuries and parameter changes and also governance proposals and then we will start on our backend and the database and after that we will format the data and send it to the widget which will be inserted into the landing page of the dials so now let me show you the website this is a demo website as you can see this is the widget that can be inserted and we have they demo it with our away proposals and then as you can see users who are not part of the avedao can also vote to provide more engagement for the community through this and then also with the immense amount of on-chain data we can also provide analytics into the dow's treasuries and how they fare compared to other dials all right and then for future opportunities we are planning to add more dials and more custom metrics more alert channels and also now serve can also function as its own governance in which many dials can come and vote on which metrics should be added and which dials should be added into the dowsers platform yep and it's also those it's also providing tools for social network analytics through twitter as you can see that we can function just like we alert and that's pretty much it for the presentation thank you amazing thank you so much this is uh this will definitely make it a lot easier to kind of track it as a dashboard on what's going on this is great cool well with that we have two more demos to go so without further ado let's welcome license style whenever you're ready hello hey everybody there's a lot of you here it's a huge team all right here we go uh thank you so much so this is a presentation on a license now which we built over the dao hack hackathon so first meet the team who we are um i'm anja the legal wizard and then we have igor alone and paul a stack wizard and alina out there as our design wizard um she is a brilliant chica these are her designs everything is copyrighted all right so what have we built uh we built a license dial which creates a standardized repository of ip licenses residing on the ipfs infrastructure and what we've designed so far is a very clean interface where one can first become a down member and submit the license to adal allow then places the license up for voting and the voting takes about seven days um we use the quorum of 25 and a simple majority meaning that more than 50 percent of votes have to be passed in order for the license to be um approved once the proposal is approved the license is stored on the ipfs storage and ready to be used by the content creators of the web3 so basically what we can now show with the code as well is the submission of the licenses and the voting but first this is the home page you can see all the approved licenses you can see all the pending licenses and all the statistics with it you can also reach the repository of all the licenses together with the filters approved finding rejected you can see the statistics on quorum on support these licenses got and you can see all the members also approved pending and rejected members you see also that you can connect the digital bullet and as soon as you do that you access your profile so what you can do with your profile is you can join as a down member you can also edit the avatar you can add a brief um description about yourself and then we kind of request all the dal members to submit a cover letter where they just talk about the motivation to join the top once you submit it successfully you can see the cover letter you can actually see the support you got how many people voted on it and if anybody wanted to reject you you will also see all the licenses that you proposed and the licenses that have been voted upon there's also a button to add the license as soon as you click on it you'll see a couple of information that we ask from anyone that wants to propose the license so first is the author name the title of the license abbreviations if any um like cc0 or something then the license version as in 1.0 4.0 whatever um the summary where you should kind of use a brief description of what this license is all about a disclaimer if needed if you want to give away your liability or responsibility a statement of purpose and the license text which is basically the legal code that is going to be applicable in the case uh we also kind of ask for submitting the precursors as in if there has been any previous history of the same license and then once you submit you'll see on your account that the license has been successfully submitted you'll have um this type of statistics again so you'll see who rejected it who approved it and then this is the to showcase which types of buttons we'll have vote for or vote against now how it all works we sort of use the ipfs as the storage so all the information is basically stored on the ipfs and we use ceramic to create data sets we also used subgraph for indexing and we deployed a smart contract on the test net so the idea behind is that we kind of meet the platforms halfway under the house uh right now after a couple of researches that we've made uh we've also been part of doing good and have uh created the terms and conditions out there uh so we are pretty familiar with the different um stages or different licenses that one has available on the platforms whereas the solution actually allows those marketplaces or the individuals to go on the license style proposal license that they want to tell or read um or just you know adhered to one that has been approved by the whole community and it's not really enough to actually just end it up there because it's not um necessarily that all the websites all the the nfd platforms are going to be reaching a consensus they don't really work like the notes so this is why we're going back to the protocol level and in the future we kind of want to um create the eip standards as well so this is basically it we do have a code to show as well and we're going to share the github repository plus um we're looking for more nerds like us and we're going to be in amsterdam possibly describing the idea to many more lawyers and many more developers so this is us amazing thank you so much and uh that was so awesome to follow and such a cool way to think about intellectual property this is great well we hope to see this live all right and with that we are ready for our last finalist demo for today so without further ado let's go into the now power demo [Music] hi guys what's up so this is the last one i'll try and bring some energy and make it interesting i've seen some pretty cool projects so far i'd also like to thank my team member muhammad who's not presenting today but so firstly what is dao power uh well firstly what's a dao so daos are organizations basically token holders and right now we have some pretty good insights into dows we typically use things like tvl or the amount of ethereum held or the number of members to summarize the dow and you can use cool tools like coin gecko and deep doubt to really get inside and see what's going on with the dao but we wanted to take a step back and really understand the community that your dow represents so the very members which make up your dow so let's put some color on what are their holdings so we've defined dao power as the total wealth held by a dow community and we've taken friends with benefits as an example we've used covalent apis which they're really cool i'd recommend um to query the token holders and then submit all of these addresses the token holders all of their current holdings so we can see what projects may overlap with your dow so we can get a deeper dive into what your users hold the total financial power of them and you know how is it distributed so here's a chart of the friends with benefits dell of the close to 6 000 members uh we can see that they're holding usdc and they're holding eight as well so i guess uh eight coin you know i can see why there's some synergies between the two groups um you can also see you know like axi and people here so constitution doubt uh so it kind of puts a bit more color on your dow members and the makeup of your community which i think will be really valuable if you're thinking about joining a dow or even you know you want insights on you know your members of the dow that you partially govern um yeah and you can like do a deep dive and see exactly which token and how much of it your dow members own you know one interesting thing we you're using covalent apis and we only manage to collect data for two dowels but i'd like to highlight you know how this tool dow power can be used so we've just seen friends with benefits uh i'm gonna make you remember this number 250 million it's about that uh that's like the total holdings of all the friends with benefits downloads so you've never heard of clear down unless you're a d5 derivatives trader um it's only got 365 members of the dell but the actual total dowel power is higher than fractured benefits down members it's 264 million so that makes the dow power per capita at 700 million which is super interesting um so we'd like to you know like see what are they holding and it seems like the members of this dow are mostly holding usdc usdt frax and i guess kucoin's token as well so it's pretty interesting just to see the makeup of two different dowels and so you can see you know your users like what are the tokens they're holding you know and we'd like to dive deeper we'd like to get more granular into basketing different tokens so for example stable coins or d5 projects or nfts and really you know get a sense of who your dow members are by what they hold um so yeah we managed to do this in a weekend but we're not done yet we want to get you know more granular see how distributed the user's funds are or the members funds are for example is it daos mostly holding tokens or is it you know members um and we want to you know apply this right now it's on ethereum but to more chains and covalent lets us do that so we're pretty excited about where we're going and uh yeah we'd love people to start building on top of this and we'd love you guys to get more insights on the dowels that you guys are actually part of and make up thank you very much for your time thank you so much this is a good way to kind of dig into the on-chain data and make a lot of that usable for more actionable items here oh amazing well that concludes all 10 of our finalist demos so i want to quickly thank all these 10 teams i just went live and presented so compound out they don't know i own this song's nft butter refund nft

showcase page under the project and as a quick note for all prizes all prize delivery is contingent on a proof of us verifying your code base so we can make sure that everything that was submitted here was worked on in the last 48 hours so none of these are final uh we are going to be reviewing everything and then distributing the prizes in the next two weeks that is by april 27th and there are some cases where uh you may have applied for a full price but you don't see your project listed there from any of those previous uh slides if you don't see yourself there but you apply for it you're
