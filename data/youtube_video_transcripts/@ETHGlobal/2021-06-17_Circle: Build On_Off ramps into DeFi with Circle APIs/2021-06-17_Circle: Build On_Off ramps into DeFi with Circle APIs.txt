shop and um and today i'm here to talk about building uh on and off ramps into defy by using some of some of serco's products particularly circo apis um so let me share my screen and get started i assume you guys can see my screen if not um shout on on on the on the chat so um so for for those of you who haven't heard about circle i'll do a very brief uh intro uh circle has been around in in crypto and blockchain uh for about seven years now um and today our our focus is is providing payments and treasury services for for businesses um and obviously the way that we approach payments and treasury services for businesses is obviously by harnessing the power of crypto and and blockchain in particular um by harnessing the power of crypto assets such as stable coins um running on public blockchains um i'll talk about ussc in a second but one of the one of the key things that we do for our business customers is it's kind of bridging this this uh this world these two worlds that are so important still today in finance which is um the world that's powered by blockchain technology um with all the benefits that it has including you know the innovations that are coming from the decentralized finance segment um but but connecting that to the traditional um you know banking and payment systems to make sure that that businesses can operate in this hybrid world that will probably be required for a number of years until hopefully we see uh technologies based on blockchain um kind of being introduced in more and more uh use cases um that are mainstream um when it comes to processing payments when it comes to uh treasuries cases that that every business in the world has you probably still has this strong need to balance out the the connectivity between the legacy or traditional financial system with with the new world of blockchain and that's one area that we are proud to uh to execute on and we bring a lot of value to to businesses in that in that in that environment as i said we'll touch a little bit on uscc ussc is is kind of uh a very a very important part of our technology stack that we use internally at circle and we build our products and services on top of that um uscc is uh is today the leading the leading fully reserve uh and regulator digital dollar stable coin it's something that we launched uh back in 2018 uh ussc is actually a standard that is governed by a consortium called center where both circle and coinbase are part of and circle is the main issuer of uscc i think most of you understand the benefits of of a digital dollar asset like usc today it ideally the concept is to bring the the benefit of the dollar as a currency but to to join that with the with the speed that we have when we when we transact uh in digital assets over the internet over public blockchains uh with the cost of transacting as well and particularly with the openness and uh and composability that comes with uh with assets uh that operate in that environment i think we are super proud of of you know having seen the adoption of usc particularly in decentralized finance um in a completely open and permissionless way nobody has ever asked us for permission to use usc in all of these protocols and that's exactly the way that it should be today there's about 23 billion ussc in circulation on the on the ethereum blockchain the way that it works a lot of people actually it's a super super simple mechanism um as far as technology is concerned uh but a lot of people sometimes ask the question about how uscc actually works as i said it's super simple hopefully this diagram gives people a an insight into it but essentially circle operates a service where our customers and today we focus on business customers as i said earlier they essentially bring dollars to circle and they do that by transferring dollars in the traditional financial system to us in various different forms once we observe the settlement of those dollars you know that have been sent by our customers we then uh mint the the corresponding amount of usc ussc and we move that that's sort of a combined operation and we move those those uh dollars um to center appointed uh reserve accounts and center as i said is the consortium that governs uscc as far as the standard is concerned and uh and it essentially uh you know establish it establish policies for for how those reserves can should be maintained and utilized effectively after that process after the usc is then created we credit usc into an account that that our customers have with us in this product that we call the circle account and i'll talk about this in a second and and that's essentially how it works and then even though i haven't depicted here there's the reverse process which is what we call redemption right so every every customer of ours when they bring ussc back to their circle account with us they have the option to to fully redeem that for four dollars on a bank account and we honor that redemption and we we give customers we transfer dollars to customers uh after buying the ussc um in um in a you know in a one-to-one ratio all of this service is provided for all of our customers for for free um so there's actually no cost for any business to to uh issue or or redeem usse with circle uh and and and that's that's kind of the main mechanism behind uscc maintaining spag right it's that it's that uh that ability to redeem um and the the ability that customers have that they can trust uh that all ussc they can bring it back to circle and redeem for the exact amount of dollars so with that uh with that what what the the the added value that would bring to that solution is that usc is fully reserved uh it's also audited um on a monthly basis we issue uh at the stations on on how uscc is continues to be fully collateralized um it's also as i said it's also based on on the idea of open standards and governance this idea that you know it's not necessarily an asset that's uh created and maintained by a single uh private entity it's it's utilized in a consortium and the idea is that consortium is open and over time will grow um and it's also issued uh in the us under the us regulatory framework uh which is which is super important for for this space um so with that said let me talk a little bit about some of the servo products and and we'll get little by little deeper in terms of details of how we we have products to to help facilitate uh the on and off ramp uh of fiat money into decentralized finance so first of all we have this this idea it's it's a core component of our product suite and it's the idea of a circle account a circle account as i mentioned it's a it's a full stack solution for for payments and treasury use cases for businesses um a couple of things that businesses can do with with the circle account as i mentioned as i was explaining the flows for usc you can first of all transfer or convert in and out of digital dollars right so if you have dollars the if you want in the old form factor in a bank account you can transfer those to circle and obtain the equivalent amount in digital form in the form of usc uh and you can do the reverse process that you get the ability then with our product to to utilize those digital dollars just as you would actually have the ability to do that if you use just about any wallet on the ethereum blockchain right at the end of the day uscc it's just a near c20 token but with our product we we we ambition to facilitate um you know making and receiving payments in digital currency form in a stable form with the use of ussc so customers who have the need to you know make payments or receive payments from uh from a global supply chain for example they can do that with us if they if they need to pay their employees in ussc and we have customers who do that they can do that with our account um and so on and so forth another those are on the payments side of use cases right another another thing that we facilitate for our customers and it's it's a recent business line that we are opening and there will be more products coming soon in the space but it's giving customers access to to high yield again based on on on digital assets such as usc uh every business in the world you know has a need for maintaining their treasury for protecting their cash investing their cash when that's applicable and uh and we want to we want to offer businesses the the ability to do that based on based on all the new uh the new solutions and the new money markets uh and and uh and infrastructure that is being created in crypto all this as i said it's it's done in in a single product that that we ambition to have a super simple uh user interface for that circle account product is then connected to the circle apis that businesses might opt to use as well but i'll touch on the circle apis a little bit later so as i said a couple of things that that this circle account facilitate for businesses you can transact globally with uh with suppliers and customers and and individuals all around the world you know not knowing borders as you all know because of the the use of public blockchain um we can we can you know these customers can can obviously base all of their digital banking if you will on on this on this premier source of digital dollar liquidity which is usc as i said always for free always one-to-one uh imperative with the dollar um we we have uh as i said we we are in this business for seven years we have a long history of of custody and security um we're proud of the infrastructure that we have built in that space and and that gives businesses you know the the trust that they need to to know that if they want to custody their assets with us that they are in good hands um and as i said we have uh we have a few announcements coming real soon in terms of how we will allow customers to earn um interest essentially on top of their idle working capital by by uh by allocating some of their ussc funds uh in uh in high-yield products that will launch very soon so let's talk about then the the products the product suite that we have that is more applicable for this workshop which is the the set of circle apis so today we have three main api products that we talked about uh the payments api the payouts api and the accounts api and i will talk i will talk they are all connected to the circle account so a business to be able to utilize those api products uh it needs a circle account uh whether it is for settlement or for the origination of payouts for managing those those sub accounts that they can have and those are the products that are paid uh from from from our point of view as i said the circle account is free but to gain access to the apis then then you need to pay subscription fees but uh we'll talk about them in more detail each one of them so the circle payments api the the point of that product is essentially to to facilitate um that that hybrid those hybrid flows when it comes to especially um consumer to business or business to business payments um bridging traditional the traditional financial system and crypto so the way that that product works is that we allow we expose an api um it's it's a very easy to use api you can essentially capture payments from your end users in the form of traditional methods traditional payment methods for example you you can you can capture payments in in debit and credit card form you can capture payments in in uh in bank account transfer forms uh whether that's ach in the us or or bank wire transfers internationally but you can also capture payments just in crypto form you can also just receive a uscc payment for example and and through that api what what we allow you to do is to have a unique view uh in terms of settlement on your circle account for all those payment methods so if you are charging your customer for some um you know wallet deposit use case that you have or for some commerce use case that you have you can be charging the debit card of your end user but you will receive payment you will receive settlement in the form of uscc on your circle account which allows you to you know after you have collected that payment to turn around and maybe utilize that cash with uh with with crypto based treasury services you can transfer that usc anywhere you can pay out suppliers all over the world so it kind of connects the end user to to crypto settlement without the end user knowing that they that their funds flows are ever going to end up in crypto because sometimes that end user honestly doesn't care but it gives the the business the benefit to utilize um the you know the the byproduct of those payments uh with all the benefits of crypto the circle payouts product is exactly the opposite kind of flow right so imagine that now maybe what you need to do is you need to disperse payments across a very large number of individuals or businesses maybe you could run your payroll using using uh using your ssc as a source maybe maybe you have a wallet product where your customers want to eventually withdraw the value that they have on those wallets um back to traditional bank accounts so across all those use cases we facilitate uh those flows in in the in the sense that if you have a circle account with us again and you have a balance in your ssc you can use utilize our payouts api to either pay out um destinations that are crypto right so you can you can essentially just pay out in usc to other crypto wallets or you can also pay out and we do the conversion for you into uh bank accounts all over the world and we facilitate those two uh forms of of uh flows with within a single api infrastructure the then the third product that we have which is the the accounts api that that api essentially facilitates um a very flexible model where you can create any number of sub-wallets by the way whenever i talk about wallets in our infrastructure these are all custodial wallets right so we we custody the wallets and we allow our customers to to access this infrastructure via apis but it's a custodial model where we control the the private keys you essentially have the flexibility to create however many digital wallets you want uh to to deposit and withdraw from those wallets all of those wallets are connected to chain if you want so you can generate deposit addresses for all those wallets you can send money from those wallets on chain um and you can also process payments in traditional forms and and receive settlement and distribute then settlement across that infrastructure wallets so imagine imagine if you were to um you know to rebuild if you will a venmo of sorts or or an uber of sorts uh and you want to use uh crypto native technology to do that you could use these apis that we have for that for example every in an uber theoretical uh use case you could have all of the driver wallets be digital wallets considered in this infrastructure right and whenever you receive a payment from an end user you transfer the part that's due to the driver in in terms of wallet transfers and that driver has access to take that fund away on chain or to receive that fund in some other form so so that's the right hand side of the slide in terms of these end user financial use cases but combining that with digital currency but also this this is used sometimes by some of our customers for treasury operations right if they want to have a flexible structure in terms of wallets maybe they want uh you know a wallet to facilitate payments to to to to suppliers maybe they want a separate wallet to facilitate other types of of treasury operations just as businesses typically have multiple bank accounts for handling different types of flows this api allows businesses to to customize the set of wallets that they utilize in our infrastructure and and all of these all of these wallets very soon when we when we roll out more broadly access to to high-yield interest accounts all of these wallets can potentially uh benefit from from uh from earning high yield uh if you locked that value in that product uh so let's talk about a practical use case um to make things a little bit more more practical so many of you i would imagine uh know off of dharma dharma is a company that has been around in crypto for for a while building building different sets of products on top of ethereum today dharma is utilizing the circle apis and as you as you as you might or might not know but if you don't i would certainly advise you to to check on on dharma they have a very slick consumer app that you can download on your phone and essentially what you do what you get is you get access to to a whole lot of defined use cases in there whether they are trading or yield use cases dharma connects people to protocols like uni swap compound urine you know and the list is super long check check their website but they ambition to obviously give access to to all that all the benefit of all that defy infrastructure to the largest possible amount of consumers and the way that we help them do that is by having them utilize uh the circle payments api to to on-ramp customers as well as off-ramping into those protocols and the way that they do that is by by using the payments api particularly they use that for for ach rails for their u.s customers so that i can make a an ach deposit from my u.s based bank account and that lands on the on the dharma app and and in the form of usc even though that's kind of abstracted away for for the user and then i can utilize those funds uh with all of those protocols uh so that that's a use case that we actually see being repeated uh many many times i'll just mention a couple of other customers that we that we help um and there's a lot of other customers that we can't quite talk about but these are some of the customers that we facilitate um you know invariably this this is the the this is the use case is giving people access to d5 but giving more and more people access to defy primarily when it comes to mainstream users that that you know there are still they still have funds on a bank account and want to kind of dip their toe into into these new protocols and apps that that are being built uh we facilitate that transition from from the traditional financial system to the new world um in a way that that people can build these apps and can hopefully target um you know millions of consumers and tens of millions of consumers and over time uh more and more um until hopefully then we don't need to to intermediate uh between the the new world and the traditional world anymore and hopefully that becomes legacy but that's certainly going to take a few years for them um so so as i said you know that's the core value proposition that our apis uh deliver on particularly for for defy uh use cases um as i mentioned we we try to we try to control all of the complexity of traditional payments uh all of the complexity of possibly having different sources for settlement or different origins for payouts for all these different providers that maybe you will find for one payment rail or the other concentrate all that into wallet infrastructure that is that is you know connected to ethereum uh that is that is uh using a digital dollar form as opposed to a traditional one um to allow essentially these businesses uh to focus on the innovation to focus on the user experience but not to not to be bogged down by by the details uh that are super super complicated to handle when it comes to traditional payments um i'll stop here for questions uh but you know for for all all the devs uh in the audience i would i would certainly urge you to to have a look at our developer documentation by going to developers.circle.com um we have a lot of documentation on all the apis a lot of uh examples cases anyone is is free to to open a sandbox account if you go to my sandbox.circle.com we just ask you for your name and email address we don't ask for anything else and you can get some api keys on that sandbox environment and you can try out the apis for yourself no questions asked no no payment required um and uh and yeah let us know what you're building and we would love to help so i'll stop here for any questions that you guys might have uh hey can i ask a question i i most certainly think again hey yeah um do circles apis allow for uh something like approve or transfer from functionality like in erc20 not right now great question so not not right now uh we actually we actually have built in conjunction with coinbase we have built that functionality into usc into the usc smart contract as part of the v2 of uscc so i think that went live uh at some point late last year uh we so it's it's it's a it's possible to do that with uscc but we have not um exposed that as a primitive on the apis as of as of now yet but we have it's a good question that you're asking uh actually just this week that was there was somebody uh one of our potential customers asking exactly that question we it's probably going to come soon yeah um do you know any ways we could hack around it to make it what you say is a company has like a circle account and they want to sort of approve me to use their usdc on their behalf is there a way we can go about it other than actually creating a database and holding everything yeah aside from creating a database and controlling that yourself which you know might might be implicating you into money transmission right so it's a bit complicated i yeah yeah i would i wouldn't have a i wouldn't have a an idea that i could that i could give it to you right now but uh but happy to engage on on discord um we can keep chatting about that and i can i can look with a few folks on my product engineering team to to explore alternatives for you ah cool i'll message you thank you okay so it looks like we're getting a lot of questions in the chat if you'd like to go look at those um the first one says do circles apis allow for approve or transfer from like functionality like erc20 that was me oh i think okay but you can see the rest of the questions in the chat i see we're getting a few more okay let me have a look um do you integrate with third-party payment gateways or yourselves or a gateway yeah great question circle is a circle is a payments facilitator um so uh and uh you know you can you can you can think of payments facilitators as um uh you know paypal stripe uh square those are all companies that are premises that's a designation on the card networks so as far as car which i understand is your question since you mentioned gateways i assume you're talking about card payments um but we do utilize partners at the low level of the stack for for actual uh card acquiring so uh we have we have we have a role to play in the end-to-end life cycle of a car payment but we still utilize our gateway behind the scenes um next question is did the platform allow for international bank deposits yes the the answer is yes we we support bank wire transfers internationally as a form of traditional payment rails and i think again if you go to developers.circle.com you will see exactly the list of countries that are supported but i think we support around about 80 80 countries eight zero countries in the world in terms of international bank both for deposits and and uh and outbound transfers as well i think those are all that i see over there all right um there aren't any questions coming in from the youtube stream so if anyone here has any final questions before we wrap up feel free to ask okay there's a couple more coming there i noticed that the smart contract for uscc is not a standard erc20 is that a reason for doing that can you i'll move to the next one kevin if you don't mind can you clarify what exactly you mean which part of non-standard you you're referring to that might make it easier for me i'll i'll jump to the next question but i'm happy to go back to you if you had more details are there any native support for non-usd currencies oh good good question yeah we started with usd the nomination uh because that's you know in crypto markets uh usd denomination is still by far the the most demanded one um however the standard that we have created for ussc is a multi-currency standard and we certainly ambition to build other other flavors of stable coins uh hopefully starting in the near future so you will see settlement in in non-usd form as well but still in the in digital currency form um last question from sean you said it was subscription pricing is that based on the number of users or volume yeah sorry sorry i wasn't exactly precise there so our business model for the apis it's actually a combination of subscription price and um and a volume based price so uh for payments and payouts uh it obviously has to do typically with the volume of payments that you're processing so you pay a subscription fee and that's that's just kind of a minimum fee that you pay right whether you use the service or not but then depending on the volume of payments that you process you're going to pay in in line with that for the accounts api then yes it has to do with the number of users slash wallets that you utilize on our platform okay um unless i got okay i haven't seen a follow-up from calvin so i don't know exactly what what what he was talking about in terms of non-standard um okay well we're up at our kind of deadline now so if you guys have any other questions feel free to reach out to joao on the discord and also thank you to joel and um for circle for sponsoring hack money this year um and yeah great workshop thanks guys for coming bye thank you guys bye
