welcome to the eat mexico finale everybody how's everybody doing all right well we're going to kick it off with a nice summary of how the last 36 hours [Music] work uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right well welcome everybody i'm kartik one of the co-founders of eat global and i am super excited to put this event at a close for the next two hours we're gonna have an amazing time so all of you been working on amazing projects for the last two and a half days and i know a lot of you are super tired we're gonna make sure everything is as quick as possible but for those of you who are joining us for the first time especially in the live stream to summarize this has been an incredible event we have 580 people from 27 different countries coming here and they are half of them are new to web3 they made some incredible projects impressed our judges so much that we had to change up how we format the rest of the event and we're going to talk about that in a second on top of that 65 of them for from latin america this has been our most local event ever and we have 92 projects that came out of it this blew our minds and exceeded all expectations and with these 92 projects we spent the last four hours going through all of them and judged and saw what they did and i want to thank all of our amazing judges for putting in all the hard work and giving the feedback so please give a big round of applause to all of our judges peristani skyler chris baron shannon evan aya sean chris evan and chewie they talked to all of these projects gave amazing feedback and on top of that you also presented to some of our incredible partners for all the prizes you're giving so i want to also give a big shout out to all of our these partners avi grant style dydx ipfs fall coin lens protocol polygon wide connect world coin me now super floyd the graph abacus chain link nurses chain coin spec espacio crypto and rabbit hole we're gonna talk about all of these winners soon but let's get back to the projects as we started at the beginning on friday this is not a conference we care about building cool things the focus is to show and not tell and from these 92 submissions we got 12 incredible finalists and they're all going to be coming on here and showcasing what they built so i want to give a big round of applause to data morpho kp kiwi sellout emergent stacks blocking me the eighth point spiritus ethereum on sets for united in wush they are all 12 incredible teams we're going to bring them on one by one you're going to see 12 incredible demos live of what they built and we're going to have vitalik do his talk and then we're going to talk about all the prizes that everybody's won so stay patient for the next two hours and before we go into the first demo i want to take a quick second to thank all of these 80 amazing projects that took all this time to make something really cool something they were really proud of you did an amazing job so many of you were new so many of you learned about so many new technologies the fact that you presented the fact that you submitted is awesome and you should be proud of that and really hope that you continue working on them tomorrow onwards take some time off today so and for those of you who want to look at all these projects you can head over to each global.com showcase and see the list of all 92 of these projects from the demo videos to screenshots and descriptions to the live websites all this thing is here and with that let's go into our very first demo who is excited all right well let's bring on data morpho for our very first team they'll get set up here and on deck will be kp and we'll get them set up in a few minutes so please give a big round of applause to data morpho thanks please okay hello everybody we're really proud to be here uh i'm being able to kick this off so we are metamorpho conformed by hermann benson ben and i'm eduardo and what is data morpho just imagine millions of years of data morphosis files that can survive generations we're tired of this nft collection fixing rarity to their convenience yes i mean everybody here mentioned one time and have a pre-revealed period well you know what is going to happen with my nft and then at the end you know that sometimes someone comes and give the golden penguin to their friends and then you go and fd that don't work nothing so this can happen anymore we want to make mints reliable okay so datamorpho is a new file standard yes now we have a standard files that are static files or maybe some file that is injected with code or algorithm that gives a different output but we don't have files that can change they can't change the content by itself so what we are going to do here is no more or this is your nft an example for a use case and close your eyes and now you have this paper congratulations this is technology no blockchain is about a lot of technology many very smart people making things that are incredible so this kind of behavior on the programming is an insult no more file substitution and impossible to pick finger you're right how with logical programming that are more fuzzy files okay let's get technical uh meet the metamorpho ecosystem how does this work let's be quick this is a file on ipfs for verification and validification this is what we usually find in a file but now we have some encrypted and obfuscated data here we have an isolated security key storage that through some triggers that there can be dates or no on miraculous saying the weather or some match results gives the keyer put in anywhere three data storage service that is full accessibility by anyone so here our little muffer is enjoying the content okay this sounds interesting can you take me a little bit deeper on this how does it work okay this is uh the structure of a gpa in example we have the first the first hex bytes the content then we have the comment area and then the file after here we have some obfuscated content and the gps encrypted there we have there some very crucial information to get the decryption we have the triggers that are going to be published and we have in the file the strictly necessary data to access to the right content on the storage service okay so is this a new file extension no is this a new file format no this is fully compatible with any any of the files that we currently use because after the end of files almost all of the viewers are not going to looking for something so so we are going to use but when this in there is the implementation now we are going to find that the the content area that is going to be triggered many times in example in christmas dia de muertos or or when somebody has a mustache we will have a different thing over there so one use case i want to mention example madonna is going to release a song and you get the nft you get a song that is madonna saying i'm going to think i'm going to sing but then on the day that corresponds this mf3 file data morphosis and now you have the song and you are the first listening to it okay so what can we expect from this trust how we love ipfs trust that amorphous reveal was revealed in the same fight that you own by from the first very first time trust and a future thing that is already done here in example license and content so is trust okay so in terms of adoption we need nft collections to start using this technology so that they build trust and liability on their project so we get started with nfds we have a fully functional proof of concept it's minimal but i will demonstrate it to you we started minting an nfd this is our nft and it's displayed in openc the baseline is the fully metadata standards of openc but we added something [Music] so you might wreck it's not very visible but we added uh secret uh encrypted information that we stack in the nfd if you try to open it you get something like this which is not very useful but we created a new interface this is extremely minimal but pretend it's a new uh open c so it's full functional full functional so here is our nfd the same as in openc but there is more behind we uh this new protocol adds dynamism to the nfds so let's add a decryption query a key and boom we got uh our upgraded nft if you don't mind make an applause for the first data morphed into the world it's a natural lotto if you don't know this is an animal that makes a metamorphosis when it wants to grow or get stressed so an nft from now on can be packed with lots of encrypted secret information that can be unlocked if you feed it the right key and this unlocks lots of exciting potential yes we think there's great applicability for this sort of system with encryption in the financial industry think about creating features contracts that you could have on the blockchain that's totally uh not mev like minor extract extracted value possible possibilities um also maybe even another book and be great for financial institutions that want to have financial transactions data on on the blockchain uh where maybe you can keep it hidden from uh competitors so uh we think this is uh going to be if we build it out and we get support um hopefully from avi and others we can really build this out and change the world for the better well the last invitation this is an open source project will be released will be online for anyone that wants to join and make their own versions branches or whatever of these to use in whatever you can imagine you're welcome thank you so much you want to take the laptop [Applause] never mind this is mine my mistake next up we have kipi please welcome kp on stage [Applause] perfect hi so we're very excited to be here we're kipi i'm sure that everyone knows that one of our biggest fears for those in crypto and even those that are not in crypto is losing your private keys and losing access to all of your tokens look at this there's enough things going on in the market and we don't want people to have to worry about that and to this end we created kipi which is a serial knowledge private key recovery platform so we're going to show you this is a very hyper technical project but we don't want to bore you so we're going to be kind of fast in the encryption part because it's kind of it's kind of hard because the idea is like how can you manage your keys right but you're not going to give me your keys if you don't know me right so i have to show you that we can actually save them you know in a very good way so this is felipe and he's going to talk more about it hello everyone i'm felipe uh well you can see from this diagram it is a little bit complex but we'll see the main feature is that we'll use one id that can prove the personhood of every user once we know the personhood we can use it to encrypt the data the private key in this case um in such a manner that it is unique to every user so even if one key is in one segment a little vulnerable that's just one case and that's just one layer because we have several layers of security here after that we'll have a splitting of the key that that is we have that protagonity it is encrypted um and then we split it right so um well more diagram but we can see that we split the the key in and store it in the ipfs it is a public place but it is secure still because every piece is uncorrelated um when we do the retrieval process uh the retrieval process use zero knowledge proof such that um the the key isn't isn't necessary to be retrieved at all it's just necessary to be proven that it can be redriven right so no information is really unsafe cool so now we're going to show you how our initial nvp works uh so the idea was to make a product that was very useful you know very intuitive and uh you're able to connect with any of you know metamask wallet connect and then you can copy paste your wallet in your email and then you validate with uh worldcoin at the same time yeah if you can show us the demo so we verify if you're actually a person and this is what gets everything started um oh there you go don't worry about it so what gets everything started and then apa is going to explain you how what happens here in the back end thank you doris so um what we did felipe was talking to you guys about how we encrypt the key and then we split it in parts so the parts that the key is split into can be a random number and a random length and then we form an encrypted array which is eventually uploaded to ipfs and ipfs gives us back an address that represents each of the shards of the already encrypted key so it's a very safe way to store the shards so how is the user going to use this so let's say you don't remember your key and you want to retrieve it so what you do is that you prove that you are you let's say a world coin and then that sends the key over to the back end and in the back end that key allows for the back end to retrieve all the addresses for the shards that are stored in nft in in ipfs okay and then those shards are sent to the smart contract running on the menu blockchain in the back end and finally you can retrieve your key so it's uh like doris said it's a really technical problem but it's uh it's a highly technical solution that makes it really easy and really safe for you guys to store your keys we're going to show you how it works i think it's pretty cool so you see here there's a private key and there's a string which is the let's call it the the secret and so when we hit process keys so it's going to go here and then it's going to start doing all the encryption and so you see that there's already the shards and then what you're looking at is the shards returning address and then what we build out of that is an array of addresses that can't be linked to the user okay at least not in the front end and since we're running the smart contract from the mean of blockchain on the back end that lives safely in there and can permanently keep your keys safeguarded so and then this is what we store and it would be really hard for anybody to try and know what it is but we're talking technical details here yeah yeah so uh i know that felipe uh you were telling me about like how this could be hyper secure at some point so yeah so you can see that this is your private key now it is distributed all over the blockchain right um we can take that calculation and use something like for example the mina protocol that you can use uh zero knowledge proof um and then from these ten charts just get one certificate of proof uh that can be considered like a new private key a new representation of your ownership yeah but it is obfuscated right and then we can do do it all over again we can split it we can do all this process again and get another chart so it is like um distributing all the information of the ownership of all of us in the blockchain in such a way that it is not um necessary to be concentrated centralized in just one asset that is the private key right so that's when future work right in all the umbrella of application that this project can have anyways thank you very much guys this is kipi thank you congratulations all right next up we have key week on that side and up next is sellout to uh get ready here on on my left please welcome kiwi on stage [Applause] daphne and myself we built kiwi so [Music] [Applause] only last year there were three billion gamers playing online and we know this will continue to grow more and more because of metaverse ar and vr developments this will become a 1 trillion industry in only 8 years and we know that web3 has very exciting use cases from metaverse and for gaming but builders are having real issues they have a lack of quality and affordable 3d assets they have to look around in different platforms that they are not interoperable between them so if you buy something in unity you cannot use it on a real engine and that's a real pain for the builders and there's also like very expensive fees that they need to pay and this slows down the development of gains currently in the market there are different players tackling parts of this problem there are decentralized marketplaces where you can monetize your assets others that where you can display your work but there's none of them that can come together and bring a solution for this community so this is why we created kiwi kiwi means marketplace in maya and this is the nft marketplace for metaverse builders and game developers our goal is to empower creators to create high quality content to accelerate the game development and also to give some financial tools for the game devs and for the meta build builders and of course build more and better games for the three billion people that they're playing around one of the best features that we have that make us very different is the the part of the ownership with the nfts that they will have they will have also engine agnostics so no matter if you're developing unreal or unity or another like engines you can upload on our website there's the buy now pay later feature that you can acquire the assets with a credit for you there are insights to develop smarter content we have a social component and some rewards to keep the quality top of the platform hello um i did not plan this ahead okay hello um here is the amazing live demo that hopefully works on the first try so here we have the home page of our marketplace key week um and you can see that once you are launched into the home page you have a featured asset and you can preview 3d models which are uploaded on ipfs and minted on polygon so you can rotate around the 3d models and zoom in and out to preview them then if you scroll down you'll see some trending assets the most popular assets also if you go to the explore page you'll have more detailed assets more assets that you can scroll through as you can see we have a lot of them here there will also be a search and filter page which later on we will show we couldn't implement it in the two days but we will show how that looks and so let's see if we click view details for example um you'll see we have our model here which we can rotate it's a little finicky that's okay life is finicky sometimes um well you're supposed to be okay there we go you're supposed to be able to rotate it and then you can see all the details of this model the triangles the vertices very important information for game developers metaverse builders and basically what's cool about this is that this is linked to your social profile so for example if we click shannon which shannon is the amazing ui ux designer of our team you'll see that we have this creator profile and so now we assign a face to the person making the assets and you can follow them and be notified on all of their upcoming assets and this is using lens the lens protocol so you have your own lens account and it also uses world coin to authenticate that you're an actual person so that we don't get scammers uploading a ton of bad assets to our marketplace because we want to ensure we have high quality assets right um but back to this character let's say you like it and you want to buy the nft so this is an nft that you buy one cool feature we have several ways to to pay one cool feature is buy now pay later which exists in web 2 but not really in web 3 and the way it works is that if you don't have enough funds to pay for it now or you just want to try it and not pay the full price you can pay it in installments and this uses the superfluid api and once you mint the nft it starts that transaction with superfluid and also mints it on polygon and yeah so this is just the creator profile that you can create your profile and it's verified by world coin and yes i believe that's the end of my part next person [Applause] hello hello i don't know why this looks blurry but this is supposed to be our ui um so as you can see in the implementation there was some bugs so i just wanted to show off kind of what it could be um when we continue the project so here's the home page um this is kind of like the profile view my boy anakin here i hate sand 14. yeah so if i wanted to follow him i can go along and see like other creators that might be similar see what kind of assets that he's creating um i can also search so i can go buy filters and find results curated to exactly what i need in my project another important aspect is the community so you can search for all kinds of people not just anakin there's everyone has a profile on here you can follow them you can follow along in their journey as they're creating assets and contributing to the community if you want to check out more of our figma assets you can add this qr code hello so we created our tokens on polygon with a supply of 100 million and every time an accident acid has four or five stars it's rewarded with tokens this way we encourage uh people to contribute to the community and to have high quality assets so thank you so much to all of these amazing sponsors in conclusion key week will revolutionize the game development industry by empowering the builders [Applause] and we're doing this through tokenization community and engine agnostic assets so thank you all so much [Applause] congrats all right next up we have sellout and on deck emergency please welcome jack from sellout [Music] great hey everybody uh my name is jack i created sellout sellout is uh a react component library for bringing web to checkout experiences to web3 so uh essentially all a developer has to do is re uh uh to wrap their app or marketplace in uh the sellout provider and you have access to this great checkout experience from start to finish so let's dive into a quick demo here we've got a marketplace let's go ahead and buy one of these t-shirts so immediately when you click buy you're greeted with a great uh modal that everybody is used to from the web 2 checkout experience i took a lot of inspiration from rainbow kit which is a recent ux developer kit for connecting wallets to ethereum so this modal contains all of the order information that you need as well as promo codes or if you need to collect an address from the user to send them a physical item and all of this information once you click confirm payment is uploaded onto ipfs so let's go ahead and submit this transaction you can see it's for the correct amount and once we confirm the payment all of the order data is packaged up and we can view a receipt of the transaction on a new page on this hosted demo site but in the url is the ipfs hash so if you're a vendor you can have an ipfs hash in your order book for additional verifiability so you can send send the buyer the exact information on the order details uh all from ipfs the checkout experience also works with nfts so i deployed a custom um polygon contract on mumbai to mint this awesome eth mexico hacker badge so uh again the similar checkout experience is here all of the uh theming is customizable within the modal so um you can change uh different color schemes uh got any dark dark mode fans in the room um and uh let's go ahead and mint this nft and again all of those customizations are available via props to a single react component that you can place anywhere in your app so the developer experience for taking a uh an app from uh just a proof of concept marketplace to having actual marketplace functionality um is this much code you have product data you have a checkout modal that you can place anywhere and then you have a sellout provider that you wrap your app in and you've got checkout on web3 and it's a great experience so we've got a a a great readme as well so um feel free to check that out and that is sellout [Applause] congratulations next up emergence and on deck stacks please welcome immersions all right what's up y'all we are emergence um so at emergence we believe that the best way to onboard new new users into daos is through uh face-to-face interactions um so the problems that we identified are daos have a problem onboarding it's mostly through discord through asynchronous conversation it's hard to get metrics on dows and as well as documentation and so basically our approach is we incentivize dow members to interact with potential new dell members through token streaming in a basically a web3 version of zoom and then we get more people to join dows and they you know the cycle continues um and so we'll get right into the demo here so this is our home page we call this the dowry so each style is going to have their own smart contract which is has a combination of superfluid and semaphore logic and each style can hold their own treasury to give to the dow members and so that we just went into the east global uh dow and so this dow has nine rooms and we're going to join a room here in a second and start streaming with a user so basically we're gonna have um uh danilo over there is gonna be the dow member and then we're going to have a new user and simulate that experience um so right now you can type in your name and then you go into the the channel and i'll let danilo take it from here so the idea of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so the main purpose of our platform is to allow people to meet more online and especially in the decentralized communities we believe that if you create more spaces where people can connect more things can emerge that we couldn't even imagine so our our um that is a way to incentivize verified down members to receive super fluid tokens as they are participating in online meetings and we're using semaphore as identity layer and also a way to keep privacy from the users so that people don't know who are they meeting when they're meeting and they can keep their privacy and just allow people to know when when they want so how the that work is first you need to open a room uh so this room opens a session on a smart contract and you can only start to claim tokens when this room is open and there is a way to verify um people who are in the in the chat and also who is um claiming for this room session so as soon as the transaction goes through we will see that the room id view pop up here um in the meantime uh we're showing our handsome teammates that it's maybe the internet is a little bit laggy um so yeah so we're waiting a little bit for the for the transaction to go through and our main motive here is to yeah i think he left the room left me alone um we're still waiting for the transaction uh while we wait we want to also show another part of the dap right after the room gets the transaction goes through we will generate a proof and then start the transaction but on the meanwhile we want to show another page that is the admin page for the dowse admin where they can see all the the rooms and all the meetings that are happening without showing any data from the user so for example here there is room one that has this um purpose and this is a voting that every member can vote on the meeting uh without revealing who they are so this is an average vote of how the meeting was amount of token that was distributed on the meeting and some of the information and another cool feature that we have implemented is that for every meeting in the end we will use an artificial intelligence to generate a transcription of um yeah the meeting and this is a transcription of our demo that we that we created and the idea to generate a text transcription is that we can generate data um from meetings also keeping the users a little bit more private than compared to videos and audios the idea also is that later this transcription will be encrypted so only specific members or only through vote it could be accessed and besides the transcription he like my spelling is a little bit bad it should be down not though and besides the transcription uh this artificial intelligence also um calculates uh generates a sentiment of the of how the meeting was and also some possible topics that will help the dow to have some more data of what is happening on the ecosystem while keeping privacy of the users who are participating so it seems the room wasn't created maybe yeah the transaction is still pending so yeah i would just explain what would happen here uh we can show on the smart contract um basically what would happen here this smart contract it's outdated but when you create a room we're just basically creating a a session and saying that this is true and basically then we are generating a proof and sending the transaction to uh to request funds with the proof of the proof of that was generated by the same of our protocol that i am member of a specific group and here we are using the external nullifier to match the the room id so that each uh proof can only request fund once from each session even though it's anonymous we can have this um locking measure where um a member can only request fund ones from each um each room so yeah it is still pending um and the idea is that here it would generate the proof and then you would when you access the meeting it will close the session and at the same time it would close the streams from all the transactions so yeah thank you thank you i know uh it won't be a hackathon with that murphy's lock kicking in so i think you still got to see what this project was able to do and uh with that let's welcome our next team stacks [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hello my name is ian and i'm part of stacks uh what we built was a new social media platform uh we really wanted to tackle uh social media uh oftentimes when we scroll instagram we're bothered because every time we grow we see reels and from influencers that we don't even know uh we see a lot of sponsored content and the algorithm is bombarding us with content that we don't really know where it's coming from and so what we really want to what we really wanted to build was a new social media where um we we kind of wanted to focus on micro interactions with our friends our family and people that we really care about um and we wanted to create something that doesn't rely on an algorithm uh built on like artificial intelligence and so we built stacks it's built on top of lens protocol we use wallet connect and it's all on polygon so here's our app um i think the internet is pretty slow so i'll just switch tabs this is what the home page will look like so stacks are basically collections of content on lens and so right here you can see a stack it's called chrome so you can create your own topic called chrome solar power anything you wanted to create and you can start adding content to those stacks and the idea is that you can subscribe to stacks and then you'll get updates when people add to those stacks so instead of a machine learning algorithm curating your feed for you you actually follow feeds that are curated by real people and people that you care about so if we click in here you can see the something like different images that people have added to the stack called chrome and then if you wanted to you could add this to your own stack that you're part of and if we go back you can scroll through your home feed i think i mentioned this already but you can see stacks that people are creating and things that people you follow are contributing to and so you can also view profiles so this person has created chrome and architecture stacks and this is here's our new stack page so if you want to make a new stack you could call it something like lens create stack and this is this creates a new post on lens so if you're not familiar with lens it's a social media protocol and so this is a different implementation of lens uh someone else built a ui and you can see that this is a post and we just we've just displayed the post differently on our ui so we want to create like a new unique experience on the front end um yeah that was something to really focus on the ui um you want to talk about that more yes um so hi everyone i'm julia i was the designer for this project and um i'm going to just thank you um so yeah uh we weren't able to build like the full flow of the app so i just wanted to take us through like what the full like experience would look like so this is kind of like what the fully built out feed like we envisioned so um with friends and influences you would be able to see like po individual posts that your friends like reacted to um influences is more for like people like you're inspired by like designers you look up to etc um and you would also like be able to see their activity whenever they create a new stacks or like respond to an image um yeah and then like gen there's also like a general feed um so when you click like on on a stacks like this this board like this is kind of like what it would expand out to look like um so you could the idea was that you can create like a public board that anyone can add to or you can kind of like limit it um to so only a certain number of people like close friends can collaborate with it um yeah and then we kind of really wanted to focus on like minimal like ui that showcase the actual like work like of the creator so this is kind of like what um like when you kind of upload like a picture to a stack it would look like so you can either choose to um upload if you're like a creator you can choose to upload a picture like of your own creation as a collection on lens um or you can upload upload um something that's not your own like as a curation and we also wanted to hopefully expand to like use referral fees on lens and introduce a wave where you can like cap it so it can focus on kind of like curating the best quality content to the top um and yeah kind of continuing on to the end so once you kind of like upload it this is what it would look like and this is what the profile feed looks like so you can kind of see like all of the staxes that um a user has like curated um as well as like their influences um and yeah this is just a quick preview of like what the uploading process like would look like like as you're in the process of creating one um so yeah now i'm gonna hand it over to sheena and mia to talk about some uk yeah one of the things oh hi my name is sheena i am from florida i'm one of the developers on the team one of the use cases that we really wanted to showcase was fashion because a lot of the things now for fashion designers is to really showcase their designs and for someone else to not steal that design and for them to actually showcase that they were the first person to actually have that mock-up so for designers and creatives we wanted to create a platform that allows for them to monetize in the way that they see their art to be displayed right and with that um there's many there's many complaints out there sorry hi i'm mia from la with everything that they have said so far there have been many complaints all across instagram to make instagram instagram again there's actually this one influencer that has over 300 000 followers um that made a post viral to just want to see cute photos of their friends and it doesn't necessarily have to be influencers with a large following it could be for people that have you know like from zero to 100 or 200 influencers but with this we just want to create a social platform that is what people want and this is also shannon another designer in our team um like mia said i'm shannon i'm from miami and um i'm the visual uh designer for this project um as a content creator like you really get bogged down by um different companies not recognizing you for your work and we wanted to create an interface that didn't look so much like um instagram or pinterest um in their own unique ways so that new people uh new creators integrated into web3 could feasibly use this uh product um and uh the interface was made so that hopefully uh well people usually like look at something and three three or four seconds later their eyes glaze over and they don't want to look at it again so we were trying to create an interface for p where people wanted to stay on it and like look um at the content a little bit more and keep on the creative side thank you so much thank you guys [Music] congratulations stacks next up block community please welcome block community on stage and on deck will be eight points [Applause] hi everyone it's an honor to be here with so many awesome projects we don't have the most technology solution but we think that it's a solution for a real problem that we have every day so in a minute it's going to be sorry well let's start to to talk about the project we have a problem principle in mexico and i think in very countries in latin america maybe in europe or something that we live in gated communities when the other administration of the community that administrators one person of a little person and he had to receive the pace the monthly pace of the all the neighborhoods and and it's a difficult way to to do um we think that they put that in the blockchain that was transparency and we can do the traceability of the money and where it starts where the neighbor paid to the to the board of the management like where's it go the the money so there is no no ways to when neighbor pays his bills and is not there is a ticket from the the pay that he do sorry about this okay we're we're almost ready to go you already have a a very good intro not with a very good english but i do my best i'm sorry [Applause] that's right okay hi everyone i'm diego and let's talk a little bit about black community this is our team he is my brother a full stack dev paco trejo and i'm a project manager okay so just giving a little recap about paco mentioned and right now in mexico there are a lot of problems with close gated communities in which properties inside of them are owned by different people and these people not always share the same way of thinking right so even though each person has their own property inside these gated communities uh the management of specific areas could be difficult and must be taken care of by someone right like uh keeping security the maintenance the water and garbage collection etc but who is responsible for all this how does a community decide who is the most appropriate person to take care of these activities and who will handle the management fees paid by each property owner so like the model that that we're trying to offer via web3 and crypto is that community members who are the property owners can pay in a transparent way via a wallet and with crypto their management fees so a community administration will receive uh all this this uh money paid by the the property owners and they will be able to make expenses also in a transparency way in a transparent way all of these will be uh all these resources will be in a treasury wallet and that's why it will be all traceable right so basically what we built these days it's adapt for payments and traceability oriented to physical gated communities i'll try to to show what we built let's see if the the connection let me so it's a very basic app in which you can sign in and register your own property this is the interface block community you can save your new property uh with your wallet address and the to consult your your property fee that you'll be paying month by month there you can also consult what is your your monthly fee and the ability to to pay let's see if it's working already there you go so i'll try like if i was registered we are open to any designer can help us with that we are developers not designers so here i will be able to to register my property and also the the fee that i'll be paying in that way i already register my property i will i will only be able to do this if before someone let me write but because no one could register a property if they're not part of the community and also here i'll check my my monthly fee associated to my wallet address and i'll be able to pay directly in this platform also an nft will be minted month by month and and every year to show that i have i've already paid and giving a little bit more about how it works and only property owners will be able to make payments in the dap the funds will be received in a treasury wallet every payment will have an nft that work as a proof of payment any expense funds leaving the treasury wallet will be easily verifiable in the blockchain and traceable if you pay early you receive a management token and also if you pay late you you will have to buy that token directly from other token holders those who paid early to pay for the interest generated by your late payment here we want to create like a token mix that will work to keep a circular economic inside the communities and someone will have a benefit if they're paying early or they they're being a good neighbor and also who who pay late will have to pay more using those those tokens and our future plans create the tokenomics for the project utility token improv ui and find a wallet partner to make it accessible to anyone any community all around the world and that's it thank you guys thanks a lot congratulations and thank you all right next up is eat point in on decks paradise please welcome eatpoint on stage hello everyone we are at point and we are victor right there alex and i'm luis eduardo and we are the mobile first and point-of-sale application for ethereum and polygon ecosystem that brings together traditional finance with web3 through wallet connect so let's see if this works okay a very wise man once said so total cryptic market cap of just half a trillion that was 2017. what have we earned that and then he said how many unbanked people have we banked and actually if we take a look at the market cap that we had last year have you noticed any kind of improvements about them banks and about people rising and getting financial inclusion well in our latin american ecosystem not so much the region has very poor credit inclusion and digital banking numbers these are abysmal 45 percent of adults do not have any bank account that that means no digital anything to do anything 79 had no power out any type of credit from financial institutions and just 12 percent and saving any kind of money in any kind of account but we are in the region of magical realism and somehow we have great infrastructure on the cell phone and telecommunications site 73 i mean you go to the small pueblos everywhere and you find people even in the lowest poverty rates with a cell phone and that's 77.1 percent of gdp in the region and these numbers will keep on growing well miss ajami also the eighth foundation is actually looking at those numbers directly and well this slide is quite important because we have what is ecom revenue and point of sale revenue which is cash and credit card rights and that is well the difference between billions 525 billion till just a couple billions that we have there is quite remarkable and that's a great opportunity because digital wallets are projected to overtake great cars and cash by 2024 with some help there is a huge opportunity for an integration of traditional finance with web3 via mobile phones and point-of-sale systems so we came up with a solution that integrates wallet connect and polygon polygon with pos using usdc usdt and some other stablecoins and wallet connect which join us to this point of sale system to do any kind of transactions and sales so let's try this live stuff can you switch to the other laptop hello switch please all right there victor is a store clerk right and he's gonna sell his poncho so now alex wants to buy it but he has no cash so what does he do he gets his phone app that has a digital wallet and now what you see there is here so you just fill everything it may take a while so he hits pay and that's just a scan with rainbow wallet for example and by the way this is on matic minutes with real money and everything so [Applause] so he goes ahead he already had the confirmation and victory is waiting for his and there it is and he's gonna just give him his ticket no chad stuff and then he's gonna corroborate the transaction on mainnet [Applause] so that's mainnet that is everything from our side we are team at point thank you [Applause] that was absolutely incredible this deserves another round of applause a real live demo of a payment on mainnet this is incredible all right next up we have spiritus and then three more demos to go and then we'll get into the talk and the prizes so please welcome spirit us on stage [Music] okay everybody uh i think my laptop is currently dying oh yeah it seems to be a little bit frozen at the moment i guess it's frozen yeah we can just start talking and hope that my laptop figures things out um yeah my name is ilan i'm from australia i had one hour of sleep last night it's uh nice to meet you all and i am one half of spiritus so we believe that you know in the opening ceremony we spoke about onboarding the next billion people to web3 and i think something that we have a responsibility to do as developers is to not just build developer tooling which still has a whole you know there's a whole range of improvements we can make it's also to build things that help people that aren't technically experienced build experience create and get involved not only that but specifically for nfts which is what we're building for we think that we want more interesting collections you know we don't just want the next pixelated artificial aardvark alliance which i mean we will buy we want something more interesting which is why we built spiritus we wanted to build a dynamic nfc base layer yeah there's a few pain points in the development ecosystem right now the asset generation process is a bit of an iterative slog usually the artist is creating the layers they're sending you the layers and dropbox you're downloading it to your local computer generating the assets and repeat ad nauseum so it would be nice if you had one place where you had all of your layers you could generate everything you want in one place another thing is that without the layers the way the current ecosystem works is there's not a ton of collaboration and creativity especially with the community especially with cco projects cco talks a lot about remix and projects and derivatives and community involvement and a lot of projects that claim to be cco don't do a lot to really you know talk about their cco morals and their their principles so it would be nice if you had one place where you could have all of your layers you had a lot you could remix and do all that kind of stuff and then um that's less lastly the thing is a lot of the times the nfts these days the most important thing that people really look for is the image itself and the metadata is often looked at as an afterthought whereas it doesn't make a lot of sense we think it should be metadata driven because the metadata is what's creating asset itself it's what's giving you the token value so creating a paradigm that allows you to generate generate art generate assets from the metadata itself as opposed to just generating the metadata alongside the art beautiful and i think my laptop is now working so good i'll briefly talk through i guess what our tech stack is what we're trying to build and then i'll give you a live demo it's also live in production and i'll share the url at the end of this so you know in in accordance with what we've spoken about we are building on polygon because we think dynamic nfts almost necessarily have to use a layer 2 if they want to have the rate of transactions to keep things fresh continually update you're thinking of video games for example we host all of our layers and we'll get into that later and images with ipfs using nfc storage we also built an example contract with tableland because we think it's an exciting new way to store your data while still having on-chain write access but public read access to these sql tables everywhere we use wallet connect v2 to sign into our app because we think that you know from a developer's standpoint there's a lot of benefit in having multi-chain instantiation just right off the bat rather than having to change different provided to a different network every time you want to look at a different connection and yeah nft storage as i spoke about so i reckon it's demo time i hope it works all right so this is one example of one use case a user could come onto our platform they could connect with wall connect to enable interchange operability on the chain interoperability so we're signing here and as you can see we're connecting to both polygon mumbai and ethereum mainnet at the same time which is just a nice sort of layer of abstraction because someone not that technically knowledgeable might not know that there's a difference between a collection on polygon versus mainnet versus optimism this allows us to handle that all for them now for a platform that should be able to remix layers and create new assets all this kind of stuff you don't want to be restricted to one chain specifically so having wall connect really uh powers us to do that yeah and the our app really the core of our product is the server itself our app is kind of half a an example of what someone could build using our server and also half an example of a public good as we'll get to later on we're going to support the ability for anyone to come in add a collection that supports various interfaces and play around so i'm going to sign a message an example of what a consumer of our server might want to do is you know have some sort of authentication using wallet connect v2 signing we've signed now it's time to put in a contract address so we are using the nouns contract um it's actually interesting as we spoke about before often the image is really all that matters for nfcs nowadays nouns don't actually have any attributes so we've had to hard code them ourselves um oh that is not the contract address because it is not copying let me just get it quickly noun's down thank you um i'll just grab it quickly because my vs code is not not very happy with me right now so what i'm going to do is i'm going to input the contract address here and what we've done is we've uploaded all of the layers to ipfs and we've exposed the layers uri on the contract so that we can rip from the contract and just instantiate sort of all the layers and have it in this nice easy to use app let me just get the nouns down contract i don't have it off the top of my head oh go on openc don't rug me now as you have many times in the past all right let me grab the contract address cool so we'll put this into here it's going to hit us over see if we have it supported which apparently we don't okay um can't fix that at the moment um but yeah i can show you i'll put up a quick video of what it was meant to look like um my laptop makes it that that far so i'll skip to the end if my laptop allows it so yeah after you've instantiated the contract what we basically have is this nice easy to use thing where you can change the metadata of an nft and what our server will do in the background is it'll generate a new image on the fly upload it to ipfs and then pass you this then you see id no idea no i think my computer barely has visuals it's done yeah um well this is not quite unfortunate so we actually know that we used uh we use table land as one of our sponsors as one of the technologies that we're using so what's nice about table land when we're talking about metadata driven development is we could do something oh it looks like we're live yeah so this is um the this is the video so as you can see here we've loaded in all the layers and then now you can basically go through them and generate your own nft on the fly and our server every time you change a trait is going to generate a new image it's going to pin that to ipfs and then it's going to yeah as i said i don't think my computer has a visual but yeah this sort of gets the idea um and i think what we're more interested in i guess is what we want to build on top of this you know we want to create a platform where anyone whether you're a developer and you want to interact with our server directly through the apis you're an artist you want to upload layers via our ui and then create collections create individual nfts possibly have a proxy contract to actually deploy yourself or you're just a member of a community and you want to play around you know it's a cco project you want to play around you can go in here you can create nfts we'll pin it for you we'll give you the cid and then you have everything you need without having to spin up all the infrastructure yourself yeah that's pretty much it appreciate it yeah thanks for being with me thank you spiritus i know sometimes these things happen but we'll uh we'll add the video to your showcase if it's not there already all right next up is ethereum uncensored please welcome at the airman center on space [Applause] hello everyone first of all thank you for this amazing opportunity we are very very honored to be here and first i want to introduce to you uh the amazing team here of the ethereum and censored my name is brissia hello [Music] [Applause] and i am nico and i'm anna and and today we've seen amazing projects but none of them work if the base layer ethereum doesn't remain censorship resistant so that's why we are here ethereum sensor that can change and save the future of ethereum and the whole ecosystem something that can be denied is the possibility of a chain suffering an attack historically we have witnessed many censorship attempts indicating a probability that they could also occur within the ethereum network but what's the problem there is no any tracking system that store information about the orphan blocks these blocks can be malicious and are accidentally or intentionally taken out out of the chain currently it's very difficult to correlate the information about them there's no data that makes us this possible so we can't find out if there's a malicious block but we have a solution for this a public good tool for the ethereum community that informs when an orphan blog appears and may have been intentionally censored and allows the community to take action against these intentional attacks and avoid censorship our product is a user-friendly simple and real-time dashboard that allows the community to make a correlation between the orphan blocks what happens if many of the orphan blocks are from the same validator maybe that is an attack an ethereum unconsensual will inform you will inform the community so the most important thing here is for normal users to be able to easily identify possible censorship attempts so for this matter we develop a web app that will show all the information regarding orphan blocks users will be able to see all the latest orphan blocks but they also will be able to see three different leaderboards such as most sensor protocols most censored individuals and most answering validators on another order of things users are also able to see the transactions that were contained on that orphan block but also see information about that in bold validator so once blocks actually contain real and relevant information we're going to crunch that data to be as certain as possible about suspected censorship attempts the web app interacts with our backend which is a rest api and queries for different data but what data it can be orphan blocks or the transactions included in these orphan blocks and the backend also is responsible to track the transactions in the orphan logs and analyze them like the transactions is coming from which users the trans transactions are from which protocols and the transactions are for what else can be censored we cannot allow sensors we cannot allow reaching the protocols we cannot allow coding to be crime [Applause] yes but how does it work our back end runs periodically to detect new created blocks from the validators and creates logs for for the database and there are different parts in the our database we store the blocks if it's orphaned and include the transactions in that block so that we can analyze the orphan blocks and their validators and the transactions and we will be able to analyze possible censorships for users for protocols and malicious validators that's how the app works great so okay what are our goals for like this project i mean like first of all we have we have to like know that we're all here building an equine because of the censorship resistance and that it's a realization it offers so having a tool like this that is going to inform the community about possible censorship to cats it's like it's based of the values that we're aiming to fulfill in equilibrium so we're gonna have this solution ready before we actually need it and why well like as you can tell we didn't apply for any of the sponsors like we're only applying for this public ground made for aetherium so we do believe it's like super important to like for the whole community to unite and think about these issues and actually build solutions towards them so as for a near future we want to improve the ux and the ui of our app then once the merge actually happens data will be more widely available for everyone and we will be able to improve our analysis once that happens we need to call for action within the community for the data providers to focus more on this important topic with better information sources we can actually improve our parent finding analysis to find attacks as they are happening and finally as the final step we'd like to have a telegram and twitter bot that could alert users about ongoing or past attacks thank you all very much and let's all save ethereum together [Applause] and i will make one more call for data providers in beacon chain there is no data provider provides orphan blocks data in beacon chain for example infra alchemian all of the data providers should improve that and one more call for the community we have proposed devcon 8 for istanbul please look our proposal and we will love to see a terrible community in istanbul thank you [Applause] congratulations ethereum uncensored all right next up is our second last demo for today and that is project reunited please welcome them on stage [Applause] [Music] thank you thank you thanks everyone there's been so many great projects today i'm so proud to be here with you all um and with all these great projects so today mario and i let me introduce the team very quickly here is mario hi he's i don't speak english my english is very bad but i can try communicate my my own idea and he's the mastermind behind this um i'm just helping mastermind and i'm very nice and kind heart [Applause] and then here here's diego uh that is our uh he's going to help us with the demo um so we are reunited and we want to alleviate pain worldwide um so public goods are good man um go to next thank you so let's talk about the problem it's a problem that many of you especially here in mexico might feel very close to the flesh missing people shatters lives missing people shatters family and communities where are these missing people why why is this happening wars conflicts human rights abuses natural disasters organized crime traffic drug violence migration and other similar issues worldwide millions have loved ones that left their home one day and never came back for many losing a loved one is the most painful experience that they have lived i'm sure a lot of you can relate to that but not knowing what happened to a loved one that's some variable so this project is inspired and dedicated to those who are desperately looking for their loved ones for answers and for relief based on official stats during this hackathon 78 people might have gone missing in mexico alone so let's talk about solutions a decentralized system to enable anyone to post missing people and match them with found people let's dig into the details so what are the key benefits of the of the approach that we are uh suggesting first inclusivity it's going to be available worldwide and it's going to be easy to use it only needs an email and a password two is the centralized a peer-to-peer database that resolves the lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics in missing people worldwide 3 is immutable this database can't be tampered by any government or other parties thanks so here's how the process works on the one side you have the seeker the person that lost a loved one they access the information and uploads data rather easily they only need their email and their password and uploading the missing person's photo and personal data the data is stored in ipfs and then it is this file that is stored in ipfs is stored on polygon as an nft mario will discuss the details a little bit more um in depth on the other side you have the founder the founder that that find a person that is potentially missing only needs to frame the potential missing person's face in the camera using the app um uh to match to to find a match and so if this person is is in in our uh on the nfts there will be a match so who are the seekers the seekers are mothers our fathers our siblings our partners and are all those looking for their loved ones or missing people and there is a good question that many people have asked us who are the founders and the founders we believe that our non-profits that are already working on the on the issue they are public servants they are workers interacting with potential missing people and they are other seekers because no one can understand and empathize the pain of a seeker more than another seeker what are the use cases first vulnerable communities helping kids migrants disabled victims of traffic and vulnerable people get back home and reunite to their loved ones unrecognized deceased unfortunately in many cases people that are missing might be deaf but still you can help families get certainty closure and reunite with the remains of their missing loved ones and later on it can even be used for different approaches like missing pets so here's a little bit of the tech stack the custodial wallet structure is what allows uh any user to access the platform easily with only an email and a password um since it's not a financial use case it it doesn't it's not that um significant that that the the wallet is custodial ipfs we use it to store biometric data and the personal data securely and call it when comparing is needed we use a 721 smart contract on polygon to store the ipfs data as an nft on the polygon blockchain and we use a phase comparison ai to compare the photos stored on ipvfs with the full transcaption from the devices of the founders uh and yeah well this is these are kind of like the main um lines of competition that we were in we use ipfs uh we believe i mean democratizing access to data and justice access to justice it's a human right then it's a public good and we're super happy to be uh entering into that with polygon and uh we want to also make user onboarding super easy and that's why we are allowing people that are non-tech non-tech people to access this system only with their email and their password and uh i think now we're ready for the okay yeah i'm going to help translate it we have uh we're going to make an example with a pilot a mexican f1 pilot czecho perez this is the this is the side like when when a person is is a seeker like in this case mario will be the person that is seeking for czecho perez custody wallet interacts with with the node the polygon with the polygon node and with that we're going to mean the nft aggregate this is also live on maintenance by the way [Music] the email and it right now it's not allowing uh that if you have one email uh to to mint another one so that's the idea of the operation smart contract here's the nft minted on the smart contract so 20 seconds ago there was this new uh case of a missing person that was registered and now we're going to see the next process uh when a founder meets find a person that might be missing we have a model of a tensorflow in a microservice [Music] it splits the face in four sections i did compress it against the data from the nfts that it's in the on the ipfs this then when it when it finally matches with a person from the database it's going to do the match and report the person that is missing [Applause] thank you very much for all the support that he has given us [Music] he is a dev but i i'm also in his sentiment we love the amazing opportunities that blockchain might bring blockchain [Applause] mexico we believe that right now we need to create solutions for real people uh in real cases viva mexico that was absolutely wonderful please give them a big round of applause once more time please all right now it's time for our last demo for today please welcome project woosh all right guys hello we're very happy to be here at youth mexico um i'm paige i'm here with my team uh roy uh temo santiago and king and we are whoosh um so yeah we'll just jump into it so there's a lot of applications that are being built today for existing web3 users and that's amazing but what about people who are not familiar private keys ethereum even maybe or um you know custodial non-custodial wallets they don't know what that means so we decided to create woosh which is a peer-to-peer payment system built to onboard the next billion users of web3 so our goal for creating this application was to make it as simple as possible so you can see with the onboarding all you have to do is enter in an email so on the back end what we're using is magic link and that's actually creating the ethereum address for us and we'll be using two different tools magiclink and uh worldcoin for the authentication and login process so as you can see we're logging in right now with magiclink and if everything goes to plan this should take us to uh we'll see worldcoin um we're using worldcoin to make sure that the person who is signing up is indeed a real person and not a bot um i have had personal experiences using uh different cache apps where there are bots i'm getting strange requests things like that we don't want that we want a platform we're for real people and for everyone so you can see we've gotten to the world coin that's good um we're gonna go ahead and verify this stuff will only be necessary if you're signing up for the first time so we'll give that a go all right well while we're reading on that so something that's um interesting about this application is that we're actually only storing the world coin ipa or sorry the world i the ip world sorry the world i id hash there we go the world id hash and the magic link ethereum address on the back end and then we're creating that correlation to um authenticate the user it's verifying looks like we got our identity confirmed so we'll move on to where we're going to be creating the um username so i'll pass that off to temo yeah so basically for this part of the technology we integrated lens because we have found that we have found that uh users needs to use tools that have been using for a long time in in the web 2 world the idea and our idea is to bring people who is not taking as we probably are and they just are already used to social applications like twitter or something like that so our idea is use and leverage the technology of lens to for example create contacts and actually create a profile that you can find to request for money or share money as well this also helps with the user experience because if you've ever sent um you know crypto to an ethereum address or any address um it can be quite long so sending it quickly to a username makes it a lot easier for the user yeah so our goal with this app was to have a one second a very simple user experience so that anyone regardless of their knowledge of web3 can use this app so we try to keep it very familiar there's two main call to actions which is request money and send money so i'll walk you through first sending money okay it's a very familiar experience where you just like type in the number that you want to send and here as you can see we have credits okay you can't see that well but it says you have five credits left and this is how we're handling gas instead of explaining to the to new web 3 users how gas works we're just calling it credits and one one credit equals one transaction in wish so next then you select your contact this account is new so there's no contacts but pretty much click next and here you have the option to add a message let's say you're paying for last night's dinner or sending a birthday gift um and you also require a pin so that not everyone who has access to your phone can just like send money and that's sent so we basically bring the concept of creates to the web to users because here everybody knows what gas is everybody knows what oracles are and what prices how can can rapidly change but common users they do not know that and they shouldn't have to know that in order to use the application so we have come up with this concept of credits which in the end is basically just matic because we have decided to use polygon as a as a chain so in the end we just make some conversions to show the user what the amount of magic is going to be in the end for them so they can understand easily how they can make transactions in the application yeah so the second feature the second main call to action is request money so when you request money it's you you don't require you don't require credits for this since it's just a message you set the amount select the user and here you can either send a link if the user isn't doesn't use this app or you send a request if they are a user um you just requested and let's say that they already paid you here you could see that the user just sent you 50 and said happy birthday you could send thanks and optionally write a message also one cool feature that we added with avi was that the money that you have saved here you can simply toggle the switch and you start earning yield um ken could talk more about that so the underlying asset is uh is die in this case and that's that's with a switch of that um that does with that toggle you are able to stake your die deposit your die land your die on ave and generate yield um basically uh the way we uh designed this very simple is basically to onboard all the new people in victory because a lot of people constantly really hate the common banks around the world so it's not a secret basically are all the banks around the world doesn't matter it's about you so i think uh with rehab and amazing things just look around there that's amazing so basically we want everyone uh can use all the wit3 products without no nothing without nothing about knowledge about v3 so basically we want to be friendly efficient different of the other wallets because other wallets has something like metamask wallet connect rainbow it's it's sometimes going to be so really really confused so this is this have an interface very very intuitive easy to use so sorry so basically if we we we want to implement this in in this part of latin because all the people need to enter to victory to be complete owner of their assets of their money and completely all the things that we free has so that's it i have to say one last thing so actually two but the first is if you have an idea i think we are actually in life so if you have an idea and you think you can do a lot of things for a lot of people you can chase it your dreams follow it um don't stop one day it's going to happen so i'm going i'm not going to talk more about me but if you can dream it you can make it so the other thing uh someone knows uh this uh vitalik uh we have a present for you come [Applause] welcome to mexico that's it my name is araujo and we we are hush [Applause] [Music] all right well those are our two 12 amazing demos so please give a big round of applause to all 12 of these finalists one more time [Applause] and now for the part that all i've been waiting for i think the most amazing thing about the last 12 demos was that so many people worked on so many incredible problems that are not only just important to them but also to all of us around the world and uh and it's just great to see not only that they became from ideas to conception but also that they all want to continue working on it and so many of them are already ready to be used right now uh that is an incredible thing that i don't think i've seen in any other city so i want to give a big round of applause to everybody here who made all these amazing projects and to kind of continue this trend i think we're really doubling down on being able to focus on interesting important problems all right before we get to the prizes when i make sure that we have a chance to take a photo for all of us that are here so i'm going to ask is for everybody to just stand up and look over there we'll just take a quick photo for everybody on that side just come fill in this row and it'll ask vitalik and i have to come on stage just so we can have you up in the center and we'll just take a quick photo [Music] [Applause] all right um we'll just yeah all right are you all ready for the fun part so the next 10 minutes is going to be a lot of clapping all right there's a hundred fifty thousand dollars in prizes being given away so let's get started first up ave grand style first prize goes to shortstop for fifty five hundred dollars sticky
