hi everybody so sorry about that delay we're having a little bit of some technical issues but we're here now everything's worked out um and yeah thank you so much for your patience uh this is the deploying on scale for gasless and faster transactions workshop um here we have dima from skill um who's going to be leading this workshop and if you guys have any questions throughout the meeting feel free to pop them in the chat and he'll get to them um as soon as possible thank you again and dima whenever you're ready yeah tell me guys hello hello guys uh do you see my screen if yes then thumbs up hey dima yeah we see a screen yeah okay great so sorry for delay my name is dima here is celine we are from scale and we are welcoming you on our scale workshop so let's begin sorry so we are welcome here on our on our workshop and scale what is scale scale is an ethereum native multi-blockchain network that is fully compatible with wholesaling this whole is called tools that are working with ethereum like web 3gs like remix like other stuff to offer to uh open zeppelin and etc so what are the main features of the scale it's fast evm execution it's contract deployment last control equipment transaction is like working very fast it is decentralized file storage that allows you to store your file right on the blockchain it is in the chain transfers that allow you to swap tokens between chain and the main net and between chains yeah so and what we are providing to you on this hackathon so every team that building on scale is claiming to could get some skills back and for this you just need to sign up the form on our site uh saline can send it to to zoom i'm gonna send it to the chat yeah so you can you just need to sign up and you will get some some skill swap it's it's really cool some t-shirts or other stuff you will like it and especially what is useful for the app developers you can get a mentor like that will help you with your project with integrating your with integrating scale into your project and the main thing that is maybe most of you is wanted to hear its scale prices it's 12 12 000 dollars in scale and it it will be splitted between the teams and how it will be split it i will tell in the ending of the meeting so keep watching and the url that you will know everything about scale and about skill prices let's go next and let's talk about uh scale and how you can use it how you will set up and work with it and some cool features that scale allows to you to block this to begin with let's start from the scale setup and run because the guys that are connected to this meeting i hope i really hope that we'll use it and we'll get some prizes and some t-shirts yeah so to get some t-shirts you firstly should uh gets this sdk the software development kit for working with scale so to get access to your skills the car here and get some t-shirts you should go to this link and and get some and sign up and to get your own ema is the key and when you get it then you will ask yourself how how we can use it and the usage is pretty simple let's go [Music] let's go to the site and get get the information so every information about setup about running about uh examples and other stuff can be found on this website in my i a sdk so let's get started with me with myself i already i'll already clone the rebel and do this stuff from the from the lead from the list because the installation script but it's not so it's not so complicated firstly you should get clone as a wrapper to your laptop then you should create the 10 file let's check out how it looks like so here it is you just need to set two keys two keys from sdk private key and test private key and this address this addresses that is for these keys so that's everything that you need to add to the dotted dot env file to run our sdk the next step is to run the command run sdk and it's take some extra minutes so i just run it a few few minutes ago and it's it will download all on useful stuff for a year for your work and deployed as a useful contract it's for imei for interacting with interchange messaging agent yeah so right now i've already run in my sdk on my laptop and it will you can check whether it works just to type in docker in ps so if it works you will see the three docker containers like say i made the cab itself or truffle ganache ganache that is like the main net but and you will interact with a minute on the real chain on the pro scheme but for sdk we are using like ganache and there is another container range next that i will told you a little bit later about some cool stuff with this container but for now it allows you to get access to the s chain right from the right buys such useful in such useful way you just need to connect your localhost slash scheme and then you will get access to the sgm for example i'm using guest get attached attach and it works so [Music] that's how it setting up it's how it install installed on your laptop and then we can check we can connect metamask to it to work with with your assets right now i i have created metama i have created some gpr pairs that i have passed to the dot env file [Music] you can these two key pairs are already in my metamask account it's like in the workshop exchange and workshop three don't ask me why because workshop's free so the workshop exchange is a account that is owner of the chain like the blockchain and if you wanted to deploy something you will use this account so right now let's check let's check transactions let's check deployment contracts and to begin with let's send some some ath from one account to another account just through meter mask it's already it's already connected to the network for pre to connect from metamask you just need to go to settings networks and put this put these credentials into the new network so workshopping is the key rpc like i showed it to you before and chain id is static like seven four five six five so and after this you will connect to the meter mask to the to the metamask to the ima sdk so we already connected and let's transfer some tokens from one account to another account okay i'm so rich let's let's send some extra money yeah so now i'm sending into the incisors blockchain they have two accounts and transferring some ath from one account to another account and yeah here it is so the transaction is already confirmed and that's it you have the confirmed transaction just in a few seconds let's go further and let's go to the contract deployment so i'm using for my internal development i'm using remix you could use truffle or web 3gs as you wish every every stuff that is working with ethereum is will also work with uh s chain because s chain is fully serum compatible so but let's take remix and try to deploy some contracts on this chain to work with remix you just need to in take your meta mask inside to it inject it to web3 and let's deploy something from the remix [Music] okay let's choose some test contract compile and let's deploy it yes so we are deploying it to scales from metamask yes so the contract is deployed and it's so fast as you can see uh also let's let's call some transaction on this contract and check whether it will be so fast as constant deployment uh meta mask confirm and here here you are the transaction is mined and confirmed so let's take a look here it's the numbers that we sent to store so as you can see the deployment of the contracts the transactions the sending of eth the interaction with contracts going in very fast way so you will you you can set up the sdk and try it by yourself and but another scale exchange is not have some scale also have some really interesting stuff let's go further choose to the next and the next point is interchange transfer so for interchange interchange transfer is we are calling him i'm a interchange messaging agent that is bridge between the mainland the chain and others chain and other chains so you can use this i may just buy the to start to start developing to start developing from this chain messaging agent if you wanted to send some tokens or something else you just need to use this ima gs lib it's really useful it's very easy to understand and it's really fast so uh for foreign chain messaging agent we could we could swap we could send the tokens efc to win 20 you see 7 21 here's t 11 55 so you can so you can send them all yeah so let's take a look onto the [Music] ima js library you can find the documentation on the on our docs and everything that you needed is already here about documentation about how to install it inside into your project how to connect to chains how to request uh how to work with it from javascript code from node.js and also we have some code snippets and that i will show to you so i already we have some snippets on our docs portal you can take one one of them and check how it works uh i have taken one it's it is javascript it's that is used how image.js library and let's take a look how it looks so this script is sending is standing on ath from the main net to the s chain and then after this we will send from the s chain to the magnet again so as you can see the firstly we are like uh moving our balance on this chain from zero to two to zero 0 0.0 to 0 and after this we send this easy back to the main net so you can use it you can use it on the main when you go to the m2s transfer you are transferring it to the s chain and you can use it inside the s chain like working with it like the symptoms like the common talking and so on and so on the same way is working for uh erc20 xc721 token and lc1155 so you can use it you can check it it's and it's fully on the blockchain it is fully secure let's go next and what we have next it is [Music] it is decentralized file storage so it's our feature that allows you to store file right on the blockchain and [Music] we also provide the interface to get the files from the from this from the blockchain storage right by the common url so the old docks for file storage you can find on our website like like this or this is the full overview of file storage but when you will developing stuff you definitely will use a file storage js lib it is npm package that is working that is using to interact in these [Music] with the file storage through javascript interface and here is the whole stuff the whole documentation about it you just need to import it inside your project and upload some files download some files you can do everything you want like the common file system you can create files delete files create directories delete directories you can get information meta information about files and so on and so on so let's take a look on the file storage so i i run ui for file search it uses a faster gs library and you can unders network repository organization repository scale demo file search if you wish you can ask me i will send the link also link in sense so i already run it onto my laptop and let's choose a file that we will upload okay so the uploading is do you know when you have a second can you explain the difference between main chain and the s chain the scale chain yeah while the file is uploading to the file search and which oh it's already it's already on the file search so what about my main chain and now blockchains so our genes as i said previously we are like multiple blockchains we have multi multi-chain solution we have a lot of s chains each of the chain contains 16 nodes and each of them are connecting to each other and we are using like consensus algorithms distributed key generation and the bls signature to protect everything to sign the messages to sign the transactions and check the check the validity of the system and because of this now we have uh very fast transactions as you see transactions deployment contracts are working in a few seconds [Music] that's because of our protection our security and our infrastructure our architecture so there are a lot of such teams on the scale network you will use your own chain that you will spin up on your laptop but the realest chains we already have jeans on the main net contains 16 knots yeah and it's already working so let's go back to the file storage now we are done we are uploading it into this s chain and you can delete it but let's take a look what the file is and how can we get it yeah i just call it like the simple website just from the url and get the file so to get the file from the file storage you can just pass the simple link into your browser or you can get this you can interact with this url inside your application and so on and so on but the main thing that you can easily get access and unlike the simple file on the centralized network but this file is on the sg on the decentralized network so it's like the blog so huge okay so you can also delete it let's delete it and now yeah now you cannot get access to this file because it is deleted all right so let's go further and all stuff as i said you can find on our docs portal on our scale file storage and file storage.js and export context okay and as i see there are a lot of people on this zoom configuration you can get some mentors for your project when you will sign up our phone that will help you to to interact with scale to spin up if you will have some some strange things so you will have some problems you can ask them or you can ask the sub our support team is a scale chat on the discord you can get also you can just type the scale.chat and you will be redirected to this our discord channel where we can where we can help you and we will give you support and let's get to the most interesting part for you is skill prices and how how it will be on for ath global so we are providing some prices the main price it costs three thousand dollars of scale and the others once it's kilimanjaro price the price number three and it will be cost for you it will it will [Music] it will give you two thousand dollars of scale also we have a special nft price for the project that will be implemented our nft uh our scale solution is nft you can i will make you some tip you can use the file storage and save the nft inside file storage and get this file storage bin to get the link to the nft yeah you are welcome and you will get the price you can you will get two thousand five hundred dollars of scale if you will do this and there is one extra price for integration of scale inside your project it will because it will work 2 so that's it i hope you will be interested in this prize in our technology in our code features and just register register on our website get ime sdk and start working with it it's really easy and it's really interesting and have a lot of features and you can get some money for this okay so that's it for me yeah saline um yeah we have a question from lyle or leel sorry i'm not sure how to pronounce exactly your name but um it was asking about the benefits of going through a multi-chain approach like scale uh vs like uh vs other approaches and avalanche is also doing that so if you want to if you want to explain that also jump in yeah so this is the main benefits as you as you saw it's the time of the transaction confirmation it's like very very fast now it's like few seconds and the contract deployment is making in seconds but for what about security we algorithms and maps for protecting our for protecting our customers yeah this is bls dkg consensus algorithm that is working on the back end of this chain all this stuff provides us with a good security and it's really worth it yeah thanks yeah and also um just as more people are getting on-boarded to um a lot of like projects or just using crypto more we are um having a solution that's you know that you can expand and have you chain where you don't have to share with a lot of like people is [Music] sorry to interrupt can everybody hear me okay yeah yeah yes i can hear you um unfortunately we do have another workshop that is coming up shortly and i have to cut this one off um but i'd really love to encourage everyone to continue this conversation in the scale sponsor discord channel and yeah thank you so much uh dima and celine for this workshop i know it wasn't easy getting everything situated but everything seemed to run smooth at the end we really appreciate your hard work and dedication i do want to encourage everyone to also head over to the other workshop that is happening right now which is sublime um and yeah thank you so much for this great workshop again and yeah find everybody on discord have a really great day everybody okay bye
