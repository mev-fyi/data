foreign [Music] so without further Ado I'd like to bring on Sarah to talk about what the fem is and how it works and what's next and everything else you need to know about the Falcon Virtual Machine so please welcome Sarah thank you Karthik um hey everyone good to meet all of you um darling in over here from East Seoul um so if any of you are here in Easton and you're staying up uh to watch this you know welcome welcome hi um also hi to everyone from around the wall um I think we've seen each other probably a few times now if you've been following the eve Global hackathons uh my team uh is a is a developer Advocate team for fbm the Falcon Virtual Machine and we've been to multiple if Global um hackathons now um Denver was a really big one that just went by and we'll be in Paris as well so looking forward to meet all of you um I thought through today for hack fs and we're super excited for hack FS because it is the first hackathon that fbm is going into that combines like with all the other um protocol Labs teams that you know have provided great environment products and putting it all together in a hackathon so uh we've been holding fbm specific hackathons for a while now and we've been doing a lot of these tutorials and documentations and presentations and I was thinking you know what's kind of new that we can share um I think we've come to a point where we actually launched um two months two and a half months ago now and a lot of things have progressed since then um there's a lot of new things that we well very quickly shipped um right after launch where we realized like these are things that developers are asking for and we also have a lot of more a lot more new things coming up as well so it kind of feels like we're going right into our next phase and you know super excited to be able to share that with everyone yeah so I'll cover today Falcon Virtual Machine what why and what next um I might be a little bit more summarized on the what and the why just because we've gone through that uh with a few presentations and we have resources to share that with you so I'm going to spend a little bit more time on what's coming up next and get everyone really excited on what they can build with us for the next month thank you oh also a quick shout out um if you have not followed us yet do follow us on the fbm dev Twitter account we give updates like my teammate Mattis has been amazing in building out my socials and he gets a lot of great updates about our product as we go along so stay tuned there um he's also doing interviews with hackers on site so really really fun stuff and we have a twitch stream which is the full Builder stream stream so just a shout out there every Thursday um except for doing like a large hackathon like that where everyone is in the middle of the hackathon workshops but every Thursday we do try to keep to a schedule where we live demo and break things um well mostly it's me breaking and net fixing but you can see us try out new things and bring on new partners and hackers as well and you know if you sum it for the hackathon you could also be one of the guests for the session cool so I'm going to cover what the fbm is um I've also added a link over there I know it's a little bit uh summarized but let me run through it and I also have a QR code over there if you want to go deep dive into a little bit more of an explanation um for a talk that I did at East Tokyo recently on what the fvm is so um I have been getting a lot of questions from developers like can you clarify what the fbm actually is um so I thought to put out some key points here that we have been answering to developers so far and I hope this really helps to clarify um it for everyone so the fbm is a runtime environment for smart contracts on Falcon um it sits on top of the Falcon Network it is a feature of the Falcon Network it is not a separate product on its own it is a layer one on top of Falcon which is a layer zero it is also fully evm compatible so we have of uh we have a fully feature complete ethereum Json RPC API and that is how the fbm is fully feature a fully evm compatible today so all the tools that you are super used and familiar uh familiar with using in as an ebm developer can be used for the fdm as well so things like hard hat boundary we actually just put out a Foundry starter starter kit so that's really cool for my teammates act um metamask yeah or using your Ox address you know you barely have to even think about what the conversion of the address will look like into Falcon for example so all these things are things that we've figured out on the back end so for you it should be super seamless to use all the tools that you are familiar with um fbm as a whole is also intended to be VM agnostic so today the first runtime that we are the first foreign runtime for the fbm that we are focusing on is evm because clearly the ethereum community is just super robust and you know super exciting ideas and developers in that space and so we wanted to provision that first and so we have the evm today but you know tomorrow it could be something else and we're hoping to build up build out or build with Builders as well to help us build uh more VMS that can be more compact that can be compatible with other chains as well we are also live on minet since March 14 2023 so if you took part in that event it was Pi Day it was super fun and exciting um great if you joined us on that day and super easy to remember to date as well so kind of looking back um a lot has happened a lot is on the slide I kind of want to go through it um I just want to take a moment to kind of think through it the last time I think I was on East Global TV was back in November with fevm um that was like the first fdm specific hackathon that we had or the first hackathon that fbm was going into um and we it was super hacky uh we had like you know a lot of developers that gave us really good feedback we we were very aware that we're putting out a product that was almost fully complete but not really and there were features that we wanted to test with developers and we got really really good feedback then but we have come such a long way since then and since launch itself you know a lot also has happened um yeah since the pi day that we launched the main net so some things that have happened adoption has gone up we have about 2.9 mil filled today in total contract balance on Falcon mainnet and we have about 175k transactions that have taken place so far and we also have about 1.1k unique contracts deployed to date coming from about close to 200 unique deployer addresses um you know that and that's like amazing right um and we really want to thank everyone that has been um deploying the main net working with us our early Builders like it's just super exciting um right now um if you want to check out these stats you know they are from our starboard um our partners starboard um the fbm starboard Explorer so you can actually head over to that Explorer and look at these contract analysis and kind of see how the fbm is doing if you are curious to see what people are what what how the statistics statistics are tracking uh week on week um things that we've shipped we have about 10 debt integration partners and we have many more Partners as well of course but during this hackathon I know this is of interest to everyone um these are also coming back around this you see them as sponsors during this hackathon uh We've integrated these Partners to come on board to mainnet and as well as to provide support for testnet so that it gives you a richer debt development experience with fvm we've shipped new features on our blog explorers including contract verification and smart contract analysis so again thank you to all upgrade Explorer Partners out there and many more that are in development right now we're hoping to really build a much richer ecosystem around in the smart contracts based on valcoin we have The fbm Foundry and data starter kit that we pushed out since launch um so that should really help developers with getting getting a template to start moving along um and we've also gotten um a Docker image for Lotus and bulls making it super easy to set up storage and retrieval on a local net so that you can keep testing before you put it to test net and so on so that has made it much faster for people to adopt fvm and test out our client contract for storage so kudos to um to that that was shipped out as well we've also transitioned testnet from hyperspace to calibration so if you haven't seen the message on the slack channels or on Twitter just a heads up we have deprecated the previous test net with the good old trusty hyperspace test net that we've been using since uh back in November and now we are transitioning over to calibration test net which very much mimics the main net um yeah the falcoin main net as well the goal of this was really to allow developers to simulate what main conditions would be like and be able to test all these what you would consider experimental features with fem on your depth solutions to make sure it works in a production environment first and then once it deploys the main net it should work seamlessly be because we worked in calibration and that's why we are moved over so a lot more documentation and tutorials that will be coming up in the workshops but there are some slight differences between the two test nets for that so a huge transition over there migration thanks to my team and we have Redfield that has shipped thanks to glyph and Alex we that has kind of put that helped that out and has been used by quite a few teams at this point we've also had staking pools that launch so that was super exciting and we also have a more cookbook resources that have come up over time for people to get ideas and get a better sense or maybe kind of see what what the fbm thing team is thinking about how you could use fvm itself and I'll touch on that in a little bit um we've also had tremendous Builder movement uh building momentum we've had about three or so eat partner hackathons and even more hackathons outside of that since the launch itself which is just insane thinking about it because it's only been like 2.5 months um but we've had hundreds of fbm projects that have ship that have been submitted since then so really seeing really strong interest there um and we've also had an fdm mainnap build a cohort that teams where teams have shipped MVP Solutions we have about 27 of them that have also deployed to win that um thanks so much to alcohol you know we like myself and my DX team were very very close to this cohort so um thank you for everyone for participating and building with us for six months and trying all these new features and giving us feedback and building out different tools with us for fvm um and now you can all use it in the hackathon so this will all be in the hackathon cheat sheet and some of these teams have also become Partners as well which is awesome and then also from that amazing cohort 40 of their smart contract templates have actually been uploaded to cookbook.dev which is a smart contract Hub and we've been working very closely too so shout out to them as well um so that makes it even easier for you in this hackathon to adopt those templates and kind of try it out for yourself and see and build upon what other teams have done so they walk so that we could run which I don't know which is just great um and we've also had about 20 teams that have transition progressed from being in in a builder cohort you know going from hackathon to build a cohort to then being accepted into fvm focused accelerators so we have some accelerated Partners out there uh OV GPC long hash and a few other accelerator Partners as well that have not had fully focused fully fpm focused accelerator cohorts that have taken in quite a significant number of femes into their cohorts as well so a lot of like if you think about it as a whole building momentum we're really excited to see all these great ideas come up from hackathons and then progress onwards to become really sustainable uh products and solutions for themselves in system so yeah just huge momentum since we launched 2.5 months ago which is honestly kind of insane so you have no excuse in a month to build something really cool all right okay so why fbm so now we're going to touch into white again if you're interested to read more of a deep dive um there's a QR code over there that you can watch the talk on and I can go a little bit deeper into where fvm stands in the file coin and master plan uh why it came in why the falcoin network eats it and so on but to summarize um the fvm is meant to bring on-chain programmability to the Falcon Network and Achieve step number three in the file coin master plan so for those of you who have been in the Falcon ecosystem this is a test for you what is the Falcon master plan um well very simply the first one was to set up a storage provider Network and a decentralized a decentralized storage Network the second one is the onboard important data onto the network and the last one would be to compute that data and that is where the fbm comes in so we are really here to achieve step three in the following master plan um it's a really exciting stuff because it's only up from here and then um to kind of make to break that down a little bit because I do get questions around what does on-chain programmability means um to us that means to enable custom logic to be written around storage and retrieval workflows um again valcoin is fully focused on storage and retrieval and so what you can you know there's a ton that you can do with all this data right you could write um you could yeah you could decide how you want those workflows to be automated or to be event driven um it's up to you so that's what fbm is really meant to do and we think that because data is so important in today's world that can unlock a lot of opportunities for developers and different solutions out there and then also I always get the question around why use fvm that is BBM compatible rather than just using evm Alone um well the the main point here is that it will enable custom logic and storage capabilities to be in a native environment right rather than you um writing your evm smart contract and then writing to a separate storage platform which you might not have much control over you can actually be able to customize it as much as you want and have everything within within a native environment which makes a huge difference when you actually deploy or Implement your application because then it leads to like a significant Improvement in terms of performance in terms of cost um and so on so that is really the key Point as to why moving on to fvm first especially for storage focused use cases would be super great to use with vvm rather than just EDM alone and lastly to enable layer 2 storage Focus solutions to be developed at web skill um this is really the vision that we have if you think about web 2 and what for example AWS and allows today um that's what we hope to be able to do with a ton of data and being able to compute that data as well okay so that's kind of the TL DIY so now we've covered the what and the why and we're going to kind of talk about what next so today I was at if so and I had um I had a hacker come to me and um yeah a friend that came up and asked me like kind of want to know what else what actually does fbm solve um so I'm going to go a little bit into that and touch on two areas that we are thinking about very deeply these two days so um for us um there are a few resources over here where you can figure you can see how we're thinking about it we have three key resources over here and these will be in the hackathon cheat sheet you can check them out for ideas I've shared some of them into the Discord so far um and I can keep sharing or answering questions we have a lot of mentors to help you out here um but three key resources one would be data plus fbm over here as the first one so that will go deep into things like programmable storage markers data dials if you're really focused on the storage component of your solution uh what can you build with fbm today so that goes super deep into that and then we have a Solutions list which is uh kind of the current ideas that we have and the workflows that we're thinking around how we can use fvm um these kind of go across across the board in many different ways so we're kind of it's not a dumping list but we have a lot of different ideas about how you can build with fvm and we write out detailed workflows that you can go expand on and build for your projects and then lastly we have an even broader and more high level um categories of what you what you could possibly possibly build with fem so that would be our request for startups um resource which some of you might be familiar with it's been around for a while but these are really broad ideas on what we think people can grow in that space so do check all these resources out you know from Super D to super high level and see where you you and your team want to build in yeah okay so I'm gonna go a little bit uh take it take it double click a little bit into two areas one would be programmable storage markets and one would be data dials and the reason I why I want to double click into these is because I think that these are really areas that um is where fbm really shines right so if you're thinking of using fvm um storage having a storage focus is going to make your app have that unique value prop so I'm going to touch a little bit on this um on programmable storage markets there are a few basic building blocks over here this is within the data plus fvm resource that I just shared earlier on I'm going to walk through them and then kind of get in your eye your brain juices flowing around these right so around building blocks um you can think about fbm being able to enable storage deal creation on the Falcon Network so um before the fbm was introduced storage New Creation was something that um developers themselves wouldn't really interact with you wouldn't actually really interact with the Falcon protocol as well and if you wanted to run this process on your own it actually is it does require a lot of steps and it does require a lot of deep technical understanding the process is well tldr pretty long right so we started New Creation with fbm it allows a storage deal to be proposed maybe automatically or maybe you could be in your parameters and you'll set it to be event driven and can actually propose a storage deal do as a storage providers using a smart contract and once that that whole process is completed with the smart contract doing it for you it can actually generate a deal ID and return it to your application or to the user to the client themselves so storage do creation and automating that process is is a big building block that we hope to see more of in projects um the other one that we're interested in is data replication so yes you store your data once but again it's a it's a huge decentralized storage Network you might not just want to store one storage provider you might want to store it with you might want to replicate your data across a few storage providers because if one drops in you at least you have a few backups right so the ability to replicate a piece of data X number of times depending on how many you need across storage providers that you trust or whoever it is that you choose to select um it's going to be super important as well so we're interested to see how you could use fvm to interact with the protocol know that maybe a storage deal um has only been replicated like twice and you want it more and how can it automatically replicate that for you so that's another basic building block that we're interested in seeing um storage provider select selection being able to select storage providers that for example gdpr policies that you want to meet how can you be able to automatically select storage providers that are in a certain geography that you want to work with or maybe fulfill certain criterias that you have and allow you to make the storage skill even faster again these are all composable so it could be a solution that even includes the first three things that I talked about um yeah so think about how you could build like a maybe a huge dashboard they can do something like that or platform that is you know really an enhanced programmable storage platform and then really quickly we have storage view renewal again knowing that your deal has it's almost close to expiry and how can you renew that automatically these are also things to think about aggregation thing thinking about how you could have like let's say so today on the Falcon Network there is um certain a certain capacity of storage that a certain data size that would be more attractive for storage providers to accept your deal proposal for so if you have a smaller piece of data it will need to be aggregated into a larger deal size first before you can propose and have storage providers to pick that up now what happens if you want to retrieve your one piece of data out of 100 pieces of data and then return it to your client or you want to just renew for that specific piece of data so these are things to think about when it comes to education and we see that as a huge huge opportunity in the programmable Market space because you know users come with all kinds of data sizes and we want to be able to have solutions for that yeah so think about filecoin being a file coin today with a storage provider Network being like this huge destruction you know being like a factory warehouse whereas like when we have aggregation it's like kind of like the reseller and the retailer in the middle that is able to provide that service so we kind of want to see a lot more on the aggregation space and then I will go a little bit into Data dials in the next slides by one before that I want to show a quick example of what it can mean to have a storage market so I'm just taking an example as like take it as one of your alumni from my previous hackathon this is the data house project um they actually built a really cool all-in-one solution that incorporated different building blocks that I mentioned earlier of course then back then the tech was a little bit different so there were certain things they couldn't include but they built an all-in-one storage platform over here and that was actually a really powerful platform so you could think about examples like that and then moving on to data dials um this is also in data plus fbm it has more of a write-up but I get a lot of questions around what what do you mean by data dials right so really quickly your data dial is a dial as we know it um that is focused on a very important data set so it has like a really large data set that you want to be able to manage renew persist be perpetually stored control access to so you can do many different things with that dials so we've actually learned a lot of thinking our product team has done a great job of providing uh more of a guidance or framework to think about data allows so if you think about it as a layer 2 which is the base a layer one which is the base which will be persistent and Perpetual storage kind of similar to what I spoke about for programmable storage Market earlier on so you could take those composable building blocks and put into a data dial to make sure that those that that important data set can be renewed and replicated and so on and then you have a layer two on top of that which you can think about governance and incentivization either through providing tokens that people can earn as I as a as incentives or just do a few dual like a different action within the dial or it could be tokens used for governance to then decide how the data is going to be managed or it could be an endowment fund that could continuously renew a fund the renewal of your data so a lot more thinking in that space and I I know this is something that people have asked for since previous hackathons and they want to see like it's a very New Concept right and so this is something that is very unique to fbm and I think if you build a product or solution here it's going to have um a huge like Market space and it's going to be very very different in the market so we're very interested to see data Dallas be built and then really quickly I want to show an example of a data dial again from an early Builder that has been just fantastic she's also now a mentor which is great um so this was actually SPN Dao formerly known as spindle and now it's called Dylan um it was from the heck 7 hackathon way back and they actually had this really cool example of taking people's credit card data and putting it into contributing it into a data set as part of a dial and then access providing access control on top of the data that's it so that maybe companies and marketing companies that want to access your data could then pay the dials endowment fund to access the data and then the users could get um directly paid for their data as well so that's a really good example of a data dial in a real world scenario so these are things that you can think about for examples um of how you want to build like how you're going to solve real world problems with the data dial cool so kind of giving you a little bit of an idea there on things that are unique to fvm and of course you can build almost anything that you want at fpm especially anything to do with data um to have a rich depth environment with actually on onboarded integrated a lot of Partners over here so um again I realize this looks like a trivia board of you to guess what Partners these are um shout it on the chat if you know them so you can help shout them out because I didn't put their the titles in here but they are mostly sponsors and they all have integrated with fbm and you can use them within your solution as well so it makes for a much richer damp ecosystem and many more of these partner Integrations are going to be coming up very soon okay and then lastly what's next for fvm um a lot of things um but I think clearly from the product side things that we are super interested in right now is working on proof of data segment inclusion uh we call it Parts I what it actually refers to is remember how I talked about if you have a small data piece within a larger aggregated data deal how are you able to prove that your small piece of data has been stored and how do you know where your data is how are you able to pull it out to then renew in a separate deal and do whatever you want with it but know where it is within that larger segment so plot size is one big thing we're thinking about decentralized aggregated Dev tools we're super interested to see developers and maybe even in this hackathon build your own decentralized aggregator we have a few centralized aggregators today that we that allow developers or clients to upload their small data but we would love to see people build their own and think about decentralized solutions for this as well and then we're also thinking of building more stars and more Dev tooling and maybe some platforms as well on our end for replication repair renewal of your data um fbm as a whole and not pertaining to the ebm compatible fem but we're also planning on scoping up for Native awesome actors to be built so that would be a whole different type of fbm and more to come on that uh we're also working on a lot more partner Integrations to come in we share your ass for gasless transactions and so on so looking to build some of those Partnerships and integrate more for richer that experience um some of them might come in during the hackathon we don't know um we hope to bring those in and maybe help you along this month-long hack and then lastly more devtooling from DX team to help you with more docs tutorials and so on so a lot more is coming up for fbm super excited you remove as you can see in 2.5 months so many things have happened what can happen during the hackathon so definitely keep an eye out and keep talking to us in the Discord Channel um cool and then where should you begin this is a reusable QR code everything that I talked about should be in here um we have dogs a hackathon cheat sheet that's super easy to use more ideas and grants and hackathons coming up as well um for hack FS do look out for the storage and retrieval series that's coming up so my colleague Matt as well as Hong Hao and lungfei will be covering a three-part series on storage and retrieval they will go deeper into the tools and tutorials and demos on how you can build some of the programmable storage Market components that I talked about earlier on so that you can use it within your project so this should happen within next week and then applications to build with fbm we have Michael exact has built up quite a few starter kits that you could use as templates so he'll be covering that coming Monday as well so you can see how what what starter kit you want to Fork to then build your project from there okay and then um that's it for me um that was a lot I mean I tried to make it simple but still a lot of things because super exciting things are happening with fbm um but again thank you from the whole team as well as really close panels that we work with um again this is like and it's not just everyone on this page it's way more people but um again thank you so much for building with fpm
