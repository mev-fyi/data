good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to fvm space War all of you are watching this on eveglobal.tv this is what we will be using today for all of the live streams and talking about all the teams and the projects we're going to see as well as answering any questions that may come up from what we will show off today so for those of you who are joining us for the first time this event is brought to you by Eve Global and youth Global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and summits Space 4 pakathon is our first event of the year and we did both of these things for this event over the last couple weeks we kicked off the whole hackathon on Friday the 20th of January where we talked about what's happening in the entire world of Bitcoin personal machine and getting ready for the mainnet launch but the next hour and a half is about the hackathon this is officially the world's biggest fem hackathon out there and our goal is to talk to all of you about what came out of this event over the past three weeks and all the amazing things that were built we saw over a thousand people participate from 82 different countries spending 23 different time zones this is already such a massive widespread participation from our Global community and we're going to discuss all the things that everybody built and cared about we put everybody on a map to see where they're from and it still continues to blow us away that we have representation from so many different countries continents and cultures on top of that we also had six amazing ecosystem partners and 32 ecosystem mentors who are there to help you really understand what you can do on the thought conversion machine and all the creative things you can build when you now have programmable data and to top it all off we are giving over 125 000 in prizes and we're gonna talk about all the prizes that all of you have won very soon I want to give a quick shout out to all of our amazing Partners so especially first and foremost fall coin and also huddle of One Life here Lighthouse push protocol and spiron they're all giving an amazing amount of prizes and showcasing who built the coolest things using their Technologies and sdks so we'll learn all about all those winners very soon but let's get started with the demos so submissions were due four days ago from two and a half weeks worth of hacking time and we were absolutely Blown Away to see that 1042 of you collectively worked on 275 projects that is already amazing to see this represents such a big part of what's Happening Now in the fvm ecosystem and I'm going through all these submissions over the last few days through kind of an intense judging process and a live feedback session in Q a we got down to 12 finalists these 12 teams are going to come on here today and demo what they built for all of us to see and our goal is to highlight some of the really cool things that were built and are possible now on fpm so in no particular order I'd like to announce and congratulate our 12 amazing finalists so please keep a big round of applause and shout out to Seiko filesaver Collective Dao ninja Dash Z kaggle honest fill data blocks Eclipse fill swap fvm Explorer FNS lookup and Cosmic chicken these are our 12 incredible teams that are going to come on here one by one and demo everything that they built and our goal is to Showcase to all of you the cool things you can do with these New Primitives that are now possible by deploying on fbm so before we go into our very first demo I want to take a quick second to highlight all the other incredible projects that were built during this event the 263 teams listed here or amazing amazing projects that we who are just absolutely excited about we talked to all of our judges and our partners to get some feedback on what they saw and what they were excited about and the excitement was unanimous from every single one of them and I want to congratulate all of these teams for taking the time to build so many really cool things and building things that you were excited about and really pushing what's possible in the world of web3 just because you are not one of these 12 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something that was not great our goal with the finalists to highlight some of the things that we were super excited about and the goal here is that we want to help you and provide you any reason with any resources we can to continue encouraging you to build and make sure that you get to continue building these projects after this event ends today so please give yourself a massive Round of Applause for pushing to the end and building something that you can be proud of and not only that but also showcasing that and demoing it to all the amazing people that are part of these events from our ecosystem and now broadly the wet three space so congratulations to all 275 teams but let's go back to our finalists so if you are interested in seeing what came out of this event you can now head over to eveglobal.com Showcase you'll be able to see all these projects here now and that includes everything from how they were built to what they built screenshots video demos and live demos and their source code all of that is now public and visible and you can check this out immediately on our website so let's go into the first demo so without further Ado I'd like to welcome our first demo of today and that is team Cosmic chicken and they'll come on and show you what they built so Jose welcome and excited to see what Cosmic chicken is thanks let me just share my screen so I'll start with the presentation hey everyone and thanks for your time uh I'm I'm presenting on behalf of the team that builds Cosmic Cosmic chicken for this fcm space work hackathon we these were the happy people that spent the last few weeks working on it and built something cool so what was our motivation first we wanted to diminish Capital costs for storage providers then we wanted to create a yield opportunity for field token holders and finally we wanted to leverage the chicken mechanism that was created by liquidy in order to bootstrap some protocol liquidity that could be a positive force inside the Falcon ecosystem so high level what daily we build so we want to prepare lenders and service providers so each one of them will deposit 50 of the collateral into our sticking pool and after that we'll be depositing the full amount of collateral that storage providers need on behalf of those uh storage providers and lenders and accruing the rewards into our sticking pool so what does this mean in practice so in this example we have three chicken bondholders that together to 50 40 field into the sticking pool we have two storage providers that together deposit 25 field into the sticking pool and afterwards the sticking pool is depositing 50 field 20 to 30 for each storage provider on behalf of them and including the rewards from the work until they repay the loan so how did we made it both the chicken bones and the staking pool are solidity smart contracts that we deployed to hyperspace you can check them at these addresses and afterwards we built a front-end in xjs where you use other JS and wagami to interact with with contracts and it deployed using network file you can check the site at this URL so now it's time for the demo this is our home page where we had the time to do some cool animations to explain what this is all about as I explained we have some information from lenders and storage providers explaining everything that happens when you join this protocol and we also explained about the chicken body itself chicken one is an ERC 721 nft token um it basically has three states you have the bonding state where you initially mean the nft where you are recruiting the balance of a boosted field you have chicken in which means that you relinquish the initial Capital that you use during the means but the ideal that you accrued so far and finally we got the chicken art where you lose the yield that you accrued so far but get back the initial Capital um we have a few more things in the home page so feel free to check it out afterwards I'm going now to move into the render dashboard and I'll start by minting a new Bond so I'm meeting and your bond for maybe 0.8 we got the metamask notification where I'll be confirming and we should get a transaction within fill Fox that will be confirmed in a few seconds meanwhile I'll explain to you what should happen in the storage provider dashboard so in here you need to deposit some money to act as your collateral afterwards you can start um alone as you can see here the total one was for to heal and eventually you pay it off and you will have it on the on the expired loans for this I'm going to switch to a new account just because this one already had the loan and I deposit some some tokens previously and now I'm going to create a new loan for a storage provider I'm going to put my address in both of the miner and the owner I'm going to use my 0.5 and I'm going to consult to keep my eggs on the fridge again we got this this smart transaction smart contact transaction I'll just open up on Phil Hawks and I'll be going back to the lender so in here we can see that we already got the 0.8 that I I did the transaction the field a few minutes behind and that's pretty much it now I can either Chicken in as I explained or she cannot and both this will trigger and transaction that I'm not going ahead now finally um I want to explain a bit about the internal logic so the chicken Bond itself as these five components you got the pending bucket where the funds deposit might blender reside you got the reserve bucket that accumulates yield both from the pending bucket the permanent bucket and itself and finally the permanent bucket which is the funds acquired by the protocol during this chicken finally we got the virtual balance of boosted fuel that is the state where you are still bonding and occurring the boosted field in the virtual balance and when you shake it in you get the actual booster field which is an erc20 token that then can be used to claim from the reserve bucket funds finally I just wanted to talk a bit about the future work so we think we should have some cool visuals for people to see what's going on to make sure that they are making a sound financial decision we of course need some bags that need to be fixed in the future we also plan to deploy this to mainnet and be to still require a few changes for that that's it from my part thanks for your time hope that you enjoy amazing thank you so much our first demo of the day and we're already seeing D5 Primitives on fpm and uh also amazing t-shirt thanks for having last year ready to Global all right we are ready for our second demo and that is team Collective Tau so rock and art welcome and uh let's see what you built [Music] yes hi everyone uh let us share on the screen foreign and during this hackathon we have been working on the non-custodial liquid staking protocol on Falcon and what does it mean for example if you are if you holder you can take your field to our staking pool and get back interest bearing CL field token later you can use it in the future Falco and device system or you can swap it back to your field with rewards which you got from mine which you got from miners and let me show how it works uh here is our UI connected to hyperspace Network and now I can State my view and get mycl view in exchange so we're sending transaction now and it will take some time from hyperspace to approve it and later I will see my change balances here also I can unstake it later and so or swap to still feel myself feel to feel if there is not enough liquidity in the pool so and now Buck will tell you how it works how can we help storage providers hello everyone um on the hyperspace we have a gym who is an active hyperspace network storage provider in order to cover his initial patch requirements on filecoin storage mining he needs to provide some form of collateral called initial pledge and the collective liquid sticking pool allows miners to back like to get some file coin in order to cover those initial requirements to get some of the Falcon Miner need to perform two operations first of all is you need to register in the collective down and change the beneficiary of his minor actor to the liquid staking pool and to do so he can use our golang SDK which is a native Lotus extension model uh that you can see here a list of CLR command for example storage provider can register in Collective demo protocol can change the beneficial address and also interact with smart contracts such as collateral and staking pool right now I want to perform an operation which is called pledging operation in which liquid staking pool will transfer some of the amount of filecoin to cover the initial pledge requirements in order to pledge we need to provide the number of sector which is 53 and its proof and go long SDK is has generated our call data that we are going to pass here which is our Lotus nodes actively running on hyperspace Network and now we are going to wait for about one minute for this operation to be performed in the meantime I will come back to the presentation and continue our team consists of three people atom being our main designer myself working on Smart contracts and career being our full stack engineer when it comes to our next steps we want to integrate further with Native proof built-in method called proof commit sector which will finalize the ceiling process with collecting dial protocol also we want to introduce taking router which is an abstraction layer that will give an opportunity for my storage providers in the network to aggregate capital from multiple sources after that we will perform a public audit and hopefully make it to the main ads as you can see now our transaction is still has not been confirmed in the meantime I will show you what is the miners that we owned on the filecon hyperspace Network our Miner has ID 2480 88 and its balance is about 1 378 file coin uh we actually we have two active sectors uh for uh half of the gigabytes and now you see that our operation has successfully completed now this address is an owner of our hyperspace Miner actor and if I refresh here I will see that the last my transaction which is a pledging operation and in this pledging operation you can see that we successfully delivered 20 filecoin to this address if I click to this address it's the same Miner called 20 this ID 2488 and its balance has successfully increased by 20 field we use 20 field as a test value to show you that it's an amount that is covering both pre-commit deposits plus initial uh pledge requirements in this case we deliver the collateral on on demand uh on the new sector added to the network without delivering the collateral up the the amount of file going up front oh thank you amazing that was really good to see and uh another amazing primitive to add to the D5 bucket for what you can do on fpm well thank you so much for that demo and with that we are ready for our third demo of the day and that is team fvm Explorer whenever you're ready so hey all this is drove and I will just go ahead and share my screen yeah potential to you all fbm explore and for fbm space in a picket on myself and I have built this platform in the back-end part I have my teammate abbascon with me was work on the front end platform so let's go over the problem first our developers will discover the full potential of fpm chain and take advantage of all the perks it provides which is important for it's important that the developer experience to be more accessible and easier to interact and contact deployment verification interaction and testing is a time consuming process for developers and it can result in loss of private Keys as well so we came up with the solution our platform allows developers to interact with those smart contracts from the fvm chain with the easy and user-friendly interface and it also allows developers to not only compile the smart contract with a built-in compiler but also deploy verify smart contract directly from a platform with just one click we also provide apis for developers to build on top of our platform so now it's demo time let's head over to our platform it's live on fvm explore.forsal dot app we provide three features which is explore that allows you to explore the currently verified contract and interact with it then we have got deploy which allows you to deploy a contract on the fvm hyperspace testnet and then also verify it from there itself then we got verify and this will allow you to interact with the contract a little on the slow page let's Dive Right In to the deployer page so we have got contract right here and we will be deploying it from our interface when we enter the Contra code and hit deploy so what will happen in the backend is that it will send API request to a API endpoint on the backend and then we will quickly see that it is compiled and now we can go ahead and deploy the contract on the fbm hyperspace.net and yeah we have got a transaction right here as soon as we confirm it will deploy and we have got the contact address in the notifications we can go ahead and copy it and save it for the purpose of exploring then we have got verification feature so when weight verify it will first compile all the data into apfs URL and it will upload to the ipfs uh using FC dot storage in the back end and then the later the contact will be ready to registry in the back end itself so you can also copy the previous link and check it out for now on so for me that we will go ahead and check out X though for explore we have already deployed a verified contract for you to interact with and we have got it right here so as soon as I enter the contract and hit hit search button we've got the source code of the contract it's a time lock wallet contract which uh here has a source code for the whole contract and then we can go ahead with the right contract section right here we have got all the functions so it shows that which function needs arguments and we have got a easy to use interface with all the information on the screen itself and then you can go ahead and enter some value and interact with it and you can see how easy it is to interact with the platform with all the bifurcation as it also shows the payable functions and all the value you need to add we will go to read contract 2 and here all the read functions are listed perfectly and then you can interact with one of these so let us try to interact with the owner function and here we can see when we don't know it shows up the address of the owner right here and we can also submit try out the functions too in the meantime we as we have seen that we've got the contract address which we just deployed so we can also go ahead and explore that too and we have got it right here and yeah the contract was Source time itself so yeah this is here and now yeah in case you have got already a deployed contract you can add the contractor site here and the source code so that's what I'm gonna do right now we have got a contract which is already deployed on the hyperspace testnet which we are going to verify right now with our platform and right here when we enter everything we just hit need toward compile again and it will compile the contract and then we can hit verify which will include the same process of verifying the contract adding the data to ipfs 5x3. storage and then it will at the contact to a registry and then similarly we can interact with it to from a bluff and interface in the meantime let me tell you about our apis so we have got bunch of apis which users can use and developers can build on top of our platform which includes compile which can be used to compile a smart contract code and we've got a documentation right here which you can use to interact and then we've got verified contract API which can be used to verify a contract with the data you provide when you do API call then we've got contact data which you can use to get the contact data right in just one click on your platform and let us go ahead and try to explore a few contracts more so we'll just wait for the contract to Bear another history and then we're good to go so yeah right here we have got the contract address yeah and the repo is live on the F so you can also try out our repo and use a platform in the meantime let's just wait for the source code to be fetched yeah so here we can see the source code has been fed right now and yeah we have got the contract source code we've got the right contract functions and the read contract functions so and this way it's how easy to interact with the ifbm hyperspace test9 right now we are on hyperspace run but we are soon going to launch on the main net too and we are going to come up with a CLI tool that allows you to use deploy compile and verify contract from a single code from a CLI thank you for your time have a good day amazing thank you so much yeah this is uh just an awesome Improvement on this developer experience so uh in addition to other tools available out there on on the FM ecosystem you get to actually make it a lot more easier for everybody to build and debug things better all right once again and now we are ready for our fourth demo with that I'd like to welcome team file saver whenever you're ready hi everyone [Music] it's good to be here okay so good evening everyone we are in the MVP Workshop team and our project is called file saver so filecoin is great for a decentralized storage but it's not that great when it comes to guaranteeing that data will be available five 10 or 20 years in the future right now users only have unlimited storage deals and once the deal has expired a user has no guarantee that their file will be available to them and valuable data could be lost this way until now the only options available were to manually create new storage deals or to turn to centralized Solutions which kind of defeats the purpose of filecoin's decentralization and that's why we want you to meet file saver and start storing your files once and for all what is file saver so it's the first fully decentralized storage drive on filecoin it provides Perpetual storage for users without requiring additional user action users can increase the Storage security by setting the number of replicas to be stored on filecoin and build for private and public use file saver is designed to preserve Humanity's most important information the community can donate to preserve data that matters to them and receive rewards for their service in the form of erc20 tokens we designed this mechanism to promote preserving sensitive data and to promote sharing knowledge in an open way so here we have a demo of our application where the user first connects their wallet and opens their profile page where they can see all of the files that they already uploaded or contributed to they can perpetually store a new file on filecoin by selecting which file they want to share selecting the initial storage period for that file and the number of replicas to be stored on filecoin when they select upload the file is temporarily stored directly on ipfs and then the user creates a new Perpetual storage offer through the filesaver smart contract additionally they also send this uh initial funds for the storage rewards through this transaction now we need to wait a bit to do hyperspace's block delay but once the offer is published on chain the user should see their file appear at the bottom of the list but with the pending status in the meantime we can see what's actually happening behind the scenes so when an offer is being created the storage providers will be notified of the storage offer they will download the file check the offer parameters and if they find them acceptable they will claim their spot to store the file and create the first Perpetual storage deal with the filesaver smart contract once that happens we should see the status of the offer switch to active as it has Services providers storing the files through filecoin so the storage deals are set for six months and for existing deals service providers have automation built into their clients which periodically check if any storage deal is about to expire if it is the service provider claims the rewards for the previous period and renews the storage deal for another six months and this process is repeated as long as there are funds available for the specific file so we can see now here that our file has been uploaded and it's pending so we're waiting for service providers to create storage deals uh users can also see they're already uploaded files and Supply additional fill tokens which will be used to create more storage deals and extend the storage period for the desired file below the user can also see other popular files which are publicly available and to which they can contribute by donating the same way they would do with their own file and finally the user can easily download any of their own or publicly available files just by clicking the download button and I think we should see that our file should switch to active and for the last part here it is and finally we want to share with you our product product Vision which is a publicly available feed where the world's most important information is preserved through sharing and donating and also a private drive for every user where they have full control of their data and where they can choose with whom they share their data and for how long so in this example let's say we it's shared for 30 minutes so that's it from us we thank you so much for your time and we hope you enjoy it thank you so much Perpetual stories on Falcon this is uh gonna be even better and I can finally just worry free starts uploading stuff that I have and uh we're gonna see a lot more themes here on the same topic but thank you so much for demoing all right um demo number five that is Project ninja Dash sugar whenever you're ready yeah hello uh hello everyone today I'm going to present ninja days ninja days is basically classic platformer game which is now on web3 so before I start I would like to introduce about my team TGs I am  full stack game developer with me I have Harsha who is a graphics and game designer my S Voice blockchain developer we are creating and Publishing games and interactive applications since last eight years now if we talk about where three gaming problems then these games are basically focused on play two and only so basically we have to buy some nft to start the game so basically it's not playable by everyone and this game has basically Less Fun and uh these games are basically unsustainable to overcome this we have developed the game which is more focused on entertainment and gameplay we have implemented web3 features like web 2 games so any web to users can easily dive into web keyword and this game is basically free to play and user can also play in on in this game now if we talk about development technology then we are using fpm hyperspace test net for uh deploying two smart contracts one smart contract is for nft minting in-game purchase a user native balance and other smart goals other smart contract we are used for creating in-game token erc20 a token exchange and getting token balance we have used a falcon ipfs for storing an area driving nft data like metadata we have used unity game engine for developing this game we have used a remix ID for a solidity programming for smart contracts and Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator is used for a game UI ux and assets design now it's time for live demo so we are in the gameplay we can easily sign in with metamask so we have signed in and you can see our wallet address is there and our username is also displayed so top of the left side we can see the in-game points which we can earn during this gameplay next to it we have erc20 token which we can earn in this game if we click on this so button then in this so we can buy coins with a FM testnet or we can exchange with our in-game and tokens now if we click on the store button here we can buy different characters these characters are basically nft double one double five and this character are stored on a falcon ipfs in settings we can easily change a music and sound effects and in edit profile we can change our username and this data is saved on server if we click on play button currently we have 15 levels if we complete any level with a 3 star then we get chance to earn erc20 token so let's start a level so we are in the first state first stage is basically interactive tutorials where we have to learn how to play the game with normal arrow keys or aswd we can move around in this game with the space button we can jump and if we can uh press space button twice then we can do higher jump we have to be aware from this spiky trace and on laptop side we can see our lives and next to it we have number of tasks which we have to complete in this game if you can complete those tasks then we can get three star as per the game name uh ninjatus we can also do this in this game we can easily click on the on UI button or we can press a control button to test so we can do this like this we can also climb over the wall and we can do also sliding from this wall as we go further on our further path we can see there are obstacles we can cannot cross the road so for this we can do teleporting with this on-screen button we can do easily teleporting as we go further we can see there is a hostage girl is there we have to say where we can uh we just have to jump and we can save her and our one task is completed as we go further we can see uh one enemy is there we have to kill him to complete our task so yes we have killed him and we are going further and yes we have finished the level as we have completed this level with three star we can get chance to claim a game token so by this we can get erc20 game token in future we want to add multiple uh levels at multiplayer system uh more character in this game so definitely yeah we want to do many things in this uh game so if you like this game do not forget to try this game and uh thank you so much for giving this opportunity have a great day figure that was awesome and uh congrats for making not only just a fully functioning game but also going down and doing multiple levels uh where uh everybody's gonna have fun with this because the game is live you can check this out on the Showcase page and I think it's probably safe to say that this is already now the best game that exists on the fbm ecosystem so congrats all right next up is our sixth demo we're halfway through this so let's check out what FNS lookup is and welcome Stephen and Jeffrey hey guys thanks for having us uh let me share my screen all right uh so today we are going to talk about the FNS app and the FNS FNS integration uh in for Fox Explorer as we call it the FNS lookup function uh FNS is developed by uh fieldfox team which is originated from the five coin developer Community um and during the space web we have made much progresses uh first we fixed the key functions and update events of contracts we also developed a deployed musical to contracts on hyperspace and uh on top of that we upgrade a UI ux and release V2 apps and add five coin CID index the FNS V2 app has already been deployed on the hyperspace and feel free to try it we have put the links here um here's some here's some pictures about the website the new website and how the data is presented um so we do hope that FNS can be used as a basic tool for the fileco ecosystem to help promote a better user experiment user experiences so we first integrated FNS in our fieldfox Explorer to provide more functions for our users FNS is open sourced and any other projects they can integrate AFS into their own project as well so some key features here FNS FNS lookup synchronizes or events related events and analyzes into DB providing API Services it also displays FNS reverse resolution in address detail page of fieldfox and all FNS registering registrations and the name details furthermore it supports FNS name search and both T4 and the 0x addresses search so this is a picture shows the tech architecture and how it works uh within the limited time we have implemented uh sorry I'll just make it full screen all right just forget So within the limited time we have uh listed all the contracts uh shown here and we also open source to the uh fv2 source code and the FNS lookup API server code uh for more detailed info you can uh goes to the GitHub links here and for more information so in the future we are going to provide a lookup open API in SDK to facilitate uh developers to integrate the FNS functions into their own dabs and wallets we also gonna finish the integration with Fox wallet to provide all the functions on the fox wallet more importantly we're going to release FNS space features which is a web 3 portal you can basically put all your information and your achievements on the website and showing to others and we got uh and we on top of that we're going to release if Phil Fox Source game and profile of society protocol all right um let's go to the fieldfox uh Explorer and show how and show how it works so this is the fox Explorer under the blockchain tab you may find FNS lookup here and click on that it shows you the FICO name lookup function you can basically can either put your FNS names or addresses here let me try the addresses first so enter and it will come come up with a overview of your addresses which including reverse record registrant names related transactions all the data shown here if I tried to another like try to fill domain here and enter it will give you another overview of the about the domain and if if you click on the registrant again it will provide you a address overview which including the addresses uh your ID actor balance account change message list transactionalist Etc which if you want to check your domains for more details simply click it click on here it will takes you to the FNS detailed domain Details page let's wait for a second yeah it comes out all the informations about your domain and even you can renew your domain here which is very easy to use and all the records as shown below all right this is the this is at the end of my presentation and thanks for having us amazing thank you so much this was a really cool demo and uh glad to see that it's going to be officially part of lfox um this is great and also continuing to build on your work from the last event is even better because now you get to actually make an ecosystem out of FNS it's going to be amazing thank you very much all right next up we have honest Phil Puerto Rican one welcome thank you Karthik hello everyone uh we are the team on honest field who is behind this project Federico authors uh great full start developer for from Argentina and me Juan Manuel Opera designer from Mexico um we built on a still uh the various project the print transparency and security to reserves uh to Old protocols that or change build and fight current right now uh but why we built this as you know after the FDF disaster the whole industry have to change all the investors users and need to know where the assets are all the time and we need to think more on verification overclose transparency first and if we can perform chain data why we can verify all the time with the audit that's why it comes in honest field and with the real-time uh reserves of protocols for that that are registered on our dashboard we provide a lab in transparency that never seen before on the space but we don't stop there and we also provide alerts for potential issues or hacks on the research and to make the informed decisions on time and even for the revenue model we think we see an opportunity to reward transparency where protocols or Labs will pay to audit the reserves in real time and others who verify that result we reward um it's time to a demo let's see when you actually go to our home you can enter and connect your wallet first on the file contest net after that you can see on the dashboard always your balance of field uh also in real time the price of the market let's make an example if I was an owner of a protocol I'm going to put an example right here just choose the category with the URL logo and we use more data for this I'm going to authorize the just section on the while we can see in the dashboard also all the trending protocols that you can follow and that are submit his proof of reserves and you can see also the favorites that alert that you can set in that you want to monitor in case and in a problem that you want to follow also we can see on the deliver all the transactions already are doing and are pending to hold any contract that already has on on the while we can see also the alerts in this part which you can create alerts for the protocols that you want to follow or monitor in the field Reserve are minimum you can check all the alert that already you have and put as favorite if you want and on the lowest part on the dashboard and also edited or switch off and you can set up also the notification here with brush protocol it's very simple you have to go to push protocol and configure Uconnect after that you go to the channel and select the honest View we can see right now we have already added the protocol demo here and if you click it you can see the file total reserves and how our tracking in real time and also the bolts and others that you probably want to check out and also the updates of the reserves but you can do it as we see we can create also alerts here I'm going to put an alert just for the last particles that already create foreign you can go to the dashboard of push protocol you have to change of network after that you go to channels you look for honest test you can subscribe to the alerts and also you can see that all alerts are already set up right here in the Inbox and you just ready to go we are reading it's everything for the demo right now under your hood how it's built we use experim for the front end we also use push for the alert and notification and we deploy the smart contract on filecon as well for the future we want to add different types of protocol Partners test key metrics for and test MVP also learn why we can improve from our leaders and users and build in many very soon transparency begins with honestly thank you it's already open amazing well thank you for that wonderful demo and sticking to the values of open finance and transparency and great to see that it's also now available for everybody to use congratulations thank you all right on to our demo number eight we have Phil swap with vinay whenever you're ready okay yeah hello everyone this is up for this foreign hackathon so this is basically like the one of the first uh D5 platform for on fbm and let's start with the demo the demo is in two sections which is swapping and Landing uh and Loans so uh so you know you can just take any rc20 token which you have on fbm departs I will just take one uh so this is my FLT token and I will add this uh import this into uh into mind there's a software platform and here I can uh swap my t-fill tokens for FLT so if I had like uh 0.1 I can get seven different tokens my balance is uh six zero in at last I will swap it as you can see it's asking for 0.1 to confirm the transaction okay uh so as you can see this is depending and uh as uh until this goes on I can show you from there so for the swapping to perform you have to add it add a pool for it so I've already created a pool you can use this add Equity button to create a pool for uh FLD tfl uh pair or any erc20 token you have uh yeah like this I have tools already hit let's move on to loan station which is the major uh like major project so in loan uh like the base is the storage providers who need uh loan for the projects like us for their Hardware cost they can borrow from the standing pool okay like clone pool so uh anyone can lend but only the actors or showish providers who are who have a validated D can only borrow okay so let's start with Lending so I will try to learn uh like World token as you can see so I will click on it and okay I got a transaction control yeah okay uh as you can see understand token I've already lost like related one file coin and uh click on and here you can see uh it uh the one file comes refer to the smart contact address so I will go back and try to you know like search for an actor or a storage recorder so I have uh this one uh I acted with the id10000 and history guide is 300 which is already listed on the uh Phil fox or fvm chain so I can just go and borrow and I can add uh his iPad I mean I also need to add the correct deal ID okay as you can see he doesn't have any pending loan on his account so I will just click on borrow and as you can see it will ask for another transaction okay I'll confirm this and uh till this goes on I can show you uh like or I've already borrowed for uh one one three zero actor ready it also has I had a you know listed a deal on the FM chain so here you can see uh like uh he the actor the storage quarter got 1.15 uh as a borrow loan and uh as you can see one uh one one three zero already has a loan so if I if I add his you know actor ID then I can get the option to pay his emails okay so uh so here you can see like his Landing uh his total depth is now just 0.7 and his Emi is like 0.20 and depending on the credit score he will get like you know uh that less amount of Interest or uh the more amount of loan tokens for every loan okay and this uh the loan is needed to be paid back in six emis so I will just uh try to pay his Emi foreign platform was it was like you know uh when the storage providers need some specific amount of uh loan for their own storage costs like uh suppose they are gonna uh they're gonna take uh some one or two DB of Hardware costs and then they have to pay they need some amount of money for that right so that's why this whole uh platform came into existence um yeah and also like suppose uh if you have like 14 tokens landed then you can easily revoke those tokens you can just add here like how much I want to focus you have already linked to the platform or to the platform and you can just click OK and it will like uh ask you for the transaction and just revoke the top us back to your account yeah so this is the holder application of this uh V5 platform in future we are going to support like you know uh maybe increase more validation in aspects for actors to uh borrow the loan okay like those things yeah thank you everyone this is the demo for since thank you so much this is uh this is already great and uh we now also have in addition to All The Primitives eight amm that you can leverage and borrow and trade against this is really cool and you can check it out on philswop.org thank you all right next up is saipal Julian and team whenever you're ready [Music] hello hey hello so yeah screenshot yes so hello everyone I'm Julian and I'd like to introduce our team and acrylic welcome our group of three students who are passionate about blockchain technology and what it can offers our goal is Supple is to make the centralized cloud computing accessible to everyone and pave the way for a more secure centralized and private future hi everyone I'm Quentin hey I'm Michelle so sapo is a bridge between fem and the network of bakaya it enables you to to make jobs that are then run on distant nodes so if you don't know bakayao it's a network of notes that can run your heavy jobs so you don't have to run them on your local computer so uh Supple uh has a goal uses simplicity so that means that you can even if you don't know how bakayao really works you can use our front end and you will understand it uh and the support already makes it so that uh data dials can be linked to our front-end so if you have a data dial with many cids that are open on ipfs you can use the data directly via our front-end so uh this uh what you just saw was our front page if you're interested in uh learning a little bit more about sapo feel free to go to our front page and here you can see that our managed many jobs uh some of them are heavier than others you can see that as stable diffusion in CPU and GPU but also uh that's easy ocean and what is exciting about the job is that you can create your own custom job we only need a Docker image and inputs as a cig pinned on ipfs or filecoin we'll try and simple example so the example we'll choose is stable diffusion with GPU so that goes a little bit faster and um so also stable diffusion generates images with AI and it takes as an input it takes text on Plain text so we have to give that as an input so yeah right uh this right here what you see is the input we are going to give to to stable diffusion so it's a frog drinking a fresh lemon juice and as you can see here you can either choose between ipfs and data dials for the sake of demonstration once again we will use this one uh if you want you can implement this function in your data direct smart contracts so you can directly import all ucid in the sapo app let's try it so here you see our list of cids that are all of five type text plane but we can also show incompatible files for example images or Json but we won't be choosing these ones so yeah this is the one that we just showed to you it's uh for drinking fresh lemon juice and we hope that we will get a pretty image after this so here on the job page you can see uh Joy specification about the docker image the job name and the input file we also implemented a way to pay a small fee based on the job complexity and the input file size and if the job fail you will be refunded at least 50 of this fee so we'll confirm yes but uh this might take a while because it was debut diffusion uses AI so it's a very heavy job uh last time we tried it it lasted for 10 minutes so we'll just get that thought because it's not very fun to wait and then here you see our job history so there are a lot of jobs that are already done by us and well some are interesting some fills so you can know when a job fails when it's for example if pakayao doesn't uh uh rejects your job it will fail and you will be refunded as you just said and here that's a job that we that we made which is a magnificent image of a frog drinking fresh lemon juice so interesting art style but well we get it uh it's uh it's an AI and it shows it so here you also can see that uh you don't have to really understand all of this uh but uh it's interesting to to know that with this back IR ID you can see all the job details so back at our stores the information and you can you can get all that with okay I'll describe you can even check if it's verified so this is interesting and you can see the outputs you can see the errors and the standard output also uh so yeah there's there are other jobs for example this one is another image of a frog and uh we'd like to thank a team that builds that made this project possible this project was inspired by lilypat which is uh also called frog project frog they also build a bridge and it's very similar but we aimed really at user Simplicity and uh also we wanted to have a front end so it goes right through fvm still and that means that your history will never disappear and we're really excited about the future of decentralized computation and we think that with this type of apps that I always can leverage FICO and storage and extract more value with the data storage on FICO thank you for your attention amazing well thank you so much for that cool demo and uh yeah we've seen the fiber matters we've seen games and now compete on data this is uh it's gonna be the next wave congratulations I hope you continue willingness thank you thank you all right next up is Eclipse with three more demos to go or almost at the finish line so I should win whenever you're ready that's when you are muted so I'm going to ask you to I mean yourself and perfect hello everyone I'm Ashwin and I'm excited to introduce eclipse Eclipse was built in the last week by Ankit Negi who's a full stack developer myself I'm a smart contract developer and Ankit Sadie who's a designer and a UI ux engineer so what is eclipse eclipse is the easiest way for businesses to elaborate filecoin as their native storage layer as a startup owner myself one of the biggest requirements in storing files is to be able to share files within a company and you know in a private and secure way uh By Nature file coin everything on filecoin is public unless you choose to increase individually so what we have built is a very uh what we have built is a very uh Google Drive like experience where companies can drag and drop files into the ecosystem into the workspace and people who are current members of that workspace are Dows will be able to you know will be only able to uh decrypt and view these files not just this however there is a big requirement of being able to store big files in a decentralized way and filecoin is leading the charge with this what we have also built is a way for companies to be able to store big files on the filecoin network using an integrated storage provider marketplace where you can probably requests to store big files and storage parameters can come and come back and pick on bid on top of these things and then you can get the best deal and you can kind of go forward that uh so how does eclipse work uh Eclipse uh Eclipse works in the following ways first is uh we use FM for delay verification and payouts for big file storage we use contract factories for data composition of data dials and we use Lighthouse for Access Control and small file storage okay so coming to the architecture of it really quickly uh so everything starts off with the eclipse data was Factory smart contract uh this is where every data will get an instance of the eclipse data itself so such that all the data is composed within that one data and every time you every time the data Tower makes a deal with the storage provider that deal also gets registered as a separate instance of a smart contract such that you know the deal can be verified over time the deal the payout can happen on time and the deal can you know the deal can be managed independently and uh to store small files we use Lighthouse and their Access Control features on filecoin coming to house storage requests work uh again uh when a data can produce request for storage and this will be honored by different storage providers who will make proposals back and the selected proposals by the dove will be uh it will be created into a smart contract which will be used also used as an escrow to make sure that the payouts happen on time and will also be used to make sure the deal is valid and you know takes place accordingly now let's get to the demo so we're already live on eclipse website.netify.app this is where you can check us out so as you can see in our landing page you have entered the app we have some documentation and if you're a storage provider you can log into through that so I'll log in as a Dom member as you can see I'm already there and uh it's it's a very simple interface where you know we try to make keep it as simple as possible for users to understand so we have different uh tasks we can check out different dials data part of like in a very Discord like interface and you can add new members very easily and you can also you can look into big files that I'll come to and you also have a profile screen where you can you know do uh you're changing your name adding your Lighthouse API for that matter and different things so let's go back to the home where uh where the Google Drive interface exists right so uh this dial currently has two members myself and Ankit I have logged into ankit's profile on this uh you know Chrome browser and uh let me just add a file really quickly let's say I want to share Banner image with with this Dao where Ankit lives so I'm just gonna upload uh this will require me to sign so that the aux control features are being applied and I'm encrypting the file as well and once this is done uh the file appears automatically and I can go to ankit's interface here which is uh and as you can see the file is already here right so even though the CID is available publicly uh this the CID is meaningless to someone who's not a part of the doubt because they won't be able to see the contents of it right that's the emphasis here so I can click on this it'll decrypt and uh again I have to sign to make sure that I'm a part of the staff at this moment and once the signing is complete I will be able to view files pretty easily as you can see here now coming back to the other main feature which is big files as I told you uh as a dial as a dow member I can put out requests for storing big files I can type the file name what the file is about the number of the amount of amount of days I'm gonna store this file for the size in GB as well as the expiry for this if no one picks it up and I'll also offer a base Bounty the type of delivery will be a link Hardware delivery file currency ID some more description about this and click on ad it's a very uh intuitive interface and I I can add how many ever I want and what I'll get to see is different storage providers coming back and bidding on top of this so as you can see you'll see different providers coming and asking for different bounties one can ask for 150 120 300 whatever it is and I can view each one of these storage providers individually you see the reputation see how good they are and I can do the same for all of them and I can then decide which stores for storage for whatever I want to I want to like go with and just to give you an experience of how the storage provider dashboard looks this is how the storage provider will be able to see it if you clicked on the storage perverted Link in the landing page you'll end up here let me just quickly sign in and with their wallet and you'll be able to see requests from different Dows in one place and you can kind of evaluate which one you want to you know go about and like um you know take up and it's not this this you will also be able to see the different activities happening you can also see who else is bidding on it and so you know you can kind of give a good price for your client and you can see your own activity here as well as your profile so that is just a quick um demo of what um you know Eclipse has to offer is it's live currently uh eclipsed hyphen web 3.95.app and I'm happy for feedback as well uh that is it for the demo yep amazing thank you so much this is uh this is really cool we're finally seeing more productivity apps here and uh things that actually fit in day-to-day workflows I'm very excited about data Dallas here well congratulations and we are now at our second last demo for today so without further Ado let's welcome Z kaggle Kathy and T whenever you're ready right thank you cardi for the um introduction let me share my screen so hello we're see cargo uh our project is a bounty platform for incentivized decentralized computing on fvm built by this very amazing team so we actually draw our inspiration from two places the first is the official list of requests for startups from fem uh asking for a decentralized compute Solutions at the infrastructure level to allow storage provider to do a verifiable computation on the storage data that they have and the other inspiration that we have drawn from is um scaggle which is a very very famous machine learning Bounty platform well there's some problem with those Solutions so first of all to win a bounty on kaggle you actually need to submit your full model before even winning anything so this leads to privacy problem and that also means that companies cannot really monetize on their proprietary model on the other hand uh we cannot really expect storage providers to have domain knowledge and all the processing power to perform some of the computations and also if only storage providers can do verifiable computation at the infrastructure level it's not very accessible the way we aim to solve it is to utilize zero knowledge proof zkp so ckp can help us do private variable computation and also our solution is totally decentralized enabling everyone to participate in this protocol so everyone can actually deploy a bounty smart contract through our browser application and everyone can join the Bounty as well so without further Ado let's do a demo so our um uh our demo live demo was actually already live on filecoin hyperspace test net but for the sake of this um demo here because we have some sequential transactions that has to be done I'm using a local host Fork network instead so let me switch over to our localhost for Network and I'll explain a bit of what we're seeing here so on the left hand side we have the Bounty provider so he will be posting the data and uh posting and and depositing a bounty amount on the right hand side we have the Bounty Hunter who will browse the task and submit whatever they uh they want uh to compute for right so on the left hand side you can see that I've already clicked the create button and pre-filled some of the information that is needed to fill out to create a bounty and now I'm going to upload the date the data so the data is very simple for demo purpose is a black and white image of the number five well this person doesn't have expertise in machine learning so he wants someone to compute it using a image classification model so he's going to go ahead and deposit one token for the bounty as soon as the transaction go through you can see that the new task is now on the feed so as the Bounty Hunter if he's interested in this task he can click into it and start computation and as a bounty owner he can click into it and view the progress as well so in reality the Bounty Hunter will actually download the data which is now stored in Lighthouse storage and then do the local computation on his own machine compute the CK proof which we do have an example in our GitHub repo and then post all the necessary files that is required to accompany their CK proof so right now I'm just going to post some sample data we're going to sign twice here because we're using the lighthouse SDK to First encrypt the data the file and also allowing only the Bounty provider the Bounty owner to view the file so not anyone else so let me quickly upload all the necessary files and again for demo purpose we already have some known data that is known to be a valid CK proof that I'm going to fill in right here so now when the um Bounty is submitted uh our contract actually checked for the Integrity of the CID so it checks that the ckp actually matches the file that they're Computing uh and also um the validity of the ckp right so once I submitted you can see that now the Bounty Hunter Bounty provider can see all the submission files well again in reality he will download all these files check that it is the computation that he wants to be done before releasing the Bounty but we're just going to go ahead and do that right now so one thing that I didn't mention just now is that uh in step two when we're submitting the Bounty the computed results is actually hacked so this is to prevent the banking owner from prematurely seeing the results so now we're going to um the bad news Hunter is going to go ahead and unhatch the result so to claim the Bounty amount and again this hash is going to be checked in the smart contract right and on the left hand side you can see that the Bounty owner now sees the computer results five is the number that was in the original image and the second number here is just a salt that is within the hash and that's the end of our demo uh we welcome any feedback if you have any question or want to know more about our um project uh you can check out our GitHub repo and it will also live on this zcago.forsale.app right now thank you very much amazing oh this is really cool and I'm glad that uh people are tackling more of these types of competitions and actually doing competition on data that can be private so this is going to be a good Trend and even better for you to ship this and have others try it out too congrats okay and with that we are ready for our last demo for today this is our 12th finalist and without further Ado let's welcome data blocks hi the project that we built for the space for hackathon is called Data blocks a set of on-sain Primitives to unlock the full potential for data dials on the filecoin virtual machine one of the main narratives around fvm has been the enabling of data doubts a community where stakeholders work together to preserve valuable data sets in theory this has a lot of potential but without the right set of option Primitives we found out how to fully understand how data dials will work in practice this is where data blocks come in data blocks is a set of smart contract Primitives to provide the proper building blocks for establishing an incentive Align data dial on fem I'll explain the three pillars of data blocks with an example let's say I have a valuable data set and I want to start a data around it the first thing I'd be able to do is tokenize the data set itself using our data token standard data tokens are simply a new set of token standards that embed the pcid of data stored on the filecoin network such that the token itself can represent the underlying data on chain data tokenization enables buyers who have an interest in a data set to purchase this tokenized version such that the data dial can generate revenue and fund its treasury which brings us to a second element of data blocks the data.core contract the core contracts have three purposes first it acts as a verified registry for dated out tokens second it acts as a treasury for the Dow where all the revenue generated from the sales of the data data tokens will be accrued in this core contract and finally it facilitates on-chain governance allowing members to create vote on and execute on-champ proposals with their Dow token and collectively decide on how to manage this out of Treasury the final element of our project is data bounties modules to incentivize the preservation augmentation and innovation of the daos data sets these include storage bounties to incentivize the creation of storage deals for data sets Perpetual storage bounties that additionally incentivize anyone to find expiring storage deals on data sets and renew those storage bounties finally generic storage generic bounties for any open-ended tasks such that they may do computation bounties or data processing boundaries where gather submissions can be reviewed and voted on by a subset of down members called witnesses to ensure the quality of submission while getting a share of the reward for themselves as you can see data box creates a clear incentive alignment for data dials where data tokens build the treasury which can be used to incentivize and preserve and augment data sets and finally fund research to create new tokenized data sets to repeat this positive feedback loop now let's see a quick demo of what a data built on data bytes data blocks might look like here we have a data dial called astrolow that centers around astronomy data sets we see that as Treasury and a registry of all its data tokens if we click into this planet's data set we can see various stats about this tokenized collection such as volume and floor price and maybe the total royalties collected to the Dow we also see the individual tokens in this collection and also the pcid of the representing underlying data we can click in to see the representing data token contract on hyperspace testnet and also look at the underlying data that series of Json files that represents the actual data set for the tokenized data if we look into a single token we can also see its owner and also its price and most importantly you can see the underlying portion of this data set which is represented by this individual token for this example it's a data on a single exoplanet in its planet's data set now let's look at the Dallas governance process you can see here a list of proposals the broad range of proposals possible through our core governance contract like funding new research hosting Dow events or investing a portion of data house uh treasury if we click into one we see it's Associated on-chain transactions such as creating a storage mounting for a data set and if you're a dow token holder you can submit a vote for against this proposal once this proposal is settled and the vote is confirmed then it would be able to create a storage boundary on chain using the data dials treasury for the sake of time I've created a similar transaction earlier today that does the same property of creating a storage bounty on chain through the data that was treasury furthermore speaking of bounties we also have a list of data boundaries from the Dow here you can see all the storage boundaries for the data set owned by the style in this active one we can see it's reward amount it's investing schedule across epochs this is to ensure that the storage is reliable over time and so if you have a date if you have a deal ID for a storage deal that I made for a pcid associated with this bounty I claim on myself as a client and by doing so I would immediately start to invest some of the rewards from this storage Bounty and also showcase the remaining unbested rewards as such finally we have computation bounties where anyone can go and submit a computation for a particular data set on chain using a submission URI that's linked on ipfs and also witnesses can come in the dial we'll submit a review for these submissions and all the witnesses in the Dow including myself could go when the submission period is over to vote on their favorite submission and review and what that will enable us to do is reward the top submission and the top witness with the reward according to the share that was allocated in the beginning so hopefully that shows you a glimpse with data blocks enables you can find all our contracts and documentation on GitHub thanks for tuning in let's make data that was a reality thanks thank you so much congratulations on this amazing hack and uh we're seeing a lot of cool really amazing themes here so this is going to be even better when everybody can check it out and actually start integrating with all the other kind of cool things that we saw so this is great and with that we are done with our 12 amazing finalist demos I want to give a big shout out again to sepo file saber Collective ninja Dash C kaggle honest field data blocks Eclipse fill swap fvm Explorer at Fitness lookup and Cosmic chicken some really really incredible teams and projects and amazing themes around defy computational um just decentrals

congratulations to Hatchery dial spatial dial smart notary protocol fill nav feminine portal Memento Dow trustified Flex build DNA and fill swath All of You Are amazing here and congratulations to all of you for building on top of spiron and also winning multiple prizes and as of this moment all of these prizes are also visible on your showcase so if you head over to your own project or if you go to anyone else's project you can see what prizes they want so for those of you are going to catch up on this live stream after you can simply just check out your showcase URL for your own submission and this will also be reflected now on your dashboard and you'll see what prizes you want and the total amounts so with a quick note on price delivery is as follows all these things are tentative and not final which means that while we have a timeline for announcing all the prizes which is this live stream we do want to take our time to make sure that everybody did work on submitting projects as part of the event rules which means that while we were able to verify quite a few of these things already we are still in the process of looking at all 275 code bases and checking that nobody did something before this event that was not already declared with us or clarified with us or was breaking the rules which was porting an existing solidity contract to fathom so we'll be verifying all of that and only then we'll be sending these prizes which means that there is a chance that if something comes up we will change the winners and there might be one or two edge cases where they're reflected winners may not be the same as what's on the slides here that I just announced the other note here is that if you won a prize from the falcoin team that will be distributed separately by the protocol Labs team and not eat Global every other prize will be given to you by a global team and that is because there's a handful of kyc and compliance requirements that will come into play here so there are two separate entities delivering these prizes so please be patient as we verify everybody's prizes and make all of this available to to everybody um on uh on your uh addresses the prizes are will be given to you by the 17th of February which means a week from now and that'll be enough time for us to go through everything and confirm and lock in all the amounts and winners and for the ones that are being delivered by the protocol Labs team you'll get a separate email with a form that you'll have to fill out just clarifying A couple of things and then those prices will be delivered to you shortly after so congratulations again and let's try to wrap up the event in the next few minutes so before we close off and we want to say a few thank yous to everybody that made this event possible the first one is of course all of you as hackers 1042 of you who spent the last three weeks with us working tirelessly and excitedly on all of your projects we got to see only 12 of them here but there's 263 more that are available on global.com that you can check out and see and just see for yourself the excitement what could be possible here in this entire ecosystem so thank you to all
