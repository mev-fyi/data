okay we're good cool all right uh we are very excited to have today for this uh week four hackath session uh we've got two teams from hack money which was the previous youth global event actually the first online long-form hackathon that we had done uh it happened from may to the beginning of june and it's structured very similarly to what hack fest is right now so hopefully you'll be able to see it from the other side from their perspective after they've you know submitted their project gone through judging uh had a little bit of time to think about what their experience was and then maybe ask them some questions about the the entire process uh so we have two teams with us today the first is potion uh which is well i'll let them get the intros but it's uh potion and d5 dollar so potion wanna you just give a quick intro have your your team say hi and your names yeah so hello everyone my name is jordy uh just a really quick few words on potion uh it's a decentralized platform for insurance writing based on an amm approach and we have today from the team here uh guillem and christian as well go ahead uh hi guys hey guys uh uh hey guys i'm arpet uh from the team d5 and d5 dollar is an index of stable coins and like very happy to be here and like uh talking to you perfect um and so jordy has uh some slides he put together with his team which is excellent and he's gonna walk us through what their experience was um like i mentioned what they learned and if anybody has any questions use the raise hand function or just put it in the chat and uh we'll either pick it up at the end of the session or if jordy happens to see it and it makes sense to pause at that point he will he'll address it then but i'm very excited to hear from both teams and i'll let you start liberty thank you so much trent so guys i want to say uh first of all thank you so much to eth global for us hack money was an unbelievable experience and it's really cool to be here to be able to share um how the process worked for us um really quick introduction to the team uh christian is our ux and ui person he was also responsible for brand design and he's on the call to tonight gilem did financial engineering as well as some smart contract development he's also on the call and you'll be hearing from him fabienne front-end developer and full-stack developer ethan has very recently joined us he works on the protocol engineering and he's a full stack deaf and myself i worked on the financial engineering and also some some project management and today uh we thought it might be useful just to give you a quick intro into what potion is and perhaps give you a quick demo of the of the stuff we built for for hack money we also wanted to share kind of the back story for how we went through the hack money experience uh including the highlights and some low lights if i don't know how long that will take us but if we have time it would also be great to share some of the lessons we learned um also also at the personal level perhaps share a little bit of potions future and uh and do q a which by the way we can do throughout as well if uh if anybody has any questions over to you if you're talking yeah okay if you want to move me to the next slide we'll start with the with a big question on why did we build potion so if you have experienced any of the sites offered by existing defy option protocols you have probably noticed that there is very small selection of possible assets to be protected and you have to choose between a reduced set of strike and duration terms so you go to op in for for instance you try to insure your assets and you may only be able to do that for for ease and you have to choose between you know four options like for strike and duration combinations and so you cannot really create a bespoke experience so basically in the hackathon what we what we needed was a way to insure as many assets as possible let users select any strike that they wanted or any duration and basically what you have to build to get this is a general purpose insurance platform and that's what we what we tried to do so yeah potion basically is a decentralized network that runs on on ethereum and it's made functionalities to mean this erc20 cash settled put options and these are what we call potions so these potions are basically contracts between a buyer and a set of lps that issue assets against price drops and this is possible because there's this network of lps who provide collateral and this quadro is readily available to be locked inside any of these insurance contracts on demand so potion basically works as an amn because users on the buyer's side come to the protocol get their potions minted at the spot on a self-service basis so what's what schools about potion and what really sets the difference with the other option protocols as we said before is that a potion user can insure potentially any asset as long as this has a reliable price fit and then and and then she can use her own desired strike and duration terms for it and yeah now one of the most important features of potion is that it uses a predictable pricing engine a pricing system since it's an amm the system needs to have always a price quote readily available for the buyer and somehow this price needs to reflect the risk preferences of the lps who are underwriting these contracts and that's precisely what the what the price engine does and although for the sake of gravity we we won't get into detail here about such engine it's worth highlighting that it creates a like this totally new much more passive experience for the lp who can express her risk preference to the system and let the pricing engine actively manage her risk exposure and yeah finally bringing this easy intuitive fun user experience has been like a north star since the inception of potion and yeah i'll i'll try to walk you very quickly through that through the particular ux that we designed for the hackathon so basically the user comes to the platform you'll see that that he finds a unisop-like interface where he his basically asked like yeah what asset do you want to insure how many what's the quantity of this asset that you want to be sure tell us what is the strike price that you need tell us what is the expiry date that that you want to use sim as simple as that so yeah as you can see there's this an array of assets that the user can can choose to ensure our aim here is to provide both crypto native assets like ether changing or maker and but then as long as i said before as long as you have a reliable price fit for an asset you can bring it to potions potentially we can we can bring synthetics of you know a tesla sp 500 or whatever so yeah then as i said you can choose any expiry date so long as the lps on the platform are comfortable with taking uh this this long term position if need be and yeah basically once the user has set his options he gets like this receipt that is telling him what will happen with his insurance what will be you know the price that he would that he will incur to and that's basically it so then when when he gets a potion this is like a an open contract that he can he can go and exercise at some point and with that he will get back the the difference of the drop by drop price that he may experience and that's basically what we're exercising this potion means getting back the payoff of a good option right and he will simply see he will simply get that and that will be basically the end of the of the buyer proportion basically this this interface that you see is basically what we built what we released in a test net during the the hard money hacked over to you jordi perfect thank you william um so for me personally uh hack money was the first hackathon that i was a part of and it kind of blew my mind quite a bit and i thought it might be useful to share kind of how we went from zero to like having like zero lines of code to having this front-end operational on test net that gilliam just just showed you so actually gulem and i joined uh as the only two members of the team um we actually started with two different ideas we had this idea for a decentralized pension fund as well as a perpetual hedger and we actually didn't decide until a few days into the into the hackathon we actually uh in our initial design we wanted to use open as the defined lego to build on top of but then as we started digging into the architecture then we realized that maybe it was not going to be sufficient for what we wanted to do i think like around uh 10 days in or something we managed to get the third team member to join he was somebody with a solidity experience and it really complemented us we were incredibly lucky to get amazing support from a lot of the d5 platforms that we wanted to rely on so for example we had engineering calls with uh mike mcdonald at balancer we had long uh discord chats with alison at uma and then for their calls with regina and nikpai at uma so yeah they became super available to us and allowed us to continue refining the architecture i think it wasn't until like kind of halfway through that we had the first functional design dock it was quite interesting to have the idea landed on a document because then this document it was something that we were able to share with uma and share with balancer and ask the question are we on the right track it like is are our ideas actually executable you know to avoid you know running into any dead ends um and so that was uh that was good but we still needed the extra talent in the team and we identified that we needed somebody to make our stuff look uh nice and sexy and pretty and we actually launched a call on twitter uh just just that's a broadcast saying we need a ux designer and uh stanley from avi was incredibly generous in actually retweeting and that's how we found the fourth team member christian who's on the call and we will speak in a few moments uh who turned out to be like like a godsend like an incredibly talented uh ux designer uh 10 days to go we kind of started getting nervous that we were not going to be able to ship everything that we had in mind and so we kind of changed the scope and we cut it in half we got to have to decide what is it that we can actually ship you know considering we have 10 days left uh amazingly uh i think something like eight days to go uh by the time we didn't potion as a name didn't exist we didn't have any branding it was still just a concept uh so eight days to go uh christian like just in a matter of 48 hours came up with like what you're seeing like all the graphic design that you're all the branding system he came up with it like super quickly and then we had like a bit of a team crisis uh which i thought was useful to share here uh basically one of the team members was actually working on two separate teams and we were struggling to meet the commitments and keeping the deadlines and it just felt like like the person that was responsible for the front end the consider we had seven days to go and we had not started on the front end it just it just felt like it was not gonna happen and so we had to take the the difficult decision to see to replace that person um and then we we launched another broadcast and actually heather from eth global was unbelievably helpful in fact josh heather trent you know they were incredibly helpful throughout but in this case uh on the advice of heather we were able to uh make a connection with fabienne who's an incredibly talented uh full-stack developer and uh yeah like literally in in four days he was able to uh put together the entire front end but i just wanted to share that uh like this was uh the last five days were incredibly incredibly intense it was like a a lot of uh like long days uh short sleeping cycles and but we just kept pushing kept pushing kept pushing and i think like the whole team rallied around the idea that we were gonna do this you know that we just started believing that we were gonna get there uh and we we had a lot of problems but just just as you got an idea we actually we had to submit this was 6 a.m barcelona time and it was 5 30 in the morning and their thing was still not running and we actually decided to start recording the video presentation with the thing not running just to be able to submit something and just magically somehow managed to get the thing running and the first successful run was actually the one that we recorded for the submit so uh i think it was like destiny uh you know what was had this waiting for us and uh yeah the the feeling was unbelievable you know the fact that uh it was such an unexpected success i think galvanized the team together uh like we really felt like we had come together and and created a team that was uh able to accomplish things and i think it gave us a like a a spirit of like a uh empowerment you know that we you know we we had been able to ship something that we felt really proud of and i think that that's when potion came together started feeling a as a team you know something that could go beyond just just hack money we were super lucky to get invited into the ideal product validation which was another huge design sprint but unbelievably uh useful highly recommended experience for anybody going through any emotions like this and then very quickly after going through this we started getting uh inbound calls from uh investors and uh and and vcs suggesting that uh this was something that uh had some legs and that they wanted to help us make it to to mainnet uh i'll tell you a little bit more about uh that in a moment um how are we doing for time trent i just wanna make sure that we're not we're good okay so gilem why don't you share some of your personal learnings sure so basically i wanted to say that we started the hackathon with this like an open mind but at the same time with like two main ideas that that we wanted to try out we didn't really know the exact shape of those but we knew the general scope they were like extremely different ideas and we kind of try to push for them in parallel through the community basically looking for team members and people you know sponsors interested to join in some way or another we quickly realized one of the ideas was too complex and basically people weren't really buying into it but the other we felt was perceived a bit more sexy by the rest of the participants this whole idea was potion and we quickly moved to it and put all the energy into it and i think i think this was yeah so defining the general scope of the project uh at the early beginning and being open to feedback of the community was crucial to move quickly into success in our case yeah and personally as the person who developed the sort of a smart contra exploring potion i i benefited a lot from studying super intensively because of the protocols that i like and i thought were directly useful for our idea uh so for me it's super important to go to the source code asap learn get inspired and yeah since we're so lucky these protocols are world crafts and actually they are open source so yeah like incredible learning groups perfect christian yes so i want i want to share my experience telling my lessons and personal perspectives so i i want to say uh as first lesson to design a product product for people not users this is a more an advice for people then uh as not a a design background but [Music] believe me design matters then uh i wanna light that build and enter genius and balance balancing team will empower your product because uh when you when you face problem with different people you empower yourself and for sure passion defeats all obstacles or deadlines and commitments and regarding my personal perspectives i i want to say thanks to the hack money because now i have the chance to to be fully employed in the defy industry i have the chance to to meet the strong default builders and visioners in this ecosystem and for sure i have the opportunity to be part of this decentralized revolution so thank you akmoney was a great great experience absolutely thank you so much so yeah i think uh like i share a lot of those views for me one thing that struck me very much is how accessible everybody was in defy i think there is an incredible spirit in the community uh all the founders are incredibly accessible so you know anyone going through the hacker fest right now if if you're being shy about uh approaching these people don't be i think there is a like this energy uh in dfi and crypto that is quite unique um i actually think that hackathons are an incredible platform for innovation um like in in my recent uh past we were trying to start a uh a startup and uh i think doing what we did for hack money would have taken a lot longer and a lot of money and i just think it's an incredible opportunity to do quick prototyping uh um in an environment that incredibly facilitates recruitment so for example when we when i approached christian or fabienne the fact that we had 88 global behind it was something that people were able to understand and that we were willing to work for free which is something quite quite unique um i also think that for us it made a huge difference the fact that we uh didn't start from zero on the code we forked existing code which meant that like from from the get go we were working on something that was already working you know and we were just refining and repurposing but we were starting from a working platform i think like in hindsight maybe some of the tough decisions that we had to take uh perhaps we had to we should have taken them earlier um so yeah that's a a personal reflection uh keep pushing until then uh trent was just sharing that you guys have like one week left i think you have submit uh next thursday uh when we were in our case one week to go we had still a lot to go so keep pushing and you can get there and i think i already said this but for me uh getting to submission with something of the quality that we were able to ship just uh created like an incredible feeling of of accomplishment and and empowerment the ability to do some great stuff on um on crypto and defy which i think is an incredible opportunity uh and then yeah just a few words on on what's next for us we've we've actually seen shipping to test net we've developed and refined a new architecture it's now a full amm with a a radical new take on pricing it's now a combination of a market-driven system with uh like special deterministic uh secret sauce uh we've we have plans to ship a risk management app that is actually built on top of potion which is the initial perpetual headser we always wanted to to build uh we are in the process of closing our round of finance uh which is incredibly exciting for us it's gonna allow us to capitalize the project to create a stable development team and go full time into the development of potion uh we're in the process of uh recruiting we wanna reinforce the team and in fact if anybody listens listening to this is like a crazy talented ethereum developer by all means uh reach out to us control the discord and talk to us and for sure the you know our north star is launching to mainnet and that's that's it um i'm happy to take any questions now or after our pizza has gone through d5 dollar whichever way you want to play trent uh that was a really amazing story you just shared i'm glad there was a bunch of things that i hadn't known about before and that graph that you had shared of the timelines was really really great to see everything in context the problems you faced um so again thank you for that thank you i think yeah we'll move um arpit do you want to put your video on and then we can just get some questions from you and then open it up for general discussion from anybody [Music] yeah you gotta mute there oh sorry so i i also have slides uh is it okay yeah for sure go ahead okay oh can you guys see it yeah like so uh before i start with d5 order right so building d5 at hackmoney was an incredible experience right and like for some background i have been to countless global hackathons i've been to eath india i took a 22 hour long flight to participate in eat san francisco i was at eat singapore right so i'm a big fan of youth global people and like just love participating in each global academics because they are so well organized and all the people are there are so approachable right the organizers the sponsors and uh the level of innovation that happens during you know uh two days in like the in-person hackathons and like over one month in virtual hackathons it's just incredible right and i think someone said that like after hack money concluded someone said that in the amount of innovation that happened in last month was probably equivalent to 10 years of innovation in traditional finance right and i think that's very powerful right so at hackmoney uh we built uh d5 uh which is a indexed obviously the index of stable coins right and i'll talk more about it so we are a team of four uh i marpith and siddharth joined us later for like all the business growth and partnership things right and during hackmany with me were deep deep and like crazy talented designer deep and front-end guy manthan uh sorry they couldn't join us today because it's quite late in india uh yeah right so why do we need an index table coin right uh actually yeah let me just jump to this one so there's a lot of talk about you know stable coins moving from their bag right uh none of the stable coins are trading exactly at one dollar or if it is something that we hear about a lot and then with centralized stable coins there's a custodian risk uh again like uh talk of the twitter and obviously like if you have a large net worth of your if you have your net a large portion of your net worth and stable coins you don't want to lose it because tether goes to zero right uh that would suck so uh that is that and then with stable contact dive which are awesome but then you know there's always this so much discussion about extensive governance that is required to actually keep it on its peg right so uh to an extent there's a barrier to it uh and of course volatility which i just spoke about so we thought you know because there are so many stable coins centralized and decentralized and each of them have their own pros and cons uh we thought why not you know take a middle way and build an index of stable coins which tries to get gets the good parts of every coin and subsidize or let's say you know provide a failure cushion for the bad parts uh that's what we are trying to make so it's an index of stable coins or that also uses d5 primitives to stay near the dollar mark and subsidize the collateralization ratio so uh actually we have changed our mechanism quite a bit now but uh this is what we built during hack money right and i want to share this first because this is more interesting so what we do is like for d5 dollar which is just a stable coin you meant that using already existing stable coins because it it's an index of the existing stable codes so during hype money what we built was uh you get stable coins uh and the our contract the default smart contract puts them in our way and then the smart contract gets the a tokens back right so now smart contact owns income generating it's like we lost the audio connection there uh you can't hear me [Music] okay can you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you oh okay okay right so what happens is like once you get stable coins they are deposited in harvey and then the smart contract gets a tokens back and then they are deposited in a balancer pool right so balancer is a protocol for like it's like uni swap but more configurable so if you put assets in a balancer pool basically if there are any arbitrage opportunities that open up people can basically you know make profit out of it but at the same time keeping your pool at the desired ratio so this is what we wanted to do so if let's say die goes to one point zero two and two usc is still at one dollar or let's say it goes below one dollar right so people will arbitrage and then try to get those pools at the uh the same price right uh like if they were 100 of each and if ti is at 1.02 uh there will be some arbitrage opportunity and what happens is in the balancer pool die will be less than number and 2usd will be more in number but like the consequences that the pools are still balanced uh and at the same time the protocol is getting trade fees from interest from our way and the trade free from the balancing so this was the original idea right but then we realized that uh for all of this curve is a very good abstraction right because they do lending behind the scenes and they are also a very efficient amm for stable coins so which simply means more income for the five dollar protocol so like to abstract all of these we now changed our design quite a lot and then we are building the five dollar curve finance now so this is g5 dollar in its current form right uh so it is backed by curve finance lp tokens and we have taken a model approach to integrating with curve pools so based on community deliberation it's uh very easy to add a new curve pool to the d5 dollar system so if if people say that there's a particular pool a curve pool that is really good that is giving really good yield uh it's super simple for us to integrate with that right and when we launch which we are looking to launch in uh about two weeks 15th august but depends on the audits so uh yeah we'll be starting with like one or two curve pools and the federal is a more robust and stable asset while holders accrue yield farming rewards from underlying protocols right so because we are depositing uh the stable coins in curve while there's a d5 which is totally liquid and the underlying assets are deposited in curve and whatever the heat farming benefits we get from curve we'll be distributing that to the d5 dollar holders right in that ratio and there is one final mechanism uh which is the d usc stickers accrue lending and creating free rewards by contributing towards spec safety so i'll talk about a little about how that works right but before that we actually ran simulations on the data from the last four months uh assuming that the usc is backed by die and sust right and uh if you look at the price d5 is the one in green and based on a simulation from real data from the last four months that actually comes out to be quite stable right in a lot of scenarios so the new thing that we introduced after after we were done participating in hack money right was the staking mechanism uh which is an additional safety layer to protect the d5 dollar bag right so what happens there is uh once you make d5 dollars you can stake it in the protocol there's a native staking mechanism and stake d usd acts as additional uh collateral for the usc in circulation right so let me take a simple example let's say there are 110 usd or the usd all right and alice she has 10 duise and she decides to stick them in the protocol now effectively state coins are a question for volatility which means that uh because they are not in circulation so uh the hundred dollars the hundred d usd which are in free circulation are essentially backed by 110 dollars right so over collateralized uh that is how we maintain our collectorization right and if let's say the peg was failing let's say tether is going to 0.9 or it is failing still right 100 d usd would be backed by 100 because the underlying assets have fallen and at that point the staked the funds will become illiquid right but that is only in the unlikely scenario of any one underlying stable coins failing but for the people who did not stick their dusd is still that one dollar but what is it in it for the stakers right so all the protocol income that is being generated from finance from those 110 dollars goes to the stickers so even if that is like five percent and you get five dollars on 110 all of that goes to alice who deposited 10. so for that for her it's 50 apr so that is the idea like if you have the risk appetites take them and you get a higher higher apr uh that is the idea that we introduced right and uh v1 v0 which is what we made during hackmoney is already on coven but as i said over the last month we changed a lot of things and we released the v1 spec which was received very warmly by the ethereum community very thankful for that and yeah like uh investors reached out to us and uh like we have a team going and we'll be launching we are hoping to launch this in a couple weeks so very interesting well and uh if you're interested in the project then join our discord or like reach out to us on twitter and stuff right and uh i think yeah as jordy also mentioned the best part about participating in hackathons and especially global hackathons is you know the accessibility all the d5 founders are so accessible you just ping them on telegram they'll reply uh the 8th global organizing team is so helpful i mean i have been trained over little issues and uh like helping out even after the hackathon and uh like all of this stuff is amazing and i think one thing which i would really like to mention is you know like there's a lot of opportunity in d5 and blockchains in general because you know this all of this infrastructure is so early basically anything that anything that you build out there is even if it's a little reasonable right there will be people to help you out and like fine tune your model and you will be able to launch so yeah like like launch two minutes so if you have an idea right talk to your users talk to your potential users talk to fellow hackers talk to the sponsors that you're building in and they'll help you and they'll help you make your model bulletproof and then just try to make a submission during the hackathon right and things will work out it's really amazing yeah interestingly like for me the blockchain journey started with you know uh so i got super interested in blockchain and then i quit my job uh and i was only 15 days into it and i learned a bit of solidity and then someone from india teams reached out you know on twitter and they said that you should participate in this india hackathon and i totally thought that you know i don't really know anything so it's probably useless to participate in this hackathon for me but i actually did because the city that they were doing it in all of my friends live there so i thought you know i might as well go and meet my friends but then we ended up winning that uh and since then i've never looked back been in the blockchain space for two years uh participating in more hackathons so i think this is a brilliant opportunity and even if you're not built anything right now one and a half week is like enough time for you guys to build anything that you want right so just go out there and yeah build and feel free to like reach out to us with the portions team to us or like anyone else if you have any idea that you want to discuss awesome thank you for sharing our pit um i think at this point we can see if there are any questions from those two presentations and then uh just after that we will move into you guys can talk i know jordy already touched on this but um what the video creation experience was like what the submission process was like for each each of you and then um what the judging session was like but christian if you want to ask your question you can unmute or write it in the chat that's fine what's with me yep um will it be like your juice in a bank or something a u.s dollar a cat like in paypal we can choose to save saving the money in oil or u.s dollars accounts will this could be the same douche and the account and so uh you can pay it backwards only yeah crypto value for itself it pauses i tried to write it i think that's the question for arpa yeah uh brent could you help me like uh understand a bit uh sorry yeah i think he's he might be asking what the what the uh dusd is denominated in or maybe just give a short summary of of how that mechanism works how which make it is it um maybe i misunderstood christian can you summarize again in paypal you have to use some account and example dollars oil or danish grounds to where you shall pay or get money to will this the u.s dollar will it could be in the same spot in the account uh in for example paypal or i only in d5 for itself yeah i think i think their product is only for d5 right now okay exactly so like uh i think our thought right now is building a stable coin which reduces the systemic risk in d5 right so there are like uh eight to eleven billion dollars worth of stable coins and if one stable coin fails like we are very bullish on d5 we don't want d5 to you know fail just because that's stable confirm so right now we are trying to build a stable coin which reduces the system risk in d5 right and we'd be very happy if the five dollar becomes the choice of stable coins in d5 right but that said you know longer term if it works out you could probably see you know us building it into a de facto savings account or like uh what if we built an asset that is backed by fiat uh something like libra right so what what if we build an asset that is backed by something like currencies from a lot of countries right and then you could redeem b d usc d five or like whatever the asset that'll be called at that point uh you could redeem that for your choice of currency in your country right so uh possibilities are endless yes but right now yes we are focused on define thank you both um the next question is in the chat from jay and this is applicable for both projects but especially jordy because you had some some teammates shift around but his question is how did you handle participants sharing in the ownership of ongoing projects after the hackathon so jordy why don't you start with that um so yeah this is a little tricky because uh obviously the nature is uh totally open source so we believe in openness and i think part of the spirit in in defy is making it accessible to everybody and by making it open you also invite contributors to uh to participate and so for us we didn't uh we didn't have any particular uh concerns uh in our discord there are some sections that are uh like specific like private to the to the core members where we're like cooking some stuff that's maybe not not ready for for consumption but actually we're considering whether we should do 100 of the development in the open um um but uh yeah for with regards to the specific uh team member like uh the discord that say that this course was totally open um so we were actually we're not that that concerned about that what about you arpit or if any other teammates from uh ocean want to chime in on that feel free i i can make a shot so yeah uh in our case like uh i don't really think this you know as such some intellectual property or something that we want to protect right if if there is a better team out there who wants to fork our code we'll probably be you know feel flattered at least right now because that gives us validation and you know if some team can build a better version out of it i'd be very happy so that's not really a concern because uh i think at least for me blogs and spirit is all about being open source and uh you know like forget but responsibly because if you're gonna get users like then you're responsible for them so uh that is one thing and in terms of you know ownership of the projects so uh does it mean which team a member handles what type or do you mean like who gets what equity in either case i think in our case or it's all of us friends who are building this project so uh that's not really a problem because we just want to like you know uh build stuff and launch and then you know talk money later if you're talking about equity but in terms of ownership i think if that was your question then it's very good to have a balanced team which means that if you have a designer a front-end guy and a back-end smart contact sky then that team is very balanced if that was your question so if you have these members then you can really build build a good project yeah yeah he did have one follow-up in the chat which is are you concerned about another entity claiming you're infringing on their intellectual property uh not yet because we haven't really thought about these things yeah because i i think all of this stuff is like still very new right i don't think there are two people doing the same thing right now because uh even when i talk to people who are very technical in the web to space but not in blockchain you know they are just blown away with the things that we are creating because things like uni swap or balancer right or order booklets trading it just blows them away so i think uh i don't think there are two people building the same thing right now awesome um looks like we clear those up but if anybody has questions that we didn't touch on yet just drop them in the chat we'll get to them um but we want to be mindful of time um i know it's late for our bit so let's let's jump to a few questions about the the video process um if we had more time i would i would have us watch the videos that you submitted and then we could kind of critique and analyze but maybe that'll have to be for another time um and i'll drop them into the hackathos chat actually i think they're already in the schedule channel but let's let's just uh talk about how did you approach making your video was it an insane challenge to get it under four minutes tell us a little bit about that and start with our bit yeah actually for us i think it was good that we had to submit a video right because then you know specifically what you have to deliver because if it's just repository code or then you know you tend not to complete it but if you have a deliverable you know that you have four minutes to showcase everything i think that is very good so in our case like we had a lot to speak about and we also had a nice demo to show thanks to our front end guy and design guy so i think that was a very cool experience and in terms of video you know try to so it's basically your elevator pitch so uh take some time to explain your concept and take some time to show the demo because yeah it it needs to be balanced balanced so if your project is very straightforward you can directly jump to the demo and then walk through it so it just uh really you know depends on how you want to do it but uh yeah like it's good to have like a couple minutes to showcase your concept and then a couple minutes to showcase your demo uh i think that is very good and i think uh that also makes the judges life very easier right because if they can see what video you made in and and basically that gives you the judges the entire idea about what you made right so uh also it gets shared around a lot so just make a good video and uh you know it's i think it's a very good investment in terms of efforts that you'll put sometimes it can be a little intimidating to you know do it but as jody also mentioned that you know the final thing that was driving them in the last 30 minutes was actually making that video so i think uh yeah that is the most fun part of the project awesome yeah i i i share uh our pit's views there um i think for us it was it was a challenge uh getting within the four minutes um and i think in hindsight if we had to do it again i think we might do it differently the way we approached it is we really wanted to explain everything that we have done and there was a fair amount of complexity and we wanted to really go into some of the details because we were proud of it uh but perhaps we didn't realize that uh for somebody that maybe is not uh like a derivative trader or an option trader some of those concepts might be just impossible to digest uh let alone in four minutes we actually were quite the uh extreme on like cutting the silences so like i think we start with like we couldn't make it shorter than six minutes and we had to literally like edit the video to remove every single little piece of silence and uh i think that that's that was the wrong approach if we although i think that in the end of the video i think conveys some quality and and goodness i think we could have uh done a better job if we had stayed at a higher level and try to simplify and just explain the the concept of the at a very high level uh i think the judge like during the judging uh you could you could see uh the judges faces they kind of liked it but uh they were not a hundred percent uh there so yeah my advice would be keep it simple uh have fun um and and like arbitrage it's a good investment because it's going to stay there forever and you don't know who's going to be watching it and it could be something that has a big impact on on your future yeah exactly just to add a note like as you start to you know figure out how you're gonna describe your your project in four minutes it may feel impossible to fit these complex ideas with this thing you've been working on for a month like how do you explain this in four minutes but you just have to know that it is it's possible it's very challenging but the key thing to know is that you want to explain your project concisely because the judges are going to be looking at this for the first time ever they don't necessarily need to know every single feature but like jordy said start at a high level be concise um you know really uh set time set limits on how much time you give to each section of your project so you want to be able to have enough time where you're not rushing through it you don't have to do these editing uh tricks where you're cutting out silence or we had some people last time where they would speed it up by like 1.25 speed and that just makes it impossible for the judges to understand what's going on um if you're speeding up the the vocals so um like i said it might feel impossible but feel free to reach out and send drafts of your video to anybody from the youth global team or myself i'll be focusing a lot on this so yeah um maybe we can quick get a quick description of like the judging experience itself um it's pretty straightforward the basic format everybody if you haven't read it there's a doc in your info center that just lays out you'll have the four minutes for your video and then you can talk over it or just use your your pre-recorded vocals and then there's i think three quite three minutes for judges to ask questions to get more context for things but jordy uh do you want to start by talking about the judging experience and yeah yeah so uh i think it can be a little nerve-wracking because you know you're live you're being recorded sticks are high you want to make a good impression uh but then when you're there it kind of goes really quick and uh the judges at least in our case were super nice we watched a lot of judging and i think they're all people from the industry they're very smart so it was good i think uh um for me if i had to give advice it would be to try to to the extent that you can be concise you know like i think there is sometimes a tendency to try to overexplain stuff to make sure that people get it but you don't have that much time so if you can kind of land the key message and kind of stop yourself from rambling um i think i think that's uh that's good yeah one approach i've seen here is you can actually write out questions that you maybe can expect from judges write that out and prepare your answers ahead of time so you don't you're not caught unexpecting or you're not having to answer something that's completely unknown to you i'm trying to prep for that arpeggio yeah i think for me i just uh considered judges as my friends right because uh whatever questions they ask finally they'll help you polish your product so like you build something you obviously love it right and so so i just think that you know the questions won't be very hard because does it that this just had four minutes to that you right and you have spent an entire month on it so you're gonna just do fine and just that you know whatever questions they ask they are probably going to be for what their users will ask you right so i think just use that as very good feedback and uh yeah i think it's a great experience yeah that's a really good perspective um i know their their title is judge but in reality they're more like they're there to give you feedback they're there to help you understand what you've built a little bit better and see where your explanations or your video maybe isn't highlighting some features that are really important or really useful yup yup can i add something really quickly there something that was useful to me is actually before um going to the judging i tried to explain the the project to my to my parents to my mom and my dad and this was actually a really useful experience because uh when they finally understood it kind of gave me a super clear uh feedback on okay if if we explain it like this then people catch it you know uh and so yeah that that might be interesting uh feedback to get ahead of the ahead of the session yeah that's a really great really great strategy explain it are your parents are your parents available too i think they might be maybe yeah in spanish or catalan but uh but yeah we'll add them to the mentor list yeah that's a great perspective explain it to somebody who is not familiar with crypto or d5 or you know it really forces you to boil it down to the basic concepts right anybody else have any questions um i know i had a few more written down but i think we may have covered most of them we talked about the video we talked about judging um the last week is definitely going to be a sprint for a lot of people you know as they're trying to tie down all their loose ends and get something that they can submit so this next week is going to be intense let's see if there are any questions in the chat or if anybody wants to unmute just ask it that's also fine then i don't have to repeat what you've written see we haven't heard from a couple people i'm not going to call you out but um this is meant to be for hackers you know to learn to get some some additional perspective so don't be afraid to unmute and just ask if not sounds like everybody is confident they know what they're doing for the next week they're they're ready to go we could probably wrap there i'm really glad that we recorded this so we have you know documentation of the stories for other hackers who weren't able to make this so it'll be available on the youth global youtube page um really great stories and um you know context from what you both experience your entire teams so again thank you for coming and sharing this art pit for staying up late um this is really really insightful stuff and i'm sure it'll be helpful to all the hackers thank you jen pleasure thank you any final words from you your teams or anybody who's here jordy it looked like your audio cut out i don't know if you said something uh i'm just uh for me i'd say uh like something that arpit said really resonated with me which is uh uh when he started like he he didn't know much solidity yet uh when he went to er eth india and and for us it was a little bit the same you know we we didn't have incredible smart contract development so uh just go for it you know and uh yeah just keep pushing and uh you know this week a lot of things can change so you know keep the positivity there and you know ask for help and you know good things will happen but give it a go you know don't don't uh don't quit yeah like if you make a demo video you're already in the 90th percentile so just just make something yeah great i think we could probably wrap there um i'll include links to both of those projects in the hack fest chat so if you're curious about what they're what they're doing what they did and where they're going in the future you can connect with them i'm sure they'd be more than happy to provide some feedback there thank you everybody for showing up and thank you for the teams thank you so much guys bye guys nice talking cheers have a good weekend and happy next week hacking
