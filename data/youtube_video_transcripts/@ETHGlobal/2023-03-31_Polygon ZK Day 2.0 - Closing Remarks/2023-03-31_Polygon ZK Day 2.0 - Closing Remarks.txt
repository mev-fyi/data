foreign [Applause] [Music] and David have been the pillars and the enablers of what we're celebrating today so I'm sure you're gonna have some really great messages thank you okay thanks Elise okay then to close the confidential after two hours I will try to keep it short but when this morning or close the world servant Jody was Raising that there were three secrets to create a the the platform I think he was missing the more important one that that also Grace just mentioned okay and that's a team I mean this has been a high performative what I have seen engineered with 20 years of experience working in a very humble way supporting whatever it was required where there was a support and backup thing creating a battle and avoiding any kind of noise for for the team and yes from from the the more senior guy to the more Junior day everybody was supporting and was was really trying to collaborate and I think this is something that we should never underestimate because one work or one task like this one it cannot be done by a single person okay then at the same time when these days we were in the final stage and there was two o'clock in the morning where still there was a lot of pressure we shouldn't under underestimate that because we're delivering but people was nervous were fixing things what I always saw is that people was laughing and I think this is very important clothes this kind of passion is enjoying the work although obviously when you play at the highest level uh pressure is there and and but at the same time how they were totally engaged with the project this is something that I will keep always on my heart and I will never forget and and yes and then things thanks to the beam I think that's that's something very important also to the whole organization the co-founders the other teams the corporate and Deputy teams thanks thanks for everything this could have been impossible without all olive oil without one volleyball and and then the second part that also I want I want a little bit to to raise you to my experience is that uh what I think that zkbm will allow us is to become mainstream okay there are a lot of use cases and we never spoke we've spoken a lot about that no in gaming in the file in payments in supply chain chain in packeting in nxts that what were this kind of scalability was required this is what I see in that that the kitten can bring to the next level because it will be seamless for developers and for for any kind of company or Enterprise supports to join us but always with the in the security and the soundness of ethereum and I think this could be very important than I am correct on all the possible Partners or developers to to join us when when and and yes I hand over to my my colleague David thanks Anthony well how would they go most of what you said um I I will start with uh getting things getting thanks to to his Global for setting up this event meaning thanks to to Vitality he's very busy all these panelists all these participants this was an amazing event so we really appreciate that uh also I would like to to start giving thanks to to the team that's Anthony was saying the the team not only this this harvesting the security team but also the whole polygon team because this is a a joint success for everyone I don't want to to basically one but we have the CK teams me serum item Market incomes engineering security team applications operations for Partnerships Megan the whole team it was amazing the thank you for your patience uh just supporting this launch because it was very aggressive and intense but uh it was it was a pleasure to work with you on and you see a whole success for the whole team also would like to to give thanks to the Auditors team because as we have discussing the holiday uh Securities uh main topic and the main concern for us they were super helpful they were super patient also because this is a very Noble technology very complex uh things to throughout it documentation needs some improvement still at this stage so it was challenging for everyone but we feel very comfortable about security this stage to to get to maintenance and uh one from my side I will also would say that uh I think I mentioned later before this song is the beginning um we have um a lot of things to do we put a high effort to implement this as we discussed uh in the the process and the form that we consider the right way uh with respected the times of development we opened the source code we uh did some some test Nets where we learned a lot of experiences we we did battle testing we managed to to ship thousands of serolog proofs then we did the secret reviews Jordi was saying for the last five months we basically are refactoring things to improve but basically security fixes and understanding of reviews which was uh the big concern for us because the approval was already implemented since the since October last year but still we managed to to make the most of this time also we have a super long backlog of issues and things to improve because uh you know the technology is Supernova we are in the stage where we feel it's material enough and practical to launch maintenance but uh we have uh several nights of work I would say the main concept where we started the project was even for us thinking on how we could build a proverb that's practical uh it was a contribution of zero Maiden basically technology of zero enhance the the performance by 40 times which was basically the difference between being practical or not but I remember compensation with Jordan the beginning of the project we were thinking on data centers or how we could prove all these polynomials and it was super challenging for us so we started this process of improvement until we got to a point that we are able to to run proofs in a single server per hour and we are able to to do a proof of 10 million gas and under 3 million of time so for us we get to a stage where Brooks are not a concerned anymore and we are not also creating a big deal of a cost for users so this is I would say the big achievement we got at this stage but the network is uh sequence improvements because this is the that beta magnet but still we need to improve a lot in terms of uh I would say we discuss activity but we have to improve also in the cost Solutions because now the biggest cost in the in the sagascares for useless bullying be basically data availability layer one and this is something uh we made decisions that improve uh the future of the centralization but still we can apply some optimizations in this path and this is pending and also what we need to do beyond that is uh to accelerate sequencing and to improve the transactions from second rate because in the end this was a stability project and this is what all was about so this is the what we have to do from now today we will stay we will take some time to celebrate of course this is a big achievement but tomorrow we continue on this path of improvement and let's say complaintness of the project also we would like to become very soon a type 2C kbm and there are some things we already know how to do I'm willing to apply but this is a path that will take uh you know during the next month our potentially the whole year so after this event we got metallic doing the first symbolic transaction I really appreciate that it was amazing they both he was put in the transaction but shortly after this event is over we will publish the axis of the main net beta in this polymer website in Social in blog so anyone can get access to the network and say public is permissionless and we put Anthony already said we would invite developers and users to to test what's the the flavor and the the feeling of this evm equivalents in the C cover lab which was the the original objective and the big deal of all of it and of course we are super happy to achieve this and we are open to feedback because some things might happen but we want to learn from this experience from users and we hope everyone enjoys the network and we can skate together a lot and we can get a you know feedback and receive contributions also because we are super open to any one contribution but uh this uh celebration for us and an important Milestone and we hope everyone enjoys it and yeah thank you so much for 47 thanks everyone for the support and see you soon I hope thanks for having opinion
