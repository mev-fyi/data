the fourth session or if this is your first uh it doesn't matter we're excited to have you anyway um paul i i'm kind of interested to hear a little bit about you um thanks for joining us first of all we'd love to hear a little bit about uh sort of your background and and how you guys started with op games cool yeah thank you luke and i i got the sentiment that i'm i'm happy to see people spending time hacking over a weekend so i hope this use this uh session is pretty useful for everyone um but i can start with talking a little bit about ob games uh op games where uh i would say we're also a game development company we started out making games in 20 like i had a company called altitude games making games starting out in 2014 and and when 2017 came around we discovered blockchain and that was kind of the impetus for us to start opi games and ob games is has always really been focused around helping game developers be successful in blockchain so so that's the mission uh that we have always had in mind and that's the reason why we want to do this hard with everyone we want people to realize what can be done with web3 and help them realize that and give them the tools needed to be able to do that and yeah i'm really looking forward to to sharing what we have and to uh getting any questions that you guys might have at the end of the presentation awesome well thank you as he mentioned we'll be taking questions at the end so feel free to drop them in the chat and we will get to them but paul the floor is yours uh thank you for for joining us again looking forward to hearing the presentation thank you thank you luke all right yeah so uh so yeah so i'll get started so uh this is the my presentation on what uh what we want to what we're hoping the hackers have built with us on uh build quest and uh i'll be talking a bit about arcadia which is our platform and uh and why we're building it and and why we're looking for the kinds of games that we are looking for here we go and i guess it's best for me to just play this video and talk through it as it plays uh it shows some of the games that we have on arcadia but essentially arcadia is an html5 platform and i'm i say html5 because that's that's really the focus that we have right now on uh ob games we feel that html5 is is precisely the platform that needs to be disrupted by webg a lot of game developers on html5 don't really have options in monetization they don't have options on distribution and and they don't have uh options of discover discoverability as well so arcadia is that we are hoping to make it a distribution and uh discover discovery channel for html5 games and um and some of the games here all the games are html5 but they run the gamut of genres we have casual games uh we have uh very simple hyper casual games like prisca which is one of the more popular games we have we have a more complicated game like um like the game we're building called arcadium arena which is a game that uses nfts that allows you to to compete against other owners of the nfts so what so to talk a little bit more about the bounties we're looking at three games three html5 games that we were hoping to put on arcade the best game will be awarded two thousand dollars and then we'll get two other ones which will be awarded a thousand dollars each and for the criteria the game should be deployed on a live url so uh that means it should be live you can use netlify or whatever hosting that you want to put it up and another important thing is the game must use uh some of the build quest sponsor api so i think that's quite unique and what we're doing we're in we want to incentivize people to use our other partner apis and the reason for that is in the third point which is on the bonus points we champion open gaming which is something i'll talk a little bit more and open gaming is really an exploration of what what what games look like if the game is open source so if your game is open source then that would give you bonus points for the body definitely and we do realize also that making games is hard it's 12 days of making a game uh will not allow you to build a really polished game and our plan is we will be looking at all the games that are submitted on build quest and we we do have a support platform for games after the hackathon we have the gm friends accelerator wherein we we kind of incubate games that that are building on the future of f3 so the goal here is if we see games that are very promising from the hackathon then we would love to work with you further on gm friends and yeah and and i guess the next the the rest of the slides i'll be talking about open gaming and then i'll be talking a little bit more about how to get started with html5 games but uh when i say open gaming a lot of it was born out of the exploration of what if games were what if all games were open source and that's there's a bit more humans there there's there's a lot of factors that we'll need to consider if we want to open source our games definitely but one vision that we see is if we do open source games and the right infrastructure and the right support systems are in place then it will allow us to reclaim power back to independent game creators and um and when i say independent creators we mean game developers and hackers like you guys who are building new things who aren't uh who want to explore this space with us so some of our partners are here on screen uh conquest eve from ronan sanford flip flop from feature creep and force duties from untaped games so these are games that are built on html5 html5 looking at how to do more on web3 and really exploring the space of uh finding new economies around uh around webcam blockchain around decentralized technologies and and and yeah and just um i guess to have a greater appreciation of what open gaming can do and what the open source can do uh it bears looking at how how video games are right now the current state of video games and it's it's a story that i'd love to go through that there's so many things to talk about but i think these two these two uh gifs show kind of the the history from then to now right so from when when when the internet came out there was a game be an explosion of games we we found a new genre we created new genres like mmorpgs like games like diablo where people can trade with each other so we did we created new economies and it was really the start of the early metaverse like we hear metaverse all the time but uh but it has already been brewing starting from the creation of the internet and the introduction of the internet in games and and and now if you look at the screen and if you look at the image on the right um i would say the language of game development and game designers have really been defined by the attention economy and that's largely because most of the power really has been controlled by the social networks by the webtoon platform so as a game designer most of the things that we always hear that like the game designers mantras actually uh retention leads to monetization and that's the reason why you get all of these games that that expect you to grind and then uh game develop game designers also have started to know how to use psychology in game design so we find that randomness and the the chance of getting something as a very powerful drive for us to to play games and and that's the reason why a lot of the games you see now are all about grinding all about uh loot boxes they're games that are designed to keep us playing forever and and maybe gamble and loot boxes when we can right so i would say it's not really the kind of games i would want to see and hopefully it's not the kind of games that all of you want to see as well but one thing i do want to mention is the game industry moves in cycles right i was uh i mentioned that i i've been i had a games company before i've been making games for quite a while and i've seen technology really shift what's happening in games um i think we're at the space now that we're able to do that um i remember when mobile and social came around that kind of shifted around the people who hold power in the space so now that we have blockchains now we have distributed uh you now that we have the centralized storage these are the tools that will allow us to to move farther from uh from decentralized platforms and build something of our own um and yeah so as i said uh the market moves in cycles currently we're in a very mature market i would say where everything like every step of the game development process has has largely been co-opted by web 2.0 platforms from creation to distribution to discoverability to monetization each step of the way is there's mostly a web 2 platform that extracts value from the game developer and i feel like uh um this this isn't really right right like that um like rent extraction is it works it it it's it's something that we found to work but it's something also that kind of leads us to these kinds of models where it's not really uh sustainable so i guess a segue a little bit back to arcadia arcadia not just sr distribution and the discovery uh discovery channel it's uh it's also our storytelling channel uh like arcadia has its own universe around it we have an arcadian's nft we're building uh stories around and uh and and the the image here is centro who is the villain of arcadia he kind of stands for the things that we want to change we want to be able to uh to take these these pillars map from centro and allow us to to build the ecosystems that we want to create um so yeah so a few more slides on this uh when we say value extraction and and and how it really works we kind of have to think of how how we want to create something new right so i guess the the mindset that people should have isn't on extraction but rather value creation so what would it look like if um if instead of us building platforms or us using these platforms the the the main goal for us is to create value as we go through the steps of these processes so uh a lot of this is still being defined in web3 but i would say that we really are at a point in history where we can define value however we want we kind of see all of these tokens all of these nfps uh values uh springing out of nowhere and this is something i think we should really look at something we should understand and put into our game designs and and and i i guess i invite the game designers right now here and game developers to look at it from that space and to to try and build something new we are here in uh build quests to kind of explore the new things that we can do with all these new tools that our partners have so uh so yeah let's look at how we can create value from them and going back to open gaming um i i see open gaming really as a as something that we should focus on because if we if you look at v5 d5 really really took off because it was open it was composable and that's what open gaming allows us to do is this composability i feel like uh if you look at what happened to d5 right now it started out with the standard the erc20 standard some of the yeah peter talked about this earlier in his presentation as well like erc20s erc-1155s these were the standards that allowed d5 to build on each other so now we have uni swap we have governance tokens we have d5 2.0 we're basing tokens and i think if you're designing a game you have to understand that's what's happening in d5 and also try to apply that in what's happening in the in your game development space as well so in in games we see we see games composed of primitives also for example uh if you're thinking of a chess game it's composed of boards and pieces uh a a board can also have instead of jazz pieces as cards and then from these little legos you can build up new genres like auto battler ccgs tower defense so a lot of these game designs have built on each other um but it hasn't really been open source before so if we we create these standards as well uh allow the value from erc20 is the value from d5 to come into these primitives and build a web game on top of it and and i think that's something really new that we can create right it's not uh it's not something that will uh it's not something that's uh that was uh told that we were told to create from the platforms right because the platforms have defined the rules and now it's up to us to define the kind of games that we want to see and and just to uh go back a little bit to how the web two platforms lock in and extract value from us so i mentioned there are four pillars the creation distribution discovery and monetization uh i suggest uh game developers take a look at the tools that they're using for each of these i realize that some of their centralized web 2.0 platforms and realize that there are alternatives in web3 so for example if you just look at the the tools that we're able to use here in build quest for creation we have open source game engines which uh i'll talk a little bit about later so instead of using the closed source game engines that uh that are out there let's explore using open source game images like phaser and d phone um instead of using um the the the in-app or the app store apis maybe we can explore using other web key apis like the ones from morale is changing covalent and instead of distributing through app stores maybe we can look at ipfs and filecoin for distribution uh for discovery maybe let's look at the nfd marketplaces like qihotek to be able to get the word out about our game we can use player guilds as well uh we can use uh maybe new experiments like curation markets that we find in some of the web 3 startups and one thing to note is uh going a little bit back to arcadia again monetization is something that we feel that all game developers are feel is the most problematic thing right now right so so arcadia is focused on this we're trying to solve the monetization piece and the hope is we get games built on arcadia we collaborate with people on the smart contracts we have smart contracts as well that we're building on top of nfts and top of tournaments um and explore the spaces of daos in device as well and and really find new games that are able to to to break free from from the centralized platforms that we know and some games i would suggest people take a look at some of these are made by developers that are looking really deeply in the space so the first is the dog which is a play on daos the decentralized autonomous organization organizations and uh and game now game so that the the game is very similar to katan i would say where the goal is to reach an end goal but that goal is defined by the players so it it's uh it explores the space of governance in games where in what if the goal in the game was defined by not by a game designer but democratically defined by a group of uh stakeholders so so that's something that you can only do in web3 another is eternal so it's a fully unchained exploration game so what that's uh i guess it's a good explanation of what uh what kind of game you can create if the whole gameplay is on chain um and and still i guess believing on understandable game two mechanics like dungeon crawling and classes in rpgs and the last one is uh it's a very famous game of course dark forest which explores the space of of creating a gameplay around zk snarks so i would suggest people take a look at this these games take a look at join their discords see see what kind of conversations are happening between game designers and learn from them and i guess i want to leave people also with this with this mantra i guess that uh i think of now rather than retention leads to monetization i feel like uh game designers uh should try to to realize that the the way they think is shaped by the language that they use and i want to suggest that instead of thinking that you're creating a game to make money right which is which is honestly what most game developers are doing right now we we we want to create game because we we have to create a game because we know that the market is big that there's a lot of money to be had but i want people to think instead of creating games to make money to creating money to make games this is something that we can do in web3 we now have the financial primitives to create our own tokens we have the the primitives to create virtual items that have massive amounts of value so learn from these other games uh take a look at the loot project for example wherein the game was uh was largely around uh building a game from from primitives from components so what kind of games can we create if we approach it from that angle rather than creating uh maybe just a tired old game on web 2 and just adding a token on top of it so so we will want to see a lot more things if we do that and and yeah so just as a last slide if anyone wants to know how to get started making games for arcadia it's it's honestly it's pretty simple for arcadia we just want people to make html5 games uh any fun game that people can play and enjoy and possibly build a a webplay ecosystem out of will consider to be put on arcadia you can go to docs.obgames.org for for some documentation on how to do so one thing i would suggest is to take a look at the videos that we put up there one is we have a video with the creator of phaser richard davey and he talks about how to use phaser to create an html5 game and also integrates it with some morales apis and if you want to go deeper into smart contracts learn more about what you can do with them take a look at our video we created with austin griffith he created a blockchain game with us very very quickly and he was able to create a wolf game derivative i uh if i remember just from from from quickly hacking on scaffolding so these two tools i feel uh spacer and scaffolding are a good uh foundation to start building an html5 game and and yeah and as long as you're able to make a fun game during the 12 days in build quest then uh then yeah then that's a great result i would say and and as always if there's something if there's a good game that we see from from all the build quest participants uh we we would be very much interested to to approach you guys and have you go through the gm friends accelerator and and yeah that's the presentation i hope it was useful and i'm here to take any questions from the chat thanks for that excellent presentation paul um very excited to see how our hackers build with bill with op games there's one question in the chat right now um is 3.js react considered html5 game yeah yeah francine it definitely is but when i say html5 honestly it's just anything that runs on a browser and i think that's the power of of the browser and html5 right that you can just buy in any api that you want there so if you have a game that's on 3js which is a 3d library for people also who who don't know about 3ds i we would love to see that um of course 3d also is very it's very compelling when people see a 3d game so yeah i would suggest you you go and do that hold on um make sure to continue the conversations and discord unless you guys have any further questions here um highly recommend connecting with paul this has been an excellent presentation i gotta thank you again for for coming out uh this afternoon uh looking forward to seeing what everyone builds with with op games and yeah yeah we're looking forward to it i know you that the hackers will be able to get to create a a new kind of exciting game that yeah we'd love to play that's what that's what it's all about the the gaming space in 2017 versus now is is so much more exciting so uh very very glad to have you guys on board for this event um remember to connect with paul in discord and continue to ask the questions that are probably going to come up as soon as we close this session i know how it is um but thanks again paul we're going to be closing the session here uh looking forward to thank you everyone looking for
