we're just going to take a couple seconds and wait for the stream to be set up before we officially start the workshop awesome so we're good to go um so here we have mark from quixotic who's going to be doing his workshop on building composable and a tm optimism layer 2. um so we're really excited to have him here at build quest and with that being said i'll hand the mic off to you mark ah great thanks anna um hey everyone thanks for joining um i'm going to go ahead and start um by sharing a little bit about um like what are composable nfts what's optimism and uh and what's quixotic um so quixotic is the largest nft marketplace on optimism we launched in december 2021 about 10 weeks ago and we've done almost 200 ethan volume and um trading in fts on quixotic is about a dollar um so much cheaper than openc um and a little bit later i'll show you uh what the platform looks like um but first i want to get into um like what are composed one fts and why would you use them um and then for a little background on me i'm one of the co-founders of quixotic um uh so compose one of ts are really just any nfts that interact with um with each other this is actually something that was very popular when nfts were first being explored as a concept so some past examples of composed one of ts are cryptokitties where you can breed two cryptokitties to produce a kitten nft um zed run is another popular composable nft game where you can race horses and the horses can also breed um and those horses are nfps um dope wars is a play to earn game on quixotic which is our marketplace and you can have like a hustler which is like a character and that person can equip gear and use that um and then loot was a popular nft project that came out last year um and um that was deliberately completely open-ended so anyone can do anything they want with a loot um other like future ideas for example for composed one of teas is that you can like assign adventures um stats in loot um you could have like a robot fighting game maybe magical elements could be combined to create a potion uh the point is like most nfts today follow the erc721 standard and that's a really open-ended standard um so you can actually do tons of things there's a huge design space there um so the question is you know why aren't people doing all these things um with the big design space available and the answer to that is that high gasses on layer one ethereum mean that any feature that's not trading your nfts is basically not going to be used um so that's that's kind of sad for builders because it closes off the design space so if we look beyond layer one ethereum that design space opens up again um so right like with something like optimism you get security and low cost so much lower fees so any thing you do on chain is probably a hundred times cheaper than layer one ethereum um so why choose optimism uh or layer twos in general um so you can choose to put nfts on other other layer ones um other blockchains that so another layer one it runs its own consensus mechanism and therefore um doesn't have the security of layer one ethereum um it might or might not run the evm and most developers like at eighth global probably are familiar with evm and the solidity smart contract language um they usually do have general purpose smart contracts examples of layer ones include solano tesla's bsc you could do a side chain like polygon which is very similar to layer one ethereum except it has its own consensus mechanism and so any nfts you make are secured on the polygon network which is you know less secure than laurel ethereum layer 2s are secured by layer 1 ethereum so transactions all eventually get compressed and posted to layer 1 ethereum some of them have general smart contracts some of them don't some run the evm some don't optimism so let's talk about optimism optimism is evm equivalent and uses the exact same ecosystem and tools as layer one so like when i'm developing smart contracts i use hard hat um i use alchemy for my web services i only actually know how to write solidity code i don't know how to write smart contracts in other languages i use etherscan i use meta mask i use remix so all these tools work really well with optimism when we built our marketplace we used many of these tools so i'm going to quickly run through an example [Music] of like how you would make your own composable nft collection this one's called the potion ears um this was an idea that i just came up with but totally feel free to just completely steal it and and implement it yourself as part of the hackathon um so what if we had an erc 721 collection of potion ears that could be used as profile pictures so like this character here would be a potioneer and the potioneers can collect potion supplies brew their own potions uh consume the potions to change their physical appearance and attributes um so the supplies maybe that's an erc alum 55 collection and the potions can also be a 721 collection the main difference between 721s and 1155s these are standards that you would use to make nfts um so like sort of by definition and nft is something that follows the erc721 standard or lm55 standard in in ethereum world anyway uh and solana and other blockchains they have their own standards for what an nft is um but an 1155 collection it has multi-quantity nfts so um you'll see why that's useful for potion supplies um 721s are all completely unique so that's why it's good for like a profile picture um i see we have a question in the chat so marcus says is 1155 is more towards consumable infts then uh yeah that that you might do that um i think a big use case of 1155s is that they're better for games so in a lot of games you might have just resources um like not every single item in a video game tends to be unique like usually there are multiple quantities of video game items um and yeah if you have questions feel free to just drop them in the zoom chat here um so here's my smart contracts um so i'm gonna do a quick explainer of the smart contracts and then after this workshop is over in our um discord channel for the hackathon i'll share a github repo that shows you my smart contracts and you can use that as inspiration for your own um [Music] so here's the potion supplies contract i'm using the open zeppelin libraries of open zeppelin is just a really popular set of libraries for creating nft smart contracts so i have some potion supplies here um and i just have three nfts in this collection it's gold obsidian and feldspar which are all uh rocks that that an alchemist might use um and i'm just going to say like we're going to mince 2 000 gold 800 obsidian and 4000 felts bar um and then here's a my potioneer um so i'm just going to highlight a couple things about this potion your smart contract this is a 721 contract but i'm also inheriting erc 1155 holder and and ownable which means this potioneer can hold 1155s okay and to support that i have um [Music] i have implemented this on erc alum 55 received so when someone sends a potion year some supplies we're going to keep track using like a mapping of the supply amounts for a potioneer so you can send to potioneer 12 for example uh like some gold um and then we're keeping track of all of that in this function so we have to implement this function to be able to hold erc-1155s okay cool and now here i'm going to implement a function called brew potion of strength so if i have 10 gold 5 obsidian and 15 volts bar then i can call this function um what uh you know when you're writing a smart contract a pattern you often want to follow is called checks effects and interactions so i'm checking that i have the required resources i am removing those resources there's kind of a typo right there i'm removing these resources from my inventory basically and then i am and i just collapsed it down so you can see more and now i'm burning the ingredients so i'm actually sending those ingredients to the burn address and then i'm minting a potion um great so that is that is the example of potion ears i didn't go as in depth as i could just because i don't want to get too into the tentacle weeds but there will be a github repo um that you can look out later and you can imagine maybe the potion changes the color of someone's hair or makes them look stronger or something that would be pretty fun um and you can imagine there would be like a market for potion supplies and what's interesting is like you could sell your entire potioneer and that potioneer can have supplies in their inventory so um you know this is all very fun and anything that conforms to either of these standards can appear on the quixotic marketplace so that's pretty cool too and so i'll give some examples on quixotic um this collection is called old english you can drink the the bottle and you get some buzz token um which is an erc20 um when you drink the whole bottle it's empty so like as every time someone calls the drink function it it gets emptied and then you can send the bottle back to where you got it from and you get some eat back for recycling it so that's kind of fun um you can also imagine how much more fun this is on a layer two because like drinking the gassy is like a dollar to call the drink function versus on l1 ethereum it would be like you know sixty dollars um pegapals is another one uh that's pretty fun and uses a composed one ft so pegapals give you membership to this like dao basically that does defy stuff um you can level up your pegapal with pega tokens so if you get a hundred pega tokens you can put them inside your pegapal and level up your pegapal um i see another question what about potion recipes a recipe nft which contains the neat ingredients if you have them in the potion that also would be great um yeah you could that's kind of interesting to make the recipe itself um in nft because the recipe does need to be sort of programmable so you noticed like for this potion of strength the ingredient you know i basically hard-coded the ingredients um here that you need um so it might be a little more advanced to have the recipe be in nft because you're gonna need to [Music] um like write like a function that combines them um but you could definitely give it a try um so that would be possible cool and then here's just some tips um we've seen for how to launch a really successful nft project um i for most projects they're as much about um [Music] uh community building as they are about the art so um for some nfts they really are about the art for a lot of the projects on our platform it's a lot about community building so really think about how you're going to build a good community around your project in addition to the art most successful projects on our platform have a very low or free mint price so opt punks was very successful they minted for 0.005 each that's only like 20 um that's also kind of only possible in layer 2 because gas to mint is only a dollar so um you wouldn't want to do that on l1 because you know it's like 60 dollars to mint for like a 20 thing you know that doesn't make sense um dope wars was freedomant um collections with yeah just a novel concept unique art or interesting utility do the best um animal profile projects um you know a lot of those have been done already um and then i'd say try joining a few nft communities yourself to see what works best and maybe even try contributing to those communities before launching your own project and that'll just help set you up for success now for this particular hackathon for build quest we're sponsoring a four thousand dollar prize pool so any team that deploys a project on the optimistic covenant test net that uses some of these composed one of t's we're going to split the four thousand dollars among all of you um so uh i'll just quickly show you the platform now um so this is quixotic it's just quixotic.io um you can just google optimism in ft marketplace if that's hard to spell um and so here's like dope wars can you can you all see the um the platform as i'm sharing it maybe um yep okay great so here's the dope wars hustlers this hustler for example is naked so if you want um you would need to get them some gear and you can find the gear here so i could buy a hustler and then i could get a bronze chain or um a hat from chinatown um great um or if i don't want to you know like i could buy a hustler with gear already so like you see like this guy brick already has like a bunch of gear and he's more expensive which makes sense because when we buy him we're also buying all the gear that he has um so that's a good example of a composable nft um here's the old english so this is just kind of a funny collection it's just a bunch of bottles um these were also very free like very cheap or maybe even freedom in and now like you've seen it's um kind of expensive to buy one but if you buy one then you can go to the website the old english website and then drink it and then you get the buzz token um so what we're trying to do is just a marketplace for for the optimism and empty spaces we're trying to create like really fun high quality projects um that are only available in layer two um if you do deploy to the test net during this hackathon um you can just go to testnet.quixotic.io and you'll be able to see this is connected to the optimism test net called optimistic coven and during the hackathon you can [Music] you know deploy deployer smart contracts and we'll pull them in here if you want to deploy your smart contract on our testnet um just message us in the discord channel for uh we we are quixotic in the discord um great so now i'll open it up to any questions from the audience um about optimism uh about nft games um or about our marketplace in particular um yeah and um feel free to come off of me too if you want to ask your question live um sauger says which are product ideas looking over optimism or which are ethereum or polygon but not an optimism that's a good question um so optimism is still very new um the it's like been available for anyone to deploy on they like remove their whitelist in december so there's been only we only have like 37 collections on our marketplace which is like really small compared to polygon or l1 ethereum um so if you are building on optimism chances are it's like a pretty unique um like you might be one of the first people doing that um and it's interesting because polygon it'll cost about like two cents to mint on the polygon network um and it'll cost about like a dollar to mint on optimism so it's like quite a bit more expensive but that also does result in like a lot less spam um so that's an interesting like advantage of building an optimism is like we have a dedicated like our marketplace only supports optimism we're dedicated to optimism um if you are minting a project on polygon for example you'll probably be trading that on openc where like your polygon project will sort of be probably among like some spam um and polygon is sort of treated like a second class citizen on openc which makes sense because most activities on ethereum great hello hi module hi hi sagar this side so nice nice uh nice presentation actually so actually i am following optimism last like uh three four years actually when the the first talk is happen on that time actually so yeah means i'm i'm looking forward what what is the the process developer onboard process and how actively working to in the future for the onboarding developer and grant program which optimism have and on the future plans they cut on snow by developer onboarding process do you mean like how do you start using the optimism network or like what's the plan for building a strong ecosystem um yeah i mean so i'm in the space quite long time and so i want to go like build a product like uh on two three products which i have in the minds and creating the roadmap of that with a team so i want to once onboard a new project on the optimism so how the supporting the grant and other parts like the team support or like on the other support to the community to build the new projects over the rather than the like a famous project like a unistripe and all it is i know that it is coming on optimism because it is on ethereum but any new projects which come up from the hackathons or something like so apart from the winning prize how the next level if you want to take the projects on the optimism if you are building something so how the optimism team or something which we can have um help out the developers on the way yeah for sure so if it's nft specific we actually do our best to provide a lot of help for like nft projects on optimism um and so we'll like advise and even we have like a launchpad product so if you this is less meant for this hackathon but like if you needed engineering help um like we have no code tools for deploying nfts um and then for the optim for broader projects and optimism most of the resources you'll find in the discord um and yeah ori actually who's here is from the optimism team so he just dropped a form in the chat but yeah i found in the discord um you can usually get in touch with the team pretty easily they try to be pretty accessible and um so yeah um and they have like a different like a community called the nerds um that you can join and then like there will be people who help you out um [Music] great and then i see another question from lyle are there any cross-chain nft bridges that support optimism um not yet but we are working on that so soon we hope to provide the ability for you to seamlessly bridge an l1 nft to optimism and trade it because then you have like the l1 asset that you can trade for a dollar instead of like 60 and then you know you can of course bridge it back to l1 at any point so we expect that bridge to come out you know ideally in the next like coming weeks um [Music] great so we have a couple more minutes left how do i follow the progress before it comes out that's a good question um [Music] you can join the quixotic discord so we're actually working on building this bridge um and it's very similar to the erc20 standard bridge so if you're interested in the technical side of how bridges work it's modeled after the erc20 bridge which you can read about on the optimism docs um and then we'll be making an announcement about the erc 721 bridge in like the next like three weeks great um [Music] well i'll be very active in the discord so um i'm completely new to quixotic was the best way to learn and deploy simple contract web internet um so the best way to learn i'd say is to [Music] if you're familiar with solidity then all you really need to do yes great um is like look at the open zeppelin contracts for erc 721 and um see how open zeppelin implements a 721 and then what i'll do after this is i'll show out a repo where you can read about how i implemented the potion ears and then um you can you know mess with that make your own potion recipe or make your own collection that's like not even potion related and it'll be any any docs you read about l1 nfts it all applies to optimism so you actually don't need to learn anything specific about optimism so it'll be the same solidity same tooling great okay i think we're wrapping up but yeah i'll be in the discord if you have any questions about nfts um games why optimism um or about our marketplace i will be there um i i'll give it back to anna if you have anything awesome yeah thank you so much um that was super interesting mark um and thank you for taking the time to like interact with our hackers um oh i think you got one more question if you want to answer that one yeah sure um how do i see the evm chains after eth2 yeah predicting the future's hard i i like only know how to write smart contracts in solidity so i do think the evm is here to stay so like i yeah i think focusing on solidity and evm smart contracts is like what i'm betting my career on i guess um and i know like optimism and most layer twos um are also focused on the evm and i also think optimism is only going to get cheaper so like it'll probably be a hundred times cheaper than l1 today it's 100 times cheaper than i want it's actually probably gonna get even cheaper um they're doing updates every week you can track the fees at something called l2fees.com um so maybe or sorry l2fes.info so here's where you find the fees um you can also read about the different l2s at l2b.com and that shows you like the total value in every l2 um okay great i think we're at time so i'll give it back to anna awesome thanks yeah as mark said uh he's available on discord both on the autism discord but you can also reach them through the ethe global discord and sponsor channel um and yeah we do have some more workshops left for the day so if you're interested definitely check them out um and with that being said i hope you all have a great time hacking and can't wait to see some really cool projects being built all right bye everyone
