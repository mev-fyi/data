standby on live stream looks like it's almost ready yep we are good okay cool welcome everybody hackafest hackers to the unstoppable unstoppable domains workshop we are very excited to have with us matthew gold and ryan lay lee i'm actually i should have double checked that but uh correct me if i'm correct me on which one you prefer which one it is um yeah these guys are going to be giving a workshop and an intro to what unstoppable domains is and what you can build on it with uh with enduring hack-a-fest over the next 30 days so we're really excited to have them with us as you all know or may not know the staking deadline for hack fest is tomorrow at midnight so please make sure to stake before that deadline um and as always be checking the hackafest schedule channel for any other events we still have a bunch more events for today tomorrow and then we're going to be adding a few more on friday to get people up to speed on the filecoin ecosystem we're planning a specific event for connecting ethereum to file coins specifically um which i'm sure a lot of people will be interested in given that it was requested in some of the other events um i think that's all the housekeeping we got to get out of the way i will be taking questions in the zoom chat so if you get stuck on something or you have a question just drop it there and then we'll address them at the end of the entire session and before we jump into this presentation let's see if we can think of a quick game uh this one's maybe maybe not as we're not going to be picking stuff up off the desk andrew do you have what kind of computer do you have a mac or pc mac all right perfect i just recently switched to pc let's let's see if people can uh turn on their videos all right i'm team pc and andrew is team mack how are we gonna how are we gonna mention how do we do this this for mac one or a two andrew is team one i'm team two so throw up a one or two let's see what our hackers have andrew you count all the ones i'll count all the twos oh darren the curveball the three linux mint linux all right i think i think windows act or uh the max actually one yeah i got eight or nine max showing all right andrew team mack wins and then uh linux coming in third place should have known there was going to be something like that all right cool uh matthew take it away show your screen tell us about unstoppable domains yeah perfect um thanks everyone thanks for putting this together excited to do this uh presentation so as you said i'm matthew from unsolvable i'm one of the founders there let me go ahead and get this presentation rolling uh and go ahead and type this in and then i've also got ryan uh we're both just waking up it's early for us it's pst but typically we sleep in so uh if we're for a little bit cloudy that's why i've got giant glass of coffee here though so that'll help me get me through um and uh yeah quick background on ensemble domains so uh we build blockchain domains and uh decentralized web tools uh for the presentation today where i'm gonna give you a little bit about uh soft little blockchain domains is the first step then we're going to do a technical overview of blockchain domains so a lot of you are coming from the decentralized website you may not know as much about ethereum and then some people are coming from the ethereum side they may not know so much about the centralized web so we're going to try to you know bridge the gaps there between these two we think blockchain domains are an excellent thing an excellent connector between these two worlds um and then at the end we're going to talk about the hackathon for unstoppable prizes of which we have two categories one is for building decentralized websites and then linking them to a blockchain domain and then the other one is chat but we'll talk about that a little bit more in detail and then at the end uh ryan is actually going to present some code that we wrote to do um decentralized chat um on a on a peer-to-peer uh file storage network uh gun db that he's just gonna demo and i think that may help people who are working on the hackathon prizes cool all right so let's see if this clicks great so who are we um we are a company based out of san francisco uh founded back in 2018 uh we actually have taken funding from uh draper and associates we through boost vc um personally i've been in in crypto since 2013 um worked on bitcoin projects previously uh and was following very closely with ethereum when it originally came out uh in 2016 uh or early 2016 got engaged and then also have been contributing to the ethereum community along with uh zilliqa another blockchain uh we launched a software domains as a company back in 2018 um and the main purpose is to replace cryptocurrency addresses that was the first use case with the human readable main so you can send money to matthew.crypto instead of a hex address we also act as a domain for unsensible website content and one of the emerging use cases we're seeing is these domain names acting as an identifier so at a high level it's a user-owned uri and we'll get into that a little bit more and it's very flexible with uh really no restrictions and it's kind of a plugable lego uh for the d-web and so we'll we'll dive into that a little bit more there's a little jargon there so blockchain domain is very much like dns the the difference is is that the information about the lookups is stored on a contract on the blockchain so you can just imagine it as a little piece of software code um in this case it's a standard called an erc721 and if you follow along with uh crypto at all you may have heard of cryptokitties they created this standard it's a just a way to generate unique tokens that have a similar set of characteristics in this case these are all domain names um and then what these are used to do is resolve crypto addresses websites and other data it's actually quite simple on the blockchain so if you just imagine it when you look on chain and we'll take a look at the contracts in a second um but there's just a uh it's like a blank slate and you can say you know my name dot crypto and then it's a pointer and just a giant table of key value pairs where you can put in anything and this is very much like dns records where you can have you know a records text records cnames i would say it's most like the text records on dns because you can put whatever you want up there and then how you want to resolve it is based on the libraries that you use to read that information why so this is a question that we get all the time everyone's like oh dns is great and for people who maybe just use dns to browse websites it does work great there are some issues we think with the current system it's centralized and custodial and so if you have blockchain domains it's a way to and you point to content on peer-to-peer storage networks you now have a platform for hosting unsensible content so we're seeing a lot of talk now on social media about people being banned or not being able to say what they want to um it's actually much worse internationally than it is here in the us we take a lot of our freedoms here for granted um i'm particularly worried about uh how our civil liberties are eroding very rapidly um so i'm coming from a very libertarian background on that end uh and so we're trying to build something that will allow people to say what they want uh and we'll have some examples of that where we can show at the end um but this is really important for large parts of the world uh that are actively censoring their consumers and i would say probably about half the planet right now is suffering from a centralized internet in one form or the other even to the extent where we have to monitor what we say because uh unstoppable domains itself is already being blocked in some of these places where they don't want people to have access to this content uh which is kind of crazy because we're so tiny but uh it really is that bad um another interesting thing is distributed infrastructure cost which is a big part of uh file coin and all these peer-to-peer storage networks which are coming out something that's not obvious is that you have new possible design patterns because of the self custody nature of a user-owned naming system so all i can say the easiest way to say it is right now on dns when you register your domain name it's inside of you know the servers and then godaddy is acting as your custodian but you don't actually have the key you know in your cell phone um and your local wallet and because you don't because it's a custodial solution for naming resolution uh it's not really consumer focused so i would say that blockchain domains are much more consumer focused um and that's where we're seeing some of the emerging use cases for decentralized identifiers all right i feel so jumping right back up what's actually happening so we've had 200 000 plus of these domain names registered and we've actually had 20 000 plus ipfs websites launched um and that's the since february on the ipfs website uh we also just recently launched uh decentralized chat so there's a lot of new functionality coming out uh that's connecting blockchain domain names to all sorts of decentralized networks so you know you're connecting them to these uh crypto networks for sending cryptocurrency payments you're also connecting them up to uh file storage networks like ipfs to host websites uh or you're connecting them to a network that may be suited for a chat protocol like gundb how does it work users are making a one-time purchase right of a domain name um and then you can configure the domain name like i stated earlier using the private key in your wallet so you when you buy the name it's a blockchain asset that's transferred to you just like a bitcoin or anything else and it's stored here forever you then can update the configuration on it we'll talk about how the swedish smart contracts work in a second and point it to whatever content you would like and then you can host the content you're actually not hosting it on the domain but you can host the content on your domain by pointing to uh the file on ipfs and then users interact with that by using ipfs gateways or browsers opera browser actually recently started supporting um the lookup of ivfs files uh on their android which was a big huge uh move forward we're very happy about that and yeah you can also use like a chrome extension that could do these lookups for you for hosting uh this is what we're starting to see so just kind of what's happening in the market people are building static sites uh single-page applications and we're starting to see uh hints of e-commerce because this is maybe the easiest place to get started um the places where we're seeing a lot of action in the market and you actually see these guys here at the conference as well it is like for simple uploading and ci tooling i would point out fleek is one that's helping to make websites happen another one is pinata for um painting content up on ipfs uh and then yeah we're seeing uh seating tools emerge so this is kind of what's happening inside the industry okay so product demo i guess i should go that was a lot of talk i'm going to do the demo of the product and then we're going to do a actual look through the smart contracts so this is let me go ahead and pull it up so this is us on softballdomains.com it's a straightforward e-commerce site you can type in you know some domain uh you just search it up you add it to your cart you check out just like anywhere else after a user after you've bought your domain name you can then go on to manage it and this is the managed section and this is kind of reminiscent of dns and then we have different records there are three major uses right now one is adding a cryptocurrency address um and this is what people are doing to make it easier to send crypto to each other uh the other one is launching a website so if you go into the website section let's check this out we've we've already made some templates and so this is one of the things that we're doing in the hackathon and like i said we've had people launch 20 000 plus of these websites just in the last four months and we actually have quite a bit of consumer demand for more complex templates so that's one of the hackathon prizes um that people that were interested in supporting uh more of these to be built we made it you know simple wysiwyg editor so if you want to uh if you want to publish uh some sort of website up here you can pick a domain name and then you know do some basic editing and then deploy so very basic stuff it's like being in the 1990s again with the regular internet the cool part though is that all this goes up uh to ipfs and so that if someone wants to then uh resolve your domain name they can just type it into their browser you can see here i have a chrome extension that allows me to do this resolution and it will bring them to the website one of the things i'm most excited about is actually blogs so let me see if we have it here uh yeah so here's like a blog template i would say maybe this is one of the first more advanced templates that combines using a blockchain domain name with a uh back-end service like database on a peer-to-peer network in this blog we're actually using three box uh which is built on top of i think they're using orbitdb on top of ipfs i'd have to check and once you create this blog i'm not going to go through this process right now but it's signing a transaction to the blockchain which updates the records um for that the person that you can actually see on the domain name when you do the lookup on the ethereum chain itself uh and then you'll end up having so here's a here's a blog site so this is i think this is brad.crypto i can bring this up this brad's one of the other uh one of the other founders of the company right and so he's got uh so he's got his blog here it's very simple i think we have like tim draper blog.crypto maybe has one a little bit more um these are just some of the websites that uh people have have made and this is this is really cool so like this blog post here um is the type of content that may or may not get banned on social media channels um and so if you want to say something it's nice to be able to say that out loud in a place that can't be taken down there's also applications on here that have started building this is audience they're another app and so they're like a uh music sharing application that and this is a hundred percent on ipfs you can see this is being accessed through a gateway i also have a browser locally that'll read directly but for the purposes of demonstration i'm in chrome so that's that's basically how it works we're you know registry you buy domain names and then we make it really easy for users to interact with the blockchain this is all hidden behind here and then when then you can easily deploy a website and get something up so people can uh people can work with it uh let me think if there's anything else there yeah that's basic product overview for blockchain domains and i guess another thing to show here is payments which we didn't really go into but you can also do a lookup inside of a crypto wallet and that way you can send crypto more easily all right so this is what we're here for is the technical interview of the smart contracts so i would point everyone to our docs and and that's probably the best place to get started we actually also have a library for doing resolution which makes it easier to do these uh reads off the blockchain okay so how does the registry work on chain so how does a blockchain domain registry works it's a suite of smart contracts uh they interact with each other in order to provide a dns like system so the core contract is the registry contract and this is just uh this is actually just keeping track of which cryptocurrency address which cryptokey uh owns each domain name and every single one of those domain names is a separate uh nft token uh on ethereum and then we have a couple of uh helper contracts uh like the signature controller the minty controller the whitelisted mentor um a prefix controller and then also the resolver and the resolver contract is what the user sees when they interact with the domain name because that's where they're actually setting the dns like information so this is a huge umi diagram if i'm assuming we're gonna post these slides somewhere i would go pick this off our medium and download this so you can look through but just know that there is a place for you where you can actually see all the connections between these functions and a brief overview for the registry contract so the what we try to ensure is that every domain has an owner so every issue domain and that every domain has control over its namespace and that includes the subspaces and then every domain stores its information on a separate contract called resolver and this just keeps the registry contract really tight and small on the code so when you're looking at the blockchain to find out who owns what domain you can find that on the registry contract but when you actually want to look up the information for resolution on the domain name you're going to need to go look at a separate contract that the user can control and update all right another contract we have is the minting controller and one funny thing about blockchain domain names that we made the decision on is this is really one way so if you make a mistake like you send your domain name to the wrong place then there's absolutely no way for us to get it back because that's written into the smart contract this is a security guarantee so this is maybe a weird thing about blockchain domain names that is not seen in traditional dns domain names so we have to be very careful when assigning out domain names in the first place to make sure that they go to the right person this is the same issue that everyone has with cryptocurrency where if you lose your key you've lost your crypto so that carries over here there's no way to get around it another thing that we did with which was an improvement of some other systems that we had seen is that we have this uh signature controller which is actually a way to pay for gas fees for users um on the ethereum network so you'll actually see this abstraction across a lot of different crypto networks you're seeing this already on file coin start to emerge even though it's not launched yet but people are preparing to have it so that um you can pay on behalf of someone else in order to keep their data stored that way you can take payment and like credit card and then you know you'll handle all the back-end stuff for making sure that it gets done with cryptocurrency so we did the same thing here for blockchain domains um and this allows us to just pay the gas cost for users and the way that we cryptographically guarantee that we're not cheating the user out of thing out of anything is the smart contract actually forces the user to send a signature so they don't have to have any cryptocurrency uh to make it update but they do have to sign it and of course you can also pay your own gas if you would like then we have the whitelisted mentor and this is used only for initial registration again this was a design choice to make it easier to control and distribute the initial names like i just said earlier once you issue a domain name you can't get it back ever so and instead of just having an a completely free-for-all system on initial registrations with an auction process or something when said to have a control drip here that allows people to register through us post registration the domain name is 100 uh controlled by them all right and then the last one is uh kind of like a um a feature of the erc721s which is the uri prefix controller this allows you to attach an image to your name um so the famous cryptokitties or gods unchained or any of these other ethereum gaming apps have a picture associated with a particular asset this is what allows you to make that association also interesting note people are starting to store these on ipfs like the actual image itself instead of storing it at a url url endpoint or like an api endpoint for images okay so that was the suite of smart contracts for the registry itself and then this last contract so you know we just discussed and it's actually not that much code so from a code size standard it's you know it's thousands of lines it's not tens of thousands um and that's because it has to all fit on chain so those smart contracts are what assigned the domain name and have owners for end users and then now we're talking about the resolver contract and this is where the user is just inputting information so this is really just a super simple key value store we have some optimizations for lookup again if you use our library for doing the lookups it'll make it much easier for you and these are the equivalents for the you know cname or text records that you have on dns and what you're allowed to do is set these records and record values and we're starting to see this be extended out an interesting thing that's happening here on these resolver contracts which i think is pretty neat is they're actually permissioning other people to rate to write data to back to the contract so if you're gonna so this is like a new feature of blockchain domains that's not really a thing that you have on regular dns which is that you can permission out uh someone else to verify a piece of external data uh back to you so um there's not great examples of this right now but one that i like to point out is like uh you could permission a third party to make a guarantee um that your twitter account is actually yours and associated with your blockchain domain name and then the trust model there for the person looking up your domain name is they can see if they trust that third party to tell the truth another one is if you wanted to uh log into an application you could allow that application to store data with a pointer back to your name uh this is a way for users to carry their data around between different apps okay cool so almost there almost through the technical review and then we'll talk about some of the more fun stuff so this is resolving content using our standard os library um there's just some simple lookup calls you can see uh that like if you want to resolve a domain you really just look up the name of the domain name if you want to pull an ipfs value or a crypto address value you just put in that key pair and it will shoot it back to you okay cool so what's so special about blockchain domains is that they're user owned and controlled 100 in their wallet they're built for end users and there's a lot more use cases for blockchain domain names because uh their self-custody asset they're very secure because they inherit the security of the ethereum network this in our view is an improvement over traditional dns and they allow you to point to uh content on p2p networks like filecoin ipfs which is kind of one of the building blocks of the decentralized web before one of the first things you do when you want to put content out on the regular web is you buy a domain name and i think that it's pretty much the same way for users so when we say that we're like trying to onboard the planet to the decentralized web we really think that we're the user entry point people are going to grab their domain name and then they're immediately going to want to deploy a website or anything else that you would typically do with a domain i referenced this earlier we have an extension we also have a browser opera browser for android also allows you to access this we're working on with a couple other extensions as well to broaden access to this so it's easy to look up you can also find all these files through a gateway like cloudflare okay cool take a i'll take a actually if it's okay i'll take a brief break here and then see if we had questions on that before we do the hackathon interview is it easy for me to actually just look in the chats is that the right place to look yeah for for questions perfect yeah just give me one sec see if i can find anything here and i'll come back great okay cool so first question and i'll just take them in order uh how is this different from ens so a quick story about ensemble domains we actually originally worked uh on uh or with an application on top of enf so our we were originally by ethe domains um back in the day so we are we have a very similar dna to ens we split off and did our own registry originally because we built one for the zilliqa blockchain and then we also ended up building one for ethereum called dot crypto so it's the same general concept of you have a smart contract platform that has different ways of resolving domain names i would say we have very similar dna in that respect the differences are are mainly about uh like organizational so ens is uh non-profit and they're uh very strongly ethereum focused actually they're a great team uh i have a call with brantley from ens later today uh so i like those guys i think they do great technology work we're just another version of a smart contract dns just to give some comparisons in the traditional.com world there are 1500 top level domains i think that blockchain domain world we're going to have just as many if not more of these extensions and it's really just a difference between the things that you tend to emphasize we are much more focused on the decentralized web at this point in time and we've actually deployed a lot more websites um and but but other than that like i would say it's like the same flavor uh or maybe like a different flavor of a very similar kool-aid all right cool so uh all right so another one is it looks like it's bundled with a domain through ipfs as well so um it's it's not really bundled it's more like the domain name is a blockchain based asset and then you can point it to any peer-to-peer file storage system that you want when we built our application we actually built it to make it super easy deploy to deploy ipfs websites for end users so you could click buttons so they're very tightly coupled just because we think ipfs is a great way to store peer-to-peer content i'm personally very excited about having incentivized peer-to-peer storage networks and there's lots of them launching this year because i think that they're that's like a missing piece in making the d web happen uh next question is what if you have a main ether address and this is from nester so thank you for the question uh and want to have multiple websites using multiple uh crypto domains can i have multiple domains point to the same ether address or do i need to have a different ether address for each domain so you can have multiple domains point to the same ether address that is fine um you cannot have uh and you can also have one ether address that owns like 50 domains a domain can only be owned by one ethereum address now there's a star there because you could also make a domain owned by a smart contract in which case it could be owned by you know a five of five or five seven or three or three or whatever keys but yeah you can you can have multiple websites um with pointing to the same uh ethereum address can you have multiple domains linked not exactly sure what you mean there but i think yes okay cool all right i'm going to see if i can find some next ones here cool yes it does need to be accessed through an ipfs enabled browser so this was from joseph he's like the question i guess is doesn't need to be accessed through an ipfs enabled browser it does or that browser can use a chrome extension like you see here um i have the unsolvable chrome extension and then i'm just loading it off of cloudflare's gateway to ipfs um and uh we're starting to see more browser support so i'm hopeful that eventually you'll be able to do this just direct in chrome or maybe by designating a dns provider if it then supports these domain names okay oh and then nestor was asking yeah about keeping the dot crypto domain in the url that's actually a security issue right now for browsers because they want to show the full url of wherever where you're actually visiting and they don't want to hide where you're going so for now it will show the uh full ipfs file hash instead of just matthew.crypto all right that was great all right cool so the next question uh a few more here and then we'll get back to the presentation i think this is good to take a break so this is from michael deluca and he asked could unstoppable domains gobble up domains ahead of their users front run for free or is there an eth cost that is locked up in the contract uh is there some level of trust here so yes on minting there is a level of trust uh and uh for for us and then we chose to go that way that is a design difference between us and uh.eth which is the ens version of these blockchain smart contracts and a question from trent do all web pages live on chain actually uh they are the web pages are stored on ipfs so they're not on the ethereum blockchain just the lookup information is stored on the ethereum blockchain uh from chad he asked what about handshake i actually don't know i think that better to ask them uh about their technology than myself uh great and then from trent is each nft a new contract or are the nft's token ids on one contract so the nfts are they are token ids on a single contract now each resolver contract actually i think are also we use an aggregated resolver contract as well and then any good crypto sites you'd recommend i can actually give you something better than that you can go to blockscan.com and this is built by etherscan and you can actually search for um for decentralized websites so you know here's uh betshop.crypto for instance or crypto nade or crypto move so uh blockscan is built by etherscan there's actually another one and uh they're not released yet but i'm going to go ahead and let you guys know about them uh this is bit search and they're also doing uh they're also doing indexing of the decentralized web and they even have an image search which i thought was pretty cool um just the fact that it's already here so the decentralized web is happening in the background there's already two search engines which i think is pretty neat so if you're looking for uh domain names i'll actually drop these in the chat so you guys will have them so bit search is one let me drop this in here and then the other one is blockscan by etherscan and these are two good places to go look so if you're looking to build a website you can get some ideas of what people have been able to do there as i was saying earlier most of the websites right now are like static web pages or single page applications they're getting more complex though as people build more complex tools and there are companies out there like fleek for instance who's making it easier to to make that happen uh great okay awesome joseph no problem we will keep the luxury of free speech live uh as long as we can't so uh we'll we'll see how long we carry the torch it is getting scary out there okay so let's get back to the uh hackathon overview uh let me see what we got here and i'm about to turn it over to ryan so ryan if you hadn't had your second coffee now's the time uh let's talk about this so we have two tracks that we're doing for uh prizes for unsolvable so one is to build an interesting decentralized website i think one of the best ways we can get more people to actually care about the decentralized web is to put cool stuff on it and so uh where it's wide open so build a website deploy it on ipfs get a blockchain domain name and then copy and paste the ipfs hash and link it to your blockchain domain name so to show you how easy that is i think that's probably worth doing so let's say you deployed something up on ipfs um you get a domain name from us for free just email one of the guys on our team and we'll get you a free domain and then uh you go to you'll be able to come in here and manage your domain name you can click on it and then when you want to set up your website you can just copy and paste the ipfs hash right here and when you paste in the ipfs hash you can click save uh you'll be able to save your changes and then that's it so literally all you're doing is um picking a website that you think will work well given the limitations of websites put up on uh ipfs and then deploy it and then link it to a domain name and linking it to the domain is super easy so that that's a very straightforward um hackathon prize and then the second chat the second track is actually uh building chat uh using blockchain domain and ipfs and we have a link to the full description here and chat is significantly more complicated so we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about that here's some ideas about websites real quick so just if you want to make something interesting anything with a dow would be pretty interesting that's like a way for people to vote maybe you could put a domain name inside of a smart contract and then people could vote on the content of that smart contract that might be interesting and fun to do uh content with the paywall like you can have an ipfs website and if someone wants to uh be able to see the content they would maybe need to authenticate with web3 with their ethereum key oh and then of course a forum everyone loves reddit right so we have three prizes for this uh and everyone gets a you'll get a free crypto document domain we'll probably also give you some store credit to get some more and as i stated if you want a domain name to test or play around with we'll give you one and we'll probably give you your name if it's available excellent all right cool so then the next one is uh building chat and this one we actually have a four thousand dollar first prize for a chat and there's actually a couple of different uh database systems to build chat on ipfs so there's orbit db which has been around for a little while then there's threads db so orbitdb team is also around and they're willing to help with this threat is db team i've also talked with them they're trying to publish some more information about how you would build chat um using threads db both of those are on top of ipfs so if we end up having more than one interesting chat application like if someone builds one on orbit and someone builds one on threads and then someone builds one with their own storage you know own database that they rolled themselves on ipfs we're willing to award multiple first place prizes here if that happens so um and then we actually built our own chat prior to this and it is not on ipfs and that's actually good because we wanted people to actually have to do the work here to build um the ipf best chat chat bot and we're going to show you the code ryan's going to do an overview of that architecture to give you an idea of how that can work and we're going to take it from there i have a couple of resources here at the end so there's orbit core for orbit db which is a database on ipfs that allow you to do chat and then we have uh threads db from uh textile and again both these guys are in hack fs cool all right ryan i think it's all you i'm going to stop sharing my screen cool hi guys uh my name is ryan i'm one of the engineers at unstoppable domains uh and the team lead for uh the decentralized chat that we rolled out at unstoppable domains i'm gonna share my screen cool what is that uh so i'm gonna cover uh the things that we did uh to implement chat over unstoppable domains and some of the things that you guys could do for rolling out your own chat protocol on these other networks uh matt mentioned orbit db uh threads db or db orbit db is great uh it's built on top of ipfs and they have a incentive structure built with firecoin to for people to host content on uh their system and store forever so uh we built our chat system on uh on a different protocol uh that doesn't have this incentive structure so uh we're just doing like first concepts it had a login system built into that so one of the things that's required for building out a chat protocol is connecting out these domains to chat ids on a peer-to-peer storage network uh gundb was our protocol that we used and they have a login system that allows you to get a chat id it's a very long string it's over like 64 characters so blockchain domains were a perfect solution to this you ch you connect your chat id to your blockchain domain and if you want to chat with appear you just say hey contact me at ryan.crypto and chat for me from there and they'll look up your domain and they'll resolve it just like how they resolve uh cryptocurrency addresses they'll see okay this is your chat id this is how i resolve it these chat protocols should also implement encrypted direct messages using this identifier you can message other users um and the great thing about these blockchain domains is it allows a layer of security so it ensures that you are chatting with the right person when we first went about implementing this chat protocol i was able to spoof as another person right so our other engineer james was on an account and i was able to spoof as them because we didn't have this layer of security we implemented this uh form of signatures where i had to sign a message to create the username and the password and this allows james to or whoever i'm talking with to ensure that i'm actually the person i uh say i am because they are able to verify my signature that i signed with my private key so they'd be like okay if it doesn't match this domain's owner then i'm not chatting with the right person so it allows for this layer of like okay trust of like because your signature matches who you say you are and the domain's owner i'm sure i'm chatting with the right person uh there's also announcement channels so if you guys head over to unstoppable domain slash chat if you log in you can add contacts chat with other people but we also have these channels which allow you to broadcast so many people list of users like uh for example in telegram you have like 10 000 users you want to have your own channel uh talk with many users that are connected there uh the same goes for multiple people on one channel so uh this is harder to scale because so many people are talking in the same channel you have to incorporate all these messages of all these users in that channel so we haven't limited tests of this quite yet we will we will see we launched chat earlier this week so we're going to see how many users it takes we expect it to break at 1 000 or 10 000 with our current protocol um but we'll just have to see and of course you can send crypto to the people that you're messaging so because their uh their chat ids are tied to their blockchain domain you get other information like ipfs websites cryptocurrency addresses that they've linked to their domain name so it's very this is this is a very easy uh solution to do it's the same as resolving a chat id cool so these are the core features of this chat protocol if you guys were to implement this on uh other networks such as gundy or orbitdb i'm sorry and threads db so connecting to a blockchain domain to a peer-to-peer storage um this is required with accounts so when you're creating credentials uh you send them to the peer-to-peer network and then you'll get back a chat id or identifier that you will tie and link to your blockchain domain how we did this with gundb is that we required the signature of the domain and then for the password you could really use anything we use the signature of the username just so that our users don't have to remember a password and write it down all they have to do is sign their domain again i'm sorry their username and that becomes their password so they just do two signatures and they're they're logged in i'm actually going to show you guys real quick some part of the code that we used to create these accounts so here we just load up the gun db library we connect to a super peer uh and we request signatures for their domain from their wallet of course the signature has to come from the domains owner we do check this and as well as a password so when you're chatting with the uh user you are verifying their signature right because you can uh thanks to the great signature scheme is when you when you sign something you can uh ensure that this address sign this message right so the use gun username is the message for the password we have them sign again um and so for this is this is creating the account uh the same goes for if you are to um create contacts you're just looking up so you want to add ryan.crypto you're looking up their uh gundb username from that because this is stored in a record uh and their record is uh here's the fetch request right here so using the unstoppable domains api were able to find their gun username and their public key uh gundb has two identifiers it may be different for other networks that's a bit about that continuing on um so how do direct messages work we again we use a chat id that we've resolved from the blockchain domain and we send a contact request to the peer so how just based on how gundb works is that you can't write to another person's storage you kind of have to write it onto your own storage uh because you don't have permissions to write to someone else's storage so you're just saving out on your own and uh and then you're writing a connection a contact request in a public storage area which the contact you're messaging is going to be listening in from so they can get contact invites from this public storage area and they know okay i should check this other person's storage to see if i have messages from them and the person that's sending it encrypts this message on their own storage so that person can only read it i can see that you've written a bunch of messages on your storage but i can't read it unless i'm the peer that you're writing to uh and i can show this over in our little library that we wrote for gun db uh i hope i'm sharing the same screen yeah it should be the same screen uh so for example sending messages to contact this is our own unstoppable chat library that we wrote for gun db uh we are creating logging into the account getting the secrets this is this of course would be different for other protocols we encrypt this message with the secret kree gundb has account system so they generate public and private keys for you and you encrypt it you write it into your own your own storage and then you write into public storage and this is how messages are sent so uh the protocols will of course be different uh orbitdb is built on ipfs and they have their own login system so that's great makes it very easy to implement chat um by having an elongated system like that yeah ryan just a brief uh comment here so that everyone can kind of tune in and i guess what you can take from the chat is we've like found and we're he's gonna discuss some more things here but there's a few things that are going to be replicable and like if you know it's the signature schema so the idea of taking the person's person has a private key for the blockchain domain name and then using that to confirm uh their chat id and then associating that back to the blockchain domain name and that way you know when you're chatting with the person um ryan.crypto that you're you can confirm that it's actually the person who owns ryan.crypto so that signature schema on any any kind of decentralized chat network you know that's going to be critical that you're going to want to like uh that that uses a blockchain identifying domain you're going to want to like guarantee that the person you're talking to is that person so that signature schema like just that signing which is really simple but you want to make sure you get that right the other one is the contact for quest schema which brian uh kind of elucidated there and we actually had to think about that quite a bit um you're obviously going to have problems with people spamming you with contact requests um there's multiple ways of making a much more complex contact request system uh in our instance uh i i believe it's wide open ryan you can correct me if i'm wrong but we left it wide open because it was significantly easier to get the first build out that way but there's a lot of innovation that could be done with contact requesting um it's even more difficult for channels and i think ryan will talk about that a little bit more but you know if you want to have a contact request with a with another user you have to figure out how you're going to you know find each other and set up a system for doing that and and then you may also want to think about how you can prevent spam in that system so signature schema that's pretty straightforward but you just want to make sure you get that right contact request schema there's actually a lot of room for creativity around how that works um and then there's threading the chats so as ryan was describing like you only have permission to write to your piece right and then you have to have some sort of shared inbox when you open up a communication channel with another person um and then the way that we did it with the threading is we just look at the time stamps when was the thing written so when you look when you open up a chat you see my message then ryan's message than my message it's not like they're in order it's just that we can look at the data and see this timestamp and so the ui is actually putting that together so signature schema is going to carry over uh contact request schema there's some interesting things you can explore there and then you know threading the chat is mostly just a you know an engineering channel to make sure you get that right i'll make another comment on signature i mean sorry on request schema because ryan's about to discuss channels which i think is interesting um let's say you want to create a broadcast channel or you want to have a channel where there's a bunch of people in it uh or maybe you want to auto opt-in people right so like i think uh i believe we have a bot actually that that uh if you let's say you wanted to sign into an application that has web3 you know usually using uh web3 sign in which is becoming more common across ethereum you could have a bot automatically send that person a message and then that so that's part of the contact request schema you may also want to decide that that type of thing is spam so so there's a lot of there's a lot of art there on design which i think is going to be pretty cool to see how people solve that on peer-to-peer networks because right now you know it's kind of a thing across every network everyone gets spammed all right uh ryan sorry about that uh you can go ahead and get back to it my bad no no thanks so yeah so uh contact request was a big thing we auto accept just by our design choice we could also disable auto accepting contact requests but we have it enabled just so that it makes it easier for you to see other people's messages and see who's chatting because we want people sort of chatting right away so moving over to channels we have three different types of channels uh one is announcements where a list of admins can send messages to a group of people uh you guys know about these types of channels uh and what it is is one admin controls and holds the announcement channels and then is able to approve other users to send messages to this channel uh and then there's public channels anyone can join these channels uh as well as private so uh the private ones work similarly to announcements where people invited or admins and only uh these admins can also read these messages the design on how you guys go about building out these channels is of course different to each protocol and ensuring that these rules apply right only these people can send messages only these people can read these messages um so yeah uh i will i'll actually show you guys real quick on how we went about doing these channels uh so here is our library uh this is load channels um so we connect to this uh we store these channels in this public area and the person that created is automatically an admin and then they uh they approve other admins to these channels so uh this library is pretty dense there is a link to it that you guys can see um i don't want let me go ahead and drop it into the chat if it's not already there um and so yeah there's uh notifications as well uh that we uh put into these channels so when you receive a message uh it's also writing to the database saying okay i've read this don't don't notify me that this is already a message um cool uh ryan thank you yeah all right yeah uh let me show you the the last slide here with the team um oh you got us cool and i'll take i'll answer some of these questions so we have a couple more in here um the first one is from barat and he says is the entire unsolvable domains project completely open source so everything that's on chain is open and readable uh the library that we've built here for chat is open source we have actually several open source libraries for reading from the blockchain as well um our web app like out of the software domains.com where we take striped payments and stuff now that i mean that's not open source because that's our web store but where we can basically everywhere you would have a cons security concern um the code is open source or on chain um so you can go and read it yourself uh next question is there a possibility of building chat over react native so i actually don't know uh uh what is it uh react native uh so our website is built with react uh so a lot of our front-end code is transferable onto uh mobile uh our chat works on mobile as well like we just use uh gundb uses uh websockets and this is something you could use on mobile as well uh so yeah you could you could actually use our unstoppable chat library on react native it's javascript and this is an npm package cool sorry i just didn't understand the question um and then uh next question is about squatting on domain names so squatting is an unsolved problem um anyone who says they've solved it have not uh and there's all sorts of research around this the way that we have gone about trying to mitigate squatting um is we are uh we have a lot of domains that we we are trying to prevent people from uh registering so we and i actually just got a message in this chat someone had his domain um someone uh picked up his domain for his company before he got a chance to get it so we'll contact that person and see if we can get that back to him um there's not a perfect answer to squatting we're trying i think we have over a million domains that we have set aside as protected for trademark holders um and we're also working with like large list providers and also traditional trademark organizations to get those domain names to the right person so we've had for instance walmart um nike and a few other corporations go ahead and claim their uh crypto names and that's through our reach out to the business and try to make that um helpful cool michael made a suggestion is to require a grinded contact request i think that's pretty interesting so i just wanted to call that out leon asks where is the chat stored and it's actually stored on the peer-to-peer network in this case guntv and for the hackathon we'd want it stored on ipfs with either orbitdb or a threads tv and yeah and then the next one is does unstoppable support sub domains the answer is yes we're rolling that feature out slowly though because of phishing concerns um as you can imagine people are quite tricky so they went ahead and made domain names and then they would give themselves the subdomain of admin so like admin dot any name dot whatever um and so we want to make sure we're working with other people in the ecosystem so when you're doing your lookups you can tell if someone may be trying to fish you based off of a subdomain but yeah the subdomains do work and you are able to build them um someone's asked can you attack the resolver by signing a bunch of transactions and burning gas uh and not really sure how someone could uh yeah i'm not really sure about how someone could attack the resolver so uh if they if they don't have permission to sign then they would just be burning their own money uh to do it so and then within our um app within our application we're obviously monitoring transactions that we pay for cool all right guys that was uh great we're at our hour here i did not think we would go this long i appreciate the questions so i guess andrew and trent are much wiser than we are because they're like you guys are for sure are going to use your hour so i appreciate them telling us that and getting us prepped for it and excited to have you guys take a look at all the things that we're building and uh we'd love i mean i'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys build on chat as i said there's several there's several different pieces of technology you can tie together um to work on some of these projects the websites one is quite straightforward but the chat one for instance you know i know that the textile team is here and then i'm assuming orbit is probably floating around but you may be able to chain some prizes together right if you do chat so i highly suggest that as someone who's participated at multiple hackathons and ryan as someone who has won more hackathons anyone else on our team can tell you if you can get your entry in three or four places at once that's much better than just one so looking forward to the entries and if you guys have questions follow up with us we'll be at our office hours and uh thanks again uh hackfast for having us thank you um yeah you wrapped it up better than i could if anybody has questions jump in the slack uh in the dedicated unstoppable domains channels and i'm sure they'll be ready to answer your questions i think we can wrap there cool thank you again both of you everyone all right bye guys
