the protocol that we're building um i'm chaosada head of product at worldcoin do a bunch of random stuff here and so um just as a reminder here at the hack money hackathon we have 16k up for grabs for people that build uh on this proof of concept sdk so uh take a look at that but before getting directly into the into the protocol itself i want to take a step back and talk a little bit about the project world coin how we got to where we're at today and why we even built this sdk all right so world coin started about two years ago with a very simple premise like crypto is awesome uh but there's a few problems mainly two of them uh very few people have actually used crypto and the second one is that all of the value that's being unlocked by crypto or created by cryptocurrencies or all these protocols is being hoarded by early adopters like myself or people with disposable income that just get to accumulate all this value and we think that sucks right and so we asked a very simple question what would have happened if bitcoin had started by giving one bitcoin to every person that was alive at that time right uh and so this as simple as it sounds we think it could have accomplished a couple of things right it could have first of all educated a lot of people about cryptocurrencies around the world secondly it would have meant that probably a significant amount of those people would be using uh blockchain based products today and then most importantly you would have spread out the value that bitcoin has generated right to the world and so obviously it was a little bit late to do this for crypto uh and for bitcoin sorry but we said what the heck let's just try it ourselves and so we created a token called world coin um and we started working on this about two years ago and so worldcoin is very simple there's 10 billion tokens every person can get some tokens for free simply for being humans until the tokens run out right and so a percentage of small percentage of the tokens are meant to fund the project but the vast majority of tokens are giving away to the world for free as an initial distribution and so this all sounded great but we run into one problem how do we make sure each person only claims their tokens only one time right when you're giving away free money uh i mean it's obvious that people will want to double dip and this seemed like a very innocent problem at first but actually we end up realizing this was super hard and there's the academic term for this civil attacks it's basically everything from twitter bots to random likes on youtube to attacks on airdrops is some it's a problem that is really really difficult to solve how do you make sure that a person only does something one time right and so as we started looking into how to solve this there were a couple of issues that came up with different solutions right uh first of all we wanted whatever we did to be super private right uh the second thing is if we wanted to do a global air drop we need to make sure it was inclusive we needed to work in every country around the world and lastly needed to be scalable right specifically for what we're trying to do is we're trying to keep welcoming to as many people as possible which means that it needs to be realistic and there needs to be a path for reaching hundreds of millions if not billions of people and so we started looking at a bunch of ways how to solve these right we started by saying okay let's just make people verify their emails or their phone numbers like social apps do turns out that's pretty easy to to get around then we said okay let's verify official ids right like passwords but the problem with that was first of all turns out most people in the world or many people in the world don't have an id and many of the ones that do are in countries where there's no sdks or apis to actually verify them remotely right and even if that was possible it turns out like this is super costly and more importantly it's super privacy invasive right we did not want to collect all of the sensitive information from basically everyone on earth uh this would be exclusive liability for us or for any partners that we shared it with then we run into this other approach called web of trust which is basically the idea that users can endorse each other right and so if you trust a certain amount of users they can verify other people as real people and so we thought this was really interesting but the problem is you need an initial set of users that you can trust uh and when you're trying to verify the entire world with web of trust you need a really large initial set of users that's evenly spread across the world and so this is actually how we eventually plan to scale oral coin but for now between one and a billion people we had to find a different path which led us to biometrics right like when we took a step back and we said okay what really makes people different between each other is their biometrics right and so we started looking at okay what can we do here uh i won't run through every single option that we run into but basically the challenge with biometrics is you need to have enough data to make sure that you can distinguish between one and ten billion people and it needs to be very difficult to cheat right so for example something like a fingerprint it does not have enough data to distinguish one in a billion people it works for our phones because on our phone you're only doing a one-to-one comparison right you're comparing the finger that it's seeing to a previous recording of your finger right so if it matches it lets you in with world coin we actually had the opposite problem right we had to look at your fingerprint and compare it against every other fingerprint that we've seen in the past to make sure that you haven't signed up before and that's super super difficult additionally it's really easy to just make a small card on your finger and now you're on your person and so you run into similar things when you say you look at people's faces or even at palms and the veins on their pumps dna is super creepy so we didn't want to do that and eventually we realized that uh like many other systems in the world that the iris has these two properties right there's enough data it's called enough entropy there to distinguish between a large set of people and it's also very difficult to to change right even twins for example have different irises and so once we have that we said okay let's try to build this on a phone right uh but it turns out that phones uh their their sensors are just not powerful enough to distinguish between enough enough people right something like an iphone can distinguish between one in 10 million people not one in 10 billion people uh same thing with off-the-shelf hardware right when you look at what uh people do for example in customs or clear they're able to to buy software of the shelf because they're doing a one-to-one comparison right they you basically go get registered and then the next time you go to the airport they're comparing those biometrics to your previous recording uh and so we didn't want to do that right and so eventually we ended up realizing that we had to do custom hardware and this is something that we tried really really hard to avoid um but eventually we just said okay if we want to solve this problem we're going to have to build our own hardware and so we got into two years of really hard r d and so it took about five generations uh and a long time of prototypes and eventually we got this little beauty which you might have seen on twitter at some point this device is called the orb it's a ball of about this size and it has three jobs right the first job of the orb is to make sure that you're a real person it looks at your face and it checks that uh that you're alive that you actually have uh facial features that you're not wearing prosthetics uh a bunch of things like this right basically to establish trust this is one of those things that's not very obvious but none of the commercial commercially available sensors would have had right the second thing that it does is that it looks at your iris and it generates a code from your iris and then the last thing that it does is on device it will compute a hash of that iris it can compare it for uniqueness and then if it's unique it signs it and it posts it actually on chain right so once world coin is live uh none of your images have to leave the orb right and so this is a really really cool system now in terms of privacy this means that no images will have to leave the orb we don't need your name we don't need your contact info we don't need your email we need your phone number we need to kyc you right but this was still not private enough for us there was two problems here the first one is that your iris hash would be connected to your wallet right and that's something we don't want uh and the downside of this is that would force you to only have one identity instead of many identities including pseudonymous ones and so we did a lot of thinking of how can we improve on top of this and we ended up doing uh another layer using zero knowledge proofs right this is some really really cool technology that many of you are probably familiar with which basically what they allow us to do is uh allow you to disconnect your iris hash from your wallet so no one not even world coin will know which iris hash that is public on chain corresponds to each wallet and so this is a very complicated system you can read about it on our website i won't get into it but basically once we have that we said okay and now let's go out to the world and test it and so about six months ago uh or nine months ago i guess at this time we started really really testing intensely we've been in about 25 countries uh probably more at this time all over the world right we had to test everything from temperatures for the orbs right operating really cold conditions and really hot conditions uh in rich countries and in poor countries uh with a lot of different languages and different local traditions to test the entire project right during this time we've had almost 600 000 people sign up to the to the beta and during the beta it's important to highlight that the privacy guarantees are different because there are some things that we're still competing on server and whatnot and we're very upfront about this uh to the participants and uh and and so right now we're at phase we're still finishing this beta right we're all going the token is not live yet we're still operating in all of these countries and this is only with about 25 orbs on the field now the really cool thing that we're doing right now is that we're about to get our first shipment of 250 orbs that come from a lab from a factory instead of formal lab and then the next one we'll get another 250 and so on and so forth so if with 25 verbs on the field we've gone to these numbers it's pretty easy to imagine uh how quickly we can scale as we get more devices and so all of these all of this stuff from the software to the hardware to the firmware and the protocol we announced about a month ago that we're open sourcing and we laid out a roadmap to for each of these components so i encourage you to check it out some parts of these are already open source so you can start playing with uh in addition to that we've started opening up uh did a bunch of things uh for building in public basically we're also setting the path to decentralize but there's throughout all of this there is one question we kept getting from devs like you which is all of this is really cool but how can i reuse this identification or this verification on my app right because your global currencies it's a cool experiment but i have another idea of what i would do with this and as we talked with many of you we realized that yes there's a lot of cool things that you can build when you solve civil resistance but we're not willing to compromise on privacy right uh when we have control over all of these things in the worldwide project we're able to make these promises but we were very concerned to be honest about opening up these two developers and so we thought a lot of how to go about letting other people build um on this verification without violating user privacy and so some suggestions people made as well just white list the wallets right uh or issue unique ids per user and it turns out all of these don't work uh for reasons that you can track users across apps or you don't you cannot support multiple identities or you can match the biometrics from one user to to the to the wallet and so at the end of the day we said okay if we're going to build an sdk it has to be built on the same zero knowledge proofs that we use ourselves and so with that we built what we called world id and today you're getting a sneak peek of the alpha of that and it's very simple it's a protocol that allows you to anonymously verify that someone is real and that they haven't performed some action before right so just as today we use this protocol to say hey i'm a real person and i have never claimed worldcoin before now with this sdk you can have any other action right and so people can say hey i'm a real person and i have never minted this nft before or i'm a real person and i've never joined this discord before all of these all of these actions that users can perform do not are not connected to each other unless they use the same wallet right but when it comes to world id there's nothing that links them together and so i can for example with one identity participate in the governance of uni swap and with another identity means an ft and the world doesn't know that both of those people is me the world only knows that me as a human behind all of these identities only performed each of these actions once right and so all of this is actually pretty complex system that you can read about more in our talks but we wanted to make it super easy to use both for devs and for users and so for devs what we did is we built a super simple widget that you can implement with three lines of code to your projects and for users we created this abstraction that is sort of like a captcha right but instead of proving that you are not a robot you're proving that you are a human that has never done something before and so this is a super simple capture widget this is super simple widget right now it's on on javascript um which you can integrate and so what it looks like is let's imagine you're a project called mesha right that you want to execute on airdrop so typically your your website would look something like this right where users can connect their wallet and just claim it but then if they connect many wallets they can just claim it many times so what you can do with world id is you can now embed this uh this world id widget just like here and it's very similar to a captcha right the button is locked and you have to complete the the challenge for world id so when you check on the checkbox it brings up a qr code uh behind the scenes this works with wallet connect which you scan using the world coin app where your identification lives you approve it from the app that is reflected on the website and then the claim button is enabled right this means that in this example i could have connected any wallet that i wanted to receive the tokens but i will only be able to execute this with one wallet okay if i try to do this again even if i connect a different wallet this captcha will fail okay now we actually went ahead and built this example and you can play with it so if you go to worldcoin.org hackmoney you can actually find the tab the source code the smart contracts for this specific example so that you can get a better idea of how to go about implementing this um this is exactly the flow that we just talked about right for users basically first they need to go to an orb which introduces the moral id and they store it on their phone on the world coin app then you as a developer can integrate the world id widget and then when users want to use it they can scan that and approve it from their phones their phones generates the serial knowledge proofs on device that allows them to to use this and then you as a developer get notified from this and you can execute whatever action you want to do and so this is super flexible right we envision these being used for things like voting right for dao so for airdrops they're just we think a really really big deal whether it's nfts or protocols decentralizing or education uh for things like quadratic voting right and quadratic funding uh doing personal bound nfts account creation and even probably web 2 use cases uh this does not replace kyc in in every case because sometimes you need kyc for compliance but in the case where you're trying to do it for fraud prevention it's actually pretty effective and so all of these is available today with a really really cool set of uh additional tools to make your life easier uh on polygon and we will be deploying on additional networks soon and so you get a couple of things you get the underlying network there is a javascript widget that basically is an abstraction on top of that protocol we have a really complete set of talks and guides for this alpha for you to play with and we've even done a simulator for the app and for the orb right we know that orbs and the app itself is not available in every country and so you can actually play with a similar that i'll show you in a second and then lastly we put together one example and over the next weeks and months we'll be releasing additional example projects of how you can implement world id so all of this is made possible by three open source projects mainly semaphore hubble and wild connect so we want to give them a huge shout out and we are contributing to all of those projects and we hope you do too and we have big plans for uh for world id as it comes right uh we'll very soon have uh deep linking support so that mobile apps can just move between our app and and adapt other chains uh and a bunch of other really cool things in terms of the timeline right now you're getting a sneak peek at the very very first alpha we literally just put this together so this we're keeping this a little bit low-key it's not secret it's on our discord but we're not really advertising it it only works with the mock app with the app simulator that i showed you and it only works on polygon uh over the next month a month or two we will actually do a formal announcement it will actually be implemented into the real world coin app so that you can access all of the real users that have already verified an orb and we'll keep iterating all of these with all of the feedback that you give us and then sometime later this summer we'll actually open up this for all developers it'll be on multiple chains and we we will be in the scaling phase when it comes to verifying users with the ors now if you're interested in building on these uh we're super happy to obviously talk through a discord but also just to schedule a one-on-one call with you so that uh we can get your feedback and you can ask questions so you can find us in the discord channel on sponsor dash worldcoin on the official discord or on our own in discord.js so in summary before opening up for questions world id is a simple is a protocol to solve civil resistance at scale in a private way it is self-custodial and open source and it is super easy to use and to implement we have about over sixteen thousand dollars in prices for teams that decide to hack on this uh and give us feedback during the hackathon uh some of these are specific prices and there's even a pool that will get distributed amongst any project that gets built and also any project that that builds during this this hackathon will also be fast-tracked uh in the community grants if they choose to keep building on this that we're about to announce in a couple of weeks all right so that's pretty much it we hope you hack on this and if you really really like it consider joining the team for hiring across the board and so with that i will open up to our questions all right let me see here chat so how can i get my world id where are these orbs so right now the orbs are available uh during the beta we have very few orbs right now and so we move them around countries depending on what we need to test uh if you go on the app store on google play and look for world coin if you see the world coin out there that is good news because it means that at some point we have operated in your country so you can download that uh and then within the worldcoin app you can actually find a map where all of the orbs that are available uh show up if you do not see the world coin app there then that means we have never been in your country yet and um and that we will be there soon uh as we get a lot more orbs over the next months we will go even to more countries and so keep posted on our on our social networks let's see are you going to sell the hardware orbs or will they be specific okay no so we will not sell the orbs because as a user you only need to go to the orb ones right as a user you go to the orb you show a qr code that on the world coming up to the orb then you get verified by the orb and so then uh basically your app becomes very five okay and so the orbs are it's basically like a big economy model similar to uber or airbnb where there's people around the world that go with the orbs they earn a small amount of roll coin for every person they verify and so they move fluidly in neighborhoods and we also expect that at some point there will be stationary orbs in different cities around the world all right if you're interested in applying to become one of these people you can do so on the website on worldcoin.org uh there is a section where you can apply to operate orbs around the world where is the hash of the iris stored so at launch uh the end state is that you will be stored on chain right and anyone will be able to see it so we don't have any special privilege over these uh as we talk about in the in a couple of blog posts on the website during the beta we're still building to that right and so today uh we still store that on our servers on our encrypted servers and we make that very clear when you sign up um and when you sign up today we also give you the option of backing up the images themselves also on our servers the reason people choose to do this is um because we're still updating the algorithm which we use to generate that that iris code right and so um what happens is if you don't back up your images basically your verification gets expired and you need to return to an orb and so some users would rather do that and have us not store their images and so that is a choice that they have but if you trust us you can during the beta you can backup your images which means that we can just recompute the iris hash on those same images and and basically keep your verification active instead of expiring it if you have multiple phones and generate multiple identities how does worldcoin validate as a person i'm registering once so basically you can only the orb will only allow you to sign up once right and so supporting multiple identities is a level above world id basically you can have many wallets and use whichever wallet you want but behind the scenes you can only have one world id now if you lose that we will eventually have a flow where you can go to an orb and basically revoke your old world id and get a fresh one issued right so this is important not just for account recovery but also to de-incentivize people from buying and selling this right if i sell you my world id but then i can go to an orb and just steal it back then it makes it a lot less likely for you to buy it okay so we will eventually support that so after initial verification my device phone becomes an id verification station for users yes uh and now this this key basically that verification is like a private key right just as you have a private key for your wallet you have a private key for your world id so that private key you can backup to icloud or google drive we might eventually let you export it we don't do that because we don't want people selling buying and selling world ids and so right now you can back it up to icloud or google drive and so if you download uh the app on another device where you have the same i clear google drive account you can restore that and just use it across the board right now obviously you will only be able to use it once so if you use it on your ipad once you cannot use it again on your iphone let's see can you explain ck piece a little bit more for sure so basically there is actually this is a good segue for me to show you this so if you go to worldcoin.org money you'll get on this notion we're going to find a lot of resources uh the guidelines for the hackathon the prices resources for hacking directly on world id including some ideas and here in background reading you can actually read introducing semaphore semaphore white paper or advances in serial knowledge pros will be a great primer to learn more about ckps some of the oops i'm sure you can screen here again some of the other things that you can find here uh is a link to the documentation which i was mentioning right it's a pretty pretty complex not complex complete um set of guides and examples of how to use the javascript widget and things like that for you to hack with world id and you also get the link to the app and orb simulator right so basically this allows you to simulate that you have uh an orb and that you have an app and it allows you to play with this as a developer so that you can build applications on top of world id let me look at the chat here if ubi is implemented will it be withdrawable to different wallet addresses if your general address is compromised yes because world id is not connected to your wallet right so it depends on the implementation of whoever is doing the ubi but basically what you could do is you could say okay every month there is basically a new trench of ubi right and every month you need to verify with the withdrawal id that you haven't claimed that month's ubi and so every month you get to choose which wallet you connect right and so even if you lose the wallet that you've used in previous months as long as you still have access to world id or you have gone to an orb to recover it uh then you can just connect a new wallet and then keep claiming your upi with that all right and i don't know how we're doing with time i know there's still a couple of questions should we keep answering them here should we send them to discord how should we go about this yeah we can go for another two three minutes if you want to answer um as many as you can and then uh maybe go to discord afterwards sounds great all right so what do we expect hackers to implement on top of world id all right so i mean i think there's a lot of problems that um that you can solve with civil resistance right it's not about what we expect it's about what you think you can build we have some of the eyes of what you can do with that we envision uh for example doing dow governance right where each person can only vote once uh or airdrops where maybe you create a pfp nft where each human can only claim one but they can claim it for free right or something like retroactive air drops like what optimism just did maybe there's a world where uh having civil resistance is very useful for that right uh also projects like bitcoin right they rely on civil resistance and currently they use a lot of factors to make sure that the quadratic votes are fair right and so there's there's some ideas in this slide if you want to take a screenshot we have more ideas on the notion of worldcoin.org hackmoney but it's really whatever you can think of all right and let's take one last one could you keep your worldcoin private key on a hardware wallet ah that's a good question so that is not supported today but it might be something interesting to explore whether um world ids should or could be stored on a hardware wallet instead of a regular wallet as of today the world id can only be stored on the official worldcoin app the reason for this is that we actually also rely on some fraud prevention mechanisms directly in the app right and so right now we haven't had the bandwidth frankly to figure out how to have those same fraud prevention guarantees in third-party clients for issuing world id and so for now that can only leave on the world going up but it's a very interesting question to think about how to do it somewhere else all right and let's do one last one so if vote on doubt for example signing my wallet verify the world id as well and then i will try to do the same action with another wallet it will be restricted to one vote yes exactly so if you vote let's say that there's the compound governance right and you get to vote uh basically compound could do a one person one vote system where each person connects a wallet they vote and to vote they have to verify with world id that they have never voted before and so if they try to vote again with a different wallet then they will not be able to do so all right all right cool i think that's pretty much it uh if you have any questions hit us up on discord uh again in the either in the official channel or uh in the world coin discord and we'll be happy to chat with you there directly or schedule a one-on-one some call awesome thank you so much tiago thiago that was super super informative uh got a lot of really interesting questions um so super glad that you're able to answer them um so thank you so much for taking the time to do this workshop for hack money um and for the rest of you thank you so much for joining um as tiago thiago said um the world coin team is available on discord both on their own discord as well as in the sponsor world coin channel on the youth global discord um so definitely hit them up if you have any questions um and with that being said i hope everyone has a great rest of your day evening or morning it's good have fun hiking
