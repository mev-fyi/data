so uh welcome everybody this is our last day of eat online judging uh this is a group three where we're gonna do a lot more demos of all the remaining projects that we have not just so far and uh this has been an amazing month for all of us we had over 700 hackers participating in this event and they're coming in from 65 different countries in 19 different time zones and uh we are going to be jumping into a lot of their demos so 175 projects were submitted for this uh this month and uh we saw an amazing set of projects from tackling d5 to scaling to nfd and gaming and uh we are going to be looking at a subset of them today in this call and uh and going through uh some of the comments and feedback from those projects with our judges and i want to kind of thank everybody for for being here so uh the quick format of how this session is going to go each team will have eight minutes in total uh they'll have four minutes to uh showcase their video demo uh which they pre-recorded to minimize any technical difficulties and they'll be four-minute q a uh post demos for each team and uh because we have a lot of projects going on we'll do a short break for our judges and some of our hackers to kind of rest uh halfway through this point and uh and then we'll kind of resume with the demos so kind of the the way each project is going to be looked at is going to be on five different categories so we will rate projects on how technical original practical they are and then also uh on on the their design aspect on how kind of they they fire into the ui ux developer experience for their projects and we also recognize that this is uh not the only way to look at a project and the only categories that that may be uh considered so we also have a catch-all that we like to call wow factor that lets us offset a handful of the things that would have missed in the previous four categories and before we kind of jump into our our very first demo uh i want to just really emphasize that people are here to learn this particular event has 50 percent newcomers into the web 3 ecosystem so the goal from our site is to allow them to experiment and uh and kind of really showcase what they were excited about and how close they got to finishing it and people are not aiming to be businesses some of them will choose to do so at their own sort of pace but uh it's not something that's being either incentivized or emphasized or or uh or encouraged uh necessarily so uh the hackers are very much here to get feedback and the goal for today's demo is going to be just really seeing uh what interesting things that matter to each of them and and kind of uh seeing them in in practice so with that said uh doing the hard job today are our three judges i want to kind of thank uh sid from coinbase dimitri from bollinger investments and ashley from the air protocol for being here uh they'll be uh our three judges for uh for today they'll be kind of walking through all of the projects and kind of giving their comments and feedback to each of those uh teams and uh they're all here now and we'll just kick this off immediately with our very first demo for today so i'll uh i'd like to kind of welcome our first team which is uh project mindful so uh we are in the process of promoting this team now and whenever they kind of get on we should be able to have them share their screen and kick off with their demo sorry carter can you promote them for this round i just realized i missed something so uh let me correct for that and i have made you uh co-host as well you know anticipation perfect thank you got it all right can you guys hear me yes we can so uh whenever you're ready feel free to share your video on it i don't like where this is going that's a smelly face uh looks like we don't have any audio so if you would just mind uh stopping that and checking the audio box one more time that would be easier chris um i don't have an option for that uh on zoom there should be a sound checkbox yeah i know it's i did it earlier on it's minimized now um if uh if that is not working what we can do is we can just play the video for you here with the audio but um all right it worked earlier on um i can't see this in the zoom settings zoom why you forsake me i can't find this um yeah if you could play it that would work it doesn't give me that option anyway let me try it that's okay i could have heard it on your side i will just play that video for you guys um thank you all right we can see a cryptid degeneration's natural habitat he rejects crouppen safe strategies in favor of being in a buying tops and selling buttons time and time again demolishing his hard-earned gains who in his chances of accumulating generation of wealth training is a hard game to play but what if you didn't have to play it the daily normal one say discipline smart contract based investment strategy to happiness and discipline degeneracy needs to suffer it is time to silence joy in a degenerate introducing mindful portfolio by nine meant for d gens mindful was created by a team of d5 d gens they know what it's like to get wrecked when the lizard brain takes over with this new platform you can adopt strategies dc angel assets rebalance your portfolio and take profits without emotion taking over unlike other portfolio rebalancing tools mindful incorporate set and forget dcr in strategies and automatic profit-taking users also collect fees from balancer by depositing funds in a chakra and the system is completely trustless and now let us venture onto the platform to see how it works this is the mindful dashboard here you can view all of your current chakras interactive charts show you the performance of your chakras over time dca and profit-taking strategies can be edited or even paused if the user deems it necessary you can also make deposits and take files from your shop class at any time however mindful recommends that you don't get to monkey mind succumb to fomo trust upon the asset breakdown tab details the composition of a chakra here you can see your current holdings are set allocations and every token's price performance for history the actions taken by your chakras strategy it is also available so that you can examine this performance in greater detail and of course be ready for tax season creating a new chakra is simple give it a fun name and then select up to eight different assets remember shortcuts were only as strong as their weakest asset so they would be sensible once you are happy with your tokens you can move on to setting up your allocations your chakra will automatically maintain these ratios so you don't need to worry about rebalancing your portfolio next you will have to set up your initial contribution you can do single asset entry or enter using the exact assets of the ratios you specify above the final step is to set up a dca and profit taking strategy specify how much you want to dca in and how often you want to do it then set up the parameters for how much profit to take and when to take it now you are ready to go wonderful isn't it i can feel my chakras lining already so how does it all work every chakra is controlled by a unique balancer pool when the conditions are met to dca or take profits an automatic relay executes the by or cell transaction receiving a 0.3 percent fee for their troubles to avoid slippage our interactions with the balancer pool use multi-asset deposits and withdrawals the mindful proxy contract then trades these assets into the required tokens on uni swap and sends them directly to the user's wallet as a part of their degeneracy minimizing philosophy the mindful team has decided not to test in production instead they plan on using any prized money from the ethernet hackathon to have their contracts audited now that's mindful behavior ready to learn more go to mindful guard cash and prepare to silence your energy generally that was our wonderful first demo for today um maybe a lot of applause for that video how did you guys get david attenborough to uh to narrate it yeah we were [Laughter] kick it off with the first set of comments or questions um okay so so my comments i mean i i'd love to hear um you know what sid and dimitri have to think but i'm i'm still kind of like who did all the marketing and and the memeing on that because you guys like really tuned in and over delivered there so i'm i think that's really great um and i wanted to chat about that for a second uh that'd be me and uh lisa um yeah yeah really engaging and really amazing copy and understanding like your demographic so kudos kudos to that glad you enjoyed it yeah so so maybe i could jump in with a question um i assume you could do this with all all erc20s but what's the kind of uh space of assets that uh that someone could uh use to create these yeah so you could use any erc20 that's traded on uni swap pretty much or alternatively on balancer um you can these are basically like balance of smart pools the same way that their current exchanges are not are set up now um you wouldn't want to put in any tokens that have like a rebalancing or rebasing mechanism so like others they die or like yams wouldn't work but that's because those aren't compatible with balancer pools in any case but anything in which there's liquidity on your knees up would work just fine got it and and do you think that um the ideal assets are the ones that have a sufficient amount of liquidity i guess could anything happen if um if it's a very thinly traded asset and and how that affect the strategy i i mean i think it would be similar to any kind of uh amm pool where you have an asset that loses value and you end up holding that bad asset so you don't want to be putting like coins in these funds ideally it would be similar to like a full two scenario you know with normal yield farming or you end up just holding all of the other coin so i would say like you know the goal with this was really to to create a portfolio of like blue chip assets but you could put like some other type of things in there like in the demo we put pickle in the fund and i think that's kind of fine but i wouldn't want to put something that that's going to get rug pulled because then you're going to just end up holding all of that got it yep that makes sense thanks and just to add to that so we plan on integrating into the ui a sort of warning if something doesn't have enough liquidity or if it's being traded very thinly just to make sure that people are trading mindfully and making their portfolios as strong as possible yeah yeah i i think this is a really interesting application of of a balancer pool here good stuff uh folks amazing demo really really loved it everything from the memes to the product functionality uh quick question uh i'm just i'm looking at the uh the gurus feature did you do y'all build that out or is that like a future road map item that was a dream item we didn't we didn't quite get to that so we kind of focused on the core functionality but the idea with that is basically if you can take like set protocols like copy trading you should be able to do something similar with a distribution in a in a chakra so it's like more personalized than set protocol stuff because you can still you know copy those initial allocations and then potentially copy like the dca entering strategies and the exiting strategies but yeah the initial version doesn't have that got it thank you is there kartik i don't know is there a way that we can kind of um like get access to that video or play a little bit i'm still like learning the the g-gen ropes myself so i'd love to kind of dive in a little bit more um as well but yeah that'd be great yeah from your score sheet you can click on the name and it's a link and now they'll take you to it oh of course because they're so clever great um there are no more questions from the judges maybe i'll ask the last one uh how do i get my next uh how did you guys get the iteration working out i want to know the the service or how that happened just i just want to do that same thing for the next thing for eighth global um yeah there's a there's a website called vocodes vo codes and they have like i think it's some sort of neural net kind of thing a lot of voices i was debating between spongebob or david attenborough well i'm glad that you that was the winner for sure i just saw his documentary that he just did recently it's so on point oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there was a little bit of inspiration there might have been a man at the time great all right well thank you so much as well ashley you asked about finding uh more about it we wrote a medium article as well which you can find linked on our showcase profile if you want to read more awesome cool thank you good to see you too yeah you do thanks everyone that's great thank you so much for being our first demo and with that we are ready to move on to our next team and that is project vault alarm so ramiro i know you're on the call so whenever you're ready feel free to share your video hello hello and welcome to my youth online 2020 project submission this is safebots my name is ramirez gonzalez i'm a full stack developer from argentina so for this hackathon my project was on ios app let's user track and evolve from the maker protocol so my idea was to let users show information about their faults their positions as quickly as possible even try the new ios widgets and will alert users in case there's a liquidation risk so go into the app basically we show the price from some collaterals and we let the users track any vault that they want it's as simple as entering for example the id of the fault and we can display the information that it might be useful so we let the users activate or deactivate alarms see the price the ratio the collateral and the depth they have taken so uh for example another one with a different collateral so we basically try to alert the user in case there's a risk of a liquidation having access also to the [Music] oracles for from maker it's also nice to let the users see all the prices for the different collaterals and not only show the current price but also the next price as the oracle is updated once an hour and this is especially what i wanted to build and try and test was the new widgets so that users can with a simple swipe even when the phone is blocked can see and be assured that their position is collateralized and is not as at risk so basically i wanted to challenge myself and try the new swift one that's basically what was built uh the app with also there are some calls to the blockchain to the mainnet and some public apis and some local notifications what i need to do next is be sure that alerts work we don't want any users to be trusting too much enough that it's not completely tested well of course polish the app get some feedback and continue building if the users find it worth it maybe uh the app can also integrate some some other protocols so that was my project i have fun building this this small app and i hope you like it awesome thanks ramirez i'll let our judges kick off any questions nice i could kick off first of all i think this is a really important project to work on i think we all need more uh risk management tools and and obviously no one wants to lose money um so really like the overall focus here i'm curious what happens when it's below a certain threshold is there any functionality now or plan to potentially be able to top that up whether automatically or through the mobile ui i was trying to well make it sound like i'm on an alarm basically i had some yield farming friends that wake up every two hours just to check uh their phone just to see if uh if price didn't went down too much so basically if i don't know i know it's not recommended but i sleep with my phone as an alarm near my near my bed so why don't you just make a sound whenever there is a risk got it and and can you apply this uh beyond maker can you do this for like uh compound positions or or yeah i i was also checking uh ave on compound but i knew more about maker i just and also was what some colleagues were recommending me to do because it was useful for them yeah yeah cool but yeah it's uh it was just a test i was sort of hacking and i was just trying to push myself and try something new gotta build something useful without making something completely strange cool thanks did you work on this yourself or did you have anyone else as a part of your team no i have some friends that guide me or just test the app and give me some feedback but yeah i code everything by myself got it okay and who did and you did the design as well or your friends helped with that or no i i copied a little bit some apps that already exist but yeah it doesn't have much of a design to be honest but it's just as clean as possible it's at least straightforward um so i mean design in terms of like uh you know being a little bit less complicated in terms of um interacting with it i'm kind of curious your thoughts too coming from coinbase yeah i think it's a super useful feature i know there's a lot of people that would really like to have a quick alarm that warns them when they're about to get wiped out uh i was just curious actually uh ramiro great project what was the hurdle you encountered with getting the alarm to work so the what i actually needed to do was to run some background tests did some background threats on when the phone is locked and the app is not even running and ios does that in a weird way i just can't set like a chrome work like every minute update i have to like ask how many times i want to run that background app and uh well on the ios kind of in an intended way just try to find out how it's more optimized and it doesn't make all the requests i want to do but maybe i was trying to ask the protocol updates only once an hour maybe just try to run it every 15 minutes uh it doesn't have to be by the second so do you have a nice background yep sorry so i would say do you have an idea of how you might change the architecture to make it work and actually get live alarms uh i was just trying i did have some experience with the previous version of swift and as a full stack i wanted to try something new and i was just trying and i think and i thought the the hackathon was a nice opportunity to try to type code and see what was going to happen yeah that's great i do have to get more more i do have to invest more time if i want to do to publish the app to make sure that if there's an optimal way to do so got it thank you awesome thank you so much romero and uh yeah i guess i hope you continue building this thing because i would definitely love to uh try this out on my phone um so with that uh we are ready to move on to our next demo that is team uh tights gas saver so uh corbin and team i think you're already on this panel list so whenever you're ready feel free to kick off with your video thanks hello i'm flavio i'm from brazil and i will show the solution that i build okay uh floppy i think uh you forgot to check the audio box so we're not seeing sorry we're not getting audio so would you mind uh sharing it again with you okay thanks hello my name is flavio gover and i will share with you the projects i built at global hackathon the problem i got was the issue of gas in ethereum transactions this creates some problems for users the user has to deal with them predictable gas prices he also needs to buy heater for roon transactions and the high prices drive away many users for this reason i decided to create titus a usc dc gas saver the main concept of tides is to enable users to save ether on sending transfers or enable users to earn usdc calling these transfers imagine the example of the frog froggy uses usdc and he wants to transfer his west disease to someone else or maybe deposit it on a long-term defy protocol he is no hurry to complete this transaction then he can use the tights to help him save his transfers fees once connected he can create an approval to be later called by another user to store the approval he has to define the recycling of the transfer the amount of the transfer how much he wants to pay a steep and a deadline for approval to be active after that he must confirm the two methods in his wallet one for the main transaction and other for the tip payment also his segment is a profile already appears on our list and can be counted by another who's user who wants to pay the gas for the transactions and receive the tip in usc dc for each complete transfer the user who sent the transaction receives the university corresponding tip for the transaction this is done by types smart contract which is responsible for receiving the types and send it to the user who paid the transactions gas fees in short it works like this the sender sing the two factory transactions after this they are stored together in the approval storage servers then another person the while selects as many sets of the approvals as we want and cause the function multiplied transfer which authorization and the contract is encodes the transferring sequence first it sends the type to the title smart contracts and then the main transaction to the recycling chosen by the frog this string ensures that the tip will be paid before the main transaction is executed at the end the balance of the smart contract that recycled the types is sent to the radio this is just the beginning and much remains to be done in this rackatom i created this concept the smart contract and tested in robsten test net i also created a demo a pp using angular the next steps are create a service to store a provost and facilitated the sending of book transactions maybe this will be created in a layer 2 of ethereum after the testis titles will go to the mainnet and in the very near future it can be used even for deposits and withdrawals in the five protocols that's it for now i hope you liked it amazing that's a that's a lot that you are able to kind of focus on so i'll uh i'll let our three judges kind of come in and ask any questions yeah thank you for that um i mean gas fees have uh really kind of been the the vein of everyone's existence in the space so certainly there needs to be creative solutions um i'm curious given this architecture who you think like specific users or specific verticals that you think um you know can really take advantage of how you structured ties um i i don't know i didn't think about this yet but i i think this would be useful for um for a people that want to sign transaction and they're not hurt to complete this like a deposit on a landing for a stable coin like usdc a long-term uh investors i think this is a good way to to save to save return on sending transactions because usdc permits this and they their person too and uh and i i think that that's the other ways that the people can uh pay less for the gas and one one a way that i i created in this in this project uh permits other person to to earn uh some talking west dc helping other people to saving either both sides wins in this game cool thank you that's great and i'm curious uh and and also echo what ashley said around gas fees of course um this is something that that it's pretty easy to tell someone would want um how would the ux look like from someone who is calling it um uh do you do you have a sense of what that would look like from uh from from the other side yes i think this um the people can select and filter uh uh the the transactions that was uh was sent by the users who want to transfer and the the person can calculate if the transaction will be profitable and i think i will will be something like this at least and and the person can select when the transactions that want to send and one feature that i think it's a good it's uh to calculate the gas in heater and comparate this with the the tips that they can be recycled sending these transactions i don't know if i was clear yeah yeah that makes sense thanks yes hey flavio thanks great project uh what happens when users if users underpay the tip and it's not enough to cover the gas does it just sit around and no one will no one will pick it up sorry when users select the transactions they uh they they wait the the transactions i think it's just someone one step in their browser wallet and do users uh they decide how much they want to tip is that equivalent to the gas that they would have paid otherwise no no in this version the user can can post can set the gas tip as he wants and and the other person can select or not the transaction okay i don't know if i answered your question but for me it was a huge the challenge to do this and i started as developer about a half and a year and i'm practicing english in this this hackathon and but and it was an amazing experience i'm very happy to be here we're super happy to have you too yeah yeah we're we're really excited that you i chose to kind of participate and uh and i hope you can continue finishing uh the whole project and everything you wanted to do and of course if you ever need any help any of us are available on discord whether that's technical or any other sort of help so continue building and uh thank you so much for presenting thank you fabio yes thank you awesome so um next up we are ready for our third demo and our fourth demo and that is uh project new phi so i know the team's here so whenever you're ready team uh feel free to start with your video and i see some familiar faces so it's great to see everybody here as well share my screen hello i'm john calabrese from nufi in the past few months the d5 space has introduced several innovations including faults farming and pooling a lot to keep up with although this continues to add interest to the space it divides still exists between the typical investor and the pros as an investor you need to do your research this involves watching tutorials by people like defy dad reading articles about a new project scratching your head a few times the list goes on all these steps are absolutely essential should you venture into these new projects on your own but newfy believes that there is a way to outsource some of the due diligence to the experts that can dedicate themselves to the vetting process saving you valuable time energy and money growing your net worth has never been this easy let's explain the inner workings of the project and take a look at what's under the hood there are two sides to new fi an investor experience and a manager experience let's start with the manager who is tasked with creating d5 and crypto pools that investors will be able to access on their side when creating a pool we simplify the universe of digital assets into two categories stable and volatile which makes the new fi system super easy to use for investors of all levels here the manager expertise comes into play when they select a strategy unlike other manager-led platforms strategy types are not just token purchases we include vault strategies that earn yield on the underlying positions like yearn and m stable this is a huge advantage of the new fi system where we're able to grow the pool's asset base without relying on price speculation or appreciation another pool has been created let's flip over the investor side investors start by finding a trusted manager who they think will outperform their peers over time or who they have a personal connection with you can sort and filter managers based on the pool size amount invested by the manager and of course performance once ready to invest they can allocate usdc to a stable pool or eth into a volatile pool they confirm the transaction in the web3 wallet and they're in that's all it takes newfy generates tokens in relation to the amounts that the investor owns using a pre-existing formula used in the urine vaults that token can be spent or used wherever has value unit swap staking wherever behind the scenes we are sending the pool funds to the platform that the manager decides to use as the investment pool grows or shrinks with underlying investment returns token will either appreciate or decline in value the manager is responsible for updating that strategy as new and potentially higher yielding opportunities become available last additional investors do not affect the price of the token so users don't get diluted with more pool interest when an investor wants to exit their relationship with their manager they simply return their tokens and get a portion of the pool assets back minus any transaction costs we've had a great time building new fi during this ethon line hack we are a truly global team and bring diverse skills that contributed to the achievements you see here but we have a lot of work to do we are preparing the platform for further investment strategies but also want to open up the platform to governance mechanisms which will control the addition and details of any new strategies employed more details will be explained further in the coming months we hope you think new fi is cool and helpful to the ecosystem should you have any questions about the platform we encourage you to check us out on social and discord we can't be successful without a community thank you so much amazing it was a really well communicated demo so i'll let our judges uh jump into questions and feedback yeah totally thank you for that i was like wow this is like a very succinct pitch curious if you guys um have have had anybody like have you have you tested it out has anybody been using it like who's managing what have the results been um is it like in the wild right now uh at the moment it's not necessarily in the wild um we still want to test the contracts more like wrapping unit tests and and make sure that all of the calculations are correct i i think like when we were running local tests on the tokens were not calculating correctly things like that so it's not in the wild yet but we did we did have it on a local fork so well do you have plans for like who would be the ideal managers you guys would go after like first users yeah it's a good question i mean i think we actually saw that presentation by supervis about like eth2 and how they have a token related to like watching that tutorial it could be really good for people we saw in that manager view like if we could show tokens or um you know any proof of attendance tokens that that you might be like okay you're you actually know what you're doing like that's you know credentials or something like that but really anyone could could spin these up and really we want to make sure that there's a track record that they establish over time cool things yeah cool and i i think on my side i think this is a really um timely project uh uh given all of the uh uh harvest the harvest issues but in general like all of these um opportunities that have popped up i'm curious how the the strategies are actually executed in the background are you envisioning this to be routed to something like a harvest or a urine or are you um or is the idea to actually uh implement the uh the strategies that they're doing like farming curve or or other assets under the hood yeah so at the moment um hal works under the hood we basically have essentially a white list of what they can invest into so there wouldn't be something risky on there obviously that's centralized because we're controlling that and that's why we're talking about opening up to a governance like uh token so that people can just decide what strategies are uh good and then we can add to the protocol and then everyone's happy that's kind of the idea anyways are the strategies like um uh a particular pool in urine or are you um looking at that strategy and saying let's have the same flavor but under new phi uh no yeah so it's directly into to urine itself uh we don't create that so um all we do is we have two distinct pools where it's just a bunch of the investor assets and then the advisor can put it into uran's pool directly or in stable that's what we have at the moment um those are the two we have at the moment but hopefully we can expand that cool thanks thanks uh great great project guys a quick question uh did you think through what it would look like to actually have a marketplace of different investors and how users would uh would be able to choose between them sorry marketplace of investors yeah yeah like users to pick from different investors and uh and you know like make a decision on who they should trust with their money yeah that's you know we have discussed um ideas around that it's actually quite cool because i think in a previous round people are asking like well how do you trust these advisors and stuff um and what we would like to do is open it up to as much transparency as possible so someone could say they're the best advisor but then they have this huge track worker that's terrible right um and yeah that's the idea like having this this open source platform where everyone can can take a look at advisors compare them contrast them we're thinking of ways to improve tooling around that so you can actually compare or you know do what you want um hopefully chat to advisors you know yeah this gives me i know we have like no no time left but this gives me kind of like melonport vibes and i don't know if you guys are super familiar but um it would be interesting to think if there's some sort of like collaboration or uh way to leverage uh insights with one another but i know time's up so thank you for the presentation it's awesome yeah thanks for having us thanks team um and uh with that we are ready to be to go into the demo for our next team and that is a block set so tony i believe you have been promoted to whenever you're ready feel free to kick up with your demo and i think as a note for our judges we are skipping the one before this because of some technical difficulties so please make sure that you're looking at block stat or block set sony go ahead thank you okay can you see my screen okay okay yeah the audio might be a bit quiet but i think it picks up later on space the next frontier as humanity strives to make itself an interplanetary species by 2024. blockchain technology is poised to help us remain connected welcome to blocksend your blockchain means space tech powered by teller [Music] ethereum and nasa our blockchain honorable is a step in bringing together interstellar travel and blockchain so this is our demo site um you simply click try our service and this will take you to our event-based asset pricing service you need to make sure that your metamask is connected or your website and your address is available you can choose a test event and you choose one of the features available our service is backed by our smart contract which is deployed on the rigby network so we need to make sure that your wallet is working off the network and then you simply click find price once you've done that so you can confirm that's parameter request and that'll go away and talk to the contract to determine the most appropriate uh response to your request [Music] however it has been included in the block so it's happening and that concludes our demo of our service and i think there we go our transaction it's just come through thank you any questions so sony i feel like uh just so that we uh we don't do you any injustice it might be just be helpful if you're able to also verbally explain sort of what you wanted to do and kind of uh how it works uh and just kind of things on that so we can also make sure that any video and navy travels we got are off-sided yeah sure um so uh basically the service that we built at least that i've built um what it does is that it brings together uh nasa event data so things like uh wildfires natural events typhoons storms and it basically uses the taylor smart contracts to determine what asset prices were on that particular day what that allows is that is for small contract developers to then be able to hook into real world events so for example if you've got an insurance contract which is uh pricing based on for example the habanero of uh wildfires um or typhoons happening you know in in forest asia our system what it does is that it will determine the event the time that it happened and then it will go to uh teller and find out what the most accurate price for a particular asset is and then based off that your contract can then carry on execution with the actual correct price but with an awareness of you know this actually happened we've also included some notification code so that allows you to actually create event-based triggers so as we update our oracle with the latest information about what's going on in the world you can then hook your smart contract into that and then your smart contract will be able to kick off an execution um based on a particular category of events that you were actually listening to the idea is that because the space industry is currently targeted to be like 10 of the global economy by 2060. um what we wanted to do is begin that integration of um space data because our system will also also includes things like you know solar flares which would affect things like if you've got a constellation deployed right and you've got insurance contracts based on off that or you've got maintenance contracts based off that or you know production schedules today you'd find it very difficult to create an automation which basically independently understands the real world and you know that oh yeah there's been a slow display it's taken out 10 of our satellites without service you'd be able to get that understanding and then you know trigger that that automation that autonomous behavior you know using the blockchain uh which basically allows you to do uh even more sophisticated things in terms of a business and commercial sense based off the back of it that was a wonderful context so i'll let our judges kick in with questions and comments yeah thank you kartik for asking for the explanation because i feel like it was so much more succinct when you said it it was i think a little difficult to hear with the video but um badass also shout out to that near sweatshirt um i know it's last minute you're living in the future in like a couple ways here right in terms of like you're talking about solar flares taking out satellites and like how oracle data is going to feed like what do you envision is the use case right now or do you see this as kind of like building the foundation for something more in the future i'm just curious like the current practical application the most the most uh immediate use case it would be the california wildfires which you had i think a couple of months back um so in that case uh an example would be that you know you've got fire you've got fire departments right which need funding in order to be able to deal with events like that and it's not just any sort of funding it's a special type of funding which needs to go through a whole raft of approvals because it's usually quite significant so that takes quite a lot of time which means that you know in terms of the processes and you know the money getting there and then the things you have to buy off the back of that getting there it's very inefficient right so with a blockchain based system using our service and that sensitization to oh we've actually got a wildfire happening in these particular coordinates you're then able to create a smart contract which basically allows you to then coordinate your entire supply chain so as soon as that event has come out it triggers a whole series of smart contracts which alerts you know federal finance which also alerts you know the supply chain to you know the scale of the fire and you know what's going on with it and then you it basically everybody gets to kick in you know at moment zero as opposed to what happens today is that you know the things that your fire department needs that the community actually needs you know it's going to take like three or four days before it actually gets there because so many people have to be in the decision making process what this does is that it takes that information and then it turns it into highly actionable automated information whereby you can build very efficient um services that actually you know deliver help to people as and when they need it amazing um i know we have a minute left so i won't take up more time i'll let sid and dimitri if they have questions too oh just one question on my side i'm curious why did you decide to use teller versus other oracle solutions um the reason i decided to use teller versus other oracle solutions is but because their interface is pretty straightforward and it's it's pretty simple um and in terms of this one of the key things about it is that we didn't i didn't want to waste time trying to figure out you know the various different aspects of the actual interface what i wanted was something that'll give me a succinct this was the time this was the asset this was the amount of money that you know that asset was priced at right because what that then allows me to do is basically take the data i'm getting from nasa and eventually you know other space agencies integrate that and then allow for you know very sophisticated notifications and you know information that would enable people to build even more sophisticated things off the back of that got it cool just a follow-up question real quick uh you you know you said that you add price data for assets uh i understand the value of taking like real-world events that happen somewhere in space and feeding that to the blockchain so you have a record of that event happening why do you also record price data well we don't record the price data what we do is we ask teller for that price data because what teller does is that they've got a bidding mechanism for price data so they they come up with i think it's the best medium price for a particular asset so xrp us et cetera so the thing is that if you are um working in a particular context like crisis response i just explained what happens is that you know you need to have that price information to be able to deploy services once you you have that awareness of the event so basically what it does is that it gives you the awareness of the event and it gives you the price of you know a particular asset that you may be transacting in so commercially what that allows you to do is set up an independent smart contract working in that particular asset and then it does all the necessary calculations and adjustments that it needs to do at that time right so yeah basically your commercials are now in line with what's going on in the real world in a way that you never could before and in a way that you can't really do um with together with today's current web 2 technology got it thank you really cool problem space space age i love it yeah oh thanks again tony uh and uh yeah i hope to see this thing in practice uh very soon um so with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and uh just thank you tony thank you for our judges uh block sat is the one after the next one on your list so we are skipping personal tokens as a project so with that we are ready to move on to our next team and that is project thera so i think they have been promoted and whenever you're ready feel free to start the video me okay hey what's up global uh can you guys hear me i guess we can perfect okay so let's start the demo um hope you guys have fun tara it's an answer to the rainforest crisis okay so blockchain is infinite meaning an asset is forever unstoppable and unique like the amazoness rainforest each terra is a rainforest type tree among 150 plus types so terra is one of these trees and it's a token created on ethereum blockchain so uh it hasn't been deployed yet to mainnet it's been tested on all nets so i'm pretty happy with that idea but before launching something so incredible we must make it right so how does it work how what's the first phase on launching dara right so by launching dara we help a liquid market to happen so objects culture music are tradition accessories clothing everything that's non-perishable products in the amazon correct so uh users can log in and enter a digital eight bit like forest and they can then have the ability to purchase products in a decentralized market way so this is the first phase that uh i was actually thinking um when i answered eve global and i got the opportunity to meet uh leandro from sao paulo and uh i talked i told him about some ideas and he was he was a gamer and he kind of believes that uh you know we can gamify it and we kind of like just started talking about it and and we just thought okay why not so if users can create and you know we can use web dots on flutter or if we i don't know if we go really hardcore maybe work with unity and use unity so users can create this avatar and digitally play you know enforcing ambiance and they can visit a solar pump like city where they can then socialize with you know like uh 8-bit avatars and players so terror would like actually create a balance of real trees planted okay but they will also serve and gain so some ideas like you know people collecting different avatar like trees and users can visit this market and in a decentralized way we could promote uh the sellings of amazonian products and this will actually help the economy here and um this will kind of look like you know the website if the person doesn't want to actually see it like in game it just wants to buy a bracelet or buy something you can see it in a most serious way but uh the idea is to uh promote this uh in a web-free fashion but also in a in a world-class fashion so people around the world can actually forest okay so what can be added if we win ethereum global uh creation of the team and social responses to help platform and make those past moves all have fun you know so we understand that gaming is not easy we will need to create servers around europe america and actually promote this to everybody so everybody can have fun socializing with their avatars while reinforcing the amazon uh creation of a headquarters full game and that development not in the amazonas so what i have learned is that in the amazon we don't have a lot of developers ready for this kind of creation this kind of uniqueness you know like special thing so uh the last thing would be marketing campaign to facilitate the idealization of a united earth helping and that's it that's my four minutes so uh yeah i'm here in the middle of the amazonas and i've been hacking ethereum for two years so after all this time i'm really happy to participate for the first time if global and actually divide with you guys this possibility and i leave it for questions and you guys can ask me anything you guys want about how it's made how what's the token i'm using what are the interfaces and what i'm gonna use to actually bring up the balance and send tariffs among avatars and users yep like yeah okay oh thanks um yeah i think that uh a lot of those questions were something i i had in mind i think in general i like the concept of trying to overlay um [Music] a way to map the uh the real world and uh and the physical world too um it's uh its counterparts unchained um who keeps the registry of tree ownership and transfer in the real world okay so that question i actually when i when it hit me you know like why like if i have the tree and i can enter into the game i can get the same tera and send it to another user and the user can also enter the game well when i thought about that maybe the possibilities of actually you know users sending in the credentials entering the game uh i didn't think it was a bad idea it was actually kind of like netflix you know so i'm here gaming you know like okay i'm tired of dara i have 10 arrows i'm gonna give my best friend a tree so he can play with me and all that idea and about the storage you know like in game of actually uh registering the tree in the beginning i thought i could do nft but when i reforest the amazon because i actually worked this year in the amazon uh it's very hard to keep up you know like sometimes we don't have the 2000 seeds of acai already a dozen seeds of buduchi so i just thought it would be a lot easier for just make it erc20 the user knows he's actually helping because it's a very complicated system you have to in route the tree and all of that so for storage in-game i really wanted to make it like the user enters with his metamask and actually not even mathematics you can use any of the other wallets that fuse gives us because users connected with flutter so i think leondra sent me the link that he's been using yeah so if you use i i o wallet call uh it gives us the the ability to actually use this weaponry dot to bring in uh balance and and off chain transactions so with with these simple things we we can make the game dynamically you know so if users if user has a tree he has a term okay he's playing he doesn't need a terror to play actually the idea is that people can just log in play and then at one point just like any other game they're just like okay now i want to skim now i want to pump up my avatar and that's when we get it you know that's when we can actually bring in the play a little bit closer to dara and he actually before the tree so it's open source it's we're not going to be storing uh in in in uh sorry i got lost in the woods i'm brazilian sorry okay so actually when he enters with his metamask his game is logged in so he has all his trees and every time he sends a terror back into the system that comes in is the game totally decentralized now that can't be happening because it's going to be very cost costly and it's going to be expensive to the players now so we just want to make it open world community-like the player can have a tree this will since it's bringing up from the balance he will have certain benefits he can then send the tree to a wallet and that's going to be corresponding with the games with the user's wallet and that will bring him other benefits maybe a special hats or a special thing in his avatar uh and the game is divided into three places so basically you have the user interface where you can be planting trees and doing little quests and then there's a solar punk city area where you can be seeing people from around the world that part of this community and it's a decentralized community so everybody can talk about their opinions they can promote uh reforestation worldwide they can promote good good things in there and we're working on a third third thing third interface where it's actually a game so you know there's there's the user interface where he's harvest mooning he's you know planting trees taking care of the little animals and then he goes to the community and it's decentralized so he can talk up socially and then he can actually play online on an mmorpg where everybody can just you know everybody's playing on the same level it doesn't matter if you have a hats or not you're just playing an rpg with your pl with your friends kind of like law you know when you install league of legends you're level one so we were thinking of grasping this idea you know so there's no difference between a player that's playing for 10 years and a player that just came in he can enjoy it have fun and have a chance to win against somebody on the real game you know so basically it would be these three parts okay cool yeah uh that was a lot um but yeah i think we uh we probably have some more questions here but i think we're at time but that was oh no yeah i have plenty of questions but i i'm appreciative i just wanted to say thank you i love when people um are thinking of like creative ways to increase like biodiversity and um so thank you thank you so much for that thank you guys oh yeah yes very heartwarming project thank you thank you guys and if you guys have any questions please send it in chat and answer okay cool thank you okay thanks a lot bye-bye hi coming from the amazon amazing that's so great i think you want to see a picture from the rainforest give me one second okay one more so while corbin is ready we'll see amazing yeah this is the amazons very big very huge trees we gotta save it that's why i tell everybody everything take care guys thanks a lot [Music] thanks for demoing and with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and that is protect protocol uh with corbin so corbin whenever you're ready feel free to kick off with your screen chair hey guys hope everything's going well um can you guys hear me yes we can alright let's get started hi everyone i'm corbin and this is my submission to the ethglobal hackathon i built protect protocol which is a new insurance protocol for the d5 space that's completely open and composable so just as uniswap allows anyone to create a spot market for any token protect protocol allows anyone to create a liability market on top of any smart contract that's holding value i talked to a lot of trading shops about getting into d5 a lot are deploying capital but they're still hesitant to commit even more capital because of the underlying risk of an exploit or centralization risk to an underlying d5 protocol so i built protect protocol to solve that just as the traditional world has the fdic which ensures all bank deposits protect protocol is a peer-to-peer solution that allows you to ensure any deposits against any d5 protocol or smart contract it differs from pretty much everything else that's out there in the market today because it's completely open composable to all also fees are extracted from protocol rewards for the deposited capital so there's no buying cover there's no buying cover cover for a year or for a six-month period basically if you deposit capital into the insurance side of the protocol you are covered block by block which is kind of how dpi should operate on the flip side there are stakers or shield miners that can deposit any capital could be eth could be die could be usdc and they start accruing rewards for that deposited capital uh and then their their deposits are actually on the hook if something were to happen to the underlying protocol so let's quickly look at how this works i have the smart contracts repo here so please feel free to check that out it's a two-sided market where folks are buying coverage from this p token contract stakers are staking into the shield contract and earning those rewards that state capital can also be reinvested into another uh third-party d5 protocol via some of the same functionality that's in the yearn uh dot finance contracts and then the fee contract and then sorry the fee model and then the claims process are completely contr are completely uh configurable on here so i built these smart contracts as part of the hackathon and then i also built a front-end forking urine once again that's hosted at protectprotocol.com and you can see a couple examples for compound for uniswap lp pools and then for ave for how this can work we even have the ability to if you want to get protected you can request that right here on the upper right corner so i encourage everybody to check out the web application it's only functioning locally so you can't actually contribute capital but you can get a gist of how the protocol works and i invite any feedback in your thoughts thanks so much take care thanks corbin that was a really creative solution so i'll let our i just jump in okay i could start um again extremely timely um so so of course uh we need more solutions um like this uh can you explain um how you envision the claims process to uh to happen is there some kind of oracle solution that tells you when there's um uh that that that there was a hack or or a rug pull or how how how is that kind of um how does that process look like on on the protocol side yeah that's a great question so the first point about the claims process is that it's completely configurable so i think you're seeing this trend more and more within d5 year in dot finance is a great example of you have this interface for what an investment strategy can represent but then the underlying logic of that strategy can differ you know based on your different approach the claims manager is that exact same idea so i define an interface for what the claims like manager needs to do you know it needs to be able to submit a claim it needs to investigate a claim for a certain period of time and then it needs to initiate a payout the actual way that that occurs um can vary based on implementation right so the way it's done on most protocols today is it's a dow vote you know you you submit a claim the dow investigates then there's potentially a payout um but with this interface you could also have that controlled by a centralized party you could of course have a dow or it could be completely smart contract governed right you could actually make a query to compound and say are my you know outstanding obligations higher than the collateral amount that i have in the protocol is that sustained for a longer period of time if so initiate the payout so i want to allow for that type of like customizable uh nature to it yeah that makes sense that that flexibility is really nice because i think it opens up more kind of implementations of what this could look like it's awesome oh that was some feedback um i'll i'll defer to sit if he if he has questions because i know he's probably a little bit more into um can i defy uh i'm i'm i have less i think uh uh deep expertise in this area uh sure love thank thanks ashley i love the idea you should ship it uh-huh how can you can you summarize what you think are the key uh improvements over say open and nexus neutral yeah so um taking nexus mutual into account um first of all i love what they've done big fan of the project fan of the folks um i do think that like having something that's more open rather than having something where you actually have to purchase the product the token to participate is one big advantage also being able to stake any type of asset to actually like be able to contribute from the shield mining side and then rather than again purchasing cover um like it's like trading in and out of a position just being able to wrap something like seed and you're automatically protected maybe two more minutes to join and then we'll get started thanks uh not sure who that was but um it's the aliens um so i would say those are the main differences and then um again something like open like so this isn't hedging price risk or it's not it's not concerned with price at all it's just protecting against smart contract hacks um using admin keys uh in a nefarious way or if admin keys got stolen um and then also oracle centralization as well so one more question do you see potential given how open and permission this is this is is there potential to use this as like a a shorting attack on projects or taking any kind of uh kind of aggressive negative exposure on projects yeah so that's the concept that comes up a lot and there's also kind of the idea of like it being used as a prediction market right so like if i knew there was an exploit that was found in something like like harvest.finance for example very timely uh maybe i would take out like the opposite position here because i knew that that was going to be exploited eventually go ahead and get started can everyone see my screen okay awesome um [Music] sorry yeah it's hard to cut you off corbin but uh thanks for it for this and i hope you keep working thank you corbin thanks corbin space um so next up we have osmosis as a team and uh jacob is here and now what i'll be doing is i'll be playing his video on my side and then jacob will be there to join for the q a piece and also just as a heads up we will be taking a quick break after this demo uh this is our halfway point so i will take a quick break and then we'll resume with the remaining half of our demos hi my name is jacob and i've been working on osmosis a defy yield multiplier i still missed a defy summer with food coins farming craziness or three due to tea outs were just a button click away but there are still opportunities in defy yet they require skills to manage token volatility slippage and impermanent loss and it's a full-time job to monitor the market no wonder most of the users prefer just to dump their coins on a landing pole and be happy with a small but hassle-free yield in fact over 80 percent of funds on ava are lying idle what if we could redirect those funds allowing investors to scale their strategies and share profits with passive depositors it could be done using credit delegation a new feature offered by ava i decided to take it one step further allowing depositors to delegate their unused collateral not to another person but to a credit pool that manages accounting risk and rewards funds may be borrowed by a smart contract brokerage account and invested only in trusted protocols in this case balancer and unstable owners need to provide a margin creating a buffer for price volatility and impermanent loss the account is priced in real time using chaining oracles and could be liquidated if the value drops below a safe level let's take a look at the application it is publicly available and all the contracts have been deployed to the kovan network now i act as a user who wants to generate more yield on his other deposits the interface is kept very simple as we targeted less sophisticated users i can see how many a tokens i have click on the delegate button and specify an amount to provide after the transaction and approval have in mind i can see my bonuses let's switch the roles and imagine that i am a professional investor i need to deploy a smart contract account with an initial margin the interface is more complex i can see my initial margin that matches total account value let's try to borrow some funds i can see the solvency index which is a ratio between the total account value and the borrowed amount has been updated when it is close to 100 percent the funds could be forcibly repaid to protect the i haven't invested yet so my portfolio is under the water let's put some money into a balancer pool now the situation is better it is important to notice that both yelled and the costs are normalized to the total portfolio value while the net is based on the initial margin i still got some dollars left so let me put them into a meta saving account now the net yield is higher but the solvency ratio is still high above 100 so there is still a room for improvements to get to a 3d detailed even during the autumn season awesome so that was a very interesting use of uh defy and a handful of other applications so i i know our judges are definitely going to have a lot of questions and clarifications on that so i'll let them kick off uh with uh with any comments hey guys thanks cathy once again it was a great event so i'm i'm waiting for the questions okay i can start uh hey jacob uh a really nice use of building blocks here um i i i think there's always a massive design space around uh integrating multiple protocols uh which balancer pools um specifically are you envisioning that the user uh invests in because it looked like um it didn't look like it was something specific so i'm curious like what like where the apy comes from yes so currently i started with a single balancer pool but obviously there is absolutely no limit i'm able to support at the moment any pools that i built on top of asset that are priced by chain link so it's about 30 pulls out of the box but definitely if there are more pricing correctors i'm open to accommodate for any balancer pull but i expect a in practice that the stable coins are going probably to be most popular because there is a little volatility and more productibility on your yield got it that makes sense and and it looks like you're also um uh integrating with uh unstable uh do you envision any other integrations that that you think you could uh include here yeah totally so so adding another platform is quite easy because i need only a pricing function a function to invest and redeem so it's quite easy few lines of code but then actually the best next candidate will be obviously the uni swap which is very stable and gives you a predictable yield maybe some new fancy tools like pico i don't know sushi it depends on the users it was also interesting i can architecture the solution so you can opt out from any platform that you do not fully trust so your money won't be connected to more risky solutions got it cool thank you uh jacob really cool project uh can you help me understand what is the upside and downside like what's the upside reward to investors and what's the potential downside risk uh the upside over what sorry the parliament i'm just trying to understand the uh oh maybe we even start with the downside risk what are the risks to people that deposit money here in this product okay so obviously the risk is that i'm integrating another protocol so if i have a token holder there is still manager batteries but if there is something wrong with balancer or m stable i need to accommodate for that so the more protocols obviously the more risk defined and the upside is the bonus yield payment that i'm getting out of for my other deposits and for investors this is a leverage tool so obviously i'm going to multiply the potentials from impermanent loss etc but i'm also going to multiply the potential profit and it's quite profitable activity right now with all of the mining rewards and trading fees so i'm just allowing these investors to scale got it thank you and is there the the people that borrow money uh did they have a limited set of areas that they can invest or can they put money into any protocol yeah so all of the protocols need to be vetted i start with two protocols but then in the future it could be like a governess mechanism to allow new players to integrate and it's thanks to that i can automate all of the pricing mechanism and therefore i can have liquidation and protects the user funds so yeah only trusted protocols that i can real time price and liquidate if they drop in value got it thank you very cool project thank you so much jacob for your project that was really cool for now uh we're going to be taking a quick 10 minute break uh so judges feel free to turn off your camera and turn them back on when you're ready um and we'll see you in 10 minutes thank you cool thank you thank you jacob thanks guys hi everyone we're going to be starting in about a minute or two so feel free to come back and turn on your camera for all the judges and the next participant has already been promoted to panelists hello judges if you're ready to go please turn your camera on and we will be starting as soon as you're ready we're ready to go sounds good thank you that's delicious uh you're now a panelist so feel free to start screen sharing okay hi guys okay let me start the presentation hi everyone thanks for taking some time to review the project i've been working on during the past couple of weeks so the goal of my project was to build a pull together pool using rv as a resource and also to build a custom interface to interact with the pool i've also planned to build a custom strategy to distribute the price to two run-on nominals sadly it works in local but not on robson so let's see how the interface works so here is the landing page of the interface part of this interface was built during the previous academe but i've decided to reuse it in order to focus more on solidity development so let's jump into the pool so here we have the app where we can see when the next price is and also what is the current price and we're gonna deposit some food into the pool so here we have a simple interface to purchase some iv pool tickets so i'm gonna purchase the maximum mood i can here i click on the buy button and then i need to approve the transaction in my wallet so let's do this okay so we've sent the transaction while it's in progress i'm gonna show you which works under the hood so the way it works is that we deposit some dye into the pool and then the pool is gonna meet us some tickets then what happened with our dye our dye is then deposited into a rv and the pool received have a token so a dive since we are using your diet to deposit into the pool so now my purchase has been successfully done so now i can show you how it works to withdraw from the pool so it's kind of the same interface the difference is there is a notion of withdrawal instantly so what happens here is that for example i'm gonna withdraw 1000 tickets and uh if i decide to uh withdraw by waiting i won't lose any credit so what are credits basically it's a way to avoid the people to like treat the system by like depositing directly into the pool and then uh withdrawing their phone so hear me i want to resume my phone instantly and in a way not participate into the effort of accumulating in yield so i'm going to click on withdraw instantly and so as we can see now as a like a forfeit i'm going to pay 10 die of interest so and only receive 90 are they pull tickets so i'm okay with that so let's withdraw this 100 available tickets so there we go we've sent the transaction so how it works under the hooks it works this way so here is a previous transaction so it's kind of like a what we did when we deposited so like basically it's gonna ascend the pool is gonna send us back some dye and we're gonna also burn the tickets that we've decided to withdraw and we're gonna let's get less dies than we had of tickets so that's about it for the interface i've built and that's not it i've also updated the builder tool of put together to let anyone deploy their own ava price pool thanks okay awesome thank you for that cool demo judges feel free to start asking your questions oh okay i could start i guess um yeah i think really uh uh a really good job building on top of um uh ave and using pull together i'm a big fan of of the project um i think you mentioned it but did you create that interface yourself or did you fork it um because i think it's a it's really nice it's it's very user friendly recently i know i've created it myself and well aggregated because i built for another cattle a kind of interface for put together but another it's me that created the interface and adapted it to the new version of the protocol since i released the last tweet the version of three and so yeah i built it myself yeah that's awesome um and uh can you explain what the how you calculate the penalty if you withdraw early because i assume that there's uh some kind of time duration for a given pool i don't know if they uh if the re rewards are distributed weekly or what but is it like pro rata to uh to the time uh uh before that uh the given lottery concludes uh yes so this is onload by the poltergeist protocol so i didn't really have to implement this but yeah the way uh the way it's gonna work is that you have this system of credits and it's going to depend here of if the pool if if a price has been awarded already the first time or not and so it will either like burn some of your credits that you have or if for example you deposit directly into the pool and then decide to withdraw instantly to like uh just participate for example just before the pool the prices are added it's gonna like take us some money out so not a credit but like the guy that you got deposited but this i didn't have to underline it because it's um handled by the protocol and that's uh what is nice with this new protocol is like if you want to implement something on you you can just do it on top of it so i don't have myself i don't have to think about this that's awesome okay cool thanks uh great project quick question uh you you mentioned here that it says uh it should allow people who invested less money in the protocol to have better chances of winning uh can you explain why that is to have better chances of winning yeah i'm just reading the description of your project ah yes all right sorry this actually well it was a random strategy that i wanted to implement and sadly it didn't work in the end but like the goal it was to have like a to a draw two random winners so uh this way you don't only have a one random winner so you have more chances to win and the way it would work it's like if uh the first address that is uh like picked is the same than the second one that is a draw we um we don't award the price a certain time to this person so it's kind of to avoid uh like some oils that would like a deposit a lot of money into the pool and then that would win almost every week so it was a strategy that i that i started to develop but sadly when i was going to deploy it on webster it wasn't working and i didn't have time to figure out how it would what was the problem so yeah suddenly i didn't have time to do this cool thank you um i know we're running out of time but i also wanted to echo dimitri's comment um crypto is like so unusable at times um so to see something that's like very functional um and and clear to use makes me feel really excited inside i'm looking forward to the day when we no longer even have to like kind of see metamask and interact with that as well um i'd be curious like from your take since it seems like you have a good focus on that like what are we missing in the space to make things more usable like from from your end in building on top of these protocols uh i think a quick question is kind of difficult to answer but uh i think uh yeah the ease of use uh if you look at uh pull together our website the main website the way that english is like it's very simple to deposit your phones into the pool like it's not uh as complicated like for example the d5 can be very complicated where when you start to learn about farming and all of this yeah it's like it's very simple you just deposit your phones and then you may win or not like there's not any nothing that is very complicated and so what we could really do to make it more simple is like really think about i think the ui it's like the most important part and really like explain to the user what they are gonna do and what's gonna be the outcome because uh usually in that most of the fire site like you arrive on the website and it's like you can deposit here but if you don't really know what's gonna happen next so i think that that would be a first step yeah cool well thank you awesome thank you pierre for your uh cool demo um and thank you for participating so up next we have pay immunity um pay immunity please start your video or sorry please start your screen share [Music] yes hi i'm rick from the pen unity team from hanover germany we're a team of four people here and our hack is based on the idea that we want to make blockchain technology and ethereum more accessible to more people and we want to position this the app so that people can copy it and use it in their own communities where people might not have knowledge of how blockchain technology works or ethereum so the app is actually an app that you can send your community members or people you want to join the community a code and with this code it allows them to enter the wallet and in this wallet people can start for example receiving uh money or sending in this case we use the diet token to make it even easier for people to understand what this is about but it could be exchanged with any type of token even tokens related to the community itself and the main [Music] idea behind this is that we enable meta transactions by using dichotomy so people don't have to worry about having it inside of their wallet and it really works like a regular wallet app so people scan it let's see the amount and where they're going to be sending the money and send it and the same works the other way around one of the things that we also implemented in the app is a link functionality so people can only scan the code but send a link to their family and friends through telegram or whatsapp or whatever other communication means they would like to use and by using ends domain we even make it easier for people to remember who they are sending the money to and this is our hack and we hope a lot of people copy it and start empowering their own communities around the world thank you very much thank you so much um judges you can start asking your questions i'm really here to see what sid what sid's feedback is given the the coinbase uh uh perspective i'm super curious thank you guys for that yeah great great project i love to see more usability i love that when if we get to a world where we don't have to tell people what gas is i think that's the ideal world for everyone uh would would love to hear a little bit more about how the guestlist transactions are implemented um yeah well a small disclaimer we didn't actually finish everything but we saw that my economy was participating in the h global and we decided to use that as kind of the framework and sdk to enable gasless transactions and we didn't make it to finish it and have a working prototype yet but we as a team will continue even after the hackathon to make it work because we have two actual projects that want to use it so we're kind of motivated by that what actual projects want to use it we are here in hanover germany and one of the projects is actually a community um of people that want to incentivize voluntary work and sustainability goals so it's kind of people that are not very familiar with blockchain technology but they need what we call like a single coin wallet that takes away all the complexity it's just a wallet with a value in it and the other project i come from venezuela where there's a lot of inflation a lot of problems right now and we want to use a die to enable people to have something similar to a bank account without having to worry about having ether or gas and that's why compatibility was a very important issue to have like a usability layer that people use something that is kind of open and completely for the people that use this kind of solution they're using something like a bank account but it can be received by anybody that has any other type of wallet and there's a lot of point of sales there so that's why it's also mobile first and we're focusing really on uh like a really easy to use qr codes can send experience what it's okay yeah no it's really amazing because the last project i was just saying like wouldn't it be so great if we didn't even have to like look at metamask and like deal with all these like kind of challenges and just using and transacting so what are the next steps for you guys then um in terms of like what what happens from here what what functionality gets built out yeah we plan to first get uh get it working with with bikonomy we had even talked with the team this morning and gave us some pointers and we'll be and keep on working on that uh for the minimal bible project uh product we are going to be using wild connect so that we can use the mobile version of the truss wallet or the rainbow wallet or whatever wallet people have just to get it really going and out there and have at least like 50 to 100 people testing it we already have at least four the project in venezuela a list of people that have already signed up and are eager to test it and even use it like in supermarkets which got announced last week a big chain supermarket is accepting dye so that would be a really nice use case that we plan to fulfill um until the end of the year cool cool and i also like how how you're using um you know it's a mobile project i think we need more of those uh in this space so so really like that uh that choice uh quick question i just wanted to look back on the meta transactions i haven't looked into a dichotomy but are they running a relayer and is that how it's implemented or are you do you need to run your own relayer they are running a relayer so the idea was actually to [Music] take care of the actual functionality and all the complexity with the layer and stuff to give it to somebody else to take care of yeah totally okay great cool thank you so much pay immunity that was a really cool project um and thank you for participating in the event so um up next we have secret pay um so feel free to start your video uh as soon as you're ready hi guys put my screen up and i'll start timing okay um shall i should i try to fix it or continue sorry is there an issue um yeah it's still a little bit quiet do you think you could try your screen share one more time okay if not we could do it for you and the green room it was perfect um let's see um just in case let me put up all the volumes on my volume mixer here i'll try on uh my end here okay thank you should i stop sharing yeah okay yes sorry about that no worries hi guys and welcome to a video demo of secret pay so with secret bay is it's a decentralized escrow service and trustless service which uses chaining oracles to verify the payment or non-payment of paypal or revolut link invoice links this means that a seller can deposit ethereum into a secret pay contract also using textile dot io or textile mailboxes invoices are sent privately to the nodes and the buyer and when the buyer pays this invoice chaining or 50 plus consensus is required by the set of chaining oracles to trigger a withdrawal of that ethereum by the buyer on the secret pay escrow agreement let's go through the steps so first of all you've got through tabs you've got sell and buy it it tells you to create an invoice gives you some information and you've got this um text prompts here you got paypal or revolut let's click on paypal here you want to type in the paypal invoice id which you can get from the url in this case let's enter this invoice id the textile public key of the buyer and the e-address of the buyer to which we shall allow the eth to be deposited once the chain link oracle's confirmed that my the invoice has been paid so these public keys are generated using meta mask the text side public keys are generated deterministically um using meta mask so no private key storage needs to be done you can select one or two or how many ever you chaining nodes you want and submit contract this page comes up which is um it is signing the textile messages click sign and in the background it'll be sending the details of the trade to the people through textile and now a prompt will come up to send the actual transaction on chain which includes most of the data apart from whether apart from the payment details and fiat payment details and firstly we need to fuel the contract with one link because if the buyer comes in and says he's paid it the contract needs link to pay the the nodes for their services now we shall swap to the the buyer side of metamask and put in the contract select load contract as you can see here details um are brought in from the contract but the invoice and the payment method can only be read by logging in the textile and seeing our mailbox so this invoice id that i put in has already been paid so now as i do query oracles we can query oracles this sends the request to the chaining nodes so how the adapter works is it receives the address of the the secret pay contract address it queries what is ledgered on the blockchain it checks its mailbox for related messages and then it finds the invoice id queries whether it's paid or not and then replies um either a one or a zero we can go back to our page now and if we click load again it should come up funds released so now in actual fact it's not actually released yet we need to click withdraw eth so 0.3854 and here you see it point three eight six four we were the buy address this eight eight a six eight a6 and the trade is complete awesome thank you for the video uh judges feel free to start asking your questions i have a question uh really enjoyed this innovative project uh you know paypal and revolut have pretty strict uh compliance policies about like crypto trading and and things like that uh does this expose account holders to uh the risk of like paypal and revenue finding out and taking their accounts away so um generally for example paypal has an anti-crypto terms and service that they're like anti-crypto even though there's new news but the fact that invoice ids are sent um through textile only the buyer seller and chaining all operators have access that invoice id so sort of for that from paypal's per second perspective they will see um it's just a general transfer an invoice payment of from like one party to another and the invoice ids show nowhere on the blockchain and it's sent through textile mailboxes very cool and is there is there uh is there a way that this gets uh a vulnerability where someone starts a dispute with paypal or revolut about a given payment and says it wasn't made or something like that it's i guess it's possible i guess that is one way where there may be an issue in this if um the the buyer whoever is whoever got whoever paid um if opens a dispute and they want proof of transaction or something um i guess if people ask for information on the trade then you know there are question marks that are brought up but um i think this would be useful for example for there are some p2p um forums and subreddits where they're really open to counterpart like the other person just completely scamming them so using chain link to be like intermediate here and or not even one node you have to have as many nodes as you want and 50 plus need to um say that it's been paid i think it's useful those for those type of communities very cool thank you yeah this is awesome um i haven't looked into textile too much but can you explain the rationale for using that is uh does it build on um on top of ipfs and is that where this is sent through or or what's the uh what purpose does it serve yes so as far as i know it uses either i don't know like the mailbox i mostly just use the their apis but it uses um b2p and ipfs and what it is is it's used by secret pay as a sort of off-chain um sort of encrypted channel to transfer and these invoice ids between the parties involved because if the invoice id was measured on the blockchain and that's public it's subject to people's spy like you can just type in invoice id on your on your paper on your browser and it gives you the email and details of the paypal um creator of the invoice got it that makes sense and it's a cool use case of it um and i'm not sure if this is configurable but for the does it have to be fifty percent consensus on the chain link notes or is or or or can you make that can you adjust that to be 80 or yes definitely i mean it's it's just like an if statement if there's like true count and false count paid or not paid there's a counter and you can just see like you know if 80 percent is is um true or paid then it's it's it's released got it cool thank you yeah thanks for this um what what's next from here um like what missing features or like team members do you need in order um to contribute to kind of like your full vision that's what you're doing so yeah yeah the the issue with this was time constraints especially but there are some some holes for example in verifying that the contract the secret pay agreement is a non-malicious con and contract the oracles are actually the ones which which are trusted i mean because even though chain link is trustless you need to trust like the set of chaining oracles right um so there's like some front-end checks for example that like are these oracles the correct oracles um is the invoice id the rece the same that every everybody's receiving the same invoice id there are some documentation and actually getting maybe more payment providers there are two payment providers right now but there's like i i need to do some research on um more providers for example and got maybe some even governance if they're like like if there's a deadlock there may be a deadlock sometimes if um oracle's um half of the oracles say yes half of the oracles say no nice need to confirm whether there are any like holes in the system like that okay well thank you so much francesco for your secret pay project um up next we have token log um wesley feel free to start video share video sharing whenever you're ready hi good evening everyone hey hello let me share my screen hi my name is wesley and this is my submission for ethonline 2020 tokenlock is a new governance tool to create token weighted backlogs it allows projects to continuously gather feedback from their token holders in order to plan and prioritize their work and allows token holders to continuously signal which items matter to them rather than just vote on single proposals i believe it's a better way for projects to collaborate with their biggest supporters how does this how this works is that token log works on any github repository that leaves your current workflow in place all data is pulled and remains on github you can configure your token log directly from your own repository and it's available on that same github path voting is done either by a one token one vote mechanism or as per default through quadratic voting voting is done through signed messages and all handled without paying any gas so let's get to a demo we're at the home page of token logs and i've prepared a few repositories for the purposes of this demo so let's start with the first one compound which obviously uses its own comp token what's interesting here is that it doesn't just check your personal account balance but also checks if you have any delegated phoning power as you can see here i only have a half comp token so my voting power is close to zero let's go back to the overview all of these repositories are using their own tokens so we have gno tbtc and urine pocket core for example is using the folding token from their aircon dial and is actually hosted on increase for the purpose of this demo i'm going to my own token lock which i created during the development of this project here you can see there's two items on it already the first one implement quadratic folding let's say i want to fold on this one and my project is configured to work with die of which i have currently 11 tokens available so if you go to the voting screen you can see that the cost of my fault is going up exponentially so this is an important item to me and i want to fold all that i've left on this item right metamask pops up to sign the message i vote for it and as you can see here three folds are counted with it it's currently at four this concludes the demo so let's quickly go back to have a look at the next steps i'm looking to finalize my mvp do some performance improvements some tweaks and minor bug fixing after that i plan to onboard projects and work with product and community management managers to actually use the product after that looking to further integrate github and allow maintainers to easily configure their repositories lastly i'm looking into exploring new voting and signing mechanisms that allow for actual economic weight to put up bounties or allow to stake or other new incentives to to prioritize and finish the work on the backlog that's it for now if you want to try it out your website is online my own token log is online or you can contribute directly to my repository on github thanks bye thank you wesley for that awesome demo uh judges feel free to start asking your questions cool yeah thanks wesley i think um you know this is an important uh problem to be working on really good timing to start thinking through governance i'm curious how you're thinking about addressing uh sybil attacks with uh with quadratic voting are there any identities attached to uh to this or is this a pure uh token weighted tcr yeah right now there are no identities coupled against it i have been looking into snapshot labs and also aragon who's using snapshots um to look at the account balances of course i haven't implemented something like that but that that could be a solution and and the second one is using actual on-chain activity i guess where you can lock the lucky tokens for a certain amount of time and that's definitely something that was uh looking into anyway um where you have continuous um for for project test lease where you have continuous sprint cycles for example you could say we take a same two week period for example to let the community vote for items as well after that you release the tokens again to go into the next round got it that makes sense um and uh i think you mentioned this but are there any on-chain transactions uh required to vote or is this done via signatures kind of like how snapshot does it everything is off-chain now indeed signatures yeah okay correct thanks you mentioned your next steps working with product managers and community managers so i'm kind of curious like do you have any particular uh people or projects in mind i'm also kind of curious about how you um distinguish between product manager and community manager i'm trying to wrap my head around like how specifically you would target community managers um yeah um i i worked a little bit with some of the projects already uh compound uh posted one of or a similar id in their blog post before this hackathon that they were looking for new ways for decentralized governance and tooling around that to have token holders help and prioritize their roadmaps so i think working with them would be the first one genosis for example is using a centralized service right now for sort of a public backlog right now and i posted this during or wow hacking on twitter already and i got some feedback from metamask and from git coin and a few other people that were interested to uh to try this out so i guess those those projects would be first to uh to reach out to and see how that how it can help with them cool okay great i don't have any questions but i really enjoyed the project i think you know making governance more user-friendly and aggregating people's governance opportunities across projects uh that would be a big win to to increase i think individual participation more than just whales so really cool project yeah i can say that like from the near uh protocol perspective too um we've been thinking a lot about this and had our first like governance meeting after we voted into like phase two of mainnet so it would be good to connect you with the team on that as well and also you went for like the most matrix setup presentation too by the way the whole like your whole aesthetic right now is very matrixy so i just wanted to set that up so anyway um thank you for that presentation cool thank you very much thank you wesley for your time that was awesome um next up we have l2 money so l2 money when you're ready please start your screen share all right cool hi everybody uh i know actually already from a hanami picnic in tokyo but uh to the other two of you hi and uh yeah i'm getting ready to present my screen now our project is a total um train wreck my uh teammates won't even show their faces uh but i'm here presenting so yeah you'll see like a team yeah exactly yeah we just didn't have enough time to execute but uh here's our video anyway let's see what you mean you can't build something completely like ready in a month we can't even build something like one percent ready but all right here it is hi my name is ben defrancesco i'm here with my teammates matt solomon and ed misurik on l2 money obviously by the screen that you're looking at we did not have the bandwidth that we thought we would have to finish l2 money sadly but we do still think this is a compelling idea and something that the community needs and we're hoping to be able to execute it sometime in the coming weeks so we still wanted to submit and give you a sense of what we had been thinking about and i'll turn it over to matt to walk through what those features would have been so here you have the home page and you see we have two tabs here one to show global stats on uh l2 usage and the second tab here to show things specific to your ethereum account so on the home page up top we would have some plots that show the total value locked in all l2s on ethereum and then in the bottom portion here we would have individual statistics about the different l2s the next thing you could do is flip over to this meet tab connect your wallet and i'm on the wrong network but that's okay and see a list of your balances so in this case it would be taking all of the tokens on zk sync and showing the total usd balance of all of those and then the next functionality would be to let you click on one of these cards see a breakdown by token and either deposit or withdraw from that particular l2 so that is pretty much it like ben said unfortunately we didn't have the bandwidth to finish but hopefully we will soon cool so yeah just includes in closing um i think l2 on ethereum is a really exciting space right now it really feels like we're at an inflection point where ethereum at the base layer has proven that there are a whole bunch of really interesting use cases and there's a ton of demand for those use cases in fact there's more demand than the base layer network can really keep up with eth 2.0 is still a little bit down the road especially the the phases that enable the kind of functionality that would be required to replace what l1 is doing and i think that um l2 is going to step in here and really fill the gap there's a lot of research that's been going on and it's coming together just at the time when it's most needed so we're excited to see that progress continue there are a ton of great teams building a lot of interesting solutions and we think that this tool will help do a few different things it will help demonstrate the growth of l2 and make it easier for users to uh track and execute their um you know their workflows across these different l2s so we're excited for the the coming future of layer two technology on ethereum we think it's gonna be a big deal in the next six to eighteen months and we're hoping that eventually l2 money will help in the ethereum community recognizing that growth and making it easier to use alrighty confusing i've never seen such a beautiful presentation oh my god um i just want to give you guys props for coming through still and and talking about like your vision and uh you know what you're what you're trying to work on um so you know that's that's what we're all here for not necessarily to have like a finished amazing project so kudos to you guys but what what made it so difficult like what if you could wave a magic wand in order to have made this happen like what maybe three things would you have had like access to or like what tech would be available to you in order to execute on the vision sure uh really it was just a matter of time we're all working full time together all three of us and just with projects we just didn't have time so we have a pretty straightforward vision though and so we're really looking forward to getting it out at some point but yeah just not not this much okay so not technical limitations just really from a time perspective that's right okay i wanna double click on that um just to take that thought experiment assuming you had time i mean what um what do you think implementation wise would be the the most critical thing to kind of um be mindful of uh i guess it would just make sure that we're doing the price conversions accurately that we're correctly like storing a database um how much value is locked up in these different l2 contracts uh but yeah i mean as i said we already had a pretty good grasp around how we were going to approach it it was really just the time thing yeah uh you should you guys should definitely ship this it'd be cool to as we i think everyone in the ecosystem wants to understand which l2s are growing uh and how much and what the distribution of assets is uh for the user tools did you give thoughts to uh if you're trying to transfer between l2s uh or from l2 to l1 and the complications around different different roll-ups and different l2 solutions having different settlement times for withdrawals and things like that or did you not get that far into the weeds uh we didn't get that far into the weeds but that's an awesome point and i'm gonna make sure to bring that back to my teammates and make sure because we're definitely planning on having some kind of withdrawal and deposit flow uh on the on the per l2 balance page uh so yeah we should make sure to keep that stuff in mind sweet thank you thank you have you looked at space fold and what you're doing there no have not let me check it out yeah i don't know if that could potentially inform a design choice here because i think they were trying to also do kind of cross l2 awesome we're looking forward to uh to seeing the next steps yeah sure i'll make sure to yeah i'll keep you all posted and thanks so much for the feedback and recommendations yeah you guys have any any other questions one minute left uh maybe one more in that um like what l2s were you thinking about were there any ones that were on the top of your road map integration wise versus uh further out for any particular reason uh yeah i guess the the ones we were doing first were some l2s that we've already worked with like zk sync and loop ring but uh we were really looking forward to after that integrating stuff with the um optimistic roll-ups and stuff like that uh so yeah that was kind of our road map and yeah we're still looking forward to implementing cool yeah nice to see you ed you too ashley all right well hey cheers everybody and thanks again so much for your time yeah thank you all right cheers bye bye hi thank you um and uh so kartik will be coming back on i was just taking over for him for the last couple projects or so um but yeah karthik hello hey everybody i'm i'm back and i want to thank anna for kind of taking over and running everything smoothly i came back a little while because i just i just stood still and let her continue so it worked out really well um so good news is we got two more projects to go and uh and i know that they're super excited to present as well so we have our second last project for the day and that is yeti roll so the team has just been promoted and uh i'm gonna do it whenever you're ready here you go guys hello can you hear me see yeah right let's start sharing my screen all right yeah so also uh for for me i started this uh this project it's a little bit hard to bite off it's a quite a big scope uh so it's a very fast video uh and after that i will i will take some uh some questions here we go guys leo brent i'm a developer and tech entrepreneur i have a couple of companies and from the companies that i have one of them has a big issue because we have around 30 40 people working for us company called the jetty and we're created yeti role for our internal use and our internal issues that we have with international banking uh basically you can go to the presentation see all why we are opposing of these uh yeah what the issues that we have you can basically see here uh yeah it's a never-ending story we need to you know do something about this i created yeti wall for this which is decentralized online payrolling plan for seamless processing of payments for people connected to centralized and decentralized organizations you can hear it here a little bit about what i'm thinking and i want to go back to work i want to you know go back to work and have efficient value transfer between me and my employees uh yeah we need to cullinate against mologue together here's a little bit about the technical overview what i was thinking about creating streams to actually pay out my workers in a decentralized matter so the employee keeps his employer keeps capital working and the employee get paid out in any asset that you want because we used a one inch integration into our system uh here's the technical setup of the treasury streams that we did here's the technical setup of the treasury flows that we created and here you can see basically how streams work in a more conceptual way we also created gui you can find that in the link and here i will now start a short demo on how it works uh technically okay so we're gonna allow our treasury to spend that die that will allow us to use it later to start the stream now we're gonna deposit the die into the treasury so let's wait for this transaction to go through and we'll just verify that the treasury has been updated for our account so you can see there a hundred thousand dollars been put in some left over from before now we're gonna start a stream from [Music] the receiver of the funds we're going to claim some money that's accrued from our stream so we're going to take out a hundreds uh die away let's wait for this to go through now we can close the funds we can see this transaction's going to go through uh and we can see our internal treasury balance for our recipient is updated now we're going to check the diet balance of our student recipient let's have one down uh now let's withdraw a hundred die away from the treasury and you can see the updated guy balance and so basically this is the overview that i want to show you guys and yeah i want to go back to work and you know let's increase human coordination together and with your guys help we will be able to uh to get this thing rolling to get this thing off the ground and to make it into a reality i'm um you know looking forward to working together more on this together with the one-inch team or with other developers you know as told before i have a couple of tech companies in the blockchain space but also the traditional space and a lot of other companies face the same issue that i'm facing international payments and having a more streamlined way of paying my workers and having my working capital actually working for me it's a big issue i want to solve it need your help thank you very much and i hope to see you at the judging session thank you thank you guys see you later all right so that's this was it okay guys uh hear me uh yeah thanks for that demo um yeah i mean payments is a is a pretty big industry of course especially international and uh yes i hope that uh some of our judges have any questions or some have questions because i got a couple as well if there aren't sorry you said you had questions kartik oh yeah but i'll i'll let i'll let you go first all right okay you can also feel free to jump in um but you mentioned like you wanted to get back to work and this is coming from like you wanting to solve uh for problems here so um like your experience with so i'm just curious because you ran through the example really quick at just like a high human to human level like what exactly do you hope um yeti will accomplish for your specific business and then i guess we can make extrapolations for other businesses as well thank you very much yeah so basically every month i'm spending more than fifteen hundred dollars or sometimes even two thousand dollars of wasted capital i need to have my working capital instead of having it invested in actually productive assets i need to set it aside and then it rots on the bank and then i need to actually transfer it to uh like uh uh like the specific issue is like i get most of my clients from europe the united and the united states uh and then uh most of my employees are actually in asia and the philippines and in russia and then what i need to do is have my euros and dollars i need to convert them first to hong kong dollars then i have to convert them to philippine peso or russian rubles and then i have to pay out my workers and these workers are actually they prefer to having a different they also want to have dollar accounts or uh get paid out in different assets and they can't because uh it's it's it's a big hurdle for them to um set up banking or etc etc but i was thinking and setting up payment streams so that my working capital is actually constantly doing something so as a company where i would normally have my working capital sleeping in a in a bank account i have my working capital actually for example providing liquidity or doing uh whatever productive thing that it can do and then at the moment when a stream starts the worker gets paid out in that productive asset stream and then can choose when he wants to get paid out right now what you could also do uh with this is that the workers when they have us like fixed streams streamed to their uh to their to them as a person other people can like fund these people if they need like a loan or something like that so it's a dual purpose for me as an employer and also for my employees i want to be paid better than a normal currency cool okay amazing uh quick question first of all great presentation uh and the vision love all of it um what's the best way to for an employee to get their money working when they've received it uh and earning interest uh you what do you mean like in the treasury you mean uh no even once an employee has if an employee claims the money for themselves or claims their salary or has a stream coming to them uh what's the best way for them to automatically have it start earning interest yeah so there's different ways to do that so at this moment i was thinking of using and i didn't have time to completely build that out because it's also uh quite big but i was thinking about using the curved tree tree pool for example which is a tree pool of acid like die usdc usdt and transferring them that asset and if they want to get paid out so if they say okay i want to get paid out they can basically get paid out every end of the day or basically you can make it like every minute uh and then you can transfer that asset into whatever asset that they want so basically you can transfer them to dollars or euros uh with for example something called uh the there's a couple of uh protocols that are starting to do that but i hope that in the future more protocols will help me with the fiat to crypto conversion and this is purely focused on the basically managing uh payment streams for decentralized enterprise organizations and i want to build it in a way that it's like an open source commodity so i i need this for my own organizations so i will actually execute this further and once it's done i will release this to the community to use it however they want to great thank you i think we're at time but um just a comment in that it really seems like you've thought through a lot of this so so thanks for kind of um going through that and and sharing it with us yeah thanks guys and yeah we need to slay motor it's like human coordination you know if we can increase the the the way the speed that we transfer capital to each other i think a lot of beautiful things can happen and especially with the workers that i work with because they're mostly in developing countries uh where we hire designers developers and these people you know if you can have a stream to them prove that their time is value then other people might lend money to them so that was my way of thinking thank you so much amazing all right thanks guys thank you and uh with that in mind uh we are ready for our last demo for the day and uh for that i'd like to invite team d5 paulie so literally you're here feel free to kick off for the video hello everyone hello i'm glad to be glad to be here um i'm the last one and um to conclude this series of uh oh some presentation what do you think about playing a game let's do it yes i'm going yeah let's go i've also never seen a microphone light up like that that's pretty cool reminds me of one of those deep sea fish that have the lights to attract the bait okay is there supposed to be audio in the background yes it is yeah i was gonna say i think uh sorry yes um sorry and since you're doing a local video you should check off both boxes at the bottom of zoom yes you're right sorry good start again um this one and this one yeah hi guys my name is ludovic and i'm going to present d5 venture the game i've built for east online hackathon 2020 welcome to d5 venture the game that will teach you about blockchain decentralized apps and defy services you play the role of a crypto entrepreneur and your goal is to become the wealthiest player through founding and developing businesses in the crypto space all players start with the same amount of cash and from the genesis block now roll the dices and move on the board when you land on a startup you can decide to found it only if no other player did it before you have to pay the initial capital now the startup is yours if you land on a startup that is already owned by another player you have to buy its product and pay the owner so basically the more startups you own the more revenues you can expect when you land on a chance block you pick a card and you have to perform an action like pay or receive cash when you land on the covered block bad luck you're locked down in quarantine and you can't play the next round to grow your wealth you must invest in your startups by injecting more cash to increase your revenues when other players land on your blocks with the defy services you can earn interest by staking cash or borrow money by locking your assets as collateral your investments can also be funded by performing an ico that means issuing and selling tokens for your startup moreover there is an in-game marketplace to exchange assets between players by playing this game the players learn how to interact with the blockchain we also hope this will allow mainstream people to realize how some decentralized solutions redefine the way the financial services can be delivered they would have a better understanding of the d5 revolution and eventually it would help them to jump in i really hope you have enjoyed this short teaser the game is deployed on matic destnet and you can play live at the url below let me describe quickly its architecture d5 venture is a fully decentralized game meaning that all the games mechanisms are performed on the matic blockchain by a set of smart contracts portis is used as a getaway to connect to the matic blockchain this is a very good solution to embark users that doesn't have a crypto wallet yet a game factory contract is responsible to create the other contracts required for a game session there is an esc-20 smart contract to represent the in-game currency an nft contract to manage ownership of startups a gamemeister contract to implement and check the game rules and a marketplace contract to manage exchanges in addition a chainlink vrf coordinator is also used to generate random numbers the development of this game doesn't stop now first i need to complete the most advanced mechanisms of the game i also need chaining vrf to be deployed on matic that is not done yet then i would be able to deploy on my net moreover the users should be able to play without paying fees thanks to a gas relay that would be funded by a nolos price pool but i didn't have the time to integrate it yet finally i think about a 3d version of the playground deployed in decentraland and more than that i would like to play with family and friends i hope you enjoyed this presentation and appreciate my work thanks for your attention thank you so much that was a creative demo i'm sure there's a lot of questions here yeah that was super fun thank you um i'd like to play myself but i'm curious i also like how you outline specifically what needs to happen next um you know what what other folks uh in in terms of team members or you know technology do you need access to in in order to execute this or can can you handle it all on your own yeah currently i didn't have the time to um to finish the implementation of all the ideas i have um especially some some ideas i have in the game itself like raising an aco we see we see the ui but it's not connected yet to the smart contract um so that's one point at the game and the other point is um how to make the game um playable by anybody uh we didn't have a an ethereum account um but didn't have the native token of the blockchain it's it's metic in this case uh it's not if but um that's why i would like a gas relay but the idea was to found the gas relay with a with something similar to pull together um so people are taking um a bit of money to um to get get the right to play and they they can get their money back when whenever they want but they they they can't play anymore and during the time they have staking their their money the interest found the gas relay that would be the the concept of pull to play but i didn't have time to do that in addition to the game um but in term of technology i've i've seen a lot of a great panel of technology um very useful to to to achieve that i was very impressed by for instance um i've discovered portis was able to switch from layer 1 to layer 2 very very quickly so it's very it's very practical in my in my concept because you you can stake your your you can stake on level one to get interest and and play on level two with the same account and that's uh that's wonderful um chaining is also very interesting in that uh in that in that way um and um yeah [Music] um i like that the game is fully decentralized because it it gives it give it some perspective so anybody can um can create a new front end and connect to connect to the to the game smart contracts and maybe implement a bot that is playing a very in autonomous way with a given strategy and that's yeah that's a lot of perspectives um and now i think i i need to have real players uh to get feedback on it cool thank you yeah this is awesome and i think uh it takes a lot of creativity to to create a game so so so kudos for um for trying to build this um i i want to claire i want to ask a clarifying question is that in that are each one of those like squares or uh or boxes do you actually perform on chain the thing that they're asking you to do so if it's asking you to stake something is that something that you need to do directly in that ui i'm sorry could you repeat i i'm not sure i understand oh yeah yeah yeah i was trying to to understand in the game when it's asking you to maybe do some action um that's like a defy action all right uh is the player supposed to actually do that on chain yes e yes absolutely when when the player is founding a startup he has to pay the initial capital and then he will get the ownership of the startup so it means there will be a transfer of the token of the the currency the in-game currency token there will be a transfer in the in the erc20 smart contract uh that manages the tokens and they also we will um have a transfer of the as of the asset in the nft contract so these two transfers have to be done together and it's done it's implemented by the the game master contract that is uh realizing the action on the blockchain uh when the when the user is um is choosing the option you want to play got it that makes sense yeah and and and that's a great way thing for um for people just to become more comfortable with actually interacting on chains so it can be a good learning tool as well yeah maybe you have recognized the concept of monopoly there is a game monopoly and that teaches about capitalism borrow money uh you have a bank and uh with blockchain we don't need any bank uh it's it's it's uh the smart contract is doing the job um in a trustless manner and that's uh that that's that's crazy we can we can play with a bank and that's what i would like people to understand why why the defy is so important and why it's so uh um uh rupture um something new something uh yeah yeah well thank you i feel like games are always a really good way to get people kind of comfortable with new ideas and concepts and step outside of like these preconceived notions that they might have so thank you for that [Music] well awesome um thanks so much that was a really creative game and uh yeah i think uh i am personally ready to play that next i'm gonna go in a project and just see what i can play with right now in matic so uh that's it uh i want to thank all of you uh for for being here especially all the teams that hung out to watch the remaining set of demos uh little thanks for presenting and being our last team and uh before we close off i want to make sure that i kind of thank our volunteers anna and winnie who uh kind of coordinate all this behind the scenes so everything you saw as a judge and where you can see the video was a lot of uh coordination that they managed through the whole process so thanks again for helping us out today and lastly before we end i want to thank all three of you dmitry said and ashley for giving us a couple hours of your day to watch all of these demos and give a lot of feedback to these projects so um really appreciate your time and i really appreciate you being part of the event as well and i'd like to thank you guys because i feel like eats global east online has done a tremendous amount for um allowing people to kind of tap into the ethereum network and ecosystem on like a human level and um for sharing really cool inspiring ideas so thank you kartik and the rest of your crew for making it happen pass this along to the rest of the team as well and thank you thank you to all the participants as well uh so much inspirational work it's amazing to see how much y'all accomplished in this short amount of time uh i think there's at least a couple of billion dollar businesses that i saw uh being downloaded potentially so uh you know you guys are building the future and and it's also very international future something i really appreciate to see with people from all around the world so i really appreciate y'all we all want to help so regardless you know hit us all up uh and let us know how we can be helpful absolutely we'll not like have a way to reach out to you uh through discord or other channels so with that i want to thank everybody here and now we will conclude this webinar so thanks again and i hope you have a great rest of the week see you on friday thank you thank you
