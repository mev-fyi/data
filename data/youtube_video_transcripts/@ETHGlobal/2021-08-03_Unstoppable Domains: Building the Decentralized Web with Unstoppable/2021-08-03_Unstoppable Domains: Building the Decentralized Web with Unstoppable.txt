all right let's uh i guess without further ado let's get this kicked off uh thank you to everyone in the in the chat tonight really excited for this one or it's morning or afternoon where you are i apologize um i'd like to introduce jimmy from unstoppable domains i'll let him take it away from here cool yeah thanks luke appreciate it and like huge huge thanks to you youth global team and the protocol labs team for hosting hack fs i'll say unstoppable we're huge fans of you know all the events that youth global puts together so it's always awesome for us to be here so i appreciate it much love uh cool so uh hey guys what's up my name is jimmy i am a product manager for unstoppable domains and today we're going to talk a little bit about what unstoppable is what kind of the vision is that we have for the future of the internet uh and then lastly we're also gonna do uh you know my favorite part which is a technical demo we're gonna show uh basically a live demo of a super simple react app of using our libraries in order to actually resolve unstoppable domains and use them on any sort of application whether it be for payments or whether it be for resolving decentralized websites and so like luke mentioned and so i work on unstoppable i'm a product manager for a team called the dev tools team and for me that's like my absolute favorite job because i'm essentially a pm of building like tools and services and libraries and documentation for my favorite people which are crypto developers so it's an awesome job and basically i get to be part of the ecosystem i get to participate in a bunch of hackathons and events just telling people about all the cool stuff they're building to make it incredibly easy to to build on our platform so that's definitely a huge priority for us we want more builders we want a broad ecosystem of apps using unstoppable domains it's not just you know us showcasing the cool stuff we want to make sure other people can build cool stuff too so we'll talk a little bit about uh how you can get involved and a bunch of the different hacks and bounties that we have that you guys can get involved with as well cool uh that's enough about agenda let's go ahead and get started and so again we're going to talk about kind of what unstoppable is and what the vision is that we have for the internet uh cool so i guess we'll start off with a problem statement um and basically say this isn't really the internet that we sign up for and so when the internet was basically founded uh you know in quotes about 30 years ago in the 90s you know the advent of tcpip and actually the internet working of web 1.0 there was this huge vision for uh what we wanted the internet to be and i say we very loosely because i was definitely not around during this time uh we basically wanted uh kind of this democratized uh access to information right you know anyone can build a web page anyone can find the truth anyone can communicate to other people around the world instantaneously uh and there was definitely a really big feeling of you know democratization about openness uh permissionlessness it was definitely the wild west and i think those ethos still really rings true today um but you know flash for 30 years and it's a little bit different than what we wanted to be in the 90s so firstly users don't own their data you know applications and and for lack of better word corporations do right very different from web 1.0 when anyone can make any website and connect to any information um secondly apps you know censor the the information that we have because they're basically gated by these corporations and so they're liable right and they basically have ownership over this information so they basically get to dictate what is on these platforms and then lastly uh data really can't be owned by its d users and therefore there's no composability of data uh which is tough because again they're owned by these corporations right so we don't really have true ownership and control over uh an agency honestly over our own data which is like pretty crazy to think about and so uh let's kind of double click into each of these three things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know after setting over setting up the problem statement how unstoppable really tries to solve this so the first thing users don't really own their data and so i like to show up this uh this little cartoon from the economist about four years ago but it's basically these companies right these big companies mining data and that's kind of it's powerful image right it's like hey like they're just gathering this natural resource which is basically our user behaviors and they're owning it and they're using it for you know god knows what but uh at you know at least at a high level they're they're selling it to the highest bidder for advertisers and uh you know i think you guys heard the term uh you know if you're not uh the user you're the product and that's basically our relationship with a lot of these you know applications and search engines uh so what's the second piece uh so the second piece is apps sensor uh data because it's on their platform uh because they're liable for it uh but what does that actually you know mean concretely for an end user like does censorship really matter uh and uh the net of it is that it does matter and so you know about 4.7 billion internet users are currently being censored and they don't even realize it right and they don't realize until uh they have to realize it and so it's kind of what i want to call like counterparty risk uh here we go uh and that what that basically means is okay there's like another kind of attack factor another risk factor that you need to think about as an internet user to use the internet right or if you're you know like if you look at a different way if you're a builder that's another kind of risk factor right you're like hey like i host on a normal domain and uh i didn't really think about what it meant to be you know something something that phi but it's actually you know owned by the finnish government and so that's you know a different set of rules and regulations that i have to kind of abide by and that's counterparty risk right that's more kind of overhead than most people think about when they think about interacting with the internet and so what does it mean to be censored uh when you don't realize it and be exposed to counterparty risk i have two examples for you guys you know on the left hand side uh sometime last year we had some godaddy employees uh tricked into transferring the control of domain names for uh crypto firms uh you know like you know no these are notable names right one of them is is liquid which is a known exchange a centralized exchange in asia and basically uh you know they were subjected to um you know phishing and other kind of social engineering where these hackers basically got control over these domain names and that became an attack factor for these crypto companies right if users are trying to go into your domain name but it redirects into a malicious site i mean there's not really a lot you can do with it because uh you know it was essentially owned by another party right godaddy was a reseller and they had access to this domain name and basically open up an attack vector for you and your users without you having even to do anything right your security was rock solid so that's one piece around counter party risk the second piece around counterparty risk is relationships to sovereign nations and so this actually happened quite recently right only a little bit over a month ago but the united states government actually took down a new site that was you know linked to uh that was basically based out of iran right they were talking about iranian related news um and the u.s took it down based on you know different political agendas and demanding you know um like counterfactual news uh for what this iranian linked news site was essentially disseminating which is pretty crazy because um i mean like let's take politics away from it like this is an iranian company it lives on iranian soil it you know has information in farsi uh and it was taken by the us government and they were able to do that because they had a dot-com domain name right it was owned by uh verisign which is a us-based company so the u.s government can just basically do whatever they want with their com names if it's in their you know political agenda and so again just another piece of counterparty risk that you just don't really think about when you're building websites right and so how do we kind of merge all those things together and think about uh what does it mean to have a truly decentralized web right and so decentralized really means censorship resistant like we mentioned just kind of bulletproofing those potential risk vectors that i was talking about excuse me it's permissionless so anyone can participate right you don't have to get access from any central authority or any other party in order to participate and it's self-custody and so what that means is you own it we own it as individuals right we own our data we own all the content that we share we own our domain names right and so that is something that's super powerful and so when we think about a decentralized web i mean there's a lot of different kind of pieces that essentially allow it to kind of aggregate together into one broader vision um but if the vision that we're setting is essentially this this new vision of the web that is you know owned by those three tenants i just mentioned uh blockchain domains are essentially the gateway to the decentralized web uh you know how do people access websites right do they care about tcp do they care about hosting on aws ec2 instance uh no they just know google.com they know it's facebook.com they don't care about the ip address they don't care about dns resolution they just know it's google and it works uh and you know and that that's pretty analogous to kind of how we you know view uh our role in the decentralized web obviously all those components of cloud computing of content resolution uh peer-to-peer networking are super important but in our day we're kind of the first stop for a lot of users in order to onboard into a decentralized web and we take that responsibility uh we don't take that responsibility lightly we know it's really really important for people to be able to interface with us and have a really great experience in order to essentially access this this new advent of a decentralized web and i'll sometimes call it web 3.0 or web 3. uh and so it's important and it's important because it essentially allows access to a wide variety of use cases that we think are going to be really important for the decentralized internet so the first use case is decentralized websites i mean that's pretty intuitive and i think it's a good response to all the different facts that i brought up earlier in this talk around you know how do you have a truly decentralized web stack that hosts content that can't be taken down that has a domain that is yours forever uh and can't be taken down either so uh pretty important stuff the second piece is crypto payments and so right now you know if you want to send any form of cryptocurrency you have a long alphanumeric string in order to send people stuff and if you're anything like me you're triple checking by the addresses that you're sending because it's just a super painful and stressful experience and you should be able to distract that right and so that's something that was a really important use case for us when we were building uh you know these decentralized domain names the last piece is digital identity which is kind of a catch-all term but really thinking about you know what does it mean to have a domain name as the gateway to the decentralized web you know what does it mean from a username perspective what does it mean from other information that is important that you want to port from either different parts of uh you know the blockchain network or smart contract network and the different dapps or even porting option information on train you know how do we how do we essentially leverage domain names in order to uh be able to be the bridge for a lot of other kind of data transfer within the decentralized web uh so that's super important for us as well um and so creating censorship resistant websites uh is of course you know the first and foremost use case that we think resonates with a lot of people uh and when it meet when we say censorship resistant we don't just mean um the fact that you know you can never kind of take it down um we also mean that uh it's kind of just yours to own forever and even if unstoppable were to disappear uh it's it's yours forever and the reason why that happens is because uh we leveraged the ethereum virtual machine and so uh without getting too technical yet uh basically we have um two smart contracts deployed on ethereum uh that would never go down and basically one of them is a decentralized registrar which essentially means uh you know a list of addresses that are uh shown as owners and therefore have right access before these domains and then the second smart contract is something called the resolver which basically allows you know the owner of these domains to write new records whether it be bitcoin addresses each addresses or the hash for content of some sort of decentralized content sharing protocol in order to have a website and so that is kind of what we mean when we buy unstoppable you know it's unsolvable because it can't be stopped right it's just on ethereum forever and when you buy a unstoppable domain um there's nothing that we can do about it right you pay it's a it's a pay once model you have it forever and even unstoppable work to uh disappear again like it's already deployed on ethereum it just lives forever and you own it because you only have to pay once and i think that's the power of it is that it's truly decentralized you know you need to you don't even need to rely on unstoppable in order to take advantage of the domains which is really cool um yeah sorry that was a quick aside but basically uh we want to create censorship resistant websites you can make dapps uh which you know we've had daps already deploy using our domain names and then you can also have other interesting things like nft galleries and blogs so we've made templates that are open source you can check out our git repo that basically show a way to display your nfts whether it be erc 721 or a different standard you can also have a blog template as well and so it's pretty standard kind of wordpress ask setting um or template rather in order to create blog so we're trying to add more and more utility for non-technical people to be able to participate in the decentralized web which i think is really exciting um so it's decentralized websites uh and also what's really important is uh solving the problem with blockchains uh making them easier right so on the left hand side you see an ether address and you see a not quite sure what that is uh it's not a bitcoin address though um but anyway that gets abstracted away into xerox gym.crypto and for folks wondering really how that works uh essentially when you enter in uh my domain name which is i have several but one of them is xerox gym.crypto essentially has a response to the resolver smart contract on ethereum the one i was mentioning before and it says hey like someone wants to send xerox gym.cryptos from eve what is this ethan address and then it will send the request to the smart contract and it'll return 0x8 a b 4 blah blah whatever uh and uh you know and then they can actually do the value exchange right and so it's a little bit of a handshake and a uh well a little bit of a it's more like content management that needs to happen before actual value transfer can happen and so it's a quite elegant solution but that's kind of the importance that we're trying to or that's kind of the pain point that we're trying to solve and why it's super important to have blockchain domains it just kind of opens up payments as a use case to to the masses for blockchain cool and this is kind of a screenshot of it uh in action and quickly yes uh and so this you can kind of just see uh it's resolving um you know zeroxjam.crypto is resolving into this youth address here which is your x 705 a volleyball this is like my actual youth address this one before it wasn't uh this was just a stand-in ether address this is my actual address shown uh on the web oh sorry on a wallet ui uh and so you can purchase a decentralized domain on an unstoppable website it's pretty standard you go to unstoppabledomains.com you search for whatever you're interested in uh and you're able to purchase it again one time purchases forever and what's really cool is we have a bunch of new tlds or top-level domains available now and so it used to just be zealand.crypto but now we have nft.dow.wallet which i think are really interesting and so that's pretty straightforward i think what gets me a lot more excited is the idea of you being able to purchase it in any sort of supported app and so this is a screenshot of my ether wallet which is a really popular open source eth wallet and you're actually able to buy unstoppable domains from their own interface and so that's really cool because it just shows that we're not really the end like the gatekeeper of the decentralized web uh that there are other kind of participants in this ecosystem for anyone to be able to purchase these decentralized domains and so that's something that i'm personally pretty excited about uh cool and so uh we're growing like i think any company in 2021 uh crypto is but uh we have over 300 million compatible browser installs we have i think 1.2 million domains now slides a bit outdated uh we support you know over 50 apps that's something that i'm personally pretty proud of um because that's kind of my mandate right i want more apps we're really cool use cases that other people are building in our ecosystem again it's not just unstoppables you know 70 people uh working in the corner trying to make this useful we want to really uh allow people to access this open source technology in order to build more use cases for and add more value to the world that's something that i personally have a lot of affinity towards as a mission uh yeah and so you can see some of the apps that have been installed with us uh pretty kind of straightforward names here some top wallets and topped apps uh and so yeah now is the right time for blockchain domains i think you know internet censorship is a big part of conversation right now i think uh large companies uh there's definitely a narrative large companies owning data and having a bit too much power in terms of what they can do with it and how they can actually um alter uh to direct your trajectory of our behaviors as a result of it uh and i think the loss to trust of traditional institutions is really at an all-time high right a lot of people are talking about uh you know the relationship with monetary policy of cyber nations as it relates to bitcoin some people are talking about the relationship with their bank as it relates to fees especially overdraft fees and other fees that they kind of uh are drawing away for folks so uh i think you know the time is definitely now to think a little bit more about broadly what is your relationship with you know other kind of infrastructure providers people like uh you know folks that run dot org dot com that are centralized entities right they're basically just centralized databases and maybe think about a decentralized option right what it means actually have a domain name that is uh built on a decentralized registrar that lives on ethereum as opposed to some nosql db that lives in you know arlington virginia or something [Music] and so i'll leave this presentation uh with a little quote it's from brewster kale who is the founder of internet archive and he said let's lock the web open this time for good and style booster obviously og web 1.0 person thinking about open sourcing information and thinking about you know what is the next step of the internet well the next step of the internet is open decentralized democratized and we're building towards brewster's vision cool so that was kind of a little bit about our vision and what we want to do now let's talk a little bit more about how browsers or really any app developer can build using unstoppable domains and so the canonical example that i'll show is essentially a pretty simple resolution you see here that we go to kyber.crypto it shows this light dap that kyber has where you go to brad.crypto which is kind of been our canonical example for uh an nft gallery said showing brad's wallet and what he's displaying as nfts he has some pretty interesting one-of-ones that if you click on go into the open source the openc page uh and so that is pretty standard um and i just want to you know i'm going to revisit this uh but uh yeah so now now that we've seen kind of the demo unfold from jiff form let's actually talk about what it means to build one unstoppable and we're actually gonna go through a demo cool so i'm gonna do my demo in two parts one part is i'm going to show you guys how you can actually build it unstoppable if you were to start from scratch so i'm gonna be in the website and i'm going to talk a little bit about you know how you navigate in order to actually access our tools and libraries to integrate with us and then i'm going to show you a really really simple app that i built on react that is using our libraries and i stripped away all the complexity all the fun javascript state changes and all the css shininess to just show you exactly what's happening underneath the hood just to show you just how easy this is cool so the first thing i'm gonna do is i i'm on our website and i'm gonna go to our doc site here and i'm going to go down and see that i am an app and i want to let's say i want to send and receive crypto right i just want to resolve a domain using crypto so i go to the crypto payments here and so here you can see a pretty nice overview of what it means to actually search for your domain name and get a response for an each address in this example and so lots of architecture lots of code snippets for js java and swift uh but i think what i'm most interested in for a quick demo is i'm actually going to go to our js resolution library and so i am looking at our js resolution library and it's kind of explaining a little bit more about what to do to accept your environment and to download the necessary libraries and here what i want to do is i essentially want to search for decentralized website using a domain and so i'm going to go to the section called find ipfs hash for decentralized web the decentralized website uh and basically you can just copy paste this code what it's trying to do is essentially pulling from our js library and actually trying to resolve it's building in a resolve ipfs hash function and we resolving something called homecakes.crypto which as a response you're going to see the ipfs hash next to this pretty standard ipfs gateway url and you can do a little bit more interesting things with it like you can find a custom record here or you can actually do it all in cli but basically it's really that easy in terms of finding a known domain name and uh essentially resulting with it cool uh so now what i'm gonna do is actually show you what that means in practice uh all right where am i okay we're gonna go the demo here uh okay cool so basically uh how do i want to do this uh okay so basically what i'm doing right now is i've already purchased an unstoppable domain and so if you have already purchased one if you haven't uh what you need to do is buy one and you go to my domains i have a couple and then click manage for xerox gym.crypto and so what we have here in the manage flow is basically a bunch of different addresses that you can resolve to and so what i want to do is actually return the ipfs hash that's attached so i can actually resolve my website and you can see this is my ipfs hash here all right so we'll pause there this is important but we will return to it uh okay so now what i have open sorry i'm gonna move this zoom thing out of the way is literally the simplest app you've ever seen uh it's it's a react app and i'm actually going to flip open to ves code to see exactly what's happening uh so it could not be simpler guys literally what i'm doing here is i'm downloading a few dependencies i'm using a standard react boilerplate i'm importing the js resolution library from our git repo then what i'm doing is i'm configuring some pretty standard states for this application and then i have two functions one is the resolve function which is basically the most important part of this very simple app it's essentially reading a domain name and returning what's either going to be a dns record if you're resolving dns or in this case we're going to be resolving an ipfs hash and then what it's going to do it's going to show a string of this record uh and then here's the actual react page so it's pretty standard here's a div block for the actual input and then it's going to be showing a string for the record or it's going to be showing an error if nothing happens okay so pretty standard so remember this is my ipfs hash that i linked uh using the unstoppable ui and so what that basically means is now on our resolver smart contract is your xgen.crypto if it gets requested for the ipfs hash um it's going to return this to whatever client is actually asking for this so i typed in my domain name i hit resolve you can see it's the same exact hash so this is an ipfs hash so that's kind of interesting it's not really that interesting and so what we can do is we can go to a pretty standard ipfs gateway copy paste it as the path and then we're going to load up my ipfs hash which is this half finished decentralized blog but you can kind of get the gist of what's happening and so uh yeah that's like basically uh the whole workflow of like actually using our js library getting you know an ipfs hash in this case and then you can put it through a gateway in order to actually resolve a decentralized website and so that's pretty interesting although not super safe in order to have a web page for what you're resolving and so what we actually built is an unstoppable domains uh google chrome extension where essentially if you download this what it's doing is a pretty similar function to what i just showed in that really simple react app but it's actually adding another layer of encryption on top of it and so if i do a native search on google chrome it's going to turn up the same thing but instead of having it be a web page for my string it's this baf kind of abstraction uh or you know changing of the of the hash and it goes to a pretty another pretty standard ipfs d-web gateway um so yeah that's uh that's basically it and i have a little bit of a call to action for you guys and so we have a ton of bounties that you can find on our discord if you're interested in basically doing what i just laid out but in a bunch of different pretty interesting use cases uh and also thanks so much for free to join our depth community we have our docs which is our homepage and we also have our discord which we're constantly adding for support and a bunch of other things um on there so feel free to join and if you're hacking with us if you're hacking with our bounties or hacking with hackfest please go to our discord or please go to eatglobal's discord and we're happy to be as helpful as possible for support right on hey hey all right we'd love to take some questions now to enter the q a portion of this excellent talk um does anyone want to go first here uh feel free to unmute yourself and turn on your camera if you'd like or if you're more comfortable remaining off more than welcome to do that through the chat as well got a quick question in the chat does uh unstoppable support ipns records instead of ipfs cid only or are there plans to it didn't last time i looked yeah so i think there's definitely plans to support ipns um my my i think we already support it but it's a little bit like obfuscated from the documentation how it works uh i think it's like on some support ticket but uh yeah i mean i think ipns makes a ton of sense right like then you can have more dynamic content and not have to change your hash all the time so um yeah i think we're actually working on like making it easier for people to add their ipns just looking through the questions yeah that's something in the waiting room uh cool i see one um i know we have yuri on hey folks uh sorry gently but i'm not gonna ask uh so questions one is uh if you could share the presentation uh for review they'll be nice and the second one was if you happen to have an unstoppable short domain for uh unsolvable discord we've been experimenting with some short links for puma discords and it's been actually pretty fun to have a short url for that so it'd be nice to be able to easily jump in and join your discord as well yeah sure um luke what's the easiest way to share materials should we just post it on the youth global discord yeah i was going to say the uh unstoppable sponsor channel it should be the actual you can post in the sponsor unstoppable domains um channel within the eth global discord um you can also use the chat here but uh it will disappear after the presentation so the discord's probably the best place to do it yeah i'll just post it there and you're just answer your second question uh on link shortener so uh so well the canned answer is uh so in order to get a vanity discord link you have to hit like a certain level of boosts which we are actively working towards we want to be level three and we're currently level two um so that's like a discord vanity link which is like discord dot gg slash you know whatever um but uh the second answer is i could definitely see a world where we just have an unstoppable domain that uh it resolves to our you know canned discord link and so that actually be pretty interesting thanks for the thanks for getting my brain juices flowing that's what we did for for us and we have like chat.puma.tech or chadwick and it just redirects the long discord url but it works pretty well so yeah no i appreciate it that's a really good idea a um great presentation but by the way um so i was uh i was wondering because like i was part of i'm sorry my camera wasn't i was working and supporting um handshake and i had a couple tld top level domains and i remember our meeting um actually when um they were coming up with ens before it was like talk publicly is it possible to set up an sld sub-level domain with one of my tlds that i own at all with one of my top level domains or is it is strictly through um the tld owned by i guess ethereum name and service is that is that how it is you're creating an sld through unstoppable domains okay so there's a few levels to this uh to this question um and so i think the difference between uh like unstoppable and ens versus handshake is with handshake like you own the top level domain so you'll own like dot 888 or something like that whereas um for ens and unstoppable like the smart contracts itself like themselves actually have the tlds and so for us we have that crypto and for ens they have eth and i think they also have some sort of like i can partnership where you can do like xyz and some other like kind of like more normal domain names um and so that's kind of like to answer your question on that and so when you think we talk about like second level domains um for handshake like yeah if you own like the tld you can like mint your own second level domains uh but for us like and for enos like you purchase it from the smart contract right and so like for us it's like we have crypto dot dialogue mt like you would purchase like simon dot nft right as opposed to for handshake if you auction for like dot 888 and then you can start issuing like simon dot a day date right so hopefully that answers your question in terms of like the differences and what does it mean to have like a tld versus a second level domain yeah yeah that that answered it quite well i used a couple of my tlds for like d-links and um a couple of websites that i've created but i it's funny how we all like set up all these daps but then we totally forget that we're like we're not truly decentralized because we still are on these centralized websites that can be shut down at any time so this is a great presentation um i really really like it um definitely going to go through the demo and check it out myself see how i can use this cool yeah i appreciate it and again if your questions go to the global discord now i'll be there man we'll we'll chat it up got a another question in the chat um are the dot crypto cld smart contracts immutable upgradeable uh that is a good question um i don't quite know what upgradeable means uh in this context but they are definitely immutable in the sense that like once you mint them like it's just yours forever um and in terms of upgradable i mean feel free to add color into what that means but from what i interpret like does that mean you can add like new features or or something on top of it or like add a new version um uh honestly no uh i think what we would rather do uh in lieu of that is just up like up by up the deploy a new smart contract uh that is probably like gas efficient and has a bunch of different features and basically just like migrate people over hopefully that answers your question yeah i mean that that makes sense um daniel if you're still in i believe okay okay yeah yeah all good again if anyone has any questions feel free to jump right in or ask inside the chat um this has been a a really incredible presentation though so really excited to see what people do with unstoppable tech throughout this hackathon yeah me too uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be good there's so much awesome stuff to be able to uh to build with this um you know like decent like just like new ways of building decentralized web or you know decentralized chat or um really anything we have actually a pretty novel integration with chain link in order to verify option information so you can append that to your domain name we have like twitter verification so it gets pretty uh you can get in a rabbit hole pretty deep if you go to the dock site sure i think we're in a really unique moment in crypto on the whole for usability in the non-technical side uh one more question actually uh what are your favorite domains to test on slash demo from the chat that's a good question so uh there's kind of like two answers of this one is um if you're talking about like as just like a developer like what is like a really good domain to test on um we basically have two research for that one is like we have a faucet for test domain so you can just like get a test net domain and hack on whatever you need to hack on on i think like rank b um we also have a list of already deployed like or already minted rather test set domains that you can just like use to play around with then you can see what's supposed to be added to it from a record perspective um in terms of my favorite domain is the test on demo i mean if i do if i'm like testing in prod or like i'm like giving like a hackathon demo i usually just like like to use my own mainnet address or mainnet domain rather because uh i have full write capability for whatever i need to do and i know that it's going to happen on main on mainnet uh so i like to use that of course uh we've liked to use brad.crypto also which brad is one of our co-founders uh because he has a pretty robust like not gallery use case and so uh you know you build like a little bit of an unofficial repertoire of like different domains that you can put together to like see like you know resolution of interesting things whether it be you know like an nft gallery versus mines the blog template versus you know a cardano payment address versus an eth1 right and so not everyone has every record kind of added to it and that's like by design so i just have like kind of a again like just like this kind of like back pocket of a bunch of random domains just to resolve and show people a domain quiver i like it exactly more like uh yeah more just like a little wallet i suppose topical very topical all right i think if um if anyone has any last questions go for it i see someone's raising their hand um go for it hello everyone hello hey uh i had a question like it's it's a totally unrelated especially to unstarted unstoppable domains uh but uh it still means like no uh i think decentralized domains are still uh haven't caught like the attention of a general public and population as uh the normal centralized domain have so uh so uh uh what do you think like how long will it take for the normal person to be able to feel comfortable to uh using ifps or using unstoppable domains thanks hey that's a really good question man um like with any answer i give there's kind of like layers to it so i'm gonna give your answer in two different perspectives one is like the end user using uh like feeling comfortable i guess on stuff like with uh decentralized domains and the other one is called like the builder that's like doing like something with their own uh domain so i can never like really speculate on timelines uh but what i can say is like i think users are gonna come a little bit before builders in terms of when you think about like mainstream adoption and for users like it's pretty i don't know intuitive slash abstracted right like if i give someone a url that's like dot you know dow like they're not gonna really think anything different from these brand new tlds have been springing up right you see like now like dot phi dot network dot finance dot co dot io so it's like just another one for them uh so it makes sense although i think a prerequisite for that is like a full kind of like ecosystem play where you know google chrome can natively resolve these domains or firefox can natively resolve them so it becomes a lot more seamless right obviously you can't do that right now you need the unstoppable chrome extension or to inject whatever hash is resolved from that actual domain query um but yeah so i but i still think it's like pretty intuitive for the end user to understand what an you know what a decentralized domain actually is um from a builder perspective i just think that's going to take a little bit longer not to say that people can't build already right now it's just like i think it's just going to be more like crypto native builders because they're pretty familiar with the decentralized tech stack you know they're pretty familiar with ipfs or even like using other alternatives like our weave and they're pretty familiar with like pinata like uploading things with pinata or using fleeq for ci cd so or if they're not like they can read about it and it's something they can pretty intuitively grok just based on being crypto native uh but if you're kind of like a web 2 developer you're just like hey like i'm just a front-end web dev like i know how to use aws and that's it um it's just gonna be a little bit harder and i think tooling just needs to be upgraded in terms of doing that right uh and i think that's why we're pretty interested in like being a part of the community we mean unstoppable domains and like being part of these hackathons because that's where we get to talk to builders and improve that tooling right that's where like deploying uh on a decentralized web stack is almost as intuitive as deploying on web2 based on you know a bunch of novel innovations that we're having in this space or that's why like we can build that decentralized like if we can have a decentralized website builder that looks like webflow like i think that's like the gold standard right for getting like the masses to build websites and that's obviously not you know uh it's not it doesn't exist right now although it should and uh it could just based on a lot of kind of like elbow grease and innovation um but yeah so that's kind of like my long-winded answer for you uh i just think it's gonna it's gonna take a little bit but uh it's just going to come in waves yes uh like as you mentioned uh a web uh a a web platform is like a web uh development type like you mentioned currently so uh do you mean like a platform like wix or weebly like some platform where people can just make a website uh using unstoppable domain and ipf yeah exactly something like wix or weebly uh i said webflow which is like a competitor to those that's a little bit more full-featured um but yeah i think that's kind of like the gold standard for getting non-technical builders to deploy websites on a decentralized web stack thank you so much yeah thank you man for your thoughtful question i think we have uh one more question from the chat um can i issue sub domains from one it's not local government uh so the short answer is yes you can issue subdomains um we don't actively build like tooling to make it quite easy but if you go to the documentations you can definitely find at least a high-level view of how you can mint sub-domains for an ensemble domain right on does anyone have any last questions feel free to post them in the chat or come off meet real quick otherwise i think we'll be uh wrapping up here i wanted to thank jimmy uh for for a great presentation thank you for your time um and a huge thank you to everyone for for coming out um really excited to see the progress here and see how everyone uses the unstoppable tech throughout the hackathon yeah thanks for uh thanks for having me luke again like we're super happy to be a part of the eth community we think youth global is just like top tier just programming uh so there's one takeaway that i have for for everyone coming first of all thanks again for for coming and listening to me ramble for like almost 50 minutes now um there's one takeaway i have for you guys like please go to the youth global discord like let's have a good you know uh async conversation there if you guys have questions if you guys want to hack on stuff take a look at the bounties take a look at the slides and be sharing the link uh just go there that's kind of you know the easiest way i can funnel folks to some some action items afterwards absolutely that's where the unstoppable conversation will continue awesome all right thanks again man take care we're gonna be ending a live
