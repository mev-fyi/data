awesome thanks everyone for joining we have tyson from zora and some creators from the web3 space who's going to give us a talk on building curation and community with web3 thanks everyone tyson i'll hand it over to you now all right hello everyone um yeah my name is tyson i uh i'm one of the co-founders here at zora um yeah super excited to kind of be joining these folks up here to talk about this kind of new idea of curation and community that's kind of being uniquely enabled by web3 um with us today we have patrick rivera from mirror um mirror is a basically brand new decentralized publishing platform it's like changing the way that writing can be shared um they've also as of last night or maybe two nights ago released a new publishing feature that allows writers to natively mint their nfts using the zora protocol um we also have jeremy from catalog works catalog works is a music player digital record shop um really cool space where artists can kind of press and sell songs um as these single edition nfts and then last but not least we also have nikki and paul joining us from i am sound um i am sounds basically one of the top creative studios slash record label slash artist management um groups operating out there right now and they've actually just curated a couple of huge exhibitions on zora with some amazing visual artists and musicians so welcome everyone um i wanted to maybe start by talking about how each of you have kind of been able to form your respective communities in each of your little spaces maybe paul or nikki do you want to let us know a little bit more about how i am sound kind of came to be and then how you've been able to find these incredible artists to work with yeah i mean i am sam we've been going for um probably over a decade now and um you know paul and i have been working together from the beginning and you know we started as a record label and expanded into a creative agency and visual arts artist management firm and i suppose just through the nature of the work that we do which orbits around music we've been involved with many projects um you know with different musicians on the marketing side on the recording side and you know working in and around those um those environments so i think for us last year when we decided to do our exhibition with zora you know we had such a wealth of a community uh just through the nature of the work that we do that it felt like a like a natural transition um to move into the space and and also i think that um you know i i am sound from the very beginning um our ethos has always been about working with artists you know of whether it's musical or visual artists from the very beginning ground level we work with almost all developing artists that we just really love and try and shepherd them throughout their career and and really kind of shine a spotlight on a lot of artists who don't necessarily get that spotlight at the beginnings of their career and so i think for us when we learned more about nfts and about you know what it can really offer to these kinds of artists we're really excited it's very much a a tangible way of doing what we've always done um but you know in i don't know i just it just seemed really exciting um and seemed like a natural evolution of our ethos yeah definitely and then jeremy i know you've just basically just started to onboard the very first musicians into catalog um do you want to just walk us through what that onboarding experience looks like and then kind of how other people can get involved with your community sure thing so we started by hand picking a selection of artists that we think make really really amazing music this first drop was very tailored in that sense um we have seen a lot of people who like other musicians who are really interested in getting on and that's something that super excites me about having a dedicated space for music in this nft space what we've been doing is is sort of talking to each artist individually answering any questions that they might have about the technology demystifying any common points of confusion but overall it's been a really amazing experience everyone's eyes light up when when they start to have that aha moment with the underlying technology and it's been really really great just like it's something you can't unsee once once you see it you cannot see it and i i love shepherding you know sort of artists and creatives through that process when uh they sort of realize that this is a new way for them to capture more of the value around their work yeah i think like we're starting to see this very unique new approach with artists and their communities this like direct way of basically interacting with the community via nfts um patrick i want to bring you in really quick because i know mira is doing a very novel approach to kind of onboarding publishers into your community do you want to give us a quick overview of the right race and maybe how that works yeah yeah so as mentioned earlier mir right now is a decentralized publishing platform and in order to onboard people we could have taken a few different approaches we could just let anybody join the platform in a complete permissionless way but there's still a lot we have to do in terms of making our editor better and adding different features and getting certain contracts audited and so instead we the other approach could also be just like slowly roll out and invite people we know and we've seen that that wasn't necessarily kind of the ethos of like permissionless open protocols and so his middle ground was building a community driven governance mechanism and so it's basically fixed way of saying allowing current writers on the platform and people interested in joining the platform to vote on who should be allowed to to be on boarded and so we we do this game pretty much every wednesday it starts at 3 eastern and you can go to our website mariner.xyz slash race you connect your connect your wallet and then obviously tweet out a link on twitter and then that gives you ten votes to vote for anybody else that connected their wallet and then we also have this excuse we have this mechanism where the existing writers on the platform they get more votes they get a thousand votes and people that aren't on the platform get 10 votes and so that kind of drives this incentive for people that are onboarded on the platform to continue like governing the community and yeah making sure that people that get voted in the platform they're going to have more influence of the next few people that are they're voted on and so i've seen some creative things where communities like tech optimus they have a telegram channel and they're organizing and voting in people and then this past week they voted someone in and he said that hey i'm gonna now the next few weeks we're gonna decide who should vote in and they're pretty much creating this decentralized community driven strategy for onboarding people on the platform and then they have a lot of novel ideas for how to use use the platform and so yeah i thought it was really interesting and i think in the future there's also other projects that want to use that similar functionality and so in the past it's been deemed like a token created registry so you can see it being used for different communities to decide okay what types of projects they should work on what projects they should invest in who should be onboarding to their community and so we're thinking about ways to kind of abstract that in a way that other people can use it as well yeah i think it's interesting because i know like paul nikki jeremy um you have all kind of maybe maybe not hand selected as maybe not the correct word here but like gone through a very manual process of deciding who is part of i am sound or part of catalog works um which is i guess on the other end of the spectrum of what mirror is doing with this like fully community driven approach to onboarding creators um i'm kind of curious about yeah how paul nikki and jeremy how you all go through the idea of selecting creators to go into i am sound or into catalog works um and yeah whether or not there is like this path of maybe a community of your version of um i don't know kind of collecting these communities or collecting these groups of creators together um based on the community input yeah um so right now it is somewhat selective like we reach out to each artist individually but that's certainly not where we want to be going forward it's mostly due to the nature of music being a bit more scrutinized when it comes to things like copyright and to avoid any kind of issues with major labels breathing down our necks we wanted to make sure that we're doing this the right way and as we sort of build out more features on the platform that allow for more discovery and for more like i can support more creators uh we're definitely looking to open our doors more um we're also big fans of how mir is going about their onboarding process and being a platform that is slowly working towards uh becoming community owned we certainly see the value in having those community picks and so not for this upcoming drop but the one after that uh look out for something that is a bit more curated by the community and more more of that going forward um you know for for i'm sound i i think unlike mirror and cadillac you know we're we're not a platform you know we're a company that's essentially working with zora just kind of helping shepherd i think especially through the music and art worlds as they are now and i think for us you know it's interesting because obviously our first exhibit was definitely one that was curated and it was you know it's a bit more on the more traditional i suppose gatekeeper model that everyone is talking about but i think for us the reason why we were doing it that way is just because you know there's so much content out there now even nfts like you know obviously things have blown up so much more in the past couple months or so that we wanted to be able to group together folks in order to um you know to be able to make a statement together and i think for us you know our for we're at the beginning of this we're working with so many musicians who you know didn't know what an nft was didn't know anything about zora and you know we had to spend a lot of time kind of onboarding them and telling them about it and really kind of you know giving them all the all the right information everyone gets really excited once they learn about it but i think that it's it's just the kind of thing where at the beginning we wanted everyone to be able to uh what be able to kind of enter this world together and tell the story together because right now i feel like there's quite a lot of folks if you if you just drop an nft out there unless you have like a massive social following it definitely can be a little bit hard to get noticed so i think for us it wasn't necessarily uh us trying to cut anyone out i think for us was just like fine finding a group of artists to make that first step forward uh and then once from there you know for for now we're we're working with zoro on helping on board a ton of artists because i think we're super excited about the democratization and you know what this can mean for artists in in the future that aren't coming in with a co-sign from some you know giant company or a co-sign from another influencer or something like that yeah definitely i think there's this um yeah there's this incredible work that you've all done uh kind of bringing these artists into the spotlight uh with that exhibition um one of the things i was kind of curious about as you were kind of onboarding these creators and bringing them into the space was like maybe some of the issues that you found uh introducing these independent creators that may not have had any previous crypto experience um and how you approach that conversation with them um i mean i think for the people that we brought on you know some of them were visual artists that we represent that you know had been interested in doing something in the space because maybe they'd lost out on work especially last year um due to covid and you know i think with other artists i think they were just sort of um nervous about how it would be the response i think that you know that's across the board with any artist just how it would be received and i felt like when we announced our project it would just sort of hit when they were like grimes was doing hers and there was like a huge sort of big ticket um projects that were that were just sort of going up and i think that a lot of artists were kind of just worried whether they were going to make any money or whether you know they were losing sight into really why why the ethos are why paul and i wanted to do this project but i think overall people were just excited because it was a way for them to express art that they you know may have had on their desktop for for a couple of years or you know may have been in in um something that they wanted to do or experience so i think that it was it really ran the gamut but um i think most of them were were excited but just also just quite nervous about just entering into the space yeah i mean it's definitely a brand new world out there with these very weird possibilities that have kind of been popping up like we've been seeing for example with what mirror is doing what catalog is doing like these are all brand new ideas of what platforms can be it gets very confusing i think it's been amazing having youtube and your team kind of help bring these creators into that world um had a couple of questions that pop up in this chat um basically actually just website links i guess we should quickly post those in there um we can throw those in paul nikki sound website was just oh i am sound of zorda coz our gallery um do you have a url for time sound proper oh oh yeah it's just authored and there it says imsan.com oh that's easy easy okay um yeah i guess as you two have kind of brought these creators into that space um there are like there are these like platforms like catalog works um which are like which is doing this incredible job of making this basically record store um online have any of the artists that you're working with kind of been looking at that kind of model with that platform or is there anything that intrigues them outside of just the nfts by themselves um they're getting interesting yeah i mean i oh i think just uh for the musicians that we work with we've been telling everyone about catalogs i think catalog for sure definitely represents like the next step in nfts and you know i think right now it's it's very much wild west and everyone is kind of writing the rules as we go along um i i think that you know we had we did have some issues with some of the musicians on our exhibit just because um you know they some of them had publishing deals some of them have record deals and it definitely got a little hairy here and there as we're trying to negotiate various things you know i the entertainment industry laws have not anywhere near caught up to technology so uh it's definitely a lot to untangle but you know i i think it's something that at the very least represents like you know a a next step and something to at least kind of challenge the status quo of what's going on in the music industry i think that you know especially with nikki and i's background coming from the more traditional music industry uh you know it's always been the you know major labels are almost the definition of gatekeeper models um you know like they're they kind of hand pick who they think are going to be the best ones that they think can make the most money and sell the most records and you know that's that's what they do but there was never really a way for artists to monetize beyond that unless you have you know there's not until just recently the last few years with obviously like you know social media and all that kind of stuff but i think that it makes sense that now that there's another way for fans of artists to be able to to be able to gain access to new fans and not just have to still stick to spotify still stick to itunes all that kind of stuff um i think everyone that we've talked to has been wanting to get introduced to jeremy and has been wanting to at least find out more information yeah i think there's also another new model that's been pretty exciting coming out of mirror which is the the crowdfunding model um patrick mcgill let me speak a little bit on that but the general idea is basically allowing the communities of these creators to help fund new projects in a way to kind of help bootstrap them into this own independent world without having to rely on basically labels or these massive spotify deals in order to put their works out there yeah yeah so somebody described it as patronage plus model where it's basically you have two components one is the patronage side where there's in the past have been platforms like patreon or even during the renaissance they had like guilds and actual like very formalized patronage models where they would just pay people and yeah it wouldn't necessarily guess it was like a more like yeah in the past is like a salary but nowadays it's more so hey we'll pay you this thing just because there's no other really great way to monetize and so getting the thing that wasn't great about that was that yeah the supporters didn't really have a way to kind of show that show their support and have a way to also share in the upside as well and so that's kind of where the plus part of this model comes in and so just as a quick overview of how the mirror crowdfund works so the yes you basically get to fund a project any sort of creative project like today we're focused on writers but in the future we hope to be able to help people fund any sort of creative project whether it's music documentary or anything of that nature and yeah once you you start the crowdfund if anybody that anybody that has an ethereum address can participate so it's global and permissionless as opposed to being required to be in some sort of jurisdiction say in the u.s or in europe or being accredited investor so it's kind of one way it's different from from existing like crowdfunding platforms and then also whenever you connect your wallet and you send e to the crowdfund contract in return you receive an erc20 token and that basically gives you like fractional ownership over whatever project it comes out of the crowdfund and so right now we're adding the ability to link the first iteration was you have one nfte which was an essay linked to the crowdfund and then the sales of the nft float to this crowdfund contract and anybody that has an erc20 they get they can redeem their erc20s for proportional share of the eth but then in the future we would like to think kind of the next wave is instead of these one-off nft drops how do we allow people to kind of create an entire business where you're linking multiple nfts to this one crowdfund contract and i'm sure we can talk about it later at some other point but that's kind of where we see it going and how we see the crowdfunding fitting into kind of future models yeah i mean i think there's this very exciting new world where there's you can almost think of it as like erecting a statue in a public square where everyone's kind of funds or like value can kind of accrue to this one spot to fund this brand new project that everyone gets to enjoy later um it's interesting i think because there's this model that's kind of thrown around with nfts that people call the one true found model which is it just takes one found for a creator with nfts to allow them to support them um as long as the creator has one fan there's one fan that would be willing to buy that nft off of them what's interesting with the crowdfunding models it actually breaks that down back into the other routes which is as many fans that would like to support the artist can in whatever way they're able to so you don't necessarily need to be a like very wealthy individual to help fund these massive projects instead what you can do is just like dedicate however much you're willing to to help make these projects a reality um i think it gets very exciting this idea of this community fundraising to make these artists be able to create whatever they'd like to i'm curious yeah paul or nikki if you're able to kind of extend on the idea of these like these crowdfunded approaches to funding projects as opposed to the original i am sound drop for example which was you know one fan being able to own the nfts um the idea of these artists communities perhaps being able to all own the nft together um by being these co-sponsors so to speak of these projects yeah i mean i think there's one project uh from our first exhibit that i think taps into this model a little bit um you know with whoopi um he created a ios game called rhythm skate that he released as an nft on the first week of our exhibit and you know as far as i know it was the first ios game released by nft you know i think everyone who bid on it was uh was able to or is about to be able to get access through test flight um and it was a really interesting experiment on how to release something like that um not just kind of thinking of nfts in a completely different manner which i loved it's not you know obviously i think a lot of us think of nfp so the whole like digital certificate authenticity and having one owner but i think what we really thought about it in a completely different model um you know i know that him and dee were brainstorming a ton about like how how do you apply technology like that into an interactive medium like ios games um and especially it's something where you know it's it's it would be an independent creator it's him and a couple of friends have been working on this game for months and months and months and being able to release as an nft not only gives him such a democratic access to uh fans and people who want to play it but you know uh he's able to fund uh this work i mean he has to hire animators to be able to help him he has to hire people to do it and being able to release it as an nft gives uh people who uh i i think it's kind of a combination of what you guys are saying where it's not just like the one band to have hopefully a bunch of money who want to help could support the creators but also the other fans who it's a combination of both where he was able to get a number of high bids which was great but then also one to just kind of put in a few here and there and to in order to kind of add more liquidity to his energy and it's great he's you know i think he's been really happy with it it's just kind of the beginning of of how to be able to think of nfts in a completely different angle which which to us that's the most exciting thing i think that right now everyone's been thinking about entities as it relates to art um and it relates to a lot of like traditional media and i think it can really flip a lot of that like you know like with publishing and music flip it on its head completely but i think that there's a lot of ways um to integrate nfts into an integers that we haven't even remotely thought of which is i think that's why we're all really excited to be here at like ground zero of uh of all this entities that's happening yeah it really is like a brand new digital canvas to kind of be working off of like an entirely new medium for creators to be playing around with it's been amazing just to listen to creators kind of come to the realizations of all the things that are possible um with just nfts as the base unit and then anything else that you can build on top of that um there for example there's this group um made by somebody trevor mcfredre's this token called the friends with benefits token which kind of did this exclusive access into a community chat room basically um which is very very exciting but because it allowed was i need to kind of be a member of this this group um but by just holding on to it holding on to one of the tokens um i think whoopi did something really magical with the ios game because it didn't necessarily matter how much you bid into that game as long as you put something up um to support the artist it was it was a tool that you're able to download from um i think yeah there's a lot of really cool features here with the community curation and community creation um that we're just starting to see happen um yeah i'm curious jeremy if you had any thoughts on yeah how that kind of crowdfunding model works in catalog or if there's a future for that there certainly uh yeah i think mira has been really great about blazing these types of trails and we have a lot to learn from from those early from those early models it's absolutely something that we're interested in adopting the concept of i mean record labels today are more or less providing that as a service obviously providing lots of other things too but one of those things that they're offering is you know fronting money to an artist for um for them to record an album or produce some some body of work and i think there is a really interesting opportunity where uh we can start to explore you know rather than just being a single organization a combined effort from other many organizations or individuals or some combination of those that is able to back artists in new ways and share the value you know from what they're sort of finding the artist with and what the artist is is creating in return um so yeah it's definitely something that we're interested in supporting a lot of things that we're trying to sort right now so it's kind of just choosing once one foot out putting one foot in front in front of the other and choosing the right thing at the right time um but yes i think there like there is a really i always tell people if i could have invested in my sound club like i said i'd be very well off right now and i think everyone probably feels more or less the same um and and what's really interesting about nfts and and and specifically with music is it is a sort of proof of culture it's you can quite literally say i supported this you know however many years before everyone else caught on to this thing and not only that but you can also share in the upside alongside the the artists and creators that you are supporting um you know buying one of these things is really the most direct form of patronage that you can have with with an artist that that you're supporting and um it really does unlock a whole new world of opportunity for both the fan and the artist themselves yeah we've actually um in a lot of our conversations with independent artists you know kind of explaining nfts to them and kind of how they can really implement it in you know into with the traditional album cycle recording an album into everything on the music side um you know we've had a few artists who are really excited about the possibility of um of completely funding an album on nfts of you know because you can make an nft of your demos and then sell that and then it's exactly what jeremy was saying is you know you're asking for your fans to not only um not only invest in you but it's uh it's really a it's something where everyone can win together because imagine if the song that you that you release all of a sudden blows up and then the person who has the nft for that original demo they gain a ton of value too and i think you know obviously that's not going to happen every time but i think it's it's a really interesting way of of trying to uh to crowdfund things in a more traditional industry that's not just someone handing over money and it's like you get one thing and that's it like the whole point of all this is that yes like you know there is there are payments happening there's monetization but it's not like it ends at that transaction there is so much more that can happen um in hopefully the years to come for the value of the nft for the value of the campaign being seen as a trailblazer in the music industry i think the one thing i've really loved about you know the crypto community and the nft community that everyone they a lot of the people that are buying these nfts now are really rewarding creators who are taking a risk and they're rewarding people who are you know are kind of just diving in head first um you know i i think that a lot of people buying stuff now of course they might be speculating on value but it's also it's it's a it's a dash of that but also with being able to be like you know what like i respect you for taking a risk and you're selling your rights with this nft or you are remixing this or i don't know there's i've seen a lot of really interesting proposals out there for nfts and um it's a really great community out there that is um that is rewarding people for being bold um and i think that's great because that all that really i think encourages artists to take that risk um and it just it keeps people from being too conservative with um with the growth of their careers yes that's one of the things that excites me so much not just with catalog but with all of this is that specifically to music the incentives right now is that artists are making music that will get them i mean a lot of artists are are making music that will get them the most streams it's it's set up the system is currently set up so that what whoever makes the most played song is going to be able to make the most money from that and so in order to put food on the table or keep a roof above their heads artists are quite literally being pushed towards making music that is more digestible and agreeable with the public and that's not how i want music to be made i want artists to be able to follow their creative passions and their vision and and to make stuff that that's weird and different and that that's the kind of music that push that pushes music forward that that takes us into new places that never existed before and i for one want to live in our in a world where artists truly can follow their creative passions and are not forced into you know doing things that that they might not want to do like this doesn't necessarily solve you know artists having to use social media but you know instead of having to offer like a patreon sort of subscription or you know doing live streams on twitch all the time which artists may or may not want to do um this truly does allow musicians there gets us closer to at least allowing musicians to focus on the thing that they love which is making music and like tyson said earlier i think it really just takes that one true fan that one believer in what you made to for it to have value it's no longer you don't need millions of streams for that song to be considered a hit and some of the you know the best music that i've ever listened to some of the most powerful albums that that have had an impact on my life aren't something that i listen to frequently it's it's something that i access in those moments um so yeah it really does flip the script on that on that side too yeah i think you touched on something there um i think it's pretty interesting this idea of like not necessarily having to model your your work around what's going to get you the most spotify streams but really modeling your work around your community um and what's something that your community would be most interested in um i i yeah i'd be curious to know paul or nikki what kind of like i guess you've kind of worked with artists on building their communities and helping them kind of foster that relationship with their fans um do you see a future where that kind of changes a little bit with this new model of um being able to like directly have your fans crowdfund and form that cyclic relationship with one another where they're able to help curate and then also help boost that that media themselves because they're kind of hard to understand it as well yeah i think so i i mean i think what we've always expressed to uh musicians that we've worked with is the the most important thing to us i always say is like it's not necessarily like the the breadth of fans is the depth of fans like you want to be able to have fans who believe in you and will they follow you on social media they buy everything you put out they go to all of your shows like having you know a hundred of those fans it is worth more than a thousand fans who just kind of like listen to you on a spotify playlist as it pops up like you it's those kinds of people that really reward a career and allow um you know allow artists to be able to actually make a living from making their art uh and i i think that this is like a natural extension of that um and um yeah i mean i think i think that's that's mainly yeah this is this is just kind of an another step to be able to um to be able to work with uh you know maybe a smaller fan base but a more passionate one and one where everyone can grow together yeah sorry nikki no i was just gonna say that um you know i think that we've uh over the history of i'm sam released artists that have been kind of obscure but then also just being quite mainstream and you know i think that you know there's always an album that happens every year that you're like why did nobody buy this album or how come you've never heard of this album it got completely lost because it didn't get written about on pitchfork or any of these other blogs and you know even as fast as you know as a fan of music i miss stuff and i think that nfts allow artists to have you know a real direct to consumer relationship where you can really be involved with your fan base and you know i think that that is going to alleviate as we're all talking about a lot of stress i think with musicians that you know they have to get on new music friday or they have to you know do do the dance at apple to get playlisted i mean i think it just will liberate people to going back to being free and making music and putting up online um and just not having those sort of like other other aspects involved which i think is so exciting um you know especially for for musicians who maybe have been making making music for you know x amount of years and brand new musicians um who are just starting out in their career i mean you don't know how many musicians have to go to radio stations and play and shake hands and kiss babies and all that kind of stuff and you know that's just kind of for a long time that's just the game you have to play um and i just love that this is just kind of changing the rules of the game i mean of course like they're they're it's never going to completely go away but anything that you know democratizes um access to uh essentially a viable career for artists is something that nikki and i support yeah and i think also to that note like you know there's a tradition now with you know rollout of eps and albums you know it has to be three to four to six months to be able to get placement um on these on these streaming platforms also to get press and i think now it's just it really is like hand to mouth you can just make something you know mix and master it and put it up online you don't have to have this lag and you know if it connects it connects but as as we're all seeing it you know if there is a rabid fan um or a fan base that once wants this stuff and can just purchase it immediately then that just seems to make the most sense um without having to do so much leg work on on an artist's behalf yeah definitely and then patrick how about in the like the traditional writing publishing world you noticed a bit of a change there as well with the crowdfunding that you're doing on mirror yeah and so i think it's interesting because with a lot of what we're doing it's less like say like random house or penguin books and more so these independent creators just because the coordination costs are a lot lower instead of having to talk to the manager and the manager's manager you just talk to one person and they get to decide and yeah and a lot of these independent writers they have their own newsletter whether on sub stack or through their own platform and yeah it's it's a lot simpler to to go to them and they have the freedom to do that and i think that that's kind of where this type of change is going to happen first these independent creators that are yeah they just have the flexibility they're doing these projects and something that we're really interested in is is how do we create these crypto native organizations a lot of people are know them as dallas and so how do we how do we make it so that people can have the benefits of being independent such as working when they want where they want on what they want but also have the benefits of working with a group of people where it's like diversified revenue sources the camaraderie of working with people just like the sense of community and yeah not having to to feel like you have to be producing something constantly and get burned out that way and so thinking a lot about that and trying to focus more on the independent creators as opposed to larger publishers for now yeah i think there's an interesting idea there where you kind of kind of have this future of creative houses that form an organization together for example something like i am sound where the the shared revenue or a portion of that shared revenue that each creator is making can go back into the total pool of everyone else um which does kind of like take the stress off having to actively be creating all the time for your community um yeah i think there's a there's a pretty interesting future there where groups of artists can kind of work together as collectives um i know with i am sound without exhibition there's some oh well i guess the the baseball is using that that cell on share mechanism in the zora protocol to basically have iom sound the the organization take a cut of that for school um but yeah there's this cool future um where you can actually also have that perpetual equity being shared among all of the artists by just having a tokenized portion basically of that of that equity over time um yeah it kind of gets very interesting when you think about the future of collaboration or working together with other artists in that sense um yeah with uh with catalog jeremy i don't know if you've maybe had the time yet to go into that product aspect yet but the the idea of the collaborations on catalog especially with something like music industry which is full of collaboration from visual identity to the mixing and producing itself um yeah i'm curious what you think about that on catalog or how you think about it it's a huge unlock for us that we're very eager to to implement it's not something that we ourselves are actively working on at the smart contract level we are in touch with another team who who is making progress on that and could not be more eager to get that uh get that integrated so much like you said so much of music is collaborative whether it's from like the musical standpoint uh or even you know we're talking about artwork or anything else that goes into the process um there's often you know more often than not many hands that go into the production of a piece rather than just a single producer so we have been very limited and what we can support in these early days all the artists that we've been talking to that have previously dropped on catalog are solo independent artists who fully produce their own music as we move forward really really eager to get uh to like if you have um if you have like a group like say a band that is something that you can use as a workaround by just having that band use you know a single wallet where they are minting from that wallet and they all have shared access to it but i think the ideal vision would be every person truly has their own wallet that represents their identity and either using daos or multi-cigs or some other form of sort of shared identity i think would be the best path forward for allowing people to sort of maintain their own um identity and contributions and links to things but also allow people to be to band together and group together um and represent something larger so uh whether that comes in the form of you know daos and multi-cigs being the the mint the minters or fractionalizing nfts and and having you know single nft represented by many erc20s uh similar to how you know right uh bounty works and on the mere platform um there's a lot of options to explore and definitely definitely curious how we can push that forward because like it does unlock so much music that's currently not able to tap into this properly you can always use off-chain solutions for this kind of thing but you know given that these records are permanent i don't want an artist who collaborated on a song 100 years from now 300 years from now to have to be chasing down you know the current the previous owner who who got who yeah this starts to fall apart once you once you go past our own lifetimes yeah definitely and then patrick just uh really quick if you want to give a quick overview of bounty i realized we kind of glossed over that uh maybe useful for people listening in to get a better idea of what that is yeah definitely that was one of the crowd funds we did and that was kind of going to this area of trying to find any sort of creative project and so there's this dao called mint fun and they basically help underrepresented artists to be able to get to the community but then also they cover the gas fees because it can cost anywhere from like 50 to 150 to mint and artwork and so they also wanted to add functionality called a reserve auction and so this is on foundation where you set a minimum price reserve price and if it gets hit then it kicks off a 24-hour timer and if there's a bid in the last 15 minutes it extends the auction another 15 minutes and i wanted to offer that functionality for the different artists in mint fun and so they decided to use mirror to do a crowdfund and raise some money so they could hire a solidity engineer instead they ended up creating a spec or an rfc with what they wanted in the contract and then did the crowdfund where anybody that participated in the crowded fund they could send eth to the crowdfund contract in return receive the rc20 tokens and we also had a feature where if you connected your twitter account through write race then your twitter profile picture would show up in the list of contributors and so you it was cool to see people that had contributed to the crowdfund you can see who they were and they were linked to their twitter identity and yeah i think there's a lot to do there really something i'm interested in exploring is how do we create kind of like a twitch like experience with leaderboards and badges for yeah for people that are funding creative projects and so to what tyson was saying earlier around yeah now instead of having like three monetization options where it's like maybe you have one subscription maybe you have a really expensive thing like live concerts and merch now you can basically just pay whatever you're willing to pay and you can get you can receive some sort of erc20 or nft in return and then we have a way of kind of building this economic graph where you can see all the projects you funded all the people that have funded your projects how much you funded them how much yeah how much these projects ended up making and what was your return and things of that nature i think there's a lot to explore there when when you think about like an economic graph and not just social graphs with likes and chairs and retweets yeah i think there becomes this phenomenon that happens where where early curators can kind of become rewarded for for their curatorial prowess um so you can imagine a world where for example i am sound finds a soon-to-be very large artist before before they become huge um and by by actively funding that artist or by actively supporting that artist they they would see a some sort of return for for helping them in that world uh what also happens is a secondary effect there is the value of the identity of i am sound kind of increases over time oh i still realize just because they are iterating um just put words in your story paul and mickey um but there's this idea of like because everything is on chain is like audible you can kind of go back over the history of what what actions people have been supporting and what people have supported in general to see kind of where their tastes lie and what they're interested in which gets very interesting yeah i mean you know i i'm not going to pretend to be the most knowledgeable about the technical side of this you know i think that this is something that we're learning more and more about every day and you know especially learning from people like you guys who are so knowledgeable on the tech side and also have a foot in on the cultural space um you know we're coming in from the side of creators and the side of artists and people who see the value in this and kind of see how this can help help them just in you know every aspect of their careers but definitely you know i i'm just learning just being here and you know wheels are turning now so maybe we'll uh come up with some core projects just from this chat awesome and then just had like probably one more question before i turn it over and see there's some questions in this chat that i was gonna address um but from maybe each of you what's the thing that's most exciting you so far in this space and what kind of future are you most looking forward to with nfts in general uh maybe paul we'll start with you um cool yeah i mean i think for for me what's what's been the most exciting um which i know i know it's been covered before but i think that there's there are so many incredible artists um you know not not just on the musician side even though that's kind of where we come from you know we work a lot in digital art you know we manage a bunch of visual artists who create incredible art for album covers and music videos and all that kind of stuff and i think there's so many really talented people out there who make incredible art but have never been able to find a real way to monetize that and actually earn a living like the only way you could get you can make money for if you get hired by someone to create work for a brand or a musician or something like that which is you know there's a lot of people who have made incredible careers from that but it's a shame that the only way that you could really get rewarded for your work as an artist that's just as comfortable as you know as you know traditional artists out there is to be able to is to go through someone else and i think this is the first time that they're able to properly um actually earn earn a living directly from people who support them and think their art is incredible and i think it's really opened up the um really opened this up for creators to not have to think about who am i making this for but they could think about i just want to make art for the sake of making art and i can find people to um to support me because you know of course like technically they could have you know sold jpegs you know it's everyone's always talking about talking about that but it's like you know that's that's wasn't really a viable market before and now there's a there's such a real way of doing that that um you know we've talked to so many digital artists who are just really excited to be able to find uh find a way to cut out middlemen and just sell directly to their fans and um and not have to be accountable to you know someone standing over their shoulder giving them notes on everything yeah i mean i think um you know conversations that we've had with artists um who are wanting to get into the nft world whether they're super large or you know are kind of independent but have their own brand just different ideas and especially using zora's protocol of how they can create their own version of what these nft platforms look like you know i think with our exhibition people were kind of blown away with how it looked and you know especially you know i think when we announced it we had so so many people reach out to us just asking us questions but i think that i'm really interested to see how this affects live um how this you know how this is going to affect communities for larger artists and you know fan clubs i think there's so many interesting things that musicians who are brands in their own right um can kind of use nfts to really expand their platform and their audience so i'm just interested to see even the conversations that paul and i are having but you know other artists that are dropping stuff now just where we're going to be in six months time and what this means for you know especially for us in the music world um what this means for the for that space in general definitely yeah i think the live experience is going to become very very interesting as things start to open up again something that comes to mind really quick was uh the artist or the dj's disclosure um just recently minted a a perpetual ticket to all of their live shows um as an nft which i thought was a very interesting unique way of of having this this canvas to work with um i i think there's all sorts of new territory to be explored um past past the pandemic world so to speak yeah here we go with that i think i mean out two artists that were going to be involved in our project both wanted to do live shows so it would just be a private zoom length and you know both were stopped and doing so by management and agents so i'm just interested to see how this sort of levels out because i think it's going to take a large artist to really do that to show the way or you know depending on um or a smaller artist but i'm just sort of i'm fascinated because i think you know i personally miss live music all during 2020 and you know i can't wait for it to come back but i also have been enjoying some of the live stream platforms and you know would want to see how that's going to change um because it still feels quite personal some of those um you know the experiences that i've had yeah definitely um patrick i know you had a very very incredible blog post when you were just joining mirror um about nfts maybe you want to fill us in a little bit on where you see the future going there yeah thank you yeah it was funny because i actually was working at a defense startup decentralized finance and yeah i got kind of jaded with the experience because a lot of our yeah a lot of it was just around speculating on tokens and that wasn't really why i got into crypto it was more so around this idea of permissionlessness and allowing people to participate and have ownership in kind of the value that they're creating but yeah when i was there i it was kind of a cynical experience that i had and so over the past few months i'll try and decide what to do got really interested in the creator of economy and building tools for people to go independent and make a living writing or creating art or music etc and then about two months ago i read the zora blog post on thecryptomedia.wtf site and that really shifted my thinking around and it combined my interest in creator economy but also crypto and it kind of showed me a way that yeah you can actually combine the two and yeah just really painted a picture of the future and to that point nfts were really framed as just art but i think really good thing that that blog post did was it framed it as any sort of arbitrary digital media file and the other really interesting thing was basically tying together digital media with a market for it and like creating the mechanic of ownership and allowing people to bid on it and i think that the really cool thing was that it was technically it's not simple but like the mental framework for thinking about and explaining it to people is actually quite simple you say okay you basically meant this nft it goes it's like a file you store it on the blockchain and then people can bid for it and then the creator decides who's yeah who can who they're gonna accept the bid from and people understand that there's different marketplaces and stuff that's similar to that and so i think that once i saw that i was like oh yeah this this makes a ton of sense i think that people are gonna understand this and yeah that really got me back into the space and someone i used to work with my previous company was at mirror as the cto and ended up talking to him and joining mirror and yeah it's just been a wild ride the last few months have been pretty crazy a bunch of friends just asking about nfts and it just seems like yeah there's definitely ups and downs and the thing i'm most excited about going forward is what do the crypto native organizations look like and so instead of having to create a stripe stripe account and create a delaware c corp and set up a bank account and do all this stuff how can you create an entire organization just deploying a smart contract with an ethereum address i think it's going to take some time but i think the thing is going to start with independent creators because like i said earlier just coordination costs are lower they have more flexibility they're willing to to experiment a bit and so i think that's what's cool about people like zora and hopefully amir we can enable that future where people can really just own more of their work and also allow their community to partake in the upside as well yeah that's amazing um for anyone who's listening in you should definitely go check out patrick's blog post by the way um it's a great read for sure um and then yeah jeremy you want to round us out with where you see the future of energy is going and what's exciting you i mean the future holds so much i think it's really possible to fully predict exactly where everything is going to go i'm sure there's going to be all kinds of use cases that pop up that none of us could even dream of right now something that really excites me about the space though going forward and that sort of enables that is the openness of all the stuff is the fact that it's permissionless and all the tools that zoro provides are make things extremely easy for developers to just come in and build their own versions of things i don't think even with catalog i don't think it's really a one-size-fits-all model for musicians and some people are looking at it as more of a place for like demos and unreleased work some people want to use it for complete music and that's uploaded everywhere and some people are interested in you know making something a bit more personal and exclusive and sort of locked behind a paywall sort of a thing and that's all really dope i think there's so much room for experimentation the fact that we can think of nfts as these culture legos as these programmable composable assets opens up so many opportunities for anyone to put their own spin on things so while we have our own ideas for how we can make catalog as useful for musicians as possible i'm sure there's dozens of people out there who are cooking up like other really cool spins on these things and you know maybe there's going to be a version of catalog that's like just totally vaporwave themed and like that'd be sick i think they're everyone has the freedom and to to build on this stuff and to make things their own and that's a really powerful shift and we've seen that a lot with defy and it caused this insane explosion with all kinds of new ideas like interlacing with each other and i think we're gonna see the same thing with nfts but what shape it takes uh i think only time will tell yeah i think the future is going to be very very weird as we go forward with this um it's kind of the nature of having something so open and so free to use um yeah i'm also just incredibly excited to see where this takes us um i know we only have a couple of minutes left and andrew and heather i'm not sure we're actually able to bring other people into this um if not we can just kind of answer questions in discord but um maybe if anyone in this room has any questions happy dancing yeah um yeah thanks tyson if anyone in this call wants to pose a question to any of the speakers uh feel free to unmute yourself and turn on your video and just jump in give people a couple minutes just to see everyone on the spot i know no warning uh oh yeah it looks like there aren't any questions from the chat so far so if you want to leave it at that i think this is an awesome call super inspiring and i am excited for how weird it's going gonna get to amazing all right well paul nikki jeremy patrick is awesome having you thanks for your time um yeah we will or at least i'll be in the discord for uh youth global for a while answering any questions if anything pops up but other than that yeah it's great chatting thanks everyone
