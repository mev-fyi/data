hi everyone yeah thank you thank you to everyone for joining us today uh thank you to alex i'm really looking forward to this presentation and give it one more minute let everybody get in here before we kick off i appreciate everyone's patience excited to he to see all of you guys here today i see a couple funny pictures always cats [Music] yeah we still see new people joining i think we can get started i want to keep this as close to the schedule as possible um as i mentioned thank you to everyone joining us today on this fine monday morning this is our first eath online workshop of the week uh really looking forward to what alex has here in store for us today um alex thank you for joining us obviously really looking forward to what you have to present i will let you take it from here uh we will be taking questions at the end so if you want to funnel your questions into the chat we can get to them i will be moderating but alex will be able to pull him out of the chat at any time at the end we'll do a little bit of a q a uh if you can't or if he isn't able to answer your question at the end um you're more than welcome to take a conversation to the discord and follow up there alex floor's all yours thank you look thank you for having me today excited to see everybody here uh looking forward to tell you something probably newer about the protocol and i wanted to start by just quickly introducing myself a lot of you guys might have heard about variable but yeah my name is alex alex salnikov i'm co-founder and head of product at wearable and today i wanted to tell you about the protocol and about why we've made it decentralized and open and open source well probably a lot of you understand the um the the motto behind open and decentralized systems but i wanted to emphasize that once again so uh variable protocol uh let me share the screen real quick so uh yeah at first wearable verbal started uh almost two years ago now we went live on november 2019 uh with the issues with the issuance platform and marketplace so we went with like why don't you guys uh create your own nfts and try to sell them and we will build tools for that and that quickly escalated into the full featured marketplace that you can now see on the wearable.com website uh we do a million dollar of daily gmv more or less and uh it's it's been an exciting journey uh about a year ago we launched the governance token rari and a liquidity mining program that allows uh that allowed everyone who uses the marketplace to basically capitalize on that and to earn governance rate we were distributing 75 000 tokens each week to the buyers of sell and sellers of the marketplace and uh it was it worked incredibly well we are number two marketplace across the ethereum ecosystem and uh i'm i'm proud to present the work of our last six months is the wearable protocol uh basically what we did we we took the infrastructural part behind wearable.com marketplace and created a separate product out of it for you for developers for builders for other people who wanted to create a marketplace because building marketplace for two years we understood that there is a lot of work to be done to actually create a great great experience for the users that's why we tried to simplify this for you and and came up with the wearable protocol so what variable protocol is is this set of tools that uh are there to enable the easiest the easiest uh go-to-market strategy for the new nft project we have a ton of projects already building on protocol wearable.com is one of the projects actually that is working on top of the protocol so it's literally a peer to everyone else who is building on top of protocol 2 we have mint gate cocoa nft beautiful apps that work on the top of the protocol xerion using the protocol in their nft integration on cyber is the platform for displaying your nft nfgs also uses the protocol so in the ballpark a wearable protocol is the multi-chain cross-chain open source decentralized exchange so the set of smart contract and in indexer on top of those smart contracts to make your trade just peer-to-peer trade swap nfts to ethereum and erc20 assets and and vice versa so any player of 721 1155 erc 721 rc1155 air c20 and is is supported to trade through the protocol basically protocol works as an order book exchange where the orders are stored off-chain to make you uh put things on sale for free so you don't need to pay gas prices which are like absolutely insane these days for most of the people who trade nfts that are not crypto punk that don't cost 50 ease so for every every lower lower segment average nft um like an average check size is a thousand dollars in the nft so paying a hundred dollars for a gas price for for each interaction with the contract is a lot uh so that's why we're using off chain order book basically if you want to put something on on sale you need only to sign a signature uh to sign an order which is just the structured the json structure that is that is stored off chain now when you want to actually execute these orders and so you have a buy order and a sell order uh you're going to the on chain smart contract you put these two signed orders in it and the assets are swapped this is done trustlessly no one is in charge of funds the smart contract verifies both orders and swaps the assets so this is the ballpark of what protocol is in the smart contract for issuance so we provide you the wearable standard smart contract you can also derive a smart contract from wearable collection to have your own collection and uh the best part about this minting contracts is that wearable protocols variable protocol supports lazy minting so you can mint nfgs for free without gas price you derive the gas price to the buyer when the buyer buys an item and in terms of the protocol in words of the protocol that happens when two orders are matched on chain the item is created only then so it's like a derived minting uh and the gas price is is paid by the person who executes these uh we support ethereum also also we support um polygon test net and the polygon mainnet is the latest stages of development we're literally deploying this uh behind the scenes this this week and oh and the flow flow is uh in the development under active development support of the flow blockchain you won't be able to access the flow blockchain on this hackathon unfortunately and uh and union service the thing that would combine all of these blockchains together so they work not as separate like indexers but only but as one indexer is also in the development so if you want to build the cross chain marketplace that's also like really great for you uh some features yes again i i've counted the main ones it's a lazy minting minting contract and exchange contract the best part about exchange contract is the flexible fee structure so when you create an order and submit that to the protocol you can actually uh set up your own front-end fee so whenever you buy you you you build something on top of the protocol uh your application in is instantly monetizable so you attach your own fees the protocol fees are zero as for now uh the question about the protocol fees is the like open governance question so uh it probably will be uh down solved down the road for now it's zero we expect the fees to be like a union swap level financial level asset fees so zero point uh zero point something uh that that has that leaves you plenty of room to monetize for example the wearable com as an application takes uh five percent fees and uh i know other competitors uh in the space take up to 20 uh in fees and this is this is about the exchange so again uh monetizable monetizable fee monetizable apps on top of the protocol is a very much requested feature we've built that in also protocol supports uh split royalties split payments collaborations multiple creators it's all basically all sorts of splits everywhere uh completely like a customizable way of splitting of splitting payments so uh any any just um use cases that wants to include multi-creator multi-user multi buyer everything like that is supported uh you can check let me let me check if i forgot something yeah we support uh all sorts of royalties too and so there is an external royalty registry in which every uh collection holder every collection owner can register their own fees for the collection their own roles is for the collection so that makes the protocol a perfect place for the secondary market and i wanted to tell a little bit more about secondary markets so right now wearable protocol allows you to query orders both from uh wearable uh and openc so you can literally build a front-end marketplace that would have all the supply available for on on on both marketplaces for your front end you won't be able to take fees for the openc orders but you might you might might add them to the variable orders so just building an open open marketplace for i don't know for it just literally makes you if you want to build them for example the tool that trades top 10 collections 10k collections that are active today uh on on the big main page you can do that on top of the protocol easily because it allows you to get all the supply and just add your own fees on top and and well uh we're good to go uh yeah i said polygon moon beam flow or in the works uh as for the um as for for the layer two solutions we're actively looking there protocol is under active development that's one of the important parts and i'm saying that it's not like breaking uh we make all the changes backward compatible but i'm saying that that there are there are constantly new features added and there is very active discord if you go to the discord we can write like feature requests things like that and this will be added tailored to you specifically it's not something that is already done in sealed and you like take it a little bit no it's under active development if you need anything uh we are happy to add this for you um yep uh i counted the the live use cases already and this is all great oh yeah uh almost almost forgot this so the app mining program app mining program is is live basically if you build an app on top of the protocol and your app generates volume on the protocol you are entitled to the portion of the weekly rari rewards basically uh you earn ownership in the contract by executing on the contract uh you can check the more detailed uh information on our on our discord and there are a couple links i believe so yeah uh if you bring if you bring liquidity to the protocol you earn an ownership over that um yep so start building today and i will just double down on this you can check the documentation and uh and our github so documentation leads you to the docs.wearable.com there is this simple protocol flow explanation of how it is actually uh built just top level uh and there are some tutorials so this tutorials and starter app are very important links for you it will be super super uh helpful it's done by our community so again i think this is actually the starter app is one of the best things you can find again you can find it by clicking documentation and starter up on the left side uh what else what else yeah over from the latest hackathons that we already done uh there is an addition in the space it's the sdk that allows you to much more easily create your um create orders create items lazy minted items fill orders all things like that uh so you can click this button in the right in the right top corner that takes you on the github and on the github there is protocol contracts protocol indexer and protocol sdk this three rape repositories available for you repositories available for you yep so protocol ethereum sdk has examples uh and some some documentation about how it actually works um this is fine there is also somewhere there was the custom [Music] yep so i can find it right now i'll send you all the links in afterwards um yeah basically the yep there is this special repo for all the issues and uh and the demo app yeah i think this is the one there was a demo app with the sdk oh yeah here it is it's a protocol example you can find that in tutorials uh in tutorials protocol example link yeah it's done by our cto basically using sdk configure sdk create lazy mint item sell orders buy order and get nfts from your current wallet uh yep i almost overlooked uh and i wanted to come back really quick on the indexer part so the indexer uh when you when you're building an adapt on the ethereum uh there are basically like two ways to do that the first one is directly interacting with the smart contract you have smart contract and that's only it you don't have any server you don't have any backend uh you don't want to interact you just want to interact directly with the with the smart contract so when you're dealing with nfts it's actually almost impossible to interact directly with smart contracts because you need an index you need an understanding of which nfts belong to whom which nfts do you want to create orders for which nfts do you want to list when which nfts do you want to query that's why there is this indexer that is listens to blockchain to ethereum blockchain and keeps track of everything every nft is uh you can query like all my nfts by address by collection by owner by creator uh all things like that it's done by the indexer wearable indexer is the is the first opens completely open sourced here in the nft space so there is like out of the alternatives there is the graph but the graph can't work with all the erc721 contracts so the graph is like probably good only when you are dealing with only one collection so again if you want to if you want to work with a lot of nfts uh you need an indexer and indexer also stores orders so it's an essential part of the of the variable uh of the wearable contract so i also skipped one link that you will obviously need so in this documentation uh in this documentation for the wearable contract um you can scroll a little bit down and find this api reference so api reference is the open api for the protocol it contains all of the all of the calls api calls that you could possibly have wanted to do under this section and you can explore this and and call them so the place where you want to start is nft order item controller uh sorry for the names it's going to be rewired in a while but basically this this name means a controller that is uh this controller is aware about nfts and about orders so basically uh this this call call from this controller would give you nft itself and the best order and the metadata i have i have a call created somewhere here so yeah uh basically let's ch let's take an example i want to get uh nft order by item uh i want to it is basically like getting an item so as you can see uh this is the url to to call it and then the response it will return me the token id contract unlockable on all the things royalties owners basically all the things that we know about an item so i've assembled the small call here i added just uh so it's ethereum dash api.wearable.org v0.1 nft order slash items and here goes the item id and then there is an optional parameter include metadata and it returns the the item with metadata we can see id contract token id unlockable creators creators might be multiple that's why there is an array supply laser supply oh yeah lazy supply is zero so that's not a lazy item uh owners owners if that's 11 55 you'll see multiple owners here multiple royalties again we have a 10 to somebody uh date um we have the metadata name description attributes all is here image image meta and we also have the order the best order best beat order and best we don't have best sell order here so best build order basically represents the best beat for this item we are almost out of the time so i'll stop here and let's open up the floor for questions uh we do not plan support for tron so far uh but i it's evm compatible so it can be deployed by just manually deploying contracts and indexer setting all that up you can create a support for throne for the protocol uh the question from citizens uh is it open source indexer api as the tools for query the smart contract i mean to get creation of the original nfts so you want to use indexer to query all the things that happened in the blockchain if you want something to execute something in the blockchain you need to call the smart contract directly so imagine i want to mint an item i'm minting an item in the contract and it gets picked up by the indexer but if i want to create a lazy minted item i need to direct that to the indexer first because that's how lazy mean that items are created uh hey alex what are the thoughts in the nft marketplace's space specifically competitors like openc super air foundation uh this call is meant to be more technical uh so i'm i don't think uh this is the right place to discuss like this competitiveness um i would say that um technically just super rare foundation are unchained completely right so they uh they use auctions that are on chain you interact with the contract directly open c uses off chain order book uh wearable protocol uses off chain order book and as i said already you can query the openc and variable orders uh variable and openc orders from the from the uh indexer so you can actually basically have the liquidity of both by using the protocol and i think that was that was all the questions so if we have if we have more let's bring them in don't miss your opportunity to ask alex what you're thinking but if there are no more questions and you can save them feel free to reach out in discord where the whole team will be present and and able to answer your questions throughout the hack and i wanna i wanna thank everyone for joining us but we'll give it one more minute ask away awesome well if there are no more final questions i want to thank everyone for joining us i want to thank alex for being here on monday morning uh or monday afternoon depending on where you are today um and i want to thank uh the the whole team for making this happen i'm really excited to see variable here again um and i think we're on we're on for a really good hackathon this time thank you everyone um thank you guys for the questions thank you for listening me uh drop me a feedback on discord if you think that i might have expanded something better or that i didn't mention something or that something was unclear i would be glad to hear something that they can make better thank you luke excellent we'll be closing a session right now we have our uh team formation session coming up soon so don't miss that um but we will be closing this zoom session now i appreciate everyone again and look forward to seeing you later thanks alex
