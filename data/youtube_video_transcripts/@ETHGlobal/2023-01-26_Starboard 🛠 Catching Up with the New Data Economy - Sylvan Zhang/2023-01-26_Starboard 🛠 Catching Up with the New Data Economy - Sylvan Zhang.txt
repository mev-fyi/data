foreign [Applause] [Music] network connection problem but um like please just let me know if you guys are not hearing me again right I'll try my best um uh but a very nice to meet everybody my name is Sylvan I work at starboard I'm in the in working on research and product so um today I want to you know just really bring up the topic about the new data economy of course I'm talking about foul coin um I want to talk about what is really unique about this new ecosystem and what's exciting about fvm what are the things that we could potentially do with fbm and how could some of our starboard products help you navigate it through this wonderful ecosystem so a brief introduction about starboard we are a company that focuses on network research Network analytics and also product incubation so on the network analytics side where mostly you know just like trying to help people um answer some of the most important research questions uh providing uh research metrics monitoring dashboards to help users understand the network for product incubation site we are trying to leverage on our experience our our insights into this ecosystem and develop some novel application to help a user better participate in this Novo data economies uh we are a dedicated contributor in the Falcon ecosystem we have been here for over two years now so it's like we we actually started uh starboard shortly after the bobcorn minute has launched a couple things that we have built uh first is the network house dashboard uh it's the most commonly used intelligence dashboard in the following Community I demonstrate or gives people insights of like different aspects uh of this um economy uh which I will give a demo uh later towards the end of the presentation we also have some use case specific research and Tool links and um as some of some of this I have just you know put them in screenshots we have the fvm I explore which I will be giving another introduction as well uh shortly uh it is a feature complete Explorer I offers a smart contract and a code inspection functionalities so I mean it's very easy for you to you know to track the smart contract that you have built and deployed um from the the Falcon the fbm whether it's like fbm test net for now or the uh main Nets in the future uh you can also validate the code that you have submitted to the network um ensure the source code with other people with our uh Explorer we also have the uh the first dashboard so Volume Plus it like a good impact of some of these or some of the details they want to store on the file claim ecosis thank you x-ray Center is for uh people to store those kind of data yeah so a big data exchange is one of the products that we have incubated uh it is a Service Marketplace um that helps people um do deals to store data and look for storage providers uh on the following Network um it's a very interesting and also like Falcon specific uh use case feel free to check it out as well now we also have the space gold Falcon data API that provides you know just like um access to highly highly valuable and composable network intelligence if you want to build something that's a daily driven or uh that takes some type of uh the main agenda today so first first of all why why is the Falcon a Noble data economy what's unique about it uh what like based on the new uh economy how can we interpret uh what additional data does file frame provide and what are some of the potential data driven opportunities when fvm comes online uh Falcon is really leading the exponential growth in web 3 adoption is currently on the largest decentralized data Centric economy in the world it has over 14 exit byte of storage capacity I've already stored all over half of a exabyte of valuable data it connects over 4000 storage providers all around the world and also has over 2 million Network users and from this uh chart you can see that the the adoption for Falcon storage has actually been growing exponentially in the past one year um and Falcon adopts this approach of uh having this really like good data utility um about um like um Import and Export and that's how um developing economy uh can get uh uh can get started and also Kansas deck right so basically uh Vulcan adopt model uh where um they the the people within the network actually towards um AI data services to the external participants to the external users and a exchange for the value that they have generated and stored but as utility is something that's really important right you want to make sure that the utility is always there so that someone always there's a constant demand for that utility and that's why the token will get thank you additional demand um and also within the um the the island called me there's like lots of you know Utility Supply and also uh token circulation uh but what really connects is that um the reputation of the entire network and also the repetition within the network actually matters a lot so in that sense what we actually need is more than you know just like token level uh information we need a service level information and use case level information as well which makes um Falcon like really unique so to to to recap so why is Falcon a great example of a Noble data economy uh it's because it provides a universal utility and in um in this island economy diagram the utility that the entire Island generates is the data services that they Provost and also a unique value proposition of having this kind of provable data and people from outside the world and also inside the island consume like useful Services here and also uh in this economy uh service quality and reputation really matter so far has more data Dimensions than most of the other popular blockchains just to give you a quick example for Bitcoin is mostly just like you know token data cannot do anything I can just like you know have a Bitcoin and transfer them on different addresses if you're a minor you can mine a Bitcoin but that's pretty much it uh for um like the computation driven like smart contract driven uh blockchain such as if you're in Solana or like BMB Chen you have a token data also like use case data because they have actually brought in like real use cases to um these um networks into these ecosystem you start having people who actually have like strong demand for a certain type of use case on top of um the the ethereum or like the Solana or the BMV blockchain uh for filecoin uh it's um actually at you know like even one more layer of data which is like the service level data so Falcon has its own token so it has a token data um with the FV and then also like lots of you know like butane um a contract of buildings actors on Falcon we can you know analyze how people are using filecoin um specific use cases will be brought to Falcon in fact by storage itself is already a use case uh on filecoin and um and what's more is that because the the reputation system really matters within the Falcon ecosystem that's why the service level data can provide additional information and that actually you know like adds a a lot more Downstream use cases as well right like when you have reputation meaning that people are constantly committing uh their resources or services to our certain thing and that helps you like differentiate people um and then you can use all those data to you know to initiate uh new types of use cases which I will get to in a bit so here are just like some examples of data that's available on Falcon you have the token level data you have the use case level data and of course um all these are built in for now uh but uh in the in the future when that VM comes uh um to the main Edge there will be more use cases for fem I'm sorry for following and also here is an example of a service level data so you can actually see oh actually different story providers performed differently based on the service level or like the assume service level agreement with their clients um certain penalties has been has been taken place um like we have active metrics to track whether a storage providers or a client is fulfilling their um supposedly service level agreement if not was the Gap and how can they improve so this is actually something that's very unique to filecoin and could potentially generate lots of new use cases and with fvm there will be like a lot more uh new type of day that gets generated but um I assume like most of you guys have already participated in some type of you know like evm uh a blockchain um engineering so it shouldn't be very uh surprising to you guys um those are just like mostly transaction data metadata actor information which is like smart contract uh information actor source code TV out total information um and also like uh fvm usage and statistics because it's very similar to um what's already available for other blockchains I'll just like you know give a quick um overview of them there you see like transaction data metadata all of these are actually uh the screenshots from our Explorer our fvm export so you can take a look at those um as well later um yeah so this is not online yet but I'm just taking this from from uh the ethereum blockchain but this could be very useful information um as well so address and account information um and we which uh the address and account information can be associated with the uh service level or like the reputation metrics um with the the with Falcon as well right so when you have a storage provider that is like heavily connected with some type of address and that address um you know like constantly adopts some smart contract or invoke invoke some smart contracts and maybe their um some relevance that could be useful as well uh usage and statistics we have a very preliminary usage and statistic page on our X4 as well if you feel free to check it out um there will be like a lot more you know usage statistics um that they're coming up um because it's just like a big topic and more people get ahead on it um yeah so the next part I really want to talk about like how can we leverage Falcon data and and fbm for new business opportunities uh some of them um it's not going to be very surprising to you guys but some of them I think it's like very unique to the file plane economy um so intelligence dashboard this is like not surprising right um there are already lots of uh good dashboards out there um at stock we're trying to do something as well um and very soon I think there will be lots of uh good uh fvm intelligence dashboard uh coming up so but again this is like known a problem I gave that people need need it right people really need it uh and it's very useful so I mean it's a it's a no-brainer it's going to come up uh reputation power application I think this could be something that's very unique to filecoin right because you already have all this uh unique um metrics about uh existing players on Falcon About Storage providers and all of this can be can generate a really like differentiating uh services or applications for example like if you want to do like a lending um based on people's reputation right so we can kind of assume that if you are a storage provider that provides you know better services or if you're committing more resources to their work uh potentially your risk of defaulting or like results you know just running away could be lower than those who have um you know like bad records about fulfilling their service level agreement uh with their clients so that could be a differentiation uh point between like a really good storage provider versus a a a bad storage provider and then what we can do is like we can have like a you know like a like a a D5 pole that adopts the uh repetition metrics and provide different rates to uh storage Fighters with uh you know different uh repetition matches so that is actually you know a smarter way uh of you know whether it's staking or lending money to like storage providers but that's like very unique and then you need a very strong a record of identifying who uh are the better or the more reputable uh miners than the others um token at the intelligence that shouldn't be surprising as well as they're also like very common um among other evm chain Evian compatible chains um adoption analytics this could be um you need to follow me as well because Far Point actually have um lots of like you know storage rooms right so storage is something that you need to file coin and then we can based on uh storage to provide um storage related adoption analytics and and if you if you take a look at like the the ant uh intelligence or like the AFT Market in general you you probably find that that most of the entities have their metadata stored on another source right it could be like through ipfs it could even be just like a random centralized provider and people don't actually check about it but for for Falcon you can have you know like Falcon native um uh nft you can have the empty metadata also store on welfare as well and then you can create like linkage uh between um a 5.0 and the Falcon nft right so that that's something that's like going to be very unique and which means that everything is you know stored or like it's very site on balcony and that that provides I think new value proposition to the market as well um the five yield curve analytics this is also like not very surprising um to most of you uh here I just want to do a quick introduction of some of the resources that starboard provides and how you can better use it with your upcoming hackathon and also like even just build uh build new application based on some of the the problem we provided or somehow like we can help you to make your life easier so I'm gonna switch string yeah so first this is the the Noah Health dashboard that we have created uh basically this gives you a very um like a high level overview of um the valve Point economy you can just like log into to this page and see oh whether new capacity has been onboarded to network uh whether New Deals have been committed um our people actively using it uh what are some potential use cases uh for you know burning PowerPoint um and also how are the the token circulation uh changing right and then for for each of these charts you can just you know click into the sub sections and see the like like a breakdown of things of course you can um you can take screenshots you can view it on our research notebook you can download the csv's provided on this uh on this chart if you want to do like addition analysis so I think I think our Network Health dashboard could become you know a very good um resource for everyone who is like new to the Falcon ecosystem and just wants an overview of you know how uh Falcon network is doing how how it's like you know everyone uh using it um what are some of the like key adoption metrics uh for these uh um there's this uh in that sense I think this really good overview of things foreign oops the fvm Explorer uh this could be more relevant to uh to the crowd here um but basically I think it's like pretty uh intuitive um you you have a search bar that you can just you know search by your your if or Falcon address um and then you have a list of you know the latest involved contract so originally we built this for like a contract for it so that's why a lot of the the focus are more you know heavy a more more prioritized for like contracts you can also view like latest um transactions um here you can see all the contrast that has been deployed to a certain Network and then you can rank them by you know like transactions um like a number of users also like by impact right so so impact meaning that how how many of the other contracts have caught this contract or like how many call has been made by this contract um that's dependent on on other contracts so I I we felt like this could be something that's very useful um if you just click into this contract you can see contract details um internal transaction contrast events but those requires verification as well um you can also see like if people have um you know verified their uh source code with us you can see their uh contrast source code here so also like if you want to share your source code with someone else feel free to just use the code verifier and then it should be very straightforward and also like the transaction this is just like the transaction list you can see um what has happened like what what are the key use cases that people have have have been doing um the final thing is about space scope API right still um as as I'm I mentioned just now this basically API uh provides lots of you know highly valuable uh file coin um network data so you can actually see so the network core is all everything about like the valpoint macro actually um our no Health dashboard uh is using uh space scope data to support all the charts so if you want to you know we create some of the charts feel free to just use the network core dashboard um and then we I mean we like break it out into a different subsections as well if you want to you know check on storage providers um aggregate data and other their reputation metrics um use the storage provider section which gives you you know like their their power rewards talking balance and sectors so six sectors is what I mean by like service level information right you can see oh how many of the sectors are actually being faulted being terminated um and you can use that as you know like a key input to some of the application um or like a reputation driven application that you guys are building and finally um we also provide like a storage deal API so basically it's like you can use any of the deal that's already on Falcon and then you can you can check you can check all the deals that's been made you know by like a client ID by the provider id uh by a specific deal ID and then you can see all the information first of all like whether this do is still alive right is it active as it has it expired or been terminated um and also who has made these deals right so um use this like for example if you want to build like a deal insurance contract you can use this as an input uh feel free to reach out to me I'm I'm just like a Selvin on the Falcon slack um and I can also share my email as well if you guys have any questions regarding uh some of things that I've shared today yeah but that's it I think we still have a few minutes left let's see if anyone has any questions or any additional information I can provide the storage provider space scope API works with high perspect so the storage provider API is actually like you know the entire network so it's not for the test net but again I mean that I think that could be a source of uh data like a like a source of information if you want to build something on hyperspace you also want to like make sure that it works well on mainnet right um so which um like does let's go I'm sorry provider API can give you a more comprehensive view of the existing server providers but not not just you know like four storage providers who are participating on hyperspace I hope that makes sense uh yes yes I will provide all the links uh transacting each other from wallet I don't think that's a in our current scope uh yet but I mean I'd be happy to connect with you in terms of the the request and then see what we can do here thank you so then we're just finishing up in our time so if you have any more questions feel free to share on the Discord on space warp Dash chat or the mentorship channel well thanks everyone enjoy your day yeah thank you thank you guys hope hope this helpful
