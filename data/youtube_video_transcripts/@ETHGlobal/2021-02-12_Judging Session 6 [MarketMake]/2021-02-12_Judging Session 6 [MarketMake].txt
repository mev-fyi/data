okay and we're starting so yeah the first team that we're gonna have in is uh called team fund the restaurants and um i think rochelle is letting them in now and then uh once they're all ready to go we should be we should be able to let them present okay uh song and muhammad do you guys know you got there oh i'm here yeah like a star yep yeah whatever you're ready you said have fun from the restaurant right yep okay um okay i'll show my skin hi everyone my name is sean and i'm a four-star developer i build this application called fondo restaurant which is a dab that allows customers to donate funds to the restaurants so so right now many restaurants are losing revenue because of the payment damage they are they don't have much customer like they used to and they are behind on their rents and also they have to spend more money for cream products such as hand sanitizer and face masks so so the solution is to have a comf funding for the restaurants and customers they can donate eve to the restaurants and restaurant owners can create a post to promote their restaurants then they can also post what they need and it's time for the demo okay so here's the the dap and and you know right now you're seeing the little restaurants where the owner these fundings and let's say you want to create a post so you can request funding if you're the owner so you will click on add restaurant enter the information and then the location of restaurants maybe for customers to visit you and maybe picture your name of the restaurants and how much you need and the descriptions are why you need these fundings and correct them confirm and there it is the restaurant is created and let's say if you're a customer and you want to support the restaurant but first i will change it to the customer's wattage and then select the restaurant we want to donate so donate to drones dinner and then this is how much that the owner needs and then click on donate and enter the amount 15 and then confirm okay so as you can see the amount that this restaurant owner needs even down to 150 and here's the donation now where you can see who donated to this special owner and that's it for this demo i will go back to the slide so in future developments i will implement credit delegation or professional using ave so the restaurant owners can borrow money and maybe the customer can they can earn interest when they deposit funds and i'll also implement gas station network to cover the gas fee and then also allow customers to donate with bitcoin dow or other cryptocurrency instead of just eve and that's it thank you for watching and i will see you next time um yup that's all i got it seems like a very forkable thing in the first place right you could turn this into you could fork this thing like it's specifically being used for restaurants right now but you could fork this into any kind of like patreon style or even like just like a shopping cart page right it's very close to i put a list of things in and someone comes in and pays for those things you've got that patreon limit there the stuff that you uh mentioned at the very end was the most exciting stuff to me like the credit delegation stuff that seems like perfect for this or even just like our diet like the kind of like yield redirection where someone could lock up money in favor of the restaurant and the yield could flow to the restaurant but then they could pull their funds back and maybe by doing that they get some you know like uh cool incentive to come visit the restaurant when things open up right you can have that log on chain and you can audit that they were there good job great great forkable project and something i along the same line i wanted to say um it's missing a very low-hanging fruit which is something for the donor to get some sort of receipt uh from his donation so let's say eventually the pandemic goes away and and restaurants uh can can resume their businesses without basing their uh revenue on the nations and it would be nice that those that were on the bad times get some sort of batch or something or or just they mentioned because right now you can't put your name or anything so something for tracking who has donated seems to be something fundamental this is really nice i also enjoyed um the presentation i think it's really generalizable as austin just mentioned i was wondering whether you maybe you would also want to add at some point or you were thinking of like creating maybe some like more involved incentive mechanisms where people would maybe benefit who are like the first donators maybe they or like somehow projects would maybe show up earlier or not like more prominent on the page or or just some like a kind of curation market type of thing whether this was a consideration um yeah i tried to do like credit dedication but i couldn't get to work yeah well it's only about time for you to get the knowledge for having those more advanced features okay yeah also i was thinking about like doing knowing like like restaurants they can borrow more more money if they have more customers using buying something from their product using like transferring e through the wallets see and and your team is it a party of two or is it only yourself myself okay yeah i i thought i don't know why i thought would i know someone else was confused um so so um hopefully this has been a nice experience uh for you to uh pursue a career on the space oh yeah thank you and to dig into that some more think of a fork think of a new direction to take this look at what you can fork this into and turn this into something new so many times uh i found myself learning in the space just by like making something then making something new and then making a new thing it takes a long time to get traction and keep going and keep building and and this will be a great space for this kind of innovation okay and it's also a great time now to involve be involved with that this kind of crowdfunding donation project now with the corona situation that's really a good spot to be in now with this thanks song yeah thank you everyone awesome um thanks so much uh next up i believe we have another team um by the name awesome pensions um and i believe that is tony who was in the room yeah yes sir so yeah take it away okay uh will you be playing the video for me or i can play it over here it's not a problem um i have a note saying we're playing the video let me just check with rochelle if she's on top of that um one second sorry all right do you are you able to play your video tony yeah i can play it it might might be a bit laggy because uh we've got cold weather and the network is going crazy so got it okay let's give it a try just a quick check should there be video should be there be audio so far something we don't think about until we're replaced by somebody much younger the back-to-back crises layoffs and bills that just need to be paid and age all coming at the same time what are you gonna do tick tocker that's right you are gonna get an awesome pitch yes awesome totally so what's an awesome tension well to help you out let's start with normal pension usually four years in length and if you're lucky five percent return on your 100k part per month if you're lucky if you're late you have to pay 145 000 per month only to get a measly 23 000 per year that's just not awesome awesome pensions we're here to help you out there's more people working in the gig economy not having the ability to save we have three great products a standard class which reduces your pension time down to a mere 20 years our premier class and our defiant class all of which perform better than your standard high street pension with our standard class you simply pay your premium you can upgrade to any of the other two classes and if you don't like the policy you can simply cancel it everything is done on the ethereum blockchain with our standard class you also have the ability to monitor the elapsed time so how much time you've been paying see how full your part is understand your average interest how much money you have left to pay and how many pigments you've made on time so as you keep yourself on track now that's awesome we are awesome pensions okay that's an awesome video awesome page yeah thank you we got to dig into the technical stuff though tell me how it works underneath right what does the contract do so what the contract does is that it's a very straightforward contract it basically allows you to um well this is a gateway pattern so you buy yourself a pension right paying over ethereum and the ui um and then what happens is that it creates a specific policy just for you right and that policy has its own part and that part basically um uses a strategy strategy service that basically tells it here's a here's an investment scheme right you invest in this currency this time uh in this part in off right for this long and then the thing is that it'll come back make it two percent and then keep that compounding for the for the whole period so as soon as you bought it and put the money in it's already started uh earning for you um using the d5 protocols at the back um and basically it uses things one inch um for uh almost one inch for i think it was for currency currency chain link was for pricing one issues for swaps that was it because you have to switch between different different different currencies in of have different earning rates so we have to do the switch for that because r doesn't natively support you know being able to just swap between different currencies and so on is there some dynamic like management of the funds like or do you just set like the policy at the beginning and then it would stay like this or would it change maybe later no the the policy the policy basically we have like a diamond which would pulls right it pulls pulls your policy and then that that basically just gives you the execution thread because um i'm still trying to figure out how we can efficiently do execution threads in in blockchain so that's a bit of a problem for me um and basically what that does is that once the policy gets that it then goes to the strategy service and says hey what's the best thing happening right now right that's going to give me two percent of my money you know as quickly as possible because the goal of the business model is basically to earn two percent per month right on whatever you you put in right ideally if you keep it at that 50 every month by the end of it 20 years later you should be able to earn a nice healthy 5k amounts which means you will definitely be able to retire that's really nice i like that so the strategy is basically set based on the policy then yeah [Music] any other questions i i would i want to like dig into the the said the tech even more you've kind of mentioned one inch you've mentioned chain link for your oracles i think you even mentioned that you're using the diamond standard or there's facets there there's a ton of tech there i wasn't sure if that's what you were saying can we get like a link to the repo so like normally what i'd like to see is like a demo where i get to get in click in and do this stuff like send my pension or send send like a fake penchant where i send one every 15 seconds or something like that to see it that's what i want to get my hands on it so uh definitely like if you could send us a link or give us something that we can interact with or a repo that we can play with i think that's the key here yeah i mean still work in progress right um but yeah i i can get i can get a link send over yeah it's not a problem and i think the key here is like keep going keep building keep iterating uh i i just said this and i feel like i'm gonna say this a million times but like throw things away build things throw things away build things expand reduce like this this kind of process and this space takes a while and and and it may take a while to get someone to to click what you're what you're describing is something awesome that people want to use but we just need to have something to play with and use too right we need that front end yeah no i mean this is absolutely that's absolutely great um i i appreciate that um because i mean in terms in terms of the application i was really looking at you know the ladies in the market you know they can save 50 they can't give you three hundred dollars a month you know and and a lot of people you know gig work because you know they they're they're they're running into this problem and it's not a problem that's gonna hit you tomorrow it's probably gonna hit you when you can't work no more and so the goal is to to make sure that this project does see the light of day and it just get out there um and i will get you some test net deployed contracts and then you can tell me and give me some advice in terms of how to make it much better heck yeah well thanks so much man it's great thank you um cool or so next up i believe uh xavier um jack kevin here uh team haciendas so are you guys here you ready to go yep uh we're gonna share the screen and play the demo video sounds good uh take it away can you guys see the screen yep are you new to d5 and finding you have no clue how to make a transaction do you find it hard to wrap your head around token swap and liquidity pools it's so confusing it's even being called weird defy no one really knows what's going on you're not alone in being confused and haciendas is here to help at haciendas we're on a mission to make d5 more accessible from fun for new users with an interactive game as it is now innovations in d5 often come with clumsy interfaces complex lingos confusing metrics and opaque back-end processes so how can we make a smooth transition from conventional finance into d5 hacienda's is the game we are building to do just that it's easy to learn and fun to play with the goal of making players comfortable with d5 protocols here we will take you on a fun and interactive guide tour to swap deposit borrow and stake you can select your character and meet other characters in the game discovering d5 protocols doesn't have to be lonely anymore you can meet and chat with other d fires and make a few friends along the way in the game you have assets stored in your inventory use them to deposit swap transact and borrow not only can you see how many tokens you have by opening the inventory you can also drag them around for making real world transactions not only can you chat with other players but you can also transact with them using real cryptocurrencies you can send money to artists your friends family or anyone else in the game you like if you'd like to exchange your tokens for some other coin you can go visit the market and swap out ease for die or several other coins all without leaving the game we've leveraged the power of one inch exchange so you can easily exchange your coins for others with the least hassle possible giving players the chance to make real transactions without leaving the gameplay will remove friction from the transaction experience haciendas integrates with advanced functionalities to help users learn to use liquidity pools the liquidity pools are represented in a visual way so it's easy for users to understand the process for example you can deposit your tokens into ave liquidity pools and borrow from the loan officer can also enter the ave governance building once greeted by this cute little ghost you can read ongoing proposals and discuss them in the appropriate room with other players players can even vote on proposals from the game we believe removing friction from this process will encourage greater participation in the voting we hope this video made you want to learn more about the exciting world of defy and we're happy you're starting your journey with us give me the website i want to go play it right now send me the link amazing so it's it's live yeah it is yeah you can play with it oh what's a link oh um i will post it amazing project by the way so i remember eat new york i don't even know what it was one of the east new york's couple years ago a year ago the flexdaps guys like basically gamified taking out a loan from compound and it just made it way more fun it got a lot more interaction it made it more uh just and that's exactly what you've done here times like zelda which is so freaking cool thanks yeah the idea is to make it fun and join real world metaphors and to make this absolute abstract concept more tangible for people who aren't used to divide so this target audience is really like a very large sort of people who are who are new to d5 people who have interacted maybe with the wallet but not quite proficient in using um you know staking or borrowing this more advanced features and introducing them to tokens like governance tokens and away and things like that so it's bridging that gap between legacy apps and conventional banking systems and you know like this very abstract d5 layer it's really cool so i'm wondering which of those uh features or use cases was the most difficult to like explain or convey a gamified way to people liquidity pools are definitely more challenging to explain and i think having this um what we designed as a liquidity pool like literally a poor um the tokens swimming around um so kind of join the metaphor like dropping your tokens in the pool and then taking some other coins out i think that really explains what happens on the back end because right now all the dabs have zero sort of system feedback on what's going on after you send something um even when i go on away like i deposit some guy i don't really know what's going on so i think having that um you know that visual feedback is really important for raising the confidence in new users so that's really good your tokens now then inside the pool like swimming around or or something you can fish them at like but there's a long officer standing by the pool so they wouldn't let you just to jump in the pool and take things out with that information so so do you have plans for continuing this because it could be fun there are so many different products that you could have a real world with tens of different scenarios and and have endless fun and and i could imagine um different ways to monetize it whether it's from incentives from the teams or or there are many ways that you could monetize it so so is it your plan to continue developing this yeah we're scheduling a call with matic this week um we got their attention so i think there's definitely plans to continue this um and explore us all the ways we can monetize it as well um yeah right now we're yeah sounds like albums sounds like a lot of fun and and thinking adding i'll choose it's over 100 different words you could have like with different portals if you are on optimism and then you need to move to matic and of course making it an educating experience could be very hard uh from a ux point of view how how do you make people have fun and learn but if you nail it uh this could be a massive onboarding tool so so i hope it goes well 100 and i just want to echo that if you nail if you nail it can be so like this this this thing that is here is like a very very similar thing to something that i'm spending like a lot of my time working on also like this is really good stuff good work i'm yeah thank you maybe transactions out of a pool right now yeah you definitely should come talk to austin griffiths sometime yeah austin is too humble to say uh but his uh the h dot build thing uh is is a nice complement of this both things should slowly go together like if someone is getting a little more experienced it's like the natural next step after you nail the the graphic interface so you should totally check his workout which is eth dot build yeah i found the link on your bio in your twitter bio and and very good luck uh hope hope we see this evolving in the future thank you thank you thanks thanks so much guys that was awesome looking forward to uh sharing this stuff on twitter getting more people to like play around with it also um cool um next up uh let's see edward amore i believe um with west texas oil interesting um you ready to go yeah let me share my screen my name is andy k and i'm part of west texas oil and we're really excited to present to you um a novel solution to oil theft uh in west texas we've got a great team and uh one of them actually is an industry expert in the oil and gas industry and uh i'll allow kenneth to kind of introduce the problem to you hello my name is kenneth luster i work in the oil and gas industry and recognize the ever increasing need for the utilization of blockchain technologies within all sectors of oil and gas after seeing the major concern of crude oil theft within the supply chain of oil production the solution we develop reconciles the bill of lading between midstream suppliers and end stream refiners from midland texas to houston texas this is our demonstration of the front end of our project uh right now we only have our supervisor uh logistics handled and the way that a supervisor would interact with this project is they'd come over to the ad bol view and here they input the information uh important for creating a bill of lading uh some of the stuff that's already pre-filled out here is the contract address of the leading contract and the funding token contract that we're using um in real life they'd uh most likely use a stablecoin contract like usdc or dye or usdt uh and then before also a good thing to mention is that before actually creating the bol and coming here they'd have to approve um the bill of lading contract to uh take out a deposit amount which um we would add in the future a field that just says value and they can input um here we already have the pre-filled out information so this is the driver ethereum address that uh we'll get the bill of lading this is the serial number and uh all these zeros are just the coordinates for the origin the point of origin and the point of destination in the future we'll use something like the google maps api to uh translate uh real life addresses to latitude and longitude and uh kind of like you know not let people uh deal with that messy stuff and then lastly the quantity of crude oil and metric tons that a driver will be taking once all this is filled out the supervisor can then create click add bol and this will create a bul um by uh creating a a transaction uh they'll click uh you know create uh confirm and then send that off to the blockchain um once this is done in the future we hope to uh actually display this for our driver uh each driver would obviously have a different uh view and the way we do that is by uh an event within our create vol as far as the next steps we plan to implement the erc 2535 damage theme diamond standard to allow for upgradability integra of a third-party fiat on on off ramps such as wire pay drivers sooner and accrue interest on payments such as volvo thank you so much for your time in consideration thanks a lot i think that was interesting so i'm just wondering and this bit of leading contract is this like a real world contract that is uh somehow represented now um like on the blockchain or is it is it like a blockchain native contract this is an industry uh standard uh contract that's used right now it's it's like handwritten um there are a couple of different forms but they generally contain similar criteria that kind of represent you know where the oil is on the supply chain but it's quite analog right now so this kind of digital even like signed messages could be really powerful here a lot of the a lot of the things that you do along the way you can be signing with a key pair and then that can be cryptographically checked without having to write that on chain and that might help with your chain of things too cool project though it's cool to see the ui it's cool to see you pasting addresses in there and firing off transactions that's what i like to see yeah we we uh we stumbled into some issues on the front end and we ended up scrapping there's there's a there's quite a few days of work i put in that that has got to shield you i got i got this tool made for building front ends for web3 you know what muhammad next time you specifically muhammad who did the social recovery not to show a different project but uh yeah so it was it was really fun and we see it i come from a little bit of a supply chain background and so i see a lot of handoffs here and it's a very high ticket industry although it is you know decreasing that just signifies to me that there does need to be optimization of your bottom line and this is one of those things like reduce loss on the supply chain so your product's more profitable you got to keep it above the break even because last year oil was down to less than zero dollars a barrel because you had to account for you know storing it so um i think it's a pretty uh interesting industry to to address this problem through it's fact it's great also are you also considering to like have some kind of factoring in like where you can people can get like money for like their bills or they're like oh oh yeah that that was like when we're thinking big picture because because kenneth um he's he's worked in the industry for so he's seen a lot of this and you know he addressed so many like when we're trying to do the problem-solving thing we want we set out trying to solve like a real-world problem you know i think that's where the most interesting aspect of blockchain is for me not that you know solving like a lending protocol or something isn't a real world problem but this is more tangible to me so when we started addressing this kenneth was like hey it takes a long time for drivers to get paid like sometimes three weeks opener i think we might be losing you a little bit andy i i i'll just say it's it's great to have people uh folks that are technical like yourself that are also very interested in ethereum like kind of this this sort of cohort kind of thing going on here like keep building that stuff something that you might find when you take on a big ambitious project like this is that there are these holes along the way that you find that if we were to fast forward to what this uh you know what what west texas supply chain looks like in 10 years it's going to be different and and and maybe some of some of the little holes that you found along the way attack one of those little things solve that problem first and start building these things up so then in 10 years we've got all this stuff in line but stay stick around in the ethereum community that's that's what that's my biggest show that i that i will give to you oh i will yeah i have a little i have a little question because i i don't know the industry um are there smallish players that are willing to go and use bleeding edge technologies or is it mainly like super big corporations that it's impossible to get them on board um so that was definitely a big concern of ours um because i you know i talked to a one of my dad teaches supply chain on the east coast and i talked to one of his professors and they're kind of you know bearish on on trying to integrate it but a lot of these are the owner operators the suppliers are on the smaller side they're like mom and pops that are contracted by shell so i do think that there's an opportunity there if we decide to prove it but uh thanks so much guys for for your time and consideration really appreciate it well thanks man um and uh one quick really note just what patricio said like i happen to know a guy who has built some relationships with bp who's trying to help bp get into this industry and he actually has like close contacts with them in such a way that they would be willing to actually allocate a lot of money to a project that could allows them to tokenize some of the things that they're already doing whether it's commodities oral or otherwise and i always kind of thought like i'm not sure how this will play out but it seems like you guys are actually might be a really interesting fit to talk with this guy um who seems to have all like these connections but not quite the technical expertise but you have a lot of the technical expertise as well so maybe dm me on discord and i can help facilitate that introduction that's the absolute thing i'll throw karen in there too karen scarborough is kind of in the space knows this kind of stuff too and evan of course but reach out to both of us let's link up let's let's see what we can connect you with yeah i'd love to thanks guys yeah thanks guys um alrighty um moving right along so the next team up is uh nerd defy or n3rd5 um uh i have the video uh craig that was downloaded off youtube so let me let me try and set that up for you let's give me just a second here uh open up the video file one more second sorry watch we've got it oh there it is before this project i want to incorporate all the things i enjoy or love about crypto and combine them into one platform so the technologies i used were matic i've also integrated the arcane widget widget i did a play on avg and also enjoyed the anti-design so i tried to work around something like that i'm also used of protocol for the a tokens and also the borrow lend functionality and also the governance i'm also trying to integrate the sub graph using the graph protocol it has just a view of my arcade network wallet so run through this is nerdfight i'm just going to quickly connect my network see i'm not connected my wallet okay and now i can also load up my arcane wallet is loaded and here i also have a network switcher so if i switch my network up my meter mask should show that i'm now on the cover network okay so in shorts nerdify is basically the ecosystem um so firstly we have our diamond contract nerd nft there's only 10 000 of these and this is styled around a crypto fund called uh cryptokitty so that just represents my nerd token and then we would have nerdy tokens which is basically our currency to have eight but nft platform and marketplace where you can create nfps and sell them and stake them and also have my safu vault which is basically a security system so any monies that come in from the nerd tokens would go into that as a security system so without i was working on integrating all their coins or tokens where you could deposit borrower and then i was going to do a flash loan system probably on the safu protocol um then i was also doing a play on of koshi so if you would state goes for nerdy tokens you could get a nerd token in the end it'll play on that um and then i did my stafford protocol over here and then again just a bit on the eu buy ecosystem um and then finally my nht marketplace would which would incorporate openc so in addition to this i also wanted to build out analytical tools um more on the side of the nft marketplace and then also do a synthetic swap which i thought could be a cool project anyways a shorter presentation on e5 i hope you enjoy it love the ui go ahead thanks so this is really comprehensive this seems like really like encompassing like the whole um range of d5 pro protocols that that are out there so like an integration of basically everything more or less a bit of a playground for me yeah that's exactly right it's like this it's so cool that you can extend any of these protocols you you you can just permissionlessly build whatever front end you want on top of it so what you did was like let's make this like 8-bit playground this sandbox where there's all these buttons for all these different things you can do you want nfts we got nfts you want to borrow we can borrow i love it that's fun i i like that you like the interface go ahead so i try to put a lot of focus on the governance you know with it being a diamond contract and allowing you to sort of upgrade it and and and that type of thing so the safety protocol is sort of based around that that whole governance you know where you've got your sort of players in the game and they the more they're interacting the more they're providing or getting weights in the system giving them a sort of a higher ranking so a different way of of looking at governance you know you know sort of centralized but decentralized fashion you can call it that so the the sort of concept would be for like stafford protocol the idea is that that would be like an insurance um for the crypto industry and all your bigger players would be like your nerds so for example of would be a nerd or compound and they're all sort of putting skin in the game if you can say that so that's why i sort of try to focus around that governance team so is the nerdy token like a governance token in the end and can you like get it like through yield forming or what's the exact use case um so the nerd token is a is the nft current diamond standard so that almost becomes your governance um the nerdy is just like a currency so i'll sort of play with the idea of having like a die or a currency so i sort of looked at off i've got you and they've got the ghost token which you can stoke a stake and then basically you get your portals or your horns so i wanted something which was uh high in value but could be traded and given away if i can say that but the the actual nerds open in your covenants makes sense yeah you have to be an actual nerd to get a nerd token well my deal with that is like it shouldn't really be based on a price but more just uh one one per person so you're really almost decentralizing the the platform if i can say that's fully you know a lot of guys like if you look at hash masks someone can go and buy ten of them and then they've almost captured the market type thing but that's where i wanted it to be a bit more even even spread so you built out an awesome ui you deployed an nft and you have something set up so people can collect the nft like there there is there were some smart contracts that went but could we talk through just like what was some of the hardest parts like how would you make it better for the next guy sure i think the sort of one-click farming and yield farming i think there's a bit of a barrier entry there to just the normal folks um that's why i sort of wanted to make it quite easy to you know log into the system with arcane wallet and create a wallet if you don't have one so almost trying to eliminate metamask and that functionality if i can and then you are just making it more fun and interactive so the more you you stake or do different things you can get rewarded with nfts and different you know different prizes etc what about for the builder for the guy who wants to build this next front end build the same thing you built what what advice would you have for them uh just keep trying yeah this was quite a lot of ticks like i found i sort of had to just say i've got two days for this and build what i could and then put it down and go into the next thing um but yeah it's not as it's not as difficult as as what it seems you know when you look at these different protocols like urine and that and when you start to deep dive it makes a bit more sense yeah it's good that's awesome to hear stay in the space keep building keep building excellent thank you thanks man thank you very much um right on um cool uh next up we have uh team octobe and um i'm also gonna play your video uh hey do you guys have a video on yourselves maybe you can set yourselves up while i set the video up sorry just one second it's not finding my quick time window a second there we go okay okay hello this is our submission unfortunately it's not as much as we wished for but we were not really 100 focused on this hackathon to be honest for different reasons mainly um i personally am just really participating to see what it's like and not really to win anything just for the experience so to say anyway there's a little bit of code that is somehow related to what we plan to do and that is a chaining adapter actually uh two chaining adapters one to fetch the number of followers of a given twitter account and one to make a tweet from a twitter account that is owned by the oracle and that's already built into our projects ui as you can see here this is a list of github issues some funds deposited on it and we can post this issue to twitter and this will be handled by an oracle on the cover network now and the idea was to make the price for posting to twitter based on the followers of the twitter account that is being used by the oracle so actually in the background it's two oracle requests first the followers and then the followers fulfillment then triggers the actual post job and there it is so the oracle posted to twitter now and you can click this button and see the post just the deposit size and a link to the issue on github and that's it what we actually planned uh to do was a much more comprehensive notification system based on chain link but that needs uh certainly needs a bit more time to think about the other thing that i did rather spontaneously now is to start implementing the graph in our project so there's a new sub sub-graph for these issue bounties you just saw and you can check it out here in the explorer yeah just two entities issues and issue deposits and a little bit of code very simple still just one simple handler that loads and adds issues and then adds every new deposit nothing too special yet but we will definitely work on this a lot more i'm pretty sure so that we can handle all sorts of nice filters or notifications or stuff like that we'll see um but for now that's it yeah not that much but i'm curious to see what others submit um yeah thanks so you said are you trying to see how it was i guess you mean how it was to build on this stack and the tooling and the community and how you're feeling now that you have tribal so if you're if you're talking you think that very quiet or um or no or your mic is on in your design we can hear you but i think i think your input volume is like it's like the smallest possible unit it's like a little man in a box like actually and that's not much better can you start over sorry a little bit better just yes it was just perfect in the other call now so i was a little bit confused now perfect now okay it's quiet but we got you go yeah okay okay i'll try to speak loud as loud as i can so what was the first question now sorry and the question was um you said uh you got into the hackathon to learn how the thing was i guess you were meaning the tully being the the whole stack and how are you feeling now do you feel like you are going to keep building on ethereum yeah of course definitely definitely i mean i just personally never participated in a hackathon so for me it's just a first-time experience and um as i said in this video i'm not here to win any prizes or something just to to see how everything works and how the process how the processes are and so on and yeah well we will definitely continue to work on this project because it's it started even before this hackathon actually you cut off the video a little bit i mentioned in the end that uh what you see there most of it was not built during this hackathon now we started actually um a few months ago and we were inspired by the hackathon just by all the topics and technologies and it's uh yeah we came up with some ideas that we want to implement in the project and submit during this hackathon but unfortunately we were a little bit blocked by both uh private issues and and work related stuff and companies demanding our time and so on so it's development-wise not that much that we can present here um yeah um there's something cool i could share with you um because i think the idea makes a lot of sense and not only it makes sense um my project actually needed this um because we give uh batches in the form of some factual tokens to people that that do things and many times projects want to give a special token as a price for people that yeah requests that's exactly sorry if i if i may interrupt you here with that that's exactly one thing that we plan to do so uh to offer an option uh to issue governance tokens for example for projects uh alongside with their issues and and bounties and so on yeah and and as you for sure know um github doesn't offer a way to contact uh a contributor directly if if the contributor doesn't have an email address yeah um you can't get in touch with them and it really sucks but it also makes sense that they want to preserve privacy so if there were if there were an open source connector like yours if it worked and that that has product market fit we would we would use it this is this is kind of what we have in mind with this notification system that i mentioned um that we want to use chain link our chain link oracles are basically the team that is running the the this decentralized app um and they also will be responsible for sending all sorts of notifications via email if there is an email we fall back to twitter or just simple github comments mentioning users and so on so we're trying to tackle that problem also yeah yeah if you ever get this built feel free to reach out and maybe we can do some testing because this is a need uh that we want to get fulfilled as quickly as possible it's not just a crazy idea we had we really want this to exist yeah i mean we already have quite good feedback from from several sites and all everybody says that yeah that could be really a very much needed project or a product or a tool um and we yeah we tried to focus on on the simplicity and cover like 95 percent of the use cases and just don't think about the five percent niche use cases and something a little bit in the spirit of uni swap um for for github issues and bounties and open source funding and so on yeah so i i just feel a little bit bad because we it's really not something we develop now during this hackathon we just feel uh felt inspired by the hackathon to implement a few additional uh features around uh lending for example like saving accounts and so on but yeah we i have to be as honest as i can we didn't really deliver anything no good work it's you're in you're you're tinkering in the right area you're thinking about the right things keep hustling keep keep building this stuff like patricio said there is product market fit for these ideas thanks a lot yeah good good yeah good work thank you thank you all right one um one thing i just will emphasize also for anyone listening um and also for you at mkt is that the hackathon the prizes of course are for what you build at the hackathon yeah the environment that the hackathon is meant to create is such that you know even if you just want to participate and chat with people and just learn about things and tinker with ideas or chat with interesting people like it's a very welcome open environment for that so i wouldn't feel bad about not necessarily having done a huge amount of hackathon but but um you know it's great to have you in the community yeah and i just wanted to make it clear because i heard from other people that uh yeah sometimes projects just don't give a and they submit whatever they have from a year ago or something i just wanted to make clear that that's not the case here yeah yeah we do do like the due diligence at the end of this long process but appreciate it thank you very much okay yeah thank you thank you cool um all right um and shared steak i said i don't know your name because your zoom name is the project name but um yeah we're trying to maintain a little bit of anonymity till we get a lawyer and figure out we go ahead hey there i'm representing sharestake we're the easiest way to stake for e2 and earn rewards should say.org and we're live on mainnet and sharestate.edu via ens we integrated chain link ave and ens over the market made hackathon uh so the main problem that we noticed was a lot of users were hesitant to stay for ethereum too because maybe they don't have 32e or technical expertise to do that the apys were also fairly low compared to kind of the tgn yield farming ecosystem that we have and a lot of users want to maintain liquidity and some investors might actually be shorty so we built a d5 compatible liquid each staking solution for non-technical users users deposit their heat into our smart contract with the website they get a viet 2 token back which they can use to either they can burn it and get their eats back directly or they can deposit that into snow swap and start earning snow rewards and that also allows exit liquidity because there's a wrap ether on snow swap as well in the same pool uh so we have close to a million deposited into the e2 contracts by shared state 100 plus holders and protocol users right now and exit liquidity that's native to our smart contract which i haven't seen anywhere else over market make we built a perpetual renewable merkle distributor that we plan to use for future air drops and an ability to open a long and short e position via ave using uh chain links uh price feeds so the way we integrate with our weight this is a mark of kind of the front end uh it's on a dev branch right now uh we you can kind of long eat by having eat and using that to open a cdp borrow a stable coin against it by eat with that and then deposit that into our contract to get the apis there so we automated that in a smart contract and then any money that's left over is credit delegated back to the user to do it as they want and there's also a short heat strategy that goes from a stable coin borrows eat and then deposits that in their contract and again likewise it uh credit delegates back to the user chain link was uh useful for the cdp base strategies because we needed at usd price fee and it provides that and then we also have the fast gas function used in our smart contract the mean deposit smart contract and our token geysers to help the front end kind of figure out good gas prices and we have sharestate.ed registered so let me jump into a quick demo here so this is our website uh it's a landing page we mainly built most of that over this month well we launched the contracts back in december with a fairly like simple ui and you can go here you can stake your eat into it we're also live on growly if anyone wants to test us and if you actually have yet you can get that back this shows how much um monies we have in the contract right now here's the earn page and you can go check if your address is eligible for sgt mine's already claimed it and then you can see like stats here as well and then we have info on our notion that this will take you to and we also have medium discord so come say hi and discord so that's the presentation please check us out sharestate.org sharestate.ed we're open source on github and you can email us at sharestake gmail.com thanks and uh we could use some help so please reach out bye all right that's that's the presentation if uh anyone's got any questions to the stuff so just really quickly one thing when it comes to one inch specifically they are on this discord and they were a hackathon project to be global and so if you did need to reach out to them um they're very receptive on discord oh cool yeah i'll reach out to them thanks can we carve it down to just what happened for the hackathon like just just like a tldr of just your hackathon presentation minus the the full you know everything deposit that so over the hackathon uh we built the landing page um pretty much over this month we got all 1000 each of deposits into our contract we built the perpetual merkle distributor for airdrops that we're planning to use and we also built the uh off a smart contract that opens the cdp and allows you to go longer shortly and then deposit into your contract but that is currently live on covant we're on gourley so we still need to do some testing before we bring it to main net i mean a miracle distributor uh uh like the contract on top of ave like any of these things are hackathon projects already so it's awesome i think it gets you guys good exposure but you don't need it you've already got your thousand e but but good work and congratulations that's thousand eight that's going to the viet to uh the two deposit contract right um we're just depositing that and then we're spinning up validators and we miscalculated the fees so we're actually like short money we're losing money doing this project it's great but hopefully that'll turn around right yeah hopefully i love the ui that's like really amazing i think it's really original like the way that those like uh different like functionalities they they like slide up and you can access them that that was really i think original maybe tell us a little bit more about like this merkle tree distribute distributor how that works like technically absolutely yeah so right now the merkle distributors you um create a merkle root and then there's a clean bitmap in the distributor which keeps track of claims so all we did was we allowed a way to update that so now you can go back on chain see who's claimed their tokens who hasn't generated a new merkle root with your extra new air drop holders plus unclaimed old ear drop holders and we allowed a way to upgrade that clean bitmap and what we do is instead of having just a single bitmap we have um or sorry instead of having the single mapping we have a mapping of mappings and we just increment the version and this is surprisingly gas efficient like instead of 60 000 it costs like 70 000. yeah thanks a lot so this is like a regular mercury or a patricia tree because it needs to be upgraded yeah well so we didn't do anything because like we overwrite the merkle root of the tree right so we use the regular uh ts node merkle tree generator that uniswap uses so i believe it's just a regular one make sense thanks a lot a good question regarding the poll because i'm somewhat concerned you have taken over a thousand ether from people and you're handling all validating duties and and the contracts where you keep balances and all the positives information and such are they open source and have the reality uh no so we're looking for an audit right now and trying to like put together the money for an audit so they haven't been audited but they're open open source and they're verified on ether scan as well but this is still a very valid concern and moving down what we're doing is a multi-bond system so you can bond our token have a certain percentage of share in the pool and bond keeper and then deploy your own validator and also when ethereum two's kind of like shared validator credentials and withdrawing to a contract those things are more available we plan to integrate that and upgrade thanks so you you got people to put a thousand each into an unaudited contract yep we didn't do anything we just launched it and people put money in and now we're gonna go like figure out the audit right that's what i was saying with kind of um right now our fees we charge point three percent per validator so you know that's not really enough to get audits or anything yeah let's get that figured out make sure like reach out to some of us if you're not able to find somebody there's lots of auditors in the space there's lots of people that'll just give you a spot check with that with that much ease that's uh that's scary good luck yeah thank you well thanks i also did just yeah um yeah that message me also i'm happy to catch you to any others mobile and this is our hack for market make 2021 so let's get started i'm aviation i'm the ios and android engineer for this project and with me i have eric who is the backend engineer so talking about the opportunity coinbase mobile app has 15 million download look at finance 10 million downloads that shows there's a significant demand for mobile app but when we look at our solution it is website based but it has a staggering pvl of 4.5 billion assuming a 2x penetration a native mobile app for away actually represent an opportunity for another 4.5 billion and that is why we have built a native ios and android app for away and it works on mainnet it is not a dab browser it's a native app so it supports all on-chain transaction we are talking about deposit withdraw borrow repay switching of interest type and collateral setting we have also integrated with one is to support the swap services in case if the user doesn't have the token which is supported by away we also provide transferring and creating and importing a wallet so the app itself is a complete solution it doesn't require any support from the website now it is built with an infinitely scalable architecture we have built our way rest api from scratch each api endpoint talk to a microservices which is also serverless and that microservice talks to the rv smart contact and that is because everything is serverless it is an infinitely scalable so it can be scaled up to the global level it's demo time today we'll do two demos for you the first demo will do an actual transaction on mainnet sorry we couldn't do many transaction one minute because the gas prices are really high nowadays in the second demo we'll demonstrate what all are the possible things with that what all things that you can do with the mobile app so let's go with the first one we will open the map mobile app and you can see all the assets which are supported by away we can see all the analytics of each asset what is the available liquidity what is the total borrowed amount but the deposit rate variable rate stable rate and everything is faced directly from the ave smart contract through our apis now let's try to deposit one each every one chain transaction is two step process the first is review the second is confirmed we can see that we are depositing one eighth the user confirms it and the transition will be broadcasted immediately on minute here you can see the transition broadcasting let's go and check on each scan and you can see it's still pending and it will be okay success let's go to the second demo and we'll show what all are the possibilities with the mobile app begins you can see the asset has one deposit of knc and ts2 load one of each one is wbtc he has a health factor of 2.2 we have already seen the depositor let's go to withdraw since he has already knc he can only withdraw k and c and we only let him to withdraw certain tnc so that his health factor is is above 1.06 again it's a two-step process review and confirm let's go to borrowed um he can borrow all the assets which are possible on on away again maximum amount he can borrow is up to is is whatever can take itself back to 1.06 two-step process let's go to repay he has only eight in his wallet so he can only pay each he doesn't have wbtc to repay his wbdc loan again it's a two-step process moving to the next one switching off interest right from stable to variable variable to stable both are supported and the last one which is the collateral setting so you can also change your press we are actually looking forward to work with our team to improve the penetration of our protocol by releasing the official app on place or an app store both ios and android app are production ready we are actually would be very happy if we can release the official rest api for public and that would really help to grow the our ecosystem by letting other developer to build on rest apis and that's all from our site thank you very much um i kind of like it how far are you from having this on the play store but we have tested all the transactions we actually end up spending almost uh 700 to 800 dollars to to actually test all the transactions everything works on midnight uh we cannot release it on app store for apple because apple requires any blockchain or any ethereum based app to be released by by a company not by an individual developer and that is why we need away helps uh and because this is an away app it has to be released by the entity name of it i can't wait to use it yeah you're in the right place to get in front of stanley i'm sure stanley's going to see this and like it so i think he's your next stop right you guys need to just get this in front of stanny see what he thinks i'm sure he'll cover your gas fees but hopefully a lot more than that yeah yeah um we are actually looking forward to actually present it to our team um any question that you have feel free to answer it are you planning to like create like similar mobile uis for other like big projects yeah yeah so we have already created one for one inch and that app is already available on on play store again we couldn't do it on app store but it's available on test flight so if you want we can give you the link and even for this one we have the apk if you have android phone you can flash it on your phone right now yeah so but we were planning that once this hackathon is live we would probably take the rv code and make it a super app which has one inch away and i think the next one we are trying is uh b protocol and and is this all open source that's another thing like are you providing these libraries back to other builders can people fork this thing and make something else uh yes that's that's but that's what we planned to do it but probably after the hackathon because we just want to do some cold cleanup code cleaning process so that it is easily understood by others but like if for instance someone wants to create an app that does ave credit delegation you have the best starting point in the whole ecosystem at this point so let's get that thing out there let's get it open source we want to make our apis public just want to check with our team visit there they are okay with that [Music] are there any like user usability issues or like things that you think are much more difficult to like handle on mobile like that would be much more easy to like show on a desktop just maybe because of his constraints um yes so the the so if you if you already have a position with away let's say you have eat and you have some dye you have borrowed and you want to borrow more dye so that calculation that goes in the back and right to to make sure that your health factor doesn't go below one so we are doing this calculation but explaining this to the user on the phone it's a little bit tricky yeah i can imagine i mean that's really hard to like show like information in a very straightforward manner like even like the limited space on mobile but i think you did a great job so that's uh thank you amazing and i'm assuming you guys will get to stanley and there's no problem but if the final boss uh provides any problems you you guys hit us up and we'll ping him too okay thank you bye-bye yeah it was really cool um sweet um moving along um we have not arbitrary but arbitrium um so yeah feel free to take it away andre thanks let me share the video it is only recently that cryptocurrency options have really kicked off in the last year or so total bitcoin options open interest has gone from about 200 million dollars to over five billion dollars the primary venue for trading options is a centralized venue called derebit therapy allows you to trade both bitcoin and ethereum options across many different strikes and many different expiries if we head over to the derebit ui we can see all the different strikes and all the different prices and there are many of these as we can see there are hundreds and hundreds of combinations however recently there have also been some decentralized options protocols that have popped up which also offer the same service it's very hard to compare prices between each of these services because you have to use many different uis we wanted to create an options aggregator which consolidates different strikes across different expiries and different venues in a single ui so we created an app called arbitrium we only managed to finish the ui we didn't manage to hook in prices but you can see this is the concept so at the top here you can pick the asset you're interested in in this case we're looking at bitcoin usd options and on the right of here you have radio buttons which allow you to select the venues that you're interested in seeing prices for beneath that you have an expiry selector so by picking a date here this would change the option um down here that you see strikes for on the left you can see the expiry price or the current price for each venue the top price here is for derebit hedgeick okx and finally open so there are different prices here because each venue has its own price tracker so you can you can view those in a consolidated view as well we created three themes for this we created a dark theme which is this one also a grey theme and finally a light theme the app is also compatible on mobile so we can see here on mobile we have a little bit less information we just show the cause in this instance but you can toggle that by using the toggle here which allows you to switch between chords and puts and you can also toggle your exchanges that you're interested in and change your asset and also change the expiry soon we'll be hooking in prices unfortunately we don't manage to finish it before the end of the hack but you can expect that to be done soon cheers so yeah that that was our video so yeah um i think when a builder asks me what do you think i could build that the market wants on defy i keep telling them build an options aggregator so you're on the right track it needs to get much better for it to be useful but you seem to understand what's needed because so far i don't know a single place where i can see the same financial product on on a single view and on real time so so i like it uh i wish you keep building it if you find any hurdle whether it's lack of funding or connections or or mentoring reach out to us because this is something the ecosystem really wants and needs [Music] awesome thanks we'll keep building and it looks so clear and like straightforward and simple like that's like the the main achievement i think like yeah i mean yeah that thing but it looks so simple right yeah that that was one of our main goals to make it easy for people who are not used to financial applications in general and they just got into d5 for example and we wanted to make it as simple as possible for these new users to get into defy and options specifically that did a great job thanks yeah there's still some work to do but yeah we'll finish it and deliver for sure vetricio is counting on you yeah yeah and if you want ideas for something and be aware that there's like 15 decentralized financial derivative products out there some of them extremely well funded i mean there are teams with tens of millions of dollars building products on the options field and and they will need an interface for their users to find enough to to get noticed so um make sure you are in contact with all those teams so they can be integrated like out of the gate you think like a part of the app could be for just a single uh product like for example just a page for open and then another just for all kicks because you you've said some some things don't have like a ui still um well i guess and and this has been proven over the years on the ethereum space um sometimes and and it's more often than not a highly polished graphic interface can trump the actual native interface of the protocol because all those protocols that i mentioned on those 15 that are out there like potion pots opinion etc what they are focused on is the underlying tech the smart contracts the solidity code and many times they don't have a top talent front-end staff or even if they want they can't really make cut their cake and eat them like like if you are doing a highly complex financial protocol you probably can't focus on the front end so so there's ample space for a plug a front end that you can plug in because they are all open source and that similar ui i did the same thing where i was trying to build a wallet on multiple l2s right you find the similar ui and you and you match one ui to everything and you kind of apply it to them and like patricia said you can do it better than they can because they've got heady heady tech they've got to wrestle with yeah they let them focus on the protocol itself and try to offer a great ui awesome keep building thank you thanks guys all right thanks guys for the great advice we'll keep building uh keep in touch feel free to reach our thing for sure thank you build in public keep building in public that's the most important part thanks guys all right um quick thing for the for the judges if you guys did want to take a two minute break or anything or if any one of you want to just mention now and we can do that break i could go for a tankle break i'm not gonna lie yeah yeah yeah okay everyone let's take a two minute break um and uh thank you let's be back at 11 15 or so ah by the way appreciate your video and mike are still on just fyi so [Music] uh hey patricia you have a fan uh someone's asking about your beef badge i have one also but maybe you want to explain where you got it actually is that a pope it's a pope isn't it who's asking uh stan amir's story kev stan is he presenting now no he's well it's it's a piece of pride it is for everyone to know that i'm an ethereum person i have a i've i don't have a metal one unfortunately but i do have uh i have several of the patch ones from our different hackathons um keep them your heart i do i actually have a shrine in my bedroom uh back home i'm not i'm not home right now literally i literally have a shrine look at those things have you seen astin's video yes so i'm leasing a new place so i don't have my own shrine um yeah okay everyone's back so maybe we should keep the show rolling um oh stan says he thought that you own a thousand eighth or something like that oh it's like uh you get that yeah after you buy after you have a certain number of youth in your eoa metallic send you were yeah you go to the ethereum foundation office in zug and check your wallet and you get one i mean we could do that because um there can be more than 7 000 people or is it 70 000 actually yeah it would be too many tokens um okay we should keep things rolling i believe the next one up is muhammad who actually had been he put his hand up right at the start so he's been here for a while thank you muhammad um ave leverage i'm right uh you there mohammed so hi cool yeah take it away uh this is every power up oh wait a second let me share your screen so yeah can you see yeah you change your name for us it's our leverage yeah i know i use the name power up in the presentation good fine power up is our defy project for market mechanism by utilizing the flashlight and one is protocol users will be able to leverage their loan or go lying or short of an asset and to throw up to avoid price and data manipulation we use channeling oracle and the graph to fetch the data basic schematic is this platform works for both existing and new loans by utilizing the credit delegation and for example user can take a one ethereum cholesterol and then take a flashlight of sweetarium and deposit three ethereum and then the contract would borrow the user loan using the credit delegation and then using the one inch api it swaps the token and collateral to depth and and then repair the flashlight using that token validate the plus the premium that take from the user um wait let's see it in action [Music] and we use the collateral token and to die and for the adaptogen we use uscc and we set the level leverage to forex and the slippage to five percent and the collateral amount would be a hundred as you can see the transactions are confirmed but uh since the contracts are not deployed on the main net i can't demonstrate the deposits and depths i use the graph api for that and the graph only works for the main net as you know so that's it um could you explain what happens under the hot place basically and once the user put the collateral as a one ethereum the flash loan used one atrium as a collector and then it deposits triatherium to the every landing pool and then using the landing pole it use the direct credit delegation to takes to borrow from the user on behalf using the on behalf of and then it takes the borrow to and swap it to the depth token for example depth token could be anything like usdc or anything and then it's used there that use that uh taken su up and the premium that's taken from the user to pay repay the flash loan the premium will be paid before the contract and call what was the hardest part for you guys building this thing what would you say you know you'd like to improve for the next guy who has to go through this same build um the hardest part was [Music] their landing pool interaction since uh it has some complex architecture and many many things are not documented yet so i have to dig in that quotes in the github to find out many apis you also mentioned there is a dead token and a collateral token so it's this like fully generalizable to any pair of two tokens at least in theory and cool so then how does this like affect the leverage ratio because some tokens are just much more volatile than others and i fetch their loan to value ratio from the graph and set the maximum amounts using that if you try to put some amount higher than ltv it would ask you to lower it but i didn't demonstrate that i see so that makes sense and so what the maximum leverage now in your example it was 4x or yeah it was i love the using the flash loan to unroll the position it's such a clever cool use of a flashlight nice i don't know was that part of the documentation was that something you guys thought up like what what spurred the the idea of using the flash loan to repay the or to get out of the position well actually uh i took the idea from and one inch as they told me this idea is pretty good to use and i chosen it awesome are you planning to add like more features um to this in the future yes of course and i got a lot of things in my mind and i listed them for their roadmap and i planned them in the future but unfortunately i can't uh for the time of the hackathon i couldn't handle it but there is you can do it in the future probably yes yes exactly just to lean into that a little bit more uh what do you think are the biggest uh concerns of yours in terms of adding on to this and building something and getting into people's hands what what can we as an ecosystem do better for you um for the deployment of the contracts i was um not i didn't have any phone in my mind since i i couldn't handle the gospels this day we had to pay at 300 guests for deployments and for that reason i didn't deploy it on maintenance but after the sake soon i will do it and for the help and i may need some team for that and uh i am soloing this one i could i couldn't find any team so one thing right off the bat would be mainnet 40. it looks like time's up and we need to jump uh uh uh reach out to me i'm at austin griffith on twitter we like have a branch of scaffold eath that does main net forking and basically everything that's listed here in this thing you can take that fork that build on top i use mainnetworking but unfortunately the graph didn't work for that sure okay thanks it works mohammed um already um next up um i don't think they're in the chat just yet uh but there's twister and jason is that you yeah yeah yep cool take it away man cool i'll say this is twister um that's a fork up to the cash on the optimistic roll-up um we didn't get to complete the whole project because of the technical complexity but this is kind of just a scope of what we have so far i would say are you sure are you trying to show your screen right now oh sorry yeah i have to hello this is twister this is a fork of tornado cash intended to run on optimism here we have the core contracts of tornado cash as well as the open zeppelin contracts required to make tutorial cash run so this is using the f optimism plugin for hard hat to compile contracts uh this doesn't work fully yet as you can see below when you run npx hard hat compile we get one error which kept us from finishing this as you'll see in a second which is the mimc hash function we have the byte code outputted from building tornado cache itself but we weren't sure how to link it with the compiler in hard hat and then uh just to uh kind of show you guys what uh happened with the uh the actual issue so um insert com lib which is um like you know a very popular library for uh zk snark uh circuits um they have this uh mimc gen contract so mimc is a hash function which is used in zk snarks which is very friendly it's like efficient since it has low multiplicative complexity and then this the circuits themselves have uh some details with this um because in a zk snark you want uh to not multiply too many times you have to do this thing where you basically store you create a value for you create a storage slot for each time you have a value that's multiplied and so if you have a bunch of these right you're going to just waste a bunch of memory and make your hash inefficient mmc mimc is just basically a hash that's uh more efficient in terms of this sense so uh the actual circumload script that tornado cash uses uh compiles the contract from scratch so this is actually pretty hardcore but you literally push on all the byte codes individually and we just didn't have the time to reference the ovm uh spec and then basically translate each of these op codes by hand to get this compiling on an optimistic role so as you probably know yesterday um the original tornado has launched their token so it's only reasonable to expect that um they will capture value whether it's in the form of fees or whatever so it makes it makes sense that someone is already up to a speed on forking tornado whether it's on a second layer or a main net so it's a good thing you exist and and hopefully when they start church in face uh you can fork it and make it a real public good yeah yeah definitely i think one of the really cool things about tornado is that um it's not just the contracts themselves like the mining is actually they actually use a separate state route for mining verification um because it's they basically check how long you've left your note in the deposit set um and so uh they're really really good and i know if you guys have checked out the governance forms but the founders themselves are very very technically they they really know what they're doing i mean it's very clever and and i love them but still it makes sense that if someone um doesn't care about the entropy or whatever and wants to have their own deployment but doesn't have the resources um it i i would totally support a fork like yours being productive yeah yeah um i i uh you know like i i told a siri coming from i think um in this ethos of what we're building right it would make sense for us to actually be fully anonymous because if you expose the anonymity instead you're just wasting you're making people waste a bunch of guys to create to print your governance token but you know it is what it is so so first thing this is dope this is an awesome idea tornado on ovm just gets me excited that's all you have to say i'm already in uh have you got uh have you jumped into the ovm discord i just talked to ben jones about this and kind of talking about some of the problems you guys are having and he said get get at us in the discord uh so if you guys go in the ovm discord if you haven't yet especially this kind of stuff this has kelvin written all over it this this yeah actually um this translation make sure you're connected with those guys oh sorry yeah yeah um kelvin's been helping us a bunch actually so yes um it's one of those things where it's like it's this is like to the point it's actually hard to write out this problem over text like we had we'd actually probably have to jump on like some sort of zoom call and everything um and so you know like i work on some other stuff full-time as well as school so it's really just a time commit like a time commitment issue for us but um totally could see this going like further um you know even the tornado cash team themselves i'm sure they'd be interested in this um and like uh yeah like you know you know i think that we respect like what both optimism is building and also what um the kinder cash team themselves are building how much time do you think would it take for you to build this up fully like to bring this to fruition uh well this is the only contract that i know of that's generated like this because uh in optimism the they have a compiler that just compiles the solidity code into opm and so this is the only contract that doesn't have a raw solidity code for it um so once this translation is done theoretically uh it should be able to run on optimism um although actually getting it deployed is different story because um optimism doesn't have their test set up yet so it's only just a local test net so far right so like there's no coven or whatever like endpoint um so like that would also probably take a while from just like the deployment perspective so i mean anywhere from like you know like finishing this to like you know yeah there's always issues but you should definitely keep up your your work i mean now that you've like come so far that's oh yeah yeah um yeah i know i i i um like originally we um so we know where the team from ucla doing this and like originally um i was interested in this idea because you know it's a good it's a good uh fit you know because the way optimism you know that l2 works is that they do transactions off chain by uh merkle root updates right and then they just um push it put push to l1 and then they have a fraud period of like a week i think and then so if anyone has a dispute with the way the merkle group has changed you know they can just they can basically dispute it um and so that's actually nice because in tornado cash uh what what happens is that you put in your deposit and then your withdrawal is uh mixed with everyone else in a depositor set so the longer you leave it in there and the more people that would uh deposit after you the more plausible deniability you have in uh whose funds it actually is um so it's really good because both of them incentivize you to like uh i guess the trade-off on the consensus part of optimism plays well into the incentive for added security in tornado um hey jason that i this is super super cool um but unfortunately just with the timing we have to move forward but um yeah i also personally am like super interested in this i'd love to see optimism have the tornado cache running on it basically um yeah keep it up let's go stop keep building hit us up if you hit a wall with those guys bug us we'll we'll buckle up too see you all right um sweet the next one is stan the man who was talking about the pin earlier so welcome stan to the show um and uh yeah stage is yours uh i i think that you guys were gonna play the video though because when i tried it on right yeah there's a few of these that i have the note for i forgot which one sorry um fantasy x yep let me just quickly open it up just uh one second sorry superstream blc team fantasy x my name is ali and together with my friend stan we built i would like to show you what we built for this hackathon now our idea was to provide a platform which allows you to implement a blockchain version of your favorite fantasy sport so it could be fantasy football could be fantasy basketball could be fancy esport and that's that's actually what we focused on for this hackathon in particular we use the popular multiplayer online battle arena game dota 2. so let me showcase the front end of our application and interact with our smart contract so as a participant i would want to build my fantasy team of professional players represented by these cards which in turn are represented by nfts once i build my team i would want them to compete against opposing teams so notice how there are different properties associated to each professional player now these are properties like average number of kills or number assists average number of deaths so there are there are proxies for their performance and the these properties are dynamic and the monetary value associated to each player will fluctuate depending on their real world performance let me show you how i can buy one of these so my meta mask pops up and there you go so the novel idea here is that we use an oracle data feed to update the values of these properties in a transparent and upper proof way and for this purpose we built a custom chaining external adapter that connects to the open dot api to get stats for each player they will be associated to their corresponding nfd and that's it thanks for listening [Music] yeah sorry we couldn't show that much because we're both newbies being my friend this is literally our first um blockchain project believe it or not say that for being a newbie it's not that bad tell us more about thank you about the competition i i really loved it uh like uh i really like the fact that you guys organized so many things for us and that you're so helpful um i tried to reach out for help but i guess my issue was my own issue and i managed to fix it by myself but at the end of the day i'm really happy with with the community and the only thing i'm not happy about austin is not having the bow tie where's the bow tie what is this exactly it's a tuesday this is it's always so exciting to see new projects like to see new people making new projects to be hooking up metamask to be hitting that button that first time i love it and and i just want to see you continue to build in a space and if you have any roadblocks or you run into anything reach out to me and let me help we'll do definitely thank you actually i meant by competition just to get back on that i meant like the competition between the players but it's i'm glad to hear that you also like the competition itself i love the projects um i really like ideas that are different than mine and everybody else's idea is different than everybody else's and i really love that uh somebody has an atm idea and i was shocked my mind was blown so something really fun that is global does is that when the hackathon finishes they put together all the submissions on a very digestable format and and if you enjoy this um you i would totally encourage you to review those submissions of hack money um is online and hack fest uh they they all have searchable functions you can see who the founders are github profiles um i i'm not an actual software developer and i still enjoyed browsing over readme files and reading their experience and and the format that there you have it on the chat the different showcases particularly i suggest you checking the one of um the only one that's missing the hack money online um because it's it's really a fun activity it's something i say for my weekends to see when i want to do something far from myself uh and and i'm sure you will love it thank you can can you dig just just for a second tell us a little bit more about that thing you have it it happens to me all the time where it's just like this freaking tool is not doing what i want it to but really it was i didn't have the context of what it was supposed to be and i didn't understand what the difference was between a provider and a signer or something like that can you give us a little insight into kind of like what you banged your head up against sure uh what didn't i well didn't we actually it's a team uh first of all we set up using truffle and uh when i set up when we set up the contracts and we tried to pull from open zeppelin to extend to create the erc 721 the compiler failed because i didn't know how to set it up accordingly uh i banged my head against that for a really really long time before i scrapped everything and did it again and did it again one of those things uh another another thing that i really had hard time with is putting prices into metamask uh i didn't know how to pass the extra parameter because i never i didn't find any documentation anywhere i might suck at finding it probably that's the case but have you seen that other tool kit called hard hat no i only know mr mask i'm brand new now i mean regarding it's like a truffle replacement and and it seems that uh developers getting their feet wet like it is slightly more than truffle so so maybe it makes sense for you to check it out it's hard hat hard hat org i think hardhat.org you'll see some nice little characters and i'll i'll even extend that shield to say check out scaffold eath it's basically like a dap in a repo that you can fork and it includes ethers it includes hard hat it has things like buttons that add those extra parameters that call things to metamask just as an example so it has a lot of copy paste examples for you and a lot of stuff is standing up yes i recommend brownie as well i i think i think we would but that's that's my friend that's that he he does the python i don't do python so that's him yeah i think that's for python folks yeah don't don't be afraid to reach out austin griffith on twitter hit me in the dms we'll do we'll do thank you uh okay uh i guess we're done i think we i think we are yeah thank you [Laughter] thank you guys thank you hello okay i represent the concern team for the market make academy founder and developer due to a lack of transparency in property ownership a growth of paper consumption a costly risk we have when we invest in a property and a profit taking time to come we built a progressive web app where anyone can transparently purchase and trade affordable token of property and make some daily return and get on that collateralized loan how it works so as an honor i have to prove my ownership and have a digital proof of existence back and as a customer i can check the digital proof of existence of an asset and purchase that asset as nft our future work will be to add more tokenized valuable assets like uh uber taxi or debt and also introduce a tokenization tool for business and later a governance protocol for our users and of course going magnets so let's see how okay that's all for the for the for the presentation thank you thanks for watching for some questions thanks a lot so i'm i'm curious to know if you have looked a bit into like the legal recognition of the property that you're trying to like tokenize like how does that work maybe in your jurisdiction or is that something you are researching yeah yes currently um i've researched that here in in france so i'm currently i'm i'm in france but the company is in u.s so currently in france we we have something we we call that um scscpi so is um is a is a property that can that can be represented by a company so currently those tokens will be like uh a part of a company and yes so so i think legally we have no no problem with that i see so there is like a company that owns like the property and you basically tokenize the share of that company exactly but in the future we we we won't need to own the property but any real estate agent can tokenize their own property and our user will just come and purchase those those tokens great thanks a lot that makes sense and i hope that like the jurisdictions will follow like other countries because this is like really like the interesting um part where like revered assets become usable yes where was that deployed i saw the site and then i saw a little ether scan is that a test net is it live that we something we can play with what what's out there yes he's on test net it's on coven but we we try to put it uh with um with matic we try to do it with matic where we but we have some issues so we decided to to continue with uh with govern so also um if you are owner of an and property nft we can make you can you can use the delegate the delegate collateral to apply for a loan and on f platform it makes sense to investigate the matic deployment um because with the current gas prices everything mainnet is so expensive and matic is so much cheaper yes yes i understand this because i try to to put some liquidity last time and i paid a lot a lot of ease on the gas so yeah definitely i will i will put my tick on on the platform how are the property prices determined are they like pulled in using some oracle or no no they are not determined we we just put the we know the price of the property currently we know the price of the property and you just go and grab what how much you want of the property so it's not fixed like uh you you can pay 25 you will pay as much as you have in your bag [Music] so but there is like initial price of the property that like yes 35 is the initial price i see that should be cheap enough any other questions anything you got hung up with on tooling like anything other than matic stuff we've kind of dug in but anything else that if you could smooth this process out for the nes next guy anything in particular that you got hung up on that you would like to see improved within the ecosystem um currently uh i don't know we are looking for an acceleration program maybe that we that can help us really really accelerate the the project so i think he's the only thing i'm currently looking for from the community you might be interested in looking at in paris it's a call 42. they have like a program around some blockchain stuff and we did a hackathon there two years ago okay so there's a lot of um there's some fun funding programs there there's some good developers there it might be this interesting ecosystem that's happened too in france yeah yes i know i know echo canada i used to work with some developers yeah i think we're out of time but i think that you're in the right place also like ethereum hackathons are a great place to accelerate your ethereum hack idea keep building keep showing up for these uh keep keep keep the momentum going good job thank you thanks man all right um okay um next up is liquid defy uh z morris and i am once again going to procure the video so let me put pull that up and uh just to confirm you're there right z yes yeah cool okay the video is coming up presenting liquidify implementing decentralized finance through protocols such as ave and uniswap this is a work in progress let me demonstrate a portion i'm gonna start from scratch okay so basically this is an escrow where you have an arbiter and a beneficiary typical typical contract typical contract between the two parties where the beneficiary will receive the funds after perhaps whatever they agree to in the contract in this case i call the arbiter the escrow manager and the escrow receiver is the beneficiary in this case i'm going to act as both and use my account so what you do in this case is you enter those parties i'll use my address for both now we can choose amount let's see that might be a little bit too high because of the fees but you can choose any amount uh at this point i will then choose approve and deploy and i'll have two submit my transaction fee and to approve the die wow it's still quite high so i do i do not have enough ether for this transaction i believe that is why it won't let me continue uh let me double check but the basically this is the premise and [Music] wow it's very high he's correct there yep so i have to reject this unfortunately uh and i really wanted to show you because once you do approve it your contract will be listed here where it says existing contracts um so i will continue to build upon this uh and i hope you have a little bit of an understanding and uh we'll be able to implement this a lot further in the future thank you uh thank you for the presentation i think an escrow contract it's a very basic primitive that we still haven't solved so it makes sense to build this thing my advice could be to plan on deploying it on matic just because it's much easier for experiments and then improve the usability like um adding ens support are you familiar with dns yes so so ens is quite fundamental for these things and then it needs to have the ability to escrow other things and die like at least ether or uscc which is what usually people want to escrow right i was using the kovan protocol uh kovan test net so that's where i could get the die uh unfortunately not enough ether um really i basically this is a scrap up from my original project which is i wanted to follow the the documentation for ave and do alone and after you do the loan what can you do with it before it's paid so i wanted to yeah do some swaps do some arbitrage um so originally i built that loan uh and that worked but then when i started to do the front end i had some problems and basically i'm really noticing that like one uh when you go into the front end you want to bring your projects to the front end your your contracts if you have more than one what if you want to bring in all the uh the providers and then uh the tokens so i you know i uh crashed on that a few times so i like deleted my github repositories a few times started over i mean nobody becomes proficient in ethereum development overnight right so this is really hard stuff yeah yeah just just seeing you hit a button and it triggers a meta mask i said this earlier like that is the first step that is the key like visceral experience and that's the thing you're coding up uh i i check out the tooling keep working like my my advice i mean it hit me up if you need some covan i i am a coven whale and i can set you up but yeah just keep building exactly that's what i'm gonna do um yeah because i was really excited when i first started this project and i was smooth going smoothly um but then when i jumped to the front end i had some problems there so then i you know that's another thing don't i really should stick stick with one thing and uh stay on that then when i started building this escrow i was saying uh you know i saw some other documentation where you could have multiple people so it's not just one uh person joining in so you have a bunch of people uh sign in on this contract and then during that maybe one of them could take a loan out and then as long as they pay it back uh or the they're actually they will be withdrawn from that from the contract and then when it's paid back you know everybody uh gets their money back and then if there's interest then you can decide what to go to do with that as well so yeah this is really exciting there's a lot you can do um got to keep on working keep building yeah what next step i want to implement to realize what was that like what's the next step or like the missing piece that you would like to to see like or that you would like to add next well um i'm really interested in um upgradeable contracts um yeah so what happens when you make some changes i mean but really i really have to finish and get the basics down so uh i'm working on it sure but i'm i'm sure you will get the basics done soon so that you can like move over to those like more exciting stuff like the upgradeability pattern yes and also the the uh the graph and uh just seeing what's going on i'm interested in tooling too just so you just see what's going on comparison hey before i make the swap what is it on on unit slot what is it on uh these other protocols or or or uh split amongst all of them see who's fastest who gives the best rate yeah looking forward to see you on a future east global hackathon yes i'm going to be having a better project soon thanks so much man thank you for presenting okay thank you thank you guys awesome um uh two more projects um and the next up is rahul uh whose project name is rahul so it's uh i like it yeah the floor is yours um hi everyone so i will be talking about sci finance uh i have been working on this project for quite a while now uh and this was this is the same submission uh which i made to it online global hackathon so the page that you are looking at is for the nft booster seal so these nfts these actors discount coupons for siphoning so you can basically select uh this is the uh related uh artwork to the currently selected uh booster and this is hosted on coin where the cid for the the artwork is encoded within the smart contract so you can simply just buy it here so these nfts they also act as uh discount coupons for siphon ends so uh with siphon ends the uh these use uh our video contracts and this we i have made certain modifications to it to uh get the desired behavior so the website is currently live here so here you can basically uh it works on common so you can just select the instrument that you want and enter the amount you can element approve deposit redeem borrow repay here you will get your current portfolio the numbers and this this is a like psy farming so here you can see the volatility so for example uh bitcoin the previous price was 38 38.8 and uh let's say the current price is 33.33 000 so this is the volatility for the total uh deposited liquidity and this is the maximum harvest that the users can get and this is the amount that is actually harvested and the api so these are currently simulated numbers uh the documentation is currently live so you can just read and go through what i have been uh working upon so the long term uh my thinking is that we are currently in the second stage of asset tokenization and i believe we will see upcoming digital creation markets so the uh this is what uh i am trying to research into and if you look at the nft here this basically uh talks about the infrastructure which i want to uh basically develop under sci finance so under network intelligence it's bonding curves econometric design state channels finally uh for the on chain infrastructure these are the nfts which will be going live pretty soon then there's a lending protocol uh then the psy harvest and then the uh digital creation market uh which i intend to develop and it will be supported by the off-chain infrastructure uh yeah and the long-term thing is that i i want to research into econometrics and financial designs which can basically finance space innovation so let's say i want to uh do some experiment in space then i i am basically looking into econometric models so through an eco tokenized model i i should be able to fund that fund that like space initiative so that's the overall idea and open to questions thank you have you built everything yourself oh yes it's like a lot of work even just the ui you've spent a lot of time like crafting the experience and it feels like geocity meets defy yeah i love it i love the just the vibe of this thing is really cool uh yeah i have been working on this for like past five six months now and i started off basically kind of researching into what's happening here because initially i was working as a foreign investment bank and there i was looking into security tokens market but that's not innovative like that's just like too much regulated and you can't do anything though so i got into this ethereum development space and since that i have been developing this and just trying to create something new something innovative but i think now it's almost there so will be fun to see how it like basically shapes from here it seems that you've also built like a complete like exhausting documentation of all that yeah they're just like undocumented and you just have to find out like how they work that you've done all day right the thing is like uh when i was building and when i shared it like uh for for example in the video itself i haven't really described how the volatility works because the harvesting works because the thing is what i'm trying to do is i have parameterized yield farming so inherently i'm capturing the market sentiment uh during yield farming uh with that i am trying to minimize the loss potential so for example if you're depositing your capital into up and you're earning interest but still like you will face losses because if the price itself goes down which doesn't seem like it's happening uh but that is a certain case so in those situations you will get our instrument and using off chain ai models and like you know modeling technique simulation techniques we can simulate it uh in a way to minimize your actual loss potential so if you are actually taking loan then you will get this instrument when the price goes up so whenever you're in a lost position we are trying to compensate for that wow so when ai meets blockchain i mean it means uh the thing is like uh within uh institutional finance ai is a big thing right now not blockchain uh but blockchain is a new finance and i think uh they will eventually emerge but it will be quite different because within service like institutional friends it's mainly for trading right uh but i think with d5 it will be more about creating econometric models so uh that is what i've been looking into yeah i i usually give this advice that like when you take on this giant project there are these holes and there's these weird things that you find that like oh like this little piece right here is totally missing in the space i can get product market fit by solving that thing instead of you you've definitely been in this expand mode it might be good to go into a reduced mode and pick up but but but but my caveat there is maybe this like overwhelming crazy ux is exactly the kind of thing that will capture like your own community and and this is the thing that like like you know i could see i could see a wave of people like diving in and just playing around with this and like getting into this ux but i i also would say kind of just like expand a lot reduce down to something and maybe even take this thing and leave it standing where it is reduce down to something small and rebuild some small piece and try to launch that and see what kind of product market fit you get there also uh i i agree with that and that is why i added this nfts so these nfts the contacts have been audited uh i'm just making the final check so initially i'll do the like nft launch on minute and uh after like getting some basic funds for auditing the other contracts then i'll do the launch and uh i agree with your uh like your suggestion but the thing is i essentially want to converge it with space stick uh and i have been like having this thing for like past five months uh elon musk purchased bitcoin like yesterday but uh i knew this thing was coming for like past year because i think it's like we meme about you know mining bitcoin on moon like taking bitcoin and moon but actually like uh economically speaking if we actually mined bitcoin on moon that is a feasible solution to actually establish research labs because uh like uh solar electricity that will be more effective on moon because it doesn't have any atmosphere and if you are a private entity and you are doing a space exploration feature then you can't like you know get money from these ventures but if you actually mined bitcoin amount which is a meme right but uh it will actually have an impact on price and it will actually help establish research labor mode so uh i think that is something that just doable in the coming decade and i just want to get involved and maybe that's why it's just kind of like you know bizarre project that i've been building too many different blocks together i love it you need you need to have crazy ambitious goals you know and uh this this is this is definitely ambitious i love it any questions any suggestions what was hard for you like give us a give us give us something oh it looks like we may be out of time okay maybe we should go maybe we should go dm sometime or something like that feel free to reach out i'd love to hear hear about your journey sure thanks so much for watching yeah thank you cool um all right thanks everyone we've got one project uh remaining zeus looks like it's a mobile app i have the video uh zk that's you right cool i have your video i'm gonna play it in uh just one second uh okay yeah so this is a sports prediction market um so really wanted to capitalize on a lot of the hype not just around the super bowl but around uh all sports being back um so big focus on the nba march madness and american sports initially um so each one of these would be a league um which would then have the bets or the matches teams and james nfl nhl fifa mlb and march madness and then i pulled the results and matches for these games is a game as well as some of the players so in the apis they do have a variety of things that you could make a prediction on including like how many points over under a player or score and then also their stats going forward and this would be linked to the ave wallet where you would actually be able to add leverage to your beds and then this would show your winnings and then one thing that i was uh exploring with was we'll have a native like zeus token and then your winnings would be able to be either transferred or used for purchases for sports memorabilia or tickets or other prizes or tokens um mobile side and then this is the uh a web dap results and then you can pick which side so this is just on kovan but i did it for golden state but then for the example also uh did it for uh the spurs on the other side and then after this you would actually be able to leverage and and one thing about uh sports betting like they have like money lines so it's like not always even and there will be a spread um sometimes that they need to cover um but then with ave a big thing was i'm looking for like arbitrage opportunities um so this was one where a lot of times different uh sports books will actually have different lines on the game slightly um so using a flash loan you could actually uh take advantage and be able to place those bets and you know cop capture a small thin spread that you couldn't really and yeah we'd love to hear you guys just feedback like that's an awesome ui for the mobile i mean i really loved like the clean and a nice way how you presented it like the desktop like application looks a bit different like was that done by this yeah or like a different person just out of curiosity no no i i did it also but i just didn't like style it as hard because the mobile really was like the core focus and then that was more just to make sure that like i could you know make a bet and and had all the info and can make the calls and things like that so i the mo the mobile's the main part of it what's the current status of the code base what do you mean um how how fat are you on coding oh the code is pretty far like the app you show that by in the demo um that could be released like fairly within the next like week or two um so that part's pretty far along and then that's why i did some of the um just like yeah other smart contract calls and stuff but a lot of that's all ready to go one question i had maybe i totally missed this but i see ave and i'm assuming there's some sort of like staking and maybe like yield redirection here but how does the betting work are you betting with your yield are you betting with eath are you betting with credit like how does it how does ave connect to sport sports betting in this scenario yeah yeah so we actually created the lending pools so that people could deposit their tokens in to that and then also earn the interest on that while they're in the pool um and then they'd be able to get that interest either way even if they lost the bet so really like no hard lock up of you stake toward golden state and if they win you win your yield back but if they lose you lose your yield or something like that which which which i mean that's a perfect thing for using something like ethereum but uh like it's more like you took ave you stake some stuff you earn some yield but also we're going to do some some sports betting over on this side and kind of like connect those two yeah exactly and then that allows you to like claim those rewards right so you still had to make that the prediction uh beforehand and then that would earn you a certain amount of potential if they did win and and probably like just just a total tangent to go on here let it be a lesson to all of us that mobile apps or dapps are gonna have to look like that before they get mass adoption they they the the current dapps that we have aren't usually mobile as mo and it's getting way better in the space but for the mainstream audience that that mobile app that you showed that's what it's to have to look like for us to be able to capture an audience any any last questions i mean what about legality have we have we have we talked about is this legal um i think prediction markets are legal right you should um you should dm joey krug um from auger who has spent a lot of time thinking about like building friction markets and betting markets and the legality around it and
