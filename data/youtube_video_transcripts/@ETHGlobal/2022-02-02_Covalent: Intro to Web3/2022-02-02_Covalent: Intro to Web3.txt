wow got a lot of people in here today that's pretty crazy okay thank you everyone who's just joining us right now uh really excited for our next workshop with covalent uh joined here by the uh incredible team leilani and living i'll let them take a moment to introduce themselves better than i probably can but we will be taking questions at the end filter your questions into the zoom chat uh below and one of the two of them will probably moderate them throughout the course of the session so without further ado it's all you thanks uh hi everyone i'm leilani i'm in product marketing covalent um leaping off to you hi you guys uh i'm in uh death row two of us that go by lay so you might have noticed that um yeah thanks for joining our workshop wow there's a lot of people here so that's nice um i'll get started so today's workshop is intro to web3 but we're going to cover a couple different topics um give you a little bit of an intro and also just go into covalent a little bit more in depth and the hackathon resources uh oops sorry there we go okay great let's get started um so here's just a little bit of a breakdown of how things are gonna go today and um luke mentioned we're gonna take questions probably towards the end but since there's two of us if you have stuff that you want to post in the chat um we'll probably be checking that intermittently to whoever's not presenting so a little bit about web3 data trends and challenges um the covalent api so you get familiar with the product itself and how to use it and then sorry my slides are slow oopsie there we go how to access on chain data and then we'll go over some resources like our knowledge base and a couple demos that you can see for inspiration um so i know this is an interesting hackathon road to web3 you're primarily focused on deploying apps on polygon and for some people maybe this is the first hackathon too um so if that's the case welcome that's super cool um we're really big on hackathons at covalent because our company actually started at one four years ago so uh they're really near and dear to us and it's super exciting to be around all the different projects and maybe some of you are newer to web 3 in general so just to kind of set the scene on where we stand in the broader ecosystem here um first of all crypto adoption as we can see in the couple the past couple of years um definitely on the upswing 2020 and 2021 we're both big and now of course we're seeing the markets go red again and everything kind of decreasing but that's the nature of it here um but you can't take away the recognition from really big brands getting into nfts like a lot of sporting brands or organizations and visa and paypal like doing their due diligence with crypto even governments adopting um cryptocurrencies as as legitimate currencies and recently india recognizing the tax uh so that's good and bad but anyway um but if you can see on the right just in the typical kind of trends of adoption of emerging technologies we're still pretty early so i know this graph kind of just goes to 2020 and a lot's happened since then but uh in terms of you know the way that adoption typically goes we still haven't crossed the chasm as people like to say um and there's a couple reasons for that and primarily a lot of infrastructure limitations so building in this space is super critical and that's why it's exciting to be here so um at covalent we try to think about the year the future five to ten years from now basically constantly um and what that's kind of going to look like in terms of the blockchain ecosystem so we definitely believe in a multi-chain future and that's kind of what we've gambled on with everything that we've built um basically applications being across different chains and data that's interoperable and i'll go a little bit further into that once we get into the api but we see like millions of pieces of information on blockchains not just related to finance too um although crypto is definitely the driving force of a lot of the traffic and we see a lot of single use and multi-use blockchains um tons of different applications things that we don't really necessarily know about yet and that comes with a lot more users on chain too um so that's kind of why it's so critical to be building that infrastructure and also building it in a way that's scalable so the problem that we're kind of focused on it's it's sort of two problems one is that data data opera oh my gosh data interoperability here we go um yeah that way no that's such a hard word um but yeah it's a major blocker if uh everybody's kind of building in silos and as you can already tell once you if you're familiar with d5 and you have to you know use bridges and send tokens across different chains to different applications and you don't have all your information in one place and the process is still quite clunky depending on the experience and what you're trying to do and part of that is about basically the read aspect of blockchain so what is what a lot of people are working on is right scalability so how to write to the blockchain in a way that's scalable and people understand um but not a lot of people are focused on how to extract blockchain data in a way that's scalable and verifiable uh and it decreases the the mess of the data on the blockchain which if you have any experience with or running your own nodes um you know that that can be quite challenging as well as expensive and kind of messy so that's what our main focus is at covalent and kind of where we fit in the crypto stack um so our product itself is a unified api basically what that means is we index all of the data on multiple blockchains and then you can query all of the data with one unified api and if you change one parameter which is the chain id parameter you can basically transport your applications or whatever you build across the different chains that we support so once we go to the resources um you can see the different blockchains that we host and you can see how to do that as well our documentation has kind of instructions on how to get started um but it's queryable from the cloud it's a no code api so uh analysts can use it which is a big kind of emerging group um and then you can yeah enable multi-chain in minutes basically so that's the main advantage especially for hackathons i know you will be focused on polygon but um if you want to see polygon contextualize against other chains or if you want to yeah show it in any sort of framework like that then i would definitely kind of make use of the multi-chain aspect there so just kind of what i touched on briefly um this is how the crypto stack looks just for people that might be newer to web3 as well or maybe you get all of this but it's still a helpful refresher but you have blockchains on the bottom here or at the bottom but i guess you know that's the foundation um and then in terms of extracting any data from blockchains to be able to use it you have to run nodes so in basically if covalent isn't here then it's on the individual building these applications to either run your own nodes or find node providers and that can basically just be a little bit costly expensive complicated um if you've ever done it it's just an added step that kind of gets in the way of you building the actual applications and then it's a lot of maintenance and kind of engineering that's required as your projects grow so where covalent fits is a data layer basically so we take care of the two steps preceding that we fully index all of the blockchains and provide it in this data layer which is then queryable with the api so basically you're just using the one api to build any application that you want to and you can check out a whole bunch of different use cases to get started or just play around with it and see what you want to build there uh and yeah the last step is users so that's the that's how it all comes together but basically supporting uh a little bit more adoption in the space and especially making this whole onboarding process easier for people that are new to web3 too so yeah um these are kind of our two main demographics so developers obviously it's a developer product but also analysts um just because it's fast and no code and you can actually try the api live in our docs site so we're seeing a little bit more like journalists and analysts um wanting access to quick and reliable data that they can use in any sort of report that they're building and dashboards and things of that sort so we actually have an analyst mode now in our docs which again we'll go through um and basically you can get all of the responses from the api in a spreadsheet format and then you can download those as well so it's just just a little bit about our ecosystem um our developers and projects and some of the people building with us so typically people will use us for nft metadata for instance um or like deck support or anything multi-chain typically uh and you can see more of these on our website which i'll put some links in the chat later but that's covalenthq.com uh and then yeah i'm gonna pass it off to ley bang to talk a little bit about the specific bounties that we're going to be offering for this hackathon and then go through some of those resources with you as well thank you hi everyone uh now let me take you through um some of the bounties i've got some great questions uh maybe we'll just get to the questions in a bit but let's talk about the exciting bounties that we have for this polygon hackathon love polygon by the way and i think you guys sign up for a really great one yeah my screen okay so we have prepared two bounties for you the first one is uh a two thousand dollar prize pool and i'm sorry to the top three projects that build upon what we have here a covalent nft collection dashboard so what this dashboard looks like is is this it is uh built with a couple of our nft api endpoints and as you can see it provides uh certain information about a particular collection this is a collection view and this particular one is polygon punks right we see uh everything related to the address the symbol the 24 hour volume right the 24 hour sold count so for this one there was only one transaction in the last 24 hours the price floor for the last around seven days i think you can change this and you can you're able to see the price floor for uh you know up to one year as well as all time and the preview of the top five so this is built using react and i will we will be sharing the project ripple definitely and if you click on global view you'll get to this page which is built using our brand new api uh market cap nft market cap sorry endpoint and it is an endpoint that returns every single collection nft collection within a particular chain across different marketplaces across openc variable etc so it is one single endpoint and if you specify the chain id uh which we currently support for five and those five are oh two of them are not here but um ethereum polygon and [Music] uh avalanche these are every single uh nft collection on polygon right are arranged according to the market cap so the first one the biggest one right now is that horse i'm not really sure what that is but we have crypto unicorn we've got chicken derby and all of these have very informative fields that you can use to build your app market cap data 24 hour volume average price transaction wallets and if you click on any one of these you get to uh the individual page right so the challenge for your with regards to this dashboard is that it is a very simple react app it has two pages that returns you certain data all of these are powered by the covalent apis but in particular the get nft market global view endpoint as well as get nft external metadata for contract endpoint uh you will be able to see how they use when you dive into the code but for this challenge we wanna uh we want to have you work on a couple more features for this site i think it's quite a fun challenge for instance what if you can create and deploy nft collections on polygon or any other chain via the site itself so let's say you link it up to a smart contract right you can have a button here that says uh upload my upload an image to mint and nft at whichever marketplace that would be pretty cool so basically giving this functionality to interact with the smart contract using the front-end ui that we've already built because most of the time what we realize is that during hackathons you can build an entirely new project or you can just work on two to three challenging features and if you succeeded that you learn a lot in a process right so again features like interacting smart contracts on third-party marketplaces you can list a cell nft you can integrate it with your wallet like for instance nft wallet or whichever metamask wallet that you have and you can display your own collection empty connection on a new page after you log in so basically providing that uh metamask or whichever wallet integration right right now it is just a non-user authenticated site it is you know there's no user login whatsoever what if you can create like a web3 login that we see in so many sites that's pretty cool as well uh and right now the analytics is as you can see just what it is right it shows price floor information it shows uh average volume the number of transactions it doesn't really show the number of transactions that this collection has but i know the data point is available in the json response uh these are just the pure raw responses that you see for each of these collection what if you know for better more sophisticated analytics you want to build your own calculations calculated fields right that will give rise to better insights oh uh the the uh 30-day average of the price floor say right so all these can be built uh and that's the other thing you can elaborate upon so yeah take a look at the the bounty information from the eth global site and in particular i think the eve global site's bounty information is more condensed if you click into the notion page you'll be able to come to this site which will give you more background about the county that is the first bounty moving on we have the second bounty bounty 2 where you just need to plug our covalent api any kind of use into whichever web 3 projects that you want to build and uh and you stand to win a chan you stand a chance to win in this price pool so we are looking for any meaningful usage of the api so let's say you want to build an nft gallery you use the api to get all the nfts from ethereum chain or polygon chain and display them on the page that is a meaningful use of the api if you are familiar with log events or topic hashes you want to display how many people perform this function or make this function call with this particular smart contract right you use this api endpoint and then you get the right information that you need and you plug it into your site and display it that's a meaningful use of the api you can build all sorts of things with the covalent api these are not just just the api points that we provide we have a lot of them class a m points are endpoints that provide information across all chains right so for instance token balances every single chain will have token balances every single chain will have transactions every single chain would have for instance log events class b endpoints are protocol specific endpoints that provide data specific to particular protocols that means we extract the data from the smart contracts interactions and then we package it up nicely so that you can call them and display them without needing to do further cleaning you probably need to do a bit of further cleaning but without needing to do massive cleaning hey so yeah second bounty build anything you want that includes our endpoints and you'll be able to classify for this price pool uh we in the context of this hackathon we want uh to have special priority to any nft project as well as uh if you use the event specific endpoints they'll give you a better chance but as long as you just use any other endpoint you do stand a good chance to win in this prize pool so that is all i have on the on the bounty side and i'll probably take you through some of the handy hackathon resources that you can refer to of course the covalent documentation and the api reference what we mean here is that the api reference is is the thing that you use most often to get the shape of the endpoint this is the api reference we call it api reference on our end so for instance what this api looks like you can click on try live to to have uh to have a sample response so for instance i get token balances for address this is a sample response for this sample address that i've input here you can put any other address here to kind of see what kind of response you get for that address so this feature on this side allows you to have a quick and dirty overview of the response object historical portfolio value over time you want to build uh an uh analytics dashboard to show what token holdings a particular wallet has been holding over time you can use this one yeah so just take a look at the endpoints here and see what fits into your project use case so that is the api reference the api documentation [Music] is this page we get which gives you some support with regards to what kind of developer tools you can use prima which is a more advanced version of querying the string [Music] the url that you can use and as well as the list of supported networks you can find it here as well but you can also find a list of supported networks here these are lists for the networks but not all endpoints are supported for each of those networks for instance the new ones such as nft global market cap i believe that one is only supported across these couple of chains for now because we've yet to index the rest and polygon all right so all the best your builds yeah um there's a couple questions coming in already and then i guess we can take more now but um viping maybe you have a better answer for one here does covalent have an api for using in cross chain nft transfer bridging i'm not exactly sure what that would entail cross chain nft transfer bridging [Music] so we do not have one for that specific endpoint i can see how that's a really useful one however if you have the smart contract address you can probably query all the log events that means all interactions with that smart contract using the get log events by contract address so what you need to do here is input the input the contract address here and input of course the chain id and it will return you all the locked events of that contract address from there you need to do some further filtering to get the particular bridge interaction that you have hope that answers your question and then i'm just posting the api key sign up just so you see what it looks like you just need your name and your email so it's not um more complicated than that um but then someone also asked about an sdk as well oh and i'm getting let me see [Music] okay so there's this question which is pretty good uh from amman so is covalent like a data broker for blockchain and how is that different from ether scan um [Music] so we are i wouldn't call ourselves data broker we are and data aggregator we package them into uh api endpoints for you to use in building your web app where three web so this it is the same data source right all the data lives on chain that's the beauty of blockchain right but data on blockchain can be a little bit hard to access especially if you need them in aggregated forms if you need them across multiple chains without needing to write one sub-graph or a different kind of architecture for each of the chains that you want to query right so that's that's kind of what we do we try to make life a bit simpler for developers underlying data is all the same does the api enable to run a function on a contract in the past so for our api we are a read-only api you have to for contract interaction you have to um build the right feature yourself is it an archive node running to get the data or all the data is off chain so what we do is that um if i'm not wrong and i need my engineering team to clarify this but we uh we do have an archive node running to get the data so the data is constantly you know gotten from uh on chain sources from all the different networks that we index and then all these data is uh served live so yeah leia's already mentioned that oh quite a few questions leigh has already mentioned so feel free to like touch back on them though too i think um correct me if i'm wrong i don't think we have like our software development kit on the docks anymore yeah i don't think we have that no we were trialing it before and i think we pulled it off because there were complications um but as we go forward so this year um one of the major milestones for us in terms of things we're going to do in tandem with decentralizing is releasing class c endpoints so basically opening up to the community to build their own specific endpoints as well um but that's going to come later on because we have kind of infrastructure to work on and we're in the first phase currently of actually decentralizing our network yep to answer thomas's question log events work only for emitted events right yes unfortunately i think that is how a lot of the data is being stored on blockchains it's quite a strange way to think about it if you're coming from the sql background or any other data storage kind of system but that's how data is stored installed on chain and uh you just need to get the emitted log events and do the necessary filtering [Music] it can be a bit tricky but um there's this very good video i've seen by if global actually on youtube on what are log events and navigating log events and topic hashes if you do a search you can find a really good explanation for the first bounty can any of the other sponsors tech be used yes of course so that's the beauty of apis right you don't you don't have to um use just one one source to build your site your website probably constitutes multiple sources of data multiple stacks or whatever that you want to use where our api is just one could be just one powering one function or one feature of your site with that said we do like to see both meaningful and perhaps more complex uses of the api that will give you a better chance at winning especially if the uh prices are top three prices instead of price pool and uh yes as well as novel use cases right everything is about the idea it comes from the idea and then if you find a really good idea and if your use of the api is simple but you have a really good idea you also stand a very good chance of winning is it possible to get nft ownership history yes you do i think within the nft market cap global view the response data i need to i think that metadata is the best endpoint is it a metadata i think yeah and then you can filter that by specific id or you can also get transactions by contract and see um like the ownership transfers there too yes um the idea of the first bounty yes to eventually much in their miserable so if um the feature that you develop is uh in a working state and beautiful we definitely will um want to implement this into a repo itself and we will credit you uh you can also just build upon it and see what where it gets you um and of course if you're not comfortable with us using it just let us know and uh yeah um [Music] we are it's 1 35 which i just realized so for everybody that only had 30 minutes thank you for coming to the workshop and for everyone that wants to stick around and keep asking questions i think libing and i probably have a couple more minutes so we can stay if there's more questions too but just so you don't all have to stick around necessarily um thanks for joining thank you guys and happy hacking thank you to both of you that was an excellent workshop really really excited to see what the hackers do with covalent tech throughout the course of the event um as i mentioned discord would be a great place to talk and continue the conversation i highly recommend doing it i know i say that for every workshop but i mean it um there are also awesome people as you can see from here so go have fun with that and let us know if you have any problems reach out in the discord with any questions we will be probably closing the session right here i think it'll probably be easier for everyone um and we'll be closing the stream uh thank you to everyone who joined today um and make sure to connect in discord one more time and thank you leigh emily thank you
