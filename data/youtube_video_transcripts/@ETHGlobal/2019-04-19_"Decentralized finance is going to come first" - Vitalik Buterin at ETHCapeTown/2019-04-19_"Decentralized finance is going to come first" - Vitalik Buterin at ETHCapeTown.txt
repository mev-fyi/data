hello hello how's it going it's been good how have you been not bad just a little bit tired is this your first time in Cape Town it is yeah and also South Africa yeah well it should be fun that makes two of us so um I wanted to kind of take uh sort of the next few minutes and cover a handful of things everywhere from how ethereum started to kind of where we are now and then kind of uh just take some uh some of your thoughts on what we can and cannot do with this technology but to kind of go take a step back let you kind of just learn a bit more about sort of starting with Bitcoin how did you get into this ecosystem how did you get to start ethereum and the inspiration around the project uh sure so I first found out about Bitcoin back in early 2011 and the way that I got into this space was I found people who are willing to paint or in Bitcoin for writing articles about Bitcoin and first there was this blog called Bitcoin weekly and then soon after that this um guy from Romania called me hi Alicia reached out to me saying he was challenging a Bitcoin magazine and I became the head writer of that and then did that for a couple of years while going through school starting University then about two years after that I kind of went went full time into the space and I started you know looking more heavily at a lot of different Bitcoin projects and back then Bitcoin projects was basically all that there was started looking into you know covered coins some of the kind of more powerful protocols at the time things like mastercoin and um eventually I realized that there was an opportunity to make something much more general purpose than what already existed and so I that was where my kind of very earliest proposal for ethereum came from like basically take kind of existing protocols that existed at the time like mastercoin that basically said here are 15 different things that you can do here's 15 different types of transactions for them and instead say well you just have a programming language with one type of transaction and inside of that programming language you can kind of Express the logic to just do whatever you want so when you were thinking about extending those existing projects or adding a bit more of abstraction was that based out of a need or or sort of just because you thought it was cool and we should do that it definitely just seemed like obviously the correct way to go and about at the time the number of applications that actually like had users aside from Bitcoin itself was like basically zero for sure and kind of given how the project started with the goals you wanted to sort of accomplish how would you compare that now with where ethereum is and sort of the direction or or even the use cases people have kind of adopted or converged to hmm and one so interestingly enough there we've kind of come for Full Circle in a way so the kind of very early versions of ethereums that were always kind of proto-etherium so even before ethereum the name um came along it was trying to generalize mastercoins Financial derivatives feature and so then after that and then a set of applications expanded and people started talking about non-financial applications like using blockchains to manage decentralized storage systems to manage the to do things like ens like domain name systems like identity management and then all this Enterprise stuff started started happening and of course in the last couple of months people have just been really excited about decentralized Finance so I thought that was kind of fun this is a lot of topics uh that you gotta foreshadowed on what we're going to talk about as a quick uh reminder to the audience we're actually going to be taking questions with the hashtag Cape Town on Twitter if you have any questions you want to ask vitalik can I tweet that question with that hashtag and we'll kind of filter them to me and we'll ask them on stage after the time I guess like given that um that's sort of definitely where the the full circle of ethereum itself kind of came to be how has your particular role changed over the past few or four years hmm and the it's definitely changed a lot especially just because of how the scale of the project increased like five years ago was basically myself and a couple of other people that were just figuring out everything and like figuring out the protocol implementing the protocol the kind of bootstrapping the community is setting up the ether sale back in 2014 and I'm talking to security Auditors there was this kind of fairly small team that just did everything and over time the number of people in the ecosystem kind of went up and up more and you know we've had more layers of abstraction added on so it grew from being one team so this big ethereum foundation that contained multiple teams and then now well last year we've launched the grand program and now uh of probably the majority of the things the foundation funds is outside of the kind of quote Foundation as an organization so I feel like many of the things I focus on have kind of become a bit more um a bit more high level though I mean the result the result kind of always some of that so like back in 2014 I wrote and a blog post about like shelling coin which was this idea for a decentralized Oracle and like auger ended up to I think taking a lot of ideas from that we're talking about a lot of these in a different Dao Concepts and then maybe in uh a bit after that I focused more on just getting proof of stake and sharding figured out and right now I basically think that like most of the res almost all of the research problems are around well uh definitely around all around proof of stake and most around sharding have basically been solved and so now that it's at the point where it's uh like the the spec for it for at least the first phase of ethereum 2.0 is entering really finalization stages and then the phase one is further further behind but still like nothing fundamentally unsolved and then phase two is lifting the work currently and focusing on trying to start piecing and piecing together so I've been heavily involved in some of that but then I also you know focused spend my time thinking about kind of more high-level things around the Dio design like economics governance and all these other topics that's awesome we're going to dig a bit deeper into 2.0 uh soon um kind of going back to um the way you think about ethereum as a platform what are some of the applications that you think are sort of useful to you or just in general you would like to see and kind of where do you see is there's an opportunity for us to introduce anyone from a smart contract platform to a blockchain yeah and in the short term I think like the decentralized finance stuff that's been happening definitely has is providing things that are useful and currently and providing things that have value to people and I feel like we've always had this idea in the space that finances going to come first and the usual kind of reason why I think that's the case is just because if you compare two existing technology kind of other outside of watch-in Finance just is the sector that's the most terrible like in many countries like even really developed ones like the United States like you'd be surprised just how insanely and efficient it is to move money between accounts and once you start talking about International payments then it gets even worse and but anywhere outside of payments like we've people are already kind of used to you know just being able to spin up whatever you want in one click and so the bar that anything decentralized blockchain has to compete with just purely usability wise is higher but I think like now that the technology is starting to get better like it's definitely here at the point where things outside of the ascent of nearly Financial applications can really start taking off so when you say decentralized Finance are you kind of in your mind referring to some specific kind of uh financial instruments or subsets of what that includes or is it just the movement in general where you can have a better efficient system doing the same things we have right now it's definitely a broad category so like for example most people would say maker accounts as essentialized Finance auger accounts unit swap counts but then these tends to be fairly kind of pure applications like stuff just happens inside of the crypto space and people use it and there's not too much connection to kind of things out outside of a blockchain in except for maybe kind of the price feeds because it gives you do have to like connect up to what the the actual value is of like a dollar or whatever but then it's there's projects that are starting to kind of poke out more and make things that are Financial but also kind of more closely connected to real world things so for example there's been a couple of projects trying to do and if the block smart contract based insurance and these tends to be in the parametric Insurance some applications so they say you know you put money into a smart contract and if say a like a flood happens or there's not enough water or the temperature is like above some uh some value of then you automatically get a payout and I know there's a project there's a project called hurricane guard that's been trying to do this for natural disaster is there something in Sri Lanka trying to do it for crop insurance so that you know area seems like something that more and more things are happening in and I guess like maybe a bit briefly what are some of the I guess barriers to entry right now in terms of implementing these types of solutions compared to like kind of offering the same in the Jerusalem Finance so right now a lot of the models we see in D5 are sort of collateral based do you think there's a way to sort of evolve past that um evolving past collateral based not sure because you know they're over collateral yeah I mean you can definitely improve collateral efficiency but then you could argue that the collateral kind of based design of the whole thing is is an advantage in some ways but like one in terms of improving collateral efficiency right one of the interesting things that we can think about is that like I know this is part this kind of model exists in Africa and it exists in other places too there's these kind of rotating kind of clubs where people this kind of coordinates to kind of put money into into a pool and and the designs differ but basically it's to kind of help people save but potentially you could also turn it into an insurance sort of application kind of application and so if you try to and if take these social models where you say you have groups of people that are participating together then often enough like in and reduce the ambulance of capital that you that you need because you can sort of share more and I guess in this case like where do you think identity and reputation kicks in or is that even directly related yeah um identity and reputation is definitely something that's very important I think um I mean as so first of all uh well it depends what you mean by identity and reputation because the words just to be inside five different things like one meaning of identity is just being able to prove that you who's trying to spend the money is the same and like whatever it is that that received the money and this is just user account security but it's basically an identity problem and there the challenge is that like the default approach to doing this is that you just have one key but then if your key gets lost or if you get stolen then you're basically screwed um and trying to move beyond that and trying like one of the things I'm a fan of is this kind of social recovery approach that says you know you have five friends and they each get a share of your key and it's kind of mathematically set up in such a way that any three of your five friends can recover your key if you lose it you could do a similar thing for key revocations so things like that are something that I'm interested in and the nice thing there is also that if we can create a kind of robust kind of identity management solution um like just for doing things like that then you can actually kind of migrate it Beyond just on blockchain things and even just to use it as an identity system for off blockchain applications so that's one kind of identity just this kind of full purely sort of self um self attested the other another a second kind of identity is trying is the incentive anti-sibil metrics so this is coming up with some kind of token where it's easy to get one but it's like extremely difficult to get many um and this is useful for like voting schemes um it's it's useful for a lot of applications but this is the sort of thing that and you you could definitely use blockchains as an ingredient but there's also this big design problem of how to actually make it make me systems and then the Third Kind of identity basically is reputation which is that like it's not just about proving you are like you are something and it's not just about proving you are unique human it's about proving that you have have certain properties right and uh this could be and if other people attesting to your trustworthiness it could be um other people or even organizations um saying you know this we've verified something about this person government's saying we verified something about this person but like then we start kind of talking about this idea that you have this ecosystem of the ability of P of identities to make claims about each other and that's something that you can definitely leverage for like reputation and credit and all these other things I hope everybody's taking notes there's like four ideas for a new identity hack here this weekend I guess one other thing sort of uh what we've seen in terms of historically a lot of new and breakthrough Technologies let you sort of uh LeapFrog uh some of the existing infrastructures um in terms of kind of seeing where ethereum or blockchain in general plays a role in in certain geographies um how do you kind of think about use cases for those types of things anywhere from like maybe different ways of voting or or finding a misappropriation of funds to like other unique use cases that may now be possible do you have any thoughts on throughout the topic here yeah and there's definitely an opportunity for blockchain based projects to just take away at an air in areas where existing in infrastructure as either in a very far behind or just that doesn't really exist at all right look there's um there's definitely parts of the world where you you can just say well oh you know what's the point of this when you have your centralized like C5 apps that you can just use to send money to to other people within a couple of seconds but that's not something and even just going beyond beyond money like even just things like Insurance things like even just giving people the ability to invest in things and all of these kind of other bigger services that are part of finance that go beyond just like sending money to people um also outside of Finance like identity even identity and reputation too like I think these kind of socially driven models of identity occurred even potentially a leapfrog more centralized models of identity in places where that kind of centralized models of identity haven't really been fully established established yet so I think that's something interesting because it makes sense right because like the information about who is a kind of trustworthy and cruise willing to voucher for whom is something that and if is pretty a decentralized thing and more social yeah yeah I mean like the the concept that it should that it's something that kind of gets centralized into these kind of formalized Institute institutions and numbers is itself pretty new so that's also something that I think it's worth looking at no it's awesome um so I guess Finance is not the only use case that we we see for ethereum or blockchains in general um there's a lot of a lot of people at the soccer thumb they want to build stuff and and are looking for ideas um what are some of the things that be cool for you to see um people hack on anywhere from things from your wishlist to kind of cool improvements or additions that you would like to see hmm I get in I think I've already said a lot of the things that I don't care about especially uh and I I especially once they try to NFC things that move either move Beyond Finance into these other areas or kind of combine elements of Finance with elements of these other areas um the other category of things I haven't mentioned is probably enough supply chain related stuff but I mean that's just an area that I personally am kind of less familiar with like exactly what people have like have done so far in and what the benefits are but it's definitely something that's worth exploring um in general I'd say just Innovative approaches to just solving these problems and in in terms of just here like people's ability to kind of connect with each other and and trust each other and all these things in a verifiable way yeah um um another thing I care about also is trying to like this is like technically harder to the next level but doing all of those things while preserving privacy and like I mean zero knowledge proof technology has just Advanced forward Leaps and Bounds over the last year and it's something that there's basically tools for it to start working with so it's definitely something that's worth starting to explore and like you definitely want to take privacy seriously in these applications right like you don't want the facts that oh Bob trusted Charlie 60 points but then Bob decided to decrease his ratings which is interesting Charlie 30 points like you don't necessarily want that to be on a global public Ledger um so that's like for a lot of these applications I think there's ways to do zero knowledge stuff to get the benefits but without um getting the without kind of uncovering everything so one example of this that I liked is um like in cases where you want all you want is like basically one of the things I dislike about kind of the way the path that and move many parts of the internet are taking is this Trends award just using centralized identity as a crutch for everything um and basically because it's like the we're often enough the problem you're trying to solve is much smaller right so for example if the problem you're trying to solve is just making it difficult for people to create 10 000 fake accounts then like sure you could solve that by just capturing everyone's identity but then you've broke you broke privacy but there are ways to do it where you still preserve privacy right so like for example if you have some existing identity system then on top of that you can put a z cash like kind of an anonymizing and mixing Gadget and then basically you just use zero knowledge proofs to prove that you are one of these approved identities that's been that's been checked by some system without revealing which one and then you also reveal a magic number so that you can't kind of reuse that identity that identity again without actually revealing which one it which one it is that um that you've consumed so things like that I'm also I'm pretty interested in um also when we talk about account Security Solutions almost a big part of this is just the usability like you want these things to be just like and accounts like like this is some like account security is just a hugely important problem right because like if you actually want people to be using you know like decentralized anything then they're interacting with a they're going to be interacting with it through some kind of identity and either that identity is broken or that identity is secure because it's controlled by some centralized mechanism but then you're losing a lot of the benefit or it's secure through because of some decentralized mechanism but then that's the thing that we have to build right so like if you want to actually use any of these decentralized Financial Solutions to and expect people other than existing Tech Geeks to be able to use them and benefit from them then you need some kind of so account security solution the uh that works for people right and that will even that works for for people that just haven't had that much exposure to computers yet and then that's a hard challenge absolutely and it also sort of ties in with the scalability of the underlying platform too and we kind of touched on E 2.0 but could you sort of describe uh sort of the goals of what the 2.0 clients are and kind of the phases and and just give us an update on uh the progress um sure so and for those who haven't heard this before I mean the ethereum 2.0 like first of all it's the two kind of major Flagship components of it one is Casper which is our proof of stake algorithm which replaces my mining proof of work consensus with something that at least we consider to be more much more efficient and the second part is sharding which is a kind of massive scalability improvements that happens because you don't need every computer to in the network to process like every transaction in the Network anymore so it's split up into three phases where phase zero basically does proof of stake phase one does sharding but just sharding for and of verification of data available ability and phase two does kind of full shorting including verifying like transaction execution smart contracts and all these other things so at the end of phase two it's a complete system but then for phase zero and phase one it's it's still kind of part useful for some things so currently the phase zero spec is like very close to completion The Phase One spec is kind of further behind but the fundamental components are just all are all in place and it's just an editing job phase two is still a bit further away but it's rapidly working on that in terms of client implementations right so there's these multiple teams that are mostly even not part of the ethereum foundation itself though many of them are supported by grants that are building clients so basically like nodes that would run as part of the ethereum 2.0 Network and that's um like so far the ones that are furthest ahead so that would probably be a lighthouse Nimbus maybe Prismatic they've been and I know Nimbus was the first to like publish a test net I know Lighthouse is going to publish a I think publish a test net fairly soon so it's or definitely getting to that stage um would you sort of mind just telling us sort of what the performance improvements end up being with these implementations and kind of what is the change we're seeing sure so worth sharding the goal is to get about a thousand factoring increase in scalability um basically just the way you do this is through not requiring every computer to process every transaction right every computer only processes a small portion of transactions and that removes the kind of biggest scalability bottleneck in the whole design that was an X that's awesome um one of the the things we've done in some of our previous chats is a section called underrated or overrated and the way that suction works is that I'm going to say a topic and you get to comment on if this is underrated or if it's overrated in terms of why um so we'll kind of list the handful of topics and maybe we can get some more from from the audience on Twitter but uh I'll kind of start off with D5 underwriter overrated [Music] definitely slightly getting overrated at this point but but I mean the parts that are underrated I think is like the part that basically tries to kind of push this stuff from Theory into practice and tries to see and look what does it actually mean to get like if this stuff provides value to like people even just outside of the crypto space how do we actually realize that value and that's something that I think it would be good to get more attention on specifically stable coins underrated or overrated probably and I'd say people talk about them enough at this point so is that uh underrated or overrated hmm um honestly also in a slightly overrated let's move on to the next one yeah Bitcoin Forks Bitcoin Forks um I mean I think bsv is like still overrated for as long as the market cap has multiple digits um in Bitcoin cash I think even actually underrated at this point and basically just because they've like I mean if you actually follow the community they've become they're just become cons considerably more sane ever since they've expunged the Bitcoin SV people and like they're going like they're getting snore signatures ahead of Bitcoin like that's that's cool yeah yeah like they've got like real tech technical talents in there it's getting interesting what about uh Forks in general hmm Forks in general I'd say underrated like I think at this point especially if he wants to launch a new decentralized chain then like forkeying an existing one is like I think even better than doing an Ico or like an eye whatever oh basically just because that's and you just get a much kind of you get a much better coin distribution that way you also again can tap into an existing Community um more people like you and fewer people hate you um yeah I mean it does have a lot of uh a lot of benefits to it and like even if you like do a forking out and add a pre-mind like it's just like that space I think is actually like has actually been native underexplored relative to just other ways of launching projects that do have tokens in them no that makes sense uh what about uh blockchain governance um depends what is which Circle you're talking in I think if the circle is crypto then definitely overrated um if the circle is ethereum actually honestly overrated as well um like basically because I think like especially in the short term well for talking about governance of ethereum then most of the things that ethereum needs to just survive and prosper the next couple of years are not really contentious governance issues like we know we need one point x we know we need a layer two we know we need 2.0 and Casper and sharding and it's um I'm not convinced that kind of two weeks to governance itself can really improve things by the that much in that regard and what can improve things is definitely I know two weeks to things like ecosystem funding for example that was actually my next topic ecosystem funding underrated or overrated um definitely still slightly underrated at this point um I mean we've like I'm actually really happy that the ethereum community is starting to kind of start tackling these issues of um funding public goods in the ecosystem seriously and trying to experiment with different approaches that go beyond the ethereum foundation like I think it's it's definitely healthy that the foundation is not the of only source of uh of funding because just with anywhere like every organization has weaknesses every institution has blind spots and so the more that we have to cover for each other is blind spots I think the better a chance the ethereum ecosystem has absolutely and kind of similar to what we've just kind of talked about um the approach that a 2.0 clients are taking to build this thing independently of the foundation if you have any comments on that is that underrated overrated unexplored um how do you see that it depends which aspect so I think in general the model has been very successful like the and the original goals of this right were basically to say that we're going to push the job of developing these 2.0 clients outside of the foundation and the foundation is going to develop one client which is the python client as a reference implementation but it's deliberately written in a soil language and so it's the what's the rationale for uh kind of offloading that to yeah you know we basically just want to prevent the foundation from becoming too big a point of centralization because in is 1.0 we've just noticed it's become this kind of Geth and parody duopoly and it would be nice to I mean the fact that it's a duopoly and and not a monopoly is something that actually saved us during the denial of service attacks some a couple of years ago but it would be healthier to have have even more clients so we want to have that kind of balance of power in the community and and also just kind of Ensure against the risk that the ethereum foundation will just have internal governance issues and not be able to get attacks together so it's it's one of the incentive strategies of you know let's support different approaches and hope you know well and these approaches are going to work pretty differently and if even if one of them succeeds done the things you can get off the ground now of course and I think in the ethereum foundation has been done quite well over the last a year over the last year and a half in many ways and there's definitely many ways that it's improving still but I think the grant program has been one of the biggest successes um the thing that I think is that I think it's doing the East 2.0 client ecosystem is doing a bit incorrectly is that I think it's gotten the level of decentralization has gotten to the point where it's duplicating things too much like we're talking about like how many implementations was it Nimbus Prismatic Lighthouse um shasper Pegasus Trinity Harmony Geth um the chains chain safe um Dean arguments thing I forgot the name like 10. and yes um so basically uh like these 10 like going from one to three to four and five is good but then these last five like it first of all they're not they're queer there's no way that we're not gonna have we're going to have enough resources to push all 10 to the best level of quality and so I think the thing that these implementations should try to do is they should try to potentially specialize more and specialize more in different things so for example one of them could specialize more in light clients the other could could specialize more in the developer tools or validator tools and potentially they could even like share some components right one so basically instead of having 10 things that are copying the same thing like you'd still need some like some amount of copying for redundancy but a bit less than you have now but instead you have more kind of branching out into different areas and into different philosophies um also kind of going a light client first as one branch that would be good to see mobile first which is pretty similar um a light clients for ethere four eth2 inside of ether one and like inside of other blockchains um a Litecoin for each two inside of a snark circuit like there's definitely um different things that you can't the that you can do and I think of trying to be more and of creative and imaginative in that way is something it would be interesting to see more of the 2.0 teams doing no it's awesome um in uh so one of the questions I kind of got before uh when I was coming up with the list of questions here was sort of it feels like a lot of the contributors are from the U.S or North America or Europe how can somebody who's not one of these regions like how can they get involved in kind of this ecosystem the development and kind of uh just in general like with with these projects like can I do you have any thoughts on sort of um what the ways are and maybe kind of contrast that with the grants program by the ethereum foundation as well yeah I mean first of all I'd say like even like Asia as a region is starting to do pretty do better and better Tech wise like I was just in Korea last week and there was a team there that was just working on a pretty novel way to build a plasma implementation and they actually got pretty far so that would that made me really happy um so I think it depends on what region so some regions I think are handicapped by language like basically they um the resources are mostly in English I mean and if you don't speak English and even if you don't speak English as a first language that just puts a huge barrier in front of you trying to participate in the ecosystem so supporting translations is one thing that we as a community can do to help um otherwise also in just education in general in general but then if you have those those things then like if people have if people have the the kind of the knowledge and the skills and I kind of know where to go like a lot of the teams are pretty Global and they'll be happy to just have contributors from in like Africa or India or just South America and anywhere um but that's you know there's obviously a long way between between kind of the status quo today and everyone who potentially could be contributing actually uh actually having that knowledge so I mean trying to you know close those gaps is definitely something that's important absolutely um sort of tangential to what we've talked about um I wanted to ask sort of the question that I think that's kind of been popping up a lot recently uh to a lot of the a lot of the people in the world uh certain messaging apps are the Internet by all means um and when you have sort of a scenario where uh anywhere from different apps having hundreds of millions to billions of users um to the audience there that's kind of what they know and and kind of see as as how do you get access to information if any of them cannot offer anywhere from decentralized type solutions to to uh kind of issuing their own money or currencies and kind of just promote Financial applications leveraged by blockchain um do you think that's a good thing is that an app positive does that kind of negate any of the existing kind of beliefs that either you or the community holds and kind of how do you perceive that and that's definitely one of those kind of double-edged Swords like it's like a big part of uh I guess it depends on like the application it depends on you know whether like what you see the benefit of like blockchains and decentralization as being but I mean at least to me it's definitely a big part is definitely just kind of empowering people not just as consumers but also as producers and that's something that I think like blockchains even just do really well because it's not just that anyone can use an app it's all adapt it's also that anyone can just go ahead and build one and that's something that I think is really valuable and we should try to preserve more hmm that's fair um so we're actually just going to move into the Q a part here um and there's a lot of questions that I've received so far so I'll try to ask as many as possible um and I'm going to start off by uh the first one which is um will will the blockchain data stay in gigabytes or or what are the plans for it to be smaller in the future the blockchain data um so the I mean the history can only grow right but what we are playing I think the client developers are thinking of doing is kind of pruning history so either not storing history that's older than say one year or just moving it to some different data structure like could be ipfs or some kind of shorted data store of some kind so that would knock things down the size of the states or the amount of information you need to have on hands to just validate the next block that's something that um there there are proposals to try to decrease so there's the rent proposal there's a stateless client proposal so those are things that are going to starting to happen um so there's definitely plans to try to reduce the amount of storage requirements of an ethereum node in multiple ways no for sure um I guess one one other question we have from the audience is what are sort of the biggest ways uh e 2.0 will change how uh people build their adapts um I think um just as a developer being kind of relying like the the environment is going to become more asynchronous so because especially if you have adapt that scales to more than one Shard like you'll have to you're not like you're not going to be able to communicate between different charts exactly the same way as you can communicate inside of like one charter inside of each one 1.0 today so coming up with uh kind of programming patterns that that you know deal with that reality I think is um going to be one of the challenges um also I expect data to be cheaper relative to execution so approaches that are more kind of and and relative to state so expect approaches that are more kind of data heavy and less execution heavy and state heavy on chain are going to make start making more sense [Music] um hmm those are probably um we're hoping that block times are going to get faster and that they're going to get more regular and that kind of short range Forks are going to become more rare and so the experience will be a bit closer to what you you can expect to get out of a centralized system okay well um from a question from a tweet that you did earlier today what would the world have looked like if you had gotten the internship at Ripple oh I don't know like we can skip it yeah okay what is your favorite meme my favorite meme specifically the one he would choose to represent yourself oh that's not my favorite meme [Laughter] I don't know I don't I I don't really have a list of like favorite what are some of your favorite memes am I supposed to have like a meme on a list of memes on hands that I like how do I answer this I I don't I don't keep up with the millennial culture anymore I don't know yeah we'll come back to this one yeah we'll come back to it okay um on other less serious note uh who do you think is ethereum's biggest competitor um well ultimately the existing centralized systems Anne's new centralized systems to try to kind of take just enough elements of blockchaining to look cool better but actually just are the same old stuff that we've had for decades um I guess I guess when you say that does that mean you kind of envisioned this as a general purpose one solution for everything type platform or or is it more of the fundamental technology itself lets you do this thing but different solutions ethereum is definitely not kind of but or by itself not optimal for every use case I mean there are plenty of cases where he just wants to build centralized things there's plenty of cases where you need decentralization but you don't need a blockchain there's cases where like you just want some really high performance specialized thing sometimes you might want some Layer Two thing that's on it that's um connects into ethereum and so there's definitely different trade-offs for different applications that make sense to do things in different ways no that makes sense um in terms of so there's a question that says is there a possibility that nation states could censor or block ethereum or dapps and if so how would they do that hmm could nation state sensor block ethereum or taps um you know there's definitely things that they can do easily that they're not doing already the simplest one is just Banning exchanges um like if you just make it like five times harder for people to get cryptocurrency and then that just makes it significantly harder for any application that depends on it like even the non-financial ones to get a very large scale adoption I mean like and like will the space be able to kind of survive if the whole like if most of the world does that even even that's an uh an unproven hypothesis I mean if they want to do more then there's definitely in the different kind of ways that they could attack it but then there's ways that these that platforms could Harden themselves and then it starts becoming pretty complicated do you kind of Envision that as a cat and mouse game or is it more of and it's definitely there's definitely cats and there's definitely mice so yeah fair enough um one that's actually correct um did you know there's also pigeons one one other question we made from the audience and we'll kind of get maybe one or two more in and then we'll wrap so when I visited Korea last a couple of weeks ago I saw a meerkat okay go ahead what's the question um do you think uh side chains will be redundant in the future and kind of maybe for for context kind of just go over what they are and so by I guess if by side chain knew me in this kind of older idea that you have chains that just have some kind of connections or some uh some other chain the end that don't really have where the secure new model basically is that you do have to trust the side chain yeah I mean I honestly think like there's not much need for those like the only kind of sidechain that really makes sense is the non-custodial ones like plasma I uh I would say um well in plasma plasma just basically is the word for the category of non-custodial side chains so I mean I'm definitely kind of bullish on those things um otherwise like things that require trusting kind of specific groups of nodes where like it's difficult for users from far away to to determine whether or not they should be trustworthy like why do that that's right I got two more and then we'll wrap this up so um one question from the audience is uh what are some of the the risks for this ecosystem or things that keep you up at night [Music] um definitely just the biggest risk is us not being able to do the to build things kind of uh fast enough and like the usual thing that people say is you know like oh if we don't build this fast enough things fast enough then a like some other blockchain competitor will take over but the other risk as I mentioned that potentially is even larger is that if the space takes too long then like existing centralized systems will just continue improving themselves and we'll have lost a big opportunity to just make you know decentralized applications and data layers that could actually be the foundation for like a generation of applications getting built on them no that's great and and kind of just to finally end um what does decentralization mean to you and and why is it important yeah in decentralization also means of lots of different things to different people and it also just depends on what yeah what application you're You're Building um I would say some of the biggest benefits are like a big one is just trust right so like if you're building something and you intend it to be like infrastructure or a platform that other people build on top of that's something that really just should be decentralized because that's like the way the only way you have to just really make like be should clearly show to your users that you're not going to kind of sweep the Raga from um from under their noses or whatever the expression is um when the when they've already built the plot built the platform and they're locked in like even just the facts that we use the word platform to refer to just centralized things maintained by one guy is kind of sad honestly um like I think if we're building things that entire kind of entire economy is and ends up relying on it should just be something that's kind of common infrastructure that you once it's built um there's not like one party that can either get either get hacked causing it to uh causing the whole thing to stop working or kind of become a monopoly and start trying to extract rent from all of that or get captured from some political interest that represents only a small subset of the users of the system so I think having some kind of of prop properly decentralized base layers for many things is something that makes sense I'm also just um generally interested in this idea of just building new kinds of new kinds of mechanisms and new kinds of ways to kind of motivate people to collaborate with each other and like there could that could mean an economic incentives it could mean things like Dao's it could also mean you know if social incentives possibly some combination of both um and there the goal like one of the big goals is just like that's the more decentralized approaches just are how you get better information efficiency like as I mentioned right most of the information about how trustworthy people are for example like who's um like what things are valuable to whom how valuable are are there are different things like that's does that doesn't exist in central servers that exists kind of split split up between all um 8 billion of us and so that's like these more decentralized approaches that allow people to kind of participate in all parts of the ego and all sides of the ecosystem I think are something that are really valuable in that sense um that metallic thank you so much for being here no thank you [Applause]
