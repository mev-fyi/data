[Music] awesome okay cool so we're going to move on to our next chat um which is going to be uh with kaida um so the title is called treasury and sustainability uh 10 billion opportunity um so yeah kaido when you're ready feel free to uh yeah there you are um awesome to have you back on the youth global stage um and i will turn it over to you all right thank you so much and thank you global for organizing this this is great uh i'll share my screen really quick give me one second so today i'm going to talk about treasury and sustainability a 10 billion dollar opportunity hope that's a good enough cash line for everybody so first a little bit about me i work on the incentive design la mado my work encompasses governance design tokenomics liquidity management and my goal is to create systems to help protocols achieve their vision in this very cyclical market and at la medaille we're building the economic infrastructure for dows and here are some partners we're working with or have worked with in the past such as away uni swap and many others and previously i was uh with trader joe which is a decentralized exchange on avalanche which with about 2.4 billion tbis is peak and this is where when i joined we had about 40 million tbl so during my time there i saw first hand the explosive growth you know these protocols can have and also a problem when this growth becomes hard to sustain so you know one day a protocol could have billions of dollars at this disposal and in a few weeks that become a tenth of that and in a few months they can't even sustain their team and have to lay people off and eventually close the project so i become interested in the sustainability of crypto projects and i have also went on to propose some sustainability projects for game economic designs and liquidity system to combat this very cyclical nature and this sustainability problem however sustainability of a project is multi-faceted so in this talk i will focus on one thing which is protocol treasuries and how can we use that to um ensure longer sustainability so the goal for this talk is to answer a few questions so the first one is what is protocol treasury why should i you know bill for it uh the second one is what are the current solutions in the space and lastly the most important to you guys which is what can you build you may have know by now i'm not really great with powerpoints but i hope this will be a fun and actionable talk to you all hackers out there so what is treasury and what is the problem here so protocol treasury's definition is a very general one it's assets owned by protocol for future development and this is really broad by design because one encompasses different functionalities here so maybe a few examples would help us to understand what this really is so a few examples of what uh protocol treasuries are used for grant programs right we see the price pool for uh heck money and these are given from protocols and normally people would incentivize others to build on top of their own protocol another big spending is on ecosystem building where you want to build partnership with other protocols and sometimes that involve monetary value transfers and lastly which is actually the biggest uh part which is budgeting so you know you need to pay your salaries for your team you need to pay for operations you need to pay for your marketing and also events and outreach and all these the the out of these treasury use cases the last one budget is actually the biggest on the high end and next we're going to just switch gear really quick and talk about you know how big is this space so on the left you can see that this is just a time series plot of total treasury value across time starting last year ending this year so right now there's currently about 9.5 billion dollars in these protocol treasuries and it has increased 10x in the last 10 months and if you remember in the last 10 months there's not really any bitcoin or if you're in price actions so a lot of these come from native uh doubt protocols launching and doubt building up and when i first heard about it i had an overwhelmingly positive response you know i was like this is amazing you know these protocols are doing amazing things and they have so much capital to attract talent and innovate however there's a catch most of these protocol treasury is made up of this native token and i will showcase you know in this slide how concentrated that that is and in the next slide i'll discuss you know why this may not be a good thing so we first start off with unisop's treasury makeup so unisoft is a decentralized exchange on ethereum it's the second largest protocol treasury it has the second largest portable treasury at 1.6 billion however 99.9 percent of that value is in its own uh unit token uh udx is another project i'll go stablecoin living on solana with the third largest protocol treasury at 620 million 99.4 percent of his total value is locked in his native token and maker dow one that everyone a lot of people was very familiar with it's the 14th largest protocol territory value and 99.2 percent are in its native token and some people might think i'm you know i'm cherry picking here i am a little bit but well a few projects you know protocols have a little bit more non-native assets the percentage is still very high so right now lido is one of the ones who's doing extremely good their decentralized 2.0 staking solution provider even though they're doing really well they are the fourth largest treasury treasury it has the fourth largest treasury value still 88 percent of this treasury is in its own native token otherwise mango market on solana out of the 500 billion they have 88 percent so you can see this trend as in most protocols where most of these 9.5 billion dollars we're talking about here actually in um highly concentrated in different native tokens out there so why is this a why is this a problem uh there there are three main problems with this high level of concentration number one is you know the market is very volatile so there can be sharp decreases in your treasury value um you know these downturns where most people in crypto are very used to nowadays your valuation can drop 50 percent to 95 percent just in a matter of weeks for example unisop in the last six months is total treasury value dropped by 65 and the second thing i want to stress on which is the most important thing is growth normally requires cash but not native token i'll try to elaborate here a little bit what does that mean a very simplified model if you think about like how these things work is treasury rewards people and people drive growth right however in the end people still need to trade with the market to exit your native token to pay for their daily expenses however native token is really really hard to exchange into cash or eurium or other very liquid assets for example if we use one percent of unisoft's treasury one percent which is about two million unit tokens it will cause you unique swaps price to drop forty percent and if you wanna use ten percent you know swap treasury you will actually make your unit swaps price go to zero so this is extremely harsh for the protocol itself and also its community and lastly why this is a problem is the huddle what i call the huddle versus sustainability problem imagining you're a protocol founder or your protocol member uh or within the team and you want to tell your people tell your community members that we need to diversify or we need to sell our tokens to give to others how can your team how can you be a team tell your community members to huddle and at the same time dumping your own token right this requires careful communication and more importantly an important and explicit agreement with the community that what you're doing is okay and everyone agrees and it's on the same page however that it's very very hard to achieve so if cash is so important the the question we should answer is how can we generate cash from treasury and in this slide i want to talk about basically what are the current solutions for protocol treasury to achieve this to achieve sustainability to generate cash to continue growth as you can see here i put potential in parentheses because some of these projects are not live yet or it has not gained significant traction due to its complexity or for just due for other protocols to utilize for these current solutions i divide them into three categories so i call them innovative solutions tried by solutions and low-hanging fruits however this categorization is not meant as seeing which layer is better than the other because many times simplify a simplified solutions actually wins however we i do believe we're in still in the searching phase in which we're trying to find more optimized solution to handle protocol treasuries so on the bottom here we have the low hanging fruits what i call them these solutions already established and have been used by protocols the middle one are tradify solutions they are these solutions basically borrow existing established ideas from corporate finance and implement them into unchained contracts on top are innovative methods and i this these solutions are less utilized in the traditional world or less known to most people but brings promising ideas to crypto and i also added in a risk spectrum because a lot of these things involve risk the things on the right would have more risks and things on the left however you should know that these are all relative risks and these risks are very different based on different projects so first on the low hanging fruits there are a few very simple low-hanging fruits right you can sell your token on the market which i would suggest using mev protected trays and also using dex aggregators the second is native yields so for example if you are a protocol your treasury has usdc and you're not spending them you can deposit you can be basically be a lender or ave or compound to earn negative yield or you have ethereum you can even become you can exchange for state e with vito to become an e 2.0 staker and on the far right we have these what we call yield aggregators such as year finance convex pulled together and many others and what they do is they you don't know which one has the best yield for your assets so you just give it to them and they help you optimize that in the middle are trying to find solutions uh there are three main buckets for tradify solutions i talked about here fixed-rate lending debt issuance and private investment in public equities and i'll talk more about what pip means a little bit later so fixed-rate lending is very straightforward you have some amount of capital you're not utilizing now can deposit them for a fixed amount of time for normally a higher apr or guaranteed apr right now element finance notion finance and many other projects support this that issue is very similar as in in some cases you collateralize your native tokens and you borrow money against it and then these you can basically use that money to generate income or you can use that money to pay your pay for growth and the two key uh two very prominent figures here are for refinance and debt dial their mechanisms a little different i'm not going to dive into it but they have very interesting design choices lastly is p-i-p-e this is just sort of like if x and z wants to invest in a coin that already is public so what they can do is what people call a strategic investment sort of these otc deals facilitated by otc trading firms such as genesis trading and lastly are what i call innovative solutions or these solutions that are you know less familiar to most people and uh so we have uma we have log we have fae and ribbon and each of them have very different design choices i'm not also sure there's a lot others out there that i don't have time to cover and to fit into this graph and then in the next few slides i just want to quickly go over each of these innovative solutions to give you guys a kind of an understanding what they're trying to do and how maybe you know you can combine different ideas together so first is uh uma success token and in the past you know i talked about otc deals and really what would happen is let's say for example um a16z wants to buy lido what would happen would buy some lighter token what would happen is it would contact the light of dow and then they're going to have a real live legal contract and for example if lido right now is one dollar they're going to buy it at uh 0.6 dollar per liter or 2.7 dollar collider unlock it for two years the problem here is that it's very hard to generate community buy-in that is you have to go into a legal agreement through otc desks so it's so one example that didn't pay now was for sushi swap they were trying to diversify but they couldn't because community voted down and what uma does is that he actually instead of buying a discounted price for these private investors they can buy a current price but their upside is that if the token price increase above a certain price or what they call a strike price they can have more upside next is log protocol streaming auction so in the past protocol sales only is a fixed price and the problem is that it's hard to agree on token a sale price for a community because everyone have different opinions and it's hard to make sure everyone is happy and what lot does is it's a continuous streaming option based on t1 as a specific set of uh uh automated market maker and people can basically convey capital and withdraw online capital and at any time this movement will change the implied price of these government tokens next is fake protocols turbo and in the past basically what you can do is i have mentioned is a protocol can deposit their tokens into ave or compound and use out as collateral and borrow against it however most protocols do not meet the risk parameters to be listed on avec or they do not meet the parameter sets for using something as collateral because those needs to be really liquid and there's a lot of systematic risk abe has to protect against uh the lenders so what fake protocol does is that you can collateralize your native token and you can earn interest on its cash value with turbo meaning if you have 10 million 100 million in your native token you can deposit that you can borrow 10 million 10 million dollars which is you know 10 of that and they use that 10 million dollars maybe generate uh 500k per year a percent stable yield to pay for your different expenses ribbon uh here they they are ribbon is a sorry this is ribbon treasury and in the past basically if most workers do not have a diversification but they don't explicitly say what we're going to say we're going to sell our tokens for cash and the problem here is that because it's just hard to agree on diversification during a bull run right when the price is increasing no one wants to no team wants to talk to the community that oh we're going to sell 200 million or 2 million or 5 million tokens on the open market because that doesn't make anyone happy so what ribbon does is i create discovered cobalts which basically give protocol the freedom to diversify based on some price target and earn free at the same earned premium at the same time ahead of time so you know you can decide during uh during a crab market or a bear market that in the sometime in the future this is something we're going to do and in that case everybody knows ahead of time and that's very easy for people to generate buy-in i've been talking a lot about you know these different ideas what people are building and now the question is you know what can you build just by looking at this you may seem like actually there's most things already exist however if you remember i mentioned that although these are solutions there are only potential solutions a lot of these tools are extremely extremely hard for developers to understand and especially for those who doesn't have a strong strong finance background and the trade-off of different you know parameter choices for any of these projects is very hard to visualize so the adoption in the system of the system in protocol tertiary is still very low and this you know resonates back with the 9.5 uh billion dollar slide which you know 90 to 80 percent of the treasury still sits in stable point i still citizen's native token not really earning anything or producing anything so what can you build uh in this part i basically want to give you guys three kind of methods to think about this problem with three angles to think about this problem so the first thing is to uh to build something that can there's something existing and we want to decrease the trust assumptions of that essentially we want to call the agreements on chain so there's two two examples i give here the first one is the token swap contract what token swap is is a way for protocols to exchange their treasury tokens with other protocols to build partnerships for example on protocol a their protocol b we want to engage in some mutual relationship what we can do is that we can exchange our treasury token so we own uh some value in the other project but at the same time we can you know engage in governance and many many other things however there's not a very great way to code this contract and then for every time you want to engage in this relationship normally a new contract will be right but will be written the second thing is the private investment in public upgrading your work you can think of this otc trades mostly right now happens off chain however there could be some you know simple contracts people can hook up for for for a hackathon where you can think about how can we make that unchained in a way that not just otc that can utilize them but also other other people can uh other other people and also other dows without legal entity can engage in these transactions next is to decrease the coordination friction basically these are two kits to manage these positions uh like i said it's it's really complex um for people to think about how what's the correct strategy or even maybe the correct strategy doesn't exist so some very simple ones are simulators for payouts i think based on some past data a very uh based on some heuristics this is you know what we think the payout will be or what are some risks on downsides on sensitivity analysis is very traditional financing stuff the second i think is very underrated which is you know easy to understand front-end i know we have team building on decentralized uis i think those are very important and also important is to make sure they're easy to understand for users because if i am a uni swap token holder i shouldn't be an expert for treasury diversification or management so how can you present something that uh the voters or the governance token voter holders can understand and engage with is very very important the last one is brainstorm you know new ideas for you maybe heard some idea back in your graduate econ class or undergrad math class or any kind of class or any kind of concepts outside the crypto world and bring them into the crypto world through making making a chain transaction and i think those are the three main ways where for for a hackathon project i think would be great to see some innovation in those fronts and i will if anyone is interested in talking you know about this feel free to reach reach out to me on twitter at xerox kaido and i'm very very happy to help you guys out to you know narrow down your space search space and etc and that is the end of my talk uh i still have a little bit of time so i would love to answer a few questions if anyone have any thanks kaido i'm just taking a look at the chat see if there are any just a quick question jacob what is the like general background for these hackers we have yeah it's a good question i think it's it's a it's a very mixed bag of people um but but certainly the main focus is everybody's very interested in d5 so um i think it's it's largely a group of people who want to build the things that you just built i think are you just defined so i think that's interesting um i guess one question that comes to mind about the talk that you mentioned um right now we are you know seeing this big advent of treasuries growing in the last like couple months as you mentioned um we are kind of still in in quite a a bull market um which makes it difficult like you mentioned sort of like trade away from from growth like how much of this problem do you think is uh simply like mathematical slash like uh like almost like a liquidity problem versus like how much of this actually ends up being like inner dow politics or treasury politics and being able to like win people over like how much of this is math and how much of this is feeling do you think yeah i think that's a great question which goes to this slide um about you know your friend is now your exit look what you mean uh so in my opinion i think most projects who think about long-term they know this is a real issue and so it depends on project by project basis but for most of the project i engage with i think the the team and the general community realize we need to build a ward chest doing it for the bear for for a potential bear market and i think that's very very important and i don't think there's a lot of inner politics against this i think it's more on the communication maybe as in how do you communicate that from the inner circle of the project to the outside circle people who you know maybe have a more speculative that on the token price gotcha very cool and i think the low hanging fruits uh it's not enough right now so that's also why i don't think we see a lot of hype in the space and uh the reason being if you think about these low-hanging fruits what it requires that you require is non-native assets so like how if you don't have nominated assets those doesn't really work very well and that's where the try to find solutions come in to generate those non-native assets and i think they're good and they're great i think they're a very good first step however at the same time how can you innovate on top of that at the same time moving forward while keeping it simple and for people to understand and use gotcha awesome um cool i don't see too many other questions in the chat perfect perfect yeah this is a great talk thank you so much for for putting this together sharing um obviously it's a big topic right now it might not feel that way because things are going up yeah but it's going to be very obviously important in the future where things aren't always going up so yeah exactly exactly all right thank you so much for having me and great great event and thank you for organizing and i'll see you guys soon
