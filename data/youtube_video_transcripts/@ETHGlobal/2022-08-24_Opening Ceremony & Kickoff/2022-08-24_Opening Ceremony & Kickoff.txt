[Applause] [Music] welcome everybody i'm super excited to welcome all of you to eat mexico [Applause] a hello to everybody watching this on the live stream i am kartik what a co-founder of youth global soy evan vernon is my and we're about to start this thing so most important thing this is not a conference conference these events are organized by eth global and our mission is very simple we want to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem this is a hackathon we believe if this is a place for you to build things and show and learn and get better at what you are excited about and we really want to make sure that you are showing instead of talking about what you're doing because these are the values we admire the most and we've done this around the world buenos aires india bangalore san francisco waterloo in toronto canada london uh amsterdam new york and that brings us to mexico city this is an incredible event we have 580 attendees from 27 different countries all in this on top of that we have 65 mentors who are here to help you learn anything that you are excited about and we're doing 10 workshops on how to get better as a web 3 developer and just three talks presentations conferencing what he said and on top of that we're giving a hundred fifty thousand dollars in prizes muchalana and making all this possible are 16 incredible partners so i want to give them a big round of applause as i thank all of them here so ave grand style dydx ipfs file coin lens protocol polygon wide connect world coin mina protocol super floyd the graph abacus chain link gnosis chain coin spec espacio crypto and rabbit hole they're all here in this building making sure that you are successful and with that let's talk about what the next three days are going to be all about bueno empresamos con este lugar dares tambien como se huertage so all attendees must wear their badges and their wristbands to be in the building we have tight security here it's a small venue it's a private event you want to make sure that you have your badges and wristbands at all times and simply put see i [Music] because we're on a busy street just let's keep in mind that we're not hanging outside in masses after 8 pm and just let make sure that we're not loitering and of course in case something goes wrong in a medical emergency we also have an ambulance waiting outside so we'll be here throughout the weekend so if if you need any assistance please let us know bueno i'm maposte lugar por toro por todoro in los pasitos we're not gonna go to the map but it's posted on the walls and there's a lot of activities happening today and tomorrow so we have an nft exhibition created by a noun style amigos it's all the way at the end on the hallway please check that out we have a digital photo booth you can take photos and get selfies with you and yourself with the team uh we can also play foosball right next to the nouns fair there's also a little carnival setting here and you can also learn how to do art beating tomorrow upstairs in the build hacking space at 3 p.m all of that is on the website schedule but before we go into all those details let's talk about communication everything we're going to be doing officially is going to be on discord see ike university of discord it global global.com diagonal is i think what evan said was you're in person talk to each other something like that i see every announcement we make which is whether it's about the food the prizes any messages if something changes or anything is or for things that are also on track all these will be announcements on discord and we're also going to send you some calendar invites so you know when submissions are when judging is and all the important stuff that's also on the website in mexico that's where everything is all right so we're going to spend 10 minutes on the logistics of how the hackathon works so the most important piece is hacking officially begins now and you can start working on your projects and you can work on a project with up to five members or also on your own and from here you have 36 hours to hack which means submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on sunday tarantulas everything you're going to be submitting today should be done from scratch which means you cannot work on a pre-existing projects you must start everything today yeah i already said that this is this is lack of coordination and to win any prizes you and all of your team members must be officially listed on your dashboard and if you have any questions about something not being clear or if you're having technical issues please find us and ask us so we can help fix this quakia pregunta yes me personally and we have a lot of workshops and talks a few of them already started today a few of them will be after we get off stage but make sure that if you're interested in learning more about any technical topic you are here in this main hall that's where all the talks are happening and even if you are tired or you want to catch up on something because you missed it it will also be recorded and you can watch it instantly on youtube grab and even if you missed that you can go back to your dashboard and use to find a team feature and meet other members who are looking to join a team or are looking to add others to their team and the most important piece is submissions are due at 9 00 a.m do not forget this deadline um so there's going to be two streams of judging all at the same time there's a main judging and for prizes happening with the sponsors they both happen at the same time so i have to figure out how to coordinate all of this in parallel and we'll get there in a second so for the main judging you have four minutes to demo and we recommend that you record a video of your project so that in case something goes wrong with live demo you can still show what you built and we do not we recommend you do not do this thing last minute and keep at least an hour to work on all of this for your submissions in the dashboard and for the sponsor judging when you are submitting your project you get to choose which prize you are going for make sure you select it otherwise there's no way for us or the sponsors to know which prize they need to look at so do this immediately as part of the submission and when judging starts you have to go find that sponsor at their table inside the main building and present them the demo so you can do this thing before your main judging or after but all that's happening at the same time and in terms of how to behave over this weekend our code of conduct is very simple you can hear the full rules and criteria for being a hacker and the code of conduct by going to eathglobal.com rules but in summary please be respectful and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated in any form of regulations yes find me if you have any questions and next up what we want to do is bring on some of our amazing partners to come here and tell us who they are and why they're excited to be part of heath mexico so without further ado like to welcome stani from ave and lens to be on stage gm super excited to be here and amazing amount of people it's it's definitely uh incredible uh weekend gonna be and those of you who are new to the ethereum community welcome uh this is probably one of the best ways to start your journey so i'm from arvin and the other team has built the the avi protocol which is a decentralized finance protocol where you can supply cryptographic assets and earn interest and use those assets as a collateral to borrow liquidity and it's one of the biggest protocols out there and also we built lens protocol which is a decentralized social media protocol which you can pretty much integrate to any application um yeah for today we have um some interesting uh bounties for everyone who is hacking on lens protocols so we want to see a lot of creativity uh during this hackathon um so we're we have a track for audio implementation so we have the first uh price of four thousand dollars um stable coins um and second price is a thousand five hundred so we're looking some interesting use cases that could empower music creators um and also music eurasia curators as well we also have a category of content discovery so first prize is four thousand and second prize is 1500 and this can be for example finding curators or creating leaderboards or some very interesting ways of discovering content and of course we have a photo sharing four thousand for first price two thousand uh one thousand five hundred for the second price and the idea is that you can create some interesting use case for photo sharing and hopefully include the audience um as well and anyone who integrates the lens protocol uh gets automatically 100 dollars so that's something you should definitely be doing um yeah and also it has a dispatcher so essentially that means gasless and sign less transactions and that's super amazing um yeah one thing is then on the other side so we have grants sponsored by the other grand style essentially first price is nine thousand second price is five and a half and and third four thousand and the last one is one thousand five hundred for the fourth price so this is where the creativity comes into your play find an interesting way to integrate the ave protocol or build something very fascinating on top something that is um might empower the d5 ecosystem or anyone um anyone beyond like bfi can be something new that we haven't seen before so we're looking a lot of creativity and also we appreciate applications that are uh incredible incredibly well designed so go creative and go crazy and just like let everything out and that's it and enjoy the hackathon and have fun and remember it's uh it's not a competition it's a place to um make most out of your time and and find new friends and and collaborate thank you [Applause] thank you so much stani next up we have steph and alex from polygon please welcome them on stage [Applause] hey everyone gmgm i'm steph yeah so again good morning so excited to be with you all here at mexico again we're both from polygon and polygon is ethereum's leading decentralized scaling platform polygon is the platform for ethereum awesome so we have lots of different scaling solutions but this weekend we're asking you to hack on polygon pos which is our proof of stake blockchain solution proof of stakes so some of the benefits for building on top of polygon are that if you're already an ethereum developer amazing you're also a polygon developer you can use all the same tools and languages that you're used to it all works exactly the same except you just connect to either our main net or our moon by testnet is [Music] you also get all of the security of ethereum plus the scalability of polygon with low cost transaction fees and gas and really fast transactions which i love when i'm building las vegas [Music] great so we have twelve thousand dollars in usdc in polygon prizes this weekend uh we have four different prize categories or problem statements that we're asking you to hack on in usdc in stablecoin categories [Music] 3. great so we have broader explanations of these four problem statements on the eth global website so check that out but we're really looking for you to solve problems in these spaces not just chase bounties but we will have multiple prizes per problem statement so yeah on the website [Music] and we'll be here all weekend so come visit us in our booth and we're all going to make it on polygon thank you namaste [Applause] thank you alex and steph all right next up we have sebastian from wally connect please big up give a big round of applause for sebastian [Applause] hi everyone hola todos um sorry i can speak both english and spanish so i kind of got confused so well connect's a remote secure signing protocol and basically what that gives you is the opportunity to have with your wallet and interact with the dapps in a secure manner while connecting is [Music] most likely you have seen us use wallet you have used wall connect with this qr code which allows you to um well you know you've probably seen the qr code with the web3 models we have lots we've been growing ecosystem like we have lots and more dabs just keeps using us we're like one of the default options usually besides just recently we just launched version uh two of wall connect uh right now we are trying to target for uh four different products but right now for this hackathon only the sign api is working so what this means is that it's the same feature as the version one walla connect where you can just do remote uh signing of of transactions but the biggest difference is that it it's a revamped api and you can have uh wall connect multiplexing i mean uh websocket multiplexing so that means that you with one websocket you can establish multiple sessions and it's also multi-chain so basically we are using chain agnostic improvement proposals to have multi-chain capabilities all right um for this hackathon we have two tracks we have the version one tracked and if you want to get a dap working i recommend that you just focus on using the version one of our connect basically if you want to have it app use version one if you want to figure out like some bugs with or issues with version two or like try to do some inter multi-chain apps i recommend that you use while connect version two although you're likely going to bump into some issues uh with wall connect version 2. an application problem and you i can give you more details about what are we looking for in the prices yeah and that's it thank you very much mucha gracias thank you sebastian i know it's not easy to do back and forth in two languages i definitely can't but i really appreciate you going through everything next up we have miguel to talk about worldcoin please welcome miguel on stage [Music] yeah i want to leave this here because otherwise i have no hands yeah gm buenos dias i'm not going to the whole back and forth thing but if you want to hear this in spanish you can come to our booth after and some of us speak spanish so it should be fine yeah we are super excited to be here as part of our incentive to open source the protocol decentralized and i just thought i would talk a little bit about what exactly we're solving um so there's this thing called civil attacks which is when some person pretends to be multiple persons multiple people and this stuff really begins you for things like social creation airdrops nft is pretty much anything where you would expect people to be actually people and we're building a protocol that allows you to say i'm a real person and i have never done something like boating minting all of these things in a completely anonymous way it's called wall iv and that transition should not be there but it is a protocol to anonymously verify that someone is a human that has never done something before so especially now with recent events we know how important it is to have privacy and to have privacy by default and we are kind of building the civil systems the entity layer that actually has that from scratch and so again you can say i have never bought in this poll without revealing any other information about you that works thanks to that thing the orb sorry that thing uh which makes sure that you're a real human and then gives you a key that you can use to generate signal as proofs that any application can then verify both on and off chain with an api um yeah the setup is really simple any user can verify through the orb then projects will request using a qraco similar to wildconnect actually powered by them um which will show a prompt in the worldcoin app saying do you want to verify this and that will take care of generating the proof send and sending it to the app you can send it and say and basically all of the hard stuff is taken care of for you this is kind of all of that you need to get set up this will show them all this will do everything and now for the first time we also have a full react version of that so if you're dealing with react it is that this easy and basically this shows this kind of captcha that allows people to click in and verify it with basically no user friction so if you have any kind of website you just saw this from there in the background is a lens integration which is pretty recent and then the user would just take off the phone scan the qr and boom they can verify that they're human completely translated this has lots and lots of use case you can use it for quadratic voting funding nft means social incentives all of these really cool things and we're excited to see what you can make um we have our own discord discordg.walcoin where you can where we can give you feedback and we'll also be at the 8th global discord and on our booth and around so if you need any feedback at all feel free to ask we have also put together a list of resources starter kits documentation everything is at worldcoin.org mexico and yeah let's build together excited to see what you make thank you so much and next up we have ipfs and follow coin unfortunately they're not here in person yet so they record a video for us so we're just gonna play the video for all of you to learn about who they are and what you can win everyone my name is carlene i'm on the ecosystem growth team with ipfs and filecoin welcome to eth mexico we're thrilled to support another event organized by eve global and i'm excited to be kicking off this event with you today now let's briefly talk about what we're excited about ipfs is the peer-to-peer protocol replacing the centralized architecture of today's internet making the web upgradable resilient and more open and filecoin is the largest storage network built on top of ipfs that ensures content persistence over time and with storage helpers like nft.storage filecoin is becoming web3's infrastructure layer for nfts which many of you will be using to build your projects does your project have a unique or significant use case for ipfs and filecoin well we'd love to see that we invite you to visit the event site or scan the qr code to check out our challenge statements and prizes for inspiration we've got twenty thousand dollars up for grabs we've also provided some great learning resources to get you started with ipfs and falcoin in literally minutes we've got an amazing workshop on ipfs and filecoin that you're not going to want to miss also we hope you stay in touch with us we're available on discord and you can also book office hours with our devs to get your questions answered submit your amazing projects to win a prize and most of all have fun we hope that you enjoy the experience you're in mexico after all build really cool things and make new friends i'm excited to see how you
