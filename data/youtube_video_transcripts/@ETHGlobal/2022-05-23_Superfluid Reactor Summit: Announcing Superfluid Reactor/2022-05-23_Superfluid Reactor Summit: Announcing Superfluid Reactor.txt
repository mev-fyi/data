[Applause] [Music] next up i want to just without further ado bring on our very first speaker for the day and that is friend from superfluid and uh without further ado let's welcome friend to really tell all of you about the superfluid reactor welcome friend hey everyone uh thanks for inviting me um i guess uh yeah i'm very excited to be here i'm gonna share my screen and show a short presentation while i do this so welcome everyone uh to the superfluid reactor summit we're extremely excited to have so many people joining in to listen to this we're very excited to be partnering with eve global for this we're we've got a very strong relationship with global we've sponsored a lot of their hackathons and it's a great honor for us to be able to have this platform to tell everyone a bit more about our ecosystem our community and the future we see enabled through our protocol so first of all let me just do some sound check here i hope by now most of you know about superfluid but just very quickly superfluid is a defy protocol for digitally native programmable cash flows we enable users to stream money on chain with no capital lock up and with full programmability so effectively superfluid is a protocol what this means is that it's a shared means a shared set of rules that govern the way information or value is transmitted right so what we're doing is we're building the rails we're building the rails to enable a new kind of finance that happens in real time because money streams happen every second so everything needs to be kind of rebuilt to use and to adapt to these real-time money streams and the way we envision this is a completely free-flowing economy right where money can flow from application to application from hand to hand in a peer-to-peer fashion on the blockchain with no friction that's that's what superfluid means superfluid means no friction but obviously a protocol in itself is not that useful right it's just again a set of rules that govern the way information is transferred what's really necessary and what we're really building for is for builders like you to enable you to come and build applications that leverage this cool technology that we've uh invented right but that in itself is not useful there's so many use cases that can be explored there's so many different verticals there's so many different uh ways that streaming money can really change the way a lot of people experience uh the transfer of value and that's something we can't do alone there's just no way we can explore all these different niches and industries where money streaming could potentially have a big impact and this is the reason why we're always trying to build for builders we're always trying to invite more and more builders to come and explore the opportunities of the superfluid protocol so far we've sponsored over 20 hackathons we've had over 400 projects built at hackathons we've we're incubating a lot of projects although so far it's been mostly informal we have a lot of integrations and there are a few projects that are already live and that you can go out and test right now that leverage the super fluid protocol but ultimately what we noticed is that a lot of products tried to build something at a hackathon but it wasn't quite enough right a lot of people don't know how to go from a project built at a hackathon to a real life production application that step is not that easy but that step is what we did and it's what we can help you do right superfluid was born out of hackathon which means we know how to go from a hackathon project to a real-life working startup so we asked our community we said you know how can we help more of you more applications uh go from you know the prototype stage to the production stage and obviously a lot of the people who even replied to this question were people that we had helped right because we helped a lot of people you'll hear a bit more about this uh from the next presenters but we've helped people build on superfluid and go and build startups from their ideas but we never formalized that and what what the response was was pretty clear we need to create an accelerator so what i'm announcing now is actually the superfluid reactor which is an accelerator focused on your growth we help startups that build on superfluid by selecting the best ones the best teams the best founders and the best ideas to come and join our community and start building with us we follow you from fundraising building the product and launching the product and securing those key partners that will get you started as a rocket ship and not just as a hackathon project and the best of all is that all of this is free we don't charge neither in money nor inequity so it's 100 free and the applications the projects and the teams that we select will be able to go through all of this free of charge and this is a very big difference compared to most accelerators out there who take a significant part of your equity now if this is interesting to you sign sign up here so you can just go to reactor or square foot finance you can find all the information there's a sign up form and everything is there but let me just tell you a bit more about the ways that the superfluid reactor can help you get ready for production and again the superfluid reactor's objective is to get you to fundraise and to production after that it's up to you so we're not going to do the work for you but we are going to help you to get there so the first thing is technical guidance now as uh vincent says from our team it's very easy to learn solidity it's very hard to master solidity now building an application for a hackathon is not the same as building an application for production right you can make something that works once but working once and working a million times with no faults is completely different and we can help you both architecting this but also developing the right practices in terms of testing in terms of adversarial thinking that are really necessary when building in web free now unlike web 2 as you might know webfree contracts are generally immutable there's a lot more that can go wrong and there's a lot less you can do about it so it's very important that you know the architecture of your app is correct and if you're coming from web 2 there's a lot of new things that we can help you quickly learn about so again building a prototype is not the same as building a production application and that's where our guidance can really help you accelerate along that journey now second the second thing i'd mention is product refinement right if you look at uh most uh web free products they're not that great but some of them are amazing now how do they do that they do that through uh interviews they do that by talking to their customers by hearing their feedback and by by basically adopting that feedback quickly and adapting over time so the way we can help here is obviously with general product management practices but also with introductions to who your actual users are right imagine you're building something in web free but your target user is not some it's not really a category that you are that familiar with right in that case you can talk to us we can introduce you to the people that you need to talk to to actually understand what that category's needs are right and this is very important in the product discovery phase on top of this you can always book one-to-one time with our product manager vijay which means you know you can get his insight get some of his expertise and this is something that's always going to be available for the super fluid reactor participants obviously building a great product is very important but you also need to get the voice out right you need people to know about it and in this regard marketing is the way to go but marketing web free is again extremely different to marketing in web 2 right if you think of web 2 most startups spend almost all of their budgets on advertising right they'll give their money to facebook to google just to blast out advertisements and that mostly works for them in web3 that doesn't work at all if you spend money on twitter ads nobody's going to read them and in fact that's generally bad practice and people will actively ignore your product if you advertise so how do you do it how do you get out there what you need to do is build a community how do you build a community well that's really hard but we can help you right we've built a community at superfluid we have some people out there who are passionate about what we're building and they are the best marketing tool that you can possibly have in webfree because in webfree marketing is organic and this is something we can talk more about we can help you and we can also introduce some of those early supporters that can really help you build an audience which ultimately is what you need when you're launching a product in web3 on top of this obviously building a great product is important but you need to also get to work it you need to be able to get those first customers and perfect your product to the point where you meet product market fit now how to do this uh there's a lot of different ways right you can try and build in isolation and maybe your right may be wrong but the approach that we generally suggest is to try and involve customers in your journey as soon as possible and this is what we suggested to tony from diagonal you're going to hear a bit more from tony after after me but what we did with them effectively guarantees that the daily launch they launched with great launch partners with a product that is specifically tailored to their needs and uh basically with the best possible partner that they could launch with so we're very excited to help help them and we're very excited to hopefully in the future enable more people to launch great products with immediate uh go to market now how do we achieve all of this well most of this is not going to be us it's going to be people we introduce so introductions are by far the most important thing we can do for you and this leverages over uh five years of uh industry connections that me and my co-founders and our team have created right we've been in the industry for a while we know a lot of people a lot of people know us and people respect us so if we introduce you to someone they're going to listen right and they're going to help you and that's the single most important thing for product interviews for marketing and community building and of course for those key partnerships and those key launch partners that can help you go to market much quicker right so the people we can introduce are you know all sorts of different um different key people in the industry and of course the best investors ultimately whatever you do in webfree is going to take time and time is money you're going to need some sort of investment this can come from the community or it can come from venture capital investors or angel investors we have a very broad network of investors we can introduce you to them and most importantly there's a lot of investors who are looking into our ecosystem they're very excited to see the next application built on streaming money and they're very keen to explore those applications very early stage so this is the perfect pipeline for us to introduce you to them very early and get you with the right resources to get to production much faster so overall if this has sounds like something that you would like go to reactor.superfluid.finance and apply now it's a very short form that you need to fill in we'll get back to you and what you can expect is periodic check-ins introductions help throughout throughout the time that you spend with us connections with other people in the reactor project which means you can you know talk about your experiences and help each other and of course some exclusive perks for superfluid reactor participants now what else to expect from today so we have uh over three hours of content so during this reactor summit we're you know very pleased to invite a lot of people from our ecosystem so you'll have people from ricochet diagonal huma finance and these are all applications built on superfluid none of them went through the reactor because it's a new thing but we did help them in different ways to get ready for production and we're very excited to have them now come and share their experience share their learnings with the rest of the community after this we'll have two panels the first one is about webfree native business operations and here you'll see some of our partners request network queen shift and unlock protocol who are building um basically products or protocols that help businesses operate on chain this is something we are very passionate about because at superfluid we enable basically recurring payments right so these applications are using us to provide real value to real web-free businesses and that's something we are very grateful that we can partner with them about after this we'll have another panel with people from maker dow and usdc so we'll be able to discuss stable coins and on-chain payments on-chain payments in our opinion are something that's very unexplored and needs to be explored more so we're going to talk about that and we're lucky to have some you know very important experts so thanks a lot for listening to my talk i assure you it's going to be the most boring so the rest are much more exciting but all i can ask you now is if you don't follow us on super follow us on twitter superfluidhq and maybe follow me as well and now i'll give the stage back uh the cardig maybe there's a few questions we can we can answer and then we can move on to the next speaker absolutely first of all this is this is incredible uh and uh thanks for kind of formalizing it i know you've been helping out a lot of uh teams already a lot of them we're gonna see right now uh come on on stage and talk about what they've been doing um i guess my broader question is um overall kind of if you can just give some insight into how do you think about managing this thing for the first kind of cohort here like is there an expectation how many teams you want to get into uh the first round or um essentially like what are you looking for in terms of what stage they should be at like maybe we can start there well we're hoping to get pro projects basically straight out of the hackathon right as i said superfluid is born out of hackathon you know if global is kind of very embedded into our uh history and for us uh getting projects when they're still got that um that excitement from the hackathon is the best time to really propel them at the moment we don't have a clear number in mind but there are definitely some projects that won't make the cut for the first uh for the first cohort but there's definitely a lot of room still so if you're out there listening one of the reasons we wanted to launch this during hack money is because hack money is the best defy hackathon in the year right so we expect to uh hopefully find some great projects here and bring them into the reactor and help them from here to go forward so don't have exact numbers but uh it'll be a i'm sure it'll be a good cohort because i've already seen some of the applications and they're pretty exciting and then this just in in the best interests of the teams that are going to be applying we often see a lot of people think that they're not good enough and they end up disqualifying themselves so maybe if you can give any comments on like what do you think is kind of considered a a acceptable level of kind of progress so that they can convert their hackathon projects into something broader like is there any advice you would give to like when they should think about their being ready of course um it's really not so much about the product it's a lot more about the team and the motivation right the product obviously is important right i think what a lot of people are going to see is now with the market shifting a bit there's not as much money out there so bad ideas are not going to have as much funding as they could have had maybe six months ago so really a good idea is important but ideas can change over time right what you build at the hackathon might not be the idea that your startup builds over the years but your team is not going to change your founding team your cohesion your motivation and your grit right your your basically determination to make it is the most important thing so whatever whatever you're building when you apply just make sure that that comes through that we can tell that you are determined to uh really make this happen right and then i'd say you're good amazing well that's excellent timeless advice and uh thank you for uh kicking us off today
