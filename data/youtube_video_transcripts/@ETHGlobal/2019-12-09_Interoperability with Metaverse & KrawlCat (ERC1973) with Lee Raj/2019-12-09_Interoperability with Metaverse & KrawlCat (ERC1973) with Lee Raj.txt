okay thank you everyone for coming here for this workshop we really appreciate it without hackers or people like you this kind of event is probably not very successful so it's so would like to appreciate everyone from our team so a little bit about me I am the tech needed crawl cat I am also the author of ERC 1973 which is a standard on scalability a layer to scalability for the 3m Network and right now I'm mostly most of my work is kind of focused on building decentralized ecosystems a little bit about my journey to give you like from where I have been and what I and where I am today so in 2016 I started as more like a crypto rider so I wrote a lot of articles on early Bitcoin etherium as well as a lot of white papers during that time then in 2017 I was actually a volunteer here in each Waterloo I couldn't get him as a hacker so I started volunteering and that's how I got here at that time I built a lot of I SEOs I got a chance to work with some thought leaders in the community at that point I worked with the creator of ERC 20 token building some early ERC 9725 research on identity and reputation systems but then i didn't work a lot on that area and moved on to being a full time blockchain developer at the company I am here today I architect a lot of different applications for smart contracts for decentralized oracle systems and then this year i pushed boundaries of innovation with our company and put forward the 1973 year c standard which is quite of a component here that you guys will try to hack around with it and now i kind of focus on building decentralized ecosystems so a little bit about very short kind of introductory things for our projects that are behind this workshop so DNA is it's a matter verse dual chain Network which is aut EXO base chain with a proof of work and proof of stake architecture consensus mechanism that enforces innovative concepts like digit identities assets avatars kind of something that you guys will be working with Crockett is more like generalized Oracle similar to chain-link that brings data from web 2.0 to web 3.0 and facilitates interoperability along with providing real world data to the blockchain network again the ERC 1973 standard is a layer 2 scalability that helps you kind of build decentralized applications without hitting the blog guest limit so it helps to distribute rewards to tens and thousands of participants without you know without running a for loop or getting into a situation where you you hit the block guest limit and you're kind of stuck with it right so the the goals of this challenge is quite simple your task is to achieve interoperability which is like communication between two closed networks right it's one of the pressing issues along with scalability and decentralization in the blockchain industry so if you kind of feel ambitious so feel free to go with it so for the hackathon judging matrix you have five factors right you have technical original ambitious design UI and Val factor I probably yeah this would most likely fit into something like original and ambitious original because it's one of the key pressing problems in the blockchain ecosystem right and ambitious because it's a little tricky to understand what the protocols and kind of figure out how you can navigate to it the price is 2k Canadian worth of DNA tokens which could be traded on an exchange later on and but make sure your team at least have some experience with solidarity or JavaScript otherwise you might find yourself stuck a little bit especially with JavaScript and web 3 so if we go through the ideal solution this is what it's kind of going to look like you're going to facilitate cross communication between these two closed protocols and your most of the code base is kind of gonna look like server-side code base with web 3GS and objects you can run a node.js server kind of account management right so my neighbor's is more like a Bitcoin based chain right so it has UT exo's and if theorem is we know it's externally own accounts and you won't really direct with any in the smart contract that you will interact with is the ERC 1978 so you can just call the public functions and you'll be fine so here we are so your task is again to achieve interoperability and let me go to the repo here to kind of guide you guys into a step by step process so this is the repo so it's kind of in-depth post feel free to go from there and if not you can just check the link here it's it Waterloo task so your architecture is pretty simple so here so this is the matter verse Explorer right so we have the UT EXO a base chain here so you pick an address here and there are concepts of avatars and certificates that are that you guys can mostly read into these two articles they're very well-written so then you can just check ok here we have avatar right so we have our here and then we can paste the addresses here so then you get this nice little link here right you get this nice little so as you can see it's like a JSON object right so now you have these corresponding maybe we can go to adjacent formatter yeah so here so as you can see from this JSON object he can find this address right which is the matter verse address and then you can see some more information from it there's an original address this is the issued transaction and there's a symbol which is somebody's name that they kind of assigned to this over there so again you can see this address is this symbol here and the original address so using this API Explorer you can you can choose to go you know you can figure out if you want to work with avatars or you can work with certificates or you can even work with raw transactional data if you want and from these addresses right so you pick these addresses from the murderer chain and then with the help of a web 3 library you are gonna create corresponding III diem accounts so for example this address could will be corresponding you can run this function create accounts web 3 right it's one of the Stack Overflow answers or something right but look I'm just go to library so here you can just create use this function in your Noche server and create a corresponding interim addresses and then they will be mapped to these addresses right and once there's a created you can store in a data structure like hash map or arrays or whatever you like and then you can start working with the ERC 1973 contract here so ideally if you have to complete the task gets very simple you can just whitelist your addresses into this function admin ters that's kind of the basic thing but if you want to get more creative after that right you want to do I think that's where they're krusk of the task lies in how can you get more creative in creating crypto economic environments will you be able to create some form of incentives for the participants of the addresses some some things like could be I think I put in some examples here ok here so for example you could create environments right where you so I guess I'll give an explanation of ER seats 19 a little bit before that so yes in 1973 what it lets you do is that you can you can register any externally own accounts right your etherium addresses and any of these participants can trigger the contract and bring rewards into the economy for example I think this is a best way to understand it here so if you look at this robson transaction here right so what happens here if you can notice that at the first transaction you had two participants in the network right you have two participants in the network so when there are two participants in the network and one of them wants to withdraw after some time he gets sixty five divided by two which is thirty two point five equally divided right and then at this point when the contract was triggered again there were-- so one block is equal to one token you can think of it this way so hundred and one at this point means that there are one hundred and one blocks passed from the last trigger point so you so at this point you have four participants in the network so if somebody had withdrawn their rewards at that point it would be twenty five point two five right 101 divided by for the last withdrawal is the first guy who was registered here right so so it's thirty two point five plus twenty five point two five which is fifty seven point five so that's what kind of this years in 1973 let's see Lu it lets you build scalable decentralized applications so that's where one of the areas you guys can think of more creative ways to do it right so going back to the tasks here right so here we are yeah so for example you guys created this corresponding accounts right and then you white listed these aetherium addresses on on your node.js server right and after you whitelist it and with different triggers you you could have certain business cases where you can say okay you know what each one aetherium token would be equivalent to ten tokens in the maribor's chain or you can do another interesting things like with different digital avatars right each one of them you can think of them as like 721 each one could represent something of more value or if you work with certificates or identity areas it would be something like okay you know if your domain is certificate holder you get more more kind of token value but if you're in less in the hierarchical chain or less Authority chain you get kind of less token value right so that's kind of creative things that is up to you guys on what you do on a basic level all you need to do is create the corresponding accounts and trigger this specific function in the smart contracts which is which is add minors here you will put your etherium address and then it's mostly white listed but after that what you do with it it's up to your creativity and I think that's one of the criterias where we will use to judge this yeah but I think that's kind of short and sweet on this if I'll be more than happy to take any questions or anything that I need to repeat for any one of you any questions yeah yeah I I was told that I should speak a little slower as well but I could I could repeat any areas that that you would like so I think like in short this is kind of your I can put the link to the presentation as well in the github repo but this is kind of the short thing that that you guys can think of you TXO best chain where you have these JSON API is right and then you have the etherium chain which is like the smart contract here and in the middle you have the areas that you work with web 3 server side key management cool we are in discord which is our let's see squat channels so I'll post a presentation in discord here so this is our channel maneuvers DNA and crawl car we'll be more than happy to answer any questions if you guys have or just ping me directly from here that's all thank you everyone and enjoy the rest of the Agatha
