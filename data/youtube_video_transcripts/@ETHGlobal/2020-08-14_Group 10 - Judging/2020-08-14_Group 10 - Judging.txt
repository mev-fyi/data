okay the recording stream is good so so all right welcome everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of beef global and uh i'm gonna say hi to everybody on on this call for hack fs judging so hack fest for those of you who don't know was a month-long hackathon uh in partnership with protocol labs from the global side and we're super excited to have all of you here for showcasing all of our demos for this event so over the past month we've had 470 hackers from 50 different countries and 19 different time zones work on interesting projects that make the best mix of ethereum and the falcon ecosystem and we've seen 132 projects come out of this event so we're taking this entire week showcasing all the projects that came out of this event from uh from all of our hackers to everybody else out there and we're also using this same opportunity to judge these projects by inviting a lot of notable people and important people from the falcon lithium ecosystem to give us their feedback and comments on how these teams can make these projects uh even more uh better so before we jump into all of our demos i want to quickly walk through the logistics of not only how the event was set up but also how judging itself is going to work so today we're going to see about 14 teams uh come on and showcase what they built uh and each team will have four minutes for a demo and we'll then have a four minute q a session and just to minimize any technical difficulties we've asked all of our teams to pre-record the demos so we'll they when they come on they'll be playing the later demos and then we'll move into a live q a in terms of how everything else was set up for haccfs uh it a project could have up to five team members but uh it was also okay for you to work uh individually or with less than five people and everything we're going to see today was written over the course of the hackathon which is a period of four weeks and the only rule and criteria for being eligible for submitting a project was that they must incorporate the tools and technologies from the protocol labs and the ethereum ecosystem so we have a really good mix of projects that take the best of decentralized storage and smart contracts and we're super excited for everybody else to see that too in terms of how the projects are going to be judged we're going to be looking at it from how technical original and practical a project is and also how usable it is from a usability standpoint and we recognize that these four categories may not be enough to fully evaluate a team and that's why we have a category that we like to call a wow factor to account for anything that we have missed on the categories above and before i move into the demos themselves i want to really emphasize that this event is not structured to be a competition um the hackers are very much here to learn and they're here to share their excitement a lot of them are beginners to both of these ecosystems so they got this uh four weeks to play with and see what's possible with uh with filecoin and ethereum and they really want to just share what they uh what they built for this event and judges are primarily here to give feedback and and help you understand how to take this uh to the next step and not everybody is trying to become a business we're going to be really mindful of the fact that we'll see a whole variety of uh different projects at their different levels of development and uh and we're here to recognize that this is uh this is intentional so with all that said uh these are going to be the teams that are going to be presenting today and uh what i wanted to do is uh and that's actually before i get into that i want to make sure i recognize the the three judges that are going to be doing the hard job of giving the feedback and being with us live i want to welcome spencer noon from vtc capital one of my welcome michael rogers from protocol labs and brian from uh the viper project and uh with all that said i wanna welcome our first team for uh for today and that is team block six i'll have uh swarup come and kick off with their demo hey everyone thanks karthik i'll get started welcome to block six demo for hackerfest 2020. we have built a notarized document signing solution backed by proofs on ethereum and encrypted files on ibfs simply deploy our front end wi-fi leaks hosting service we get a custom domain let's open that so the user experience is very similar to that of docusign so you just simply upload a file like an nda fill in the information of the person who's trying to notarize it we add the signers we can add as many as we want we can then go through the document make sure everything is filled up and the signature blocks are in place let's hit submit at this point there's a unique identifier that's added to the pdf with all the information stored on it we encrypt it to ensure that the ips file is not readable by anybody else and then we send an email with the confirmation request to the notary as we can see here this is the transaction is the first step of the smart contract now at this point a backend receives an event and sends out the request for the signatories to go ahead with their signature so let's open up those emails so even this file is actually being rendered from ipfs through space demon we can make sure that the document looks good hit submit so this makes another transaction as you can see it's still pending let's go and make the second request so once this transaction gets confirmed we will receive a signed event and that actually preps the document for it to be no choice but no tree as you can see an email has been sent an authorization request here and this is the final step we're good to go so each of these signatures that we do we're storing the proofs on ipfs in an encrypted manner and then we store the hashes of those on ethereum to ensure that it's not been tampered with at this point the back-end is going to combine all the signatures mark the document as final take the final hash and then make yet another transaction when that transaction gets placed the transaction life cycle completes where you can be not checked for proof of the entire document signing along with the pdf that's been stored open this file so we can see here this is the final document it will contain all those signatures proof of these are on-chain and signatures itself are also on ipfs so i'm going to download this file now this is the interesting part right so how do you verify this document i'm going to copy this link let's say the back-end server is down or if the notarization system goes out of business the beauty of how this has been built using smart contracts is we can always fetch the proof using ethereum and ipfs so i'm going to show you the example putting that file in it's making those calls with metamask and it's able to fetch all of the information our open source code base as long as we're on the same network id we're able to get the original hash that is also stored and then all the checks are done based of that more information is on our github for you to go and check it out all right so that was our demo awesome thank you so much and uh with that i'll kick it off to our judges for any feedbacks for our comments the demo went a little fast but i just wanted to check on something um there was a stage where you said you can see that the transaction was still processing but it looked like the ui had already completed is there a disconnect between the ui saying that it's submitted and the actual transaction completing or was that just like a demo well that's mostly due to ethereum right so when you do submit the transaction it still has to get mined uh which hopefully with other networks will be almost instant so that's just what i'm trying to show that you know once there's a certain delay to it uh but apart from that uh the user will be notified whenever that transaction gets confirmed okay okay so beyond just the sort of ui that hey was submitted there's like an email later that says like oh it was all processed because this is meant for end users who probably don't know much about blockchain so we're not trying to show them too much about i mean for the purposes of a video demo i showed it what's really happening behind the scenes because it took us a lot of effort to build this but uh you know i i built this in mind with anime yeah you know with for regular users who you know who are just doing things on paper how are the the key store that sign the transactions so this uses a service that we actually built a couple of years ago uh but it actually can also be handled by the notary itself so it's fully open source so who whichever entity is running this service so in this case of course i showed you a demo by blogstic itself but it could be white label and that that particular entity will be running signing on the main chain because the end users they probably don't want to be worrying about installing metamask to sign proofs but the signatures and the hashes are still stored on iphones and ethereum so they can always verify as long as they trust the body okay yeah uh as a suggestion there's a couple other uh newer ideas around that um i forgot the name of it but uh one of them is it's very simple it's like a cookie um that is split between like a server a client yeah taurus yeah so we sort of discussed that uh to use it but again even that is yet another new service so like in this experience as you notice they're just using email right uh which uses the oracle to send out the proofs so sort of the send out the tokens so that's what we wanted to keep that easy because that would be yet another service that they have to sign up for but hopefully i think it's getting there because when i first saw the demo to what it's been launched a few months ago um it's closer to what an end user would want to use but yeah okay thanks for the suggestion thank you yeah and i i think um great job it looks very kind of like a web to docusign type app so i could i could see myself or other people using this with with some um improvements obviously i'm curious what the i'm not a i'm not a front-end developer that's why it looks so bad it doesn't look that bad i assigned a vc term sheet how i got into finder startups was through something like this i built it as a very simple demo way back uh and when this unfortunately came up with hack reserves like this is where you know truly uh i can build a real lab around it yeah um i'd be curious to understand what the biggest challenge that you guys had to overcome to ship this and then maybe also understand um like are you gonna continue working on it what's uh what would you do if you had more time uh i i would definitely want to improve the ux uh especially the signature part and things those are very complex to build um as you notice um it's like this because the wet signatures was something that was being discussed uh when i spoke to the notaries uh like they were not okay with like a just an email signature right so that part i would want to improve with a better uh front-end library uh the other challenges were just making sure the fleek the space demon encryption stuff works that was new to me that's something that i always wanted to do on ipfs i think it almost works well but what you don't see in the demo and why you see the speed up is because i had to do it over and over because it would crash or you know things like that would happen and one if we had more time we would probably all right what specifically was crashing uh the space demon client itself it's something i have not used in the past uh we actually changed our idea and i had like three days to build this so on the second day i was interacting with space demon and um it was constantly crashing on my local but on the server it works fine so the on if you actually visit this website i've managed to get that working since the packaging ended cool what were you using for encryption uh it uses uh i believe the client actually takes care of all of that for us it's a something very new that they've built i use this textile uh and cricket buckets uh and i believe the encrypted file actually goes on ipfs so you can actually see the hash it's just that you cannot decrypt it unless the keys are available to the user awesome and uh that's time for my very first uh project so congrats thank you both of you again for participating in the hack fest as well and uh with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is team in project mile so i'll let them kick off with with demo hey we're mile and our aim for this hackathon was to facilitate retrieval binding we did this by solving two problems the first was how to help more miners join the file coin retrieval market and the second was how to optimize content delivery for clients to solve both of these problems we developed an architecture with low level file coin building blocks in the architecture we developed a miner can immediately start offering retrieval deals by subscribing to a faucet node which provides cids for the miner to import this slide provides a high level diagram of how this is implemented and let's now dive into the different parts that make up this architecture first let's cover how data deals are sourced a miner can run our retrieval client on top of their lotus note the retrieval client can discover another type of node which we call faucet node via lib p2p and subscribe through gossip sub to get immediate access to a stream of cids the retrieval client then sends back events about the cids they serve events include information about any client requesting the cid as well as metrics surrounding the data transactions for example the location of the client or the latency of the network transaction meanwhile the faucet node writes in a database which miner was assigned to a cid and the events resulting from that parent recall that events describe data and transactions and are published by the retrieval clients the faucet aims to match a retrieval miner to the cid which maximizes the potential amount of file coin they can earn it does so by using a prediction model trained on the database of events we'll go into more details about the database and prediction model later but how does the faucet know which cids are available to match with a miner clients who want to store their data publish their cids to a gossip sub-topic the faucet is subscribed to the client is incentivized to implement this procedure because the faucet will ensure that they have more options to retrieve their content as of yet we've implemented everything we've described so far except the prediction model to help miners visualize the data being retrieved and the amount of file coin earned over time we've also developed a dashboard which sits on top of the retrieval client now let's cut to the demo because of the number of minor client and faucet nodes required to fully test our system some parts of this demo are mopped so you can see that we already have a faucet node and a retrieval moon running and in the ui for the retrieval node we can see that we've detected a new faucet and we can just click on start to initiate a new handshake and here we you can see that we received a new cid in return to retrieve content so this ui allows us to visualize critical information as a retrieval miner in this first pane you can see past market deals the second pane you can see stored pieces of data the third pane you can see network peers we're connected to and finally we have a settings page where you can input your hardware configuration so this configuration is sent to the faucet node um to optimize data deal now that you've seen our system in action we need to address where we would like to take this project we need to first populate the database with events data using the event data stored in the database we can train the prediction model this model would take in data x associated with a cid this could be for example the country where this content is most popular in tandem the model also takes in data x prime about a specific miner for example this could be the miner's ip location and taking in x and x prime simultaneously the model aims to predict a label gamma which would be the amount of file coin collected for a given minor cid pair subsequently the faucet associates a minor with the cid that the model predicts will generate the most valve coin we hope you've enjoyed this overview of our project we're a two-person team who are supportive for small parts of this project by three other teammates thank you for taking the time to listen awesome um there's a lot to to cover in that demo so i'll uh i'll have uh some of our judges gonna dig in yeah i'm just i'm just going to repeat back to you what i saw just to make sure that i have the full frame of everything so it's looking at the chain and the existing retrieval deals to know which pieces of content are being retrieved pretty often or it's only relying on cds being proactively added into this retrieval network yeah so what we wanted to do for this is to uh just create a file set that has a list right now we hard coded the list so we didn't really focus on the way we were sourcing the actual deals uh but the idea is that we are listening to a gossip subtopic so clients can actually publish uh cids there in order for it to maximize their chances of getting more options later okay and so those are the payload cids right for each yep the content that's the idea okay okay yeah yeah um [Music] okay trying to work through all the details of that so it's going out it's doing a retrieval keeping an unsealed copy of that to do retrievals on at a lower price than what you're going to get out of a liner right um well sorry could you repeat that question exciting so so so when when you decide to build a network and you still like it then does a retrieval deal with the original miner gets the data out and then keeps an unsealed copy of it around to do retrievals on at a lower price i would imagine yes that's correct yeah well there's definitely some more variables that you want to put in your model but other than that this is like a relatively solid idea i think a few people are actually working on yeah we just wanted to get the proof of concept for the architecture of our book but this is definitely very level it needs quite a bit more development uh so yeah this this was just to get the whole system running and then you know we can work on the details as we go say maybe uh it would be helpful for uh just uh generally for us like for those who are not super deep into uh to this ecosystem can you give us a good overview of what the importance of retrieval market is and sort of why i decided to focus on this sure um so we were really this is kind of like a part that is currently not very developed on the flat coin and the current filecoin implementations uh but the idea is that uh you can uh improve the performance of uh retrieval by having more options and more minors uh actually store the data on a hotter layer so in a layer that is quicker to get uh so it's essentially like a content delivery network where instead of uh getting a miner which might be far away and might have quite latency you have more options and so the idea is like we kind of create this rocker market where a miner can enter it and immediately start offering deals without needing to to have a huge setup so it's kind of for smaller uh miners to join the market and create kind of a more localized uh network where peers can grab uh content really quick from someone who's nearby as opposed to from the same miner all the time sorry it's a pretty big topic at the same time so my overview was a big and very crucial piece here yes that's awesome uh maybe uh if uh brian spencer have any kind of comments or uh clarification they would like we'll give them a chance for that um but if not we did you um so as far as the model goes did you do any work and at least drawing it out and what that would look like and like maybe simulations or something in python uh no we haven't implemented that yet um i think the idea would be to to collect some some data first and foremost uh so to start populating that database when this thing goes live um and once we have some data i think we can start to think about what kind of model we would want right now it'll just randomly return a cid um and that's a good way actually to cast a white net and gather a lot of data is just a return of random cid at the moment gotcha yeah i think i i do think it is really smart to kind of localize uh what content with the people who want to retrieve them yeah and it's a good way to to improve market efficiency um i mean there's similar things that go on in financial markets so it's not it's not unheard of to do these kinds of things there's also some huge costs and retrievals as well um like if you if you don't set up fast retrievals when you set up the mining contract then you're gonna have to pay the unsealing cost and that's not only gonna take like hours but it's gonna cost like the majority of the retrieval is going to be the unsealing cost so any market where you're keeping around unsealed copies is gonna be able to offer like retrievals way way way cheaper so yeah like this is like a space that we kind of know is going to expand yeah nicely done guys um what what are some of the kind of most pressing future optimizations that you would make or are planning to make um i mean right now we just want to get it to install on some miners so what we're really interested in is uh seeing the ux uh from coming from a minor the idea is to get it used and to start gathering data uh to see if it's actually understood so i think there's a bit of a barrier of entry for people to actually understand what's going on and understand you know how you install this and how what are your options so i think we ideally want to focus on onboarding miners and testing this out and obviously joining the test net so actually seeing some real deal happen cool awesome well um that's time for uh for this project so i want to thank you for uh demoing and hope you continue to uh continue working on this thing and i'll be ready for the launch and uh with that we'll move on to our third team and that is project edualt so i believe jacob is here on this call um jacob if you can hear me i just have a quick clarification we have to play our video but uh i have two video files a two minute pitch and a four-minute demo which one do you want us to play oh you're muted by the way sorry the four-minute demo perfect okay so the video i saw in the chat is a different one so i'll cue that up and uh oh sorry sorry sorry so next up i'll be playing jacob's video i'm jacob cohn rosenthal educator programmer and creator of eduvault eduvault is a user-owned database that lets users take their educational data from app to app this record of their progress is crucial for ai gadget education but the ai will need to know everything that you know do we really want to give mega corporations that much personal insight how do we sidestep this dystopia by letting users own their own data eduvault harnesses web 3.0 technologies like ipfs and textile threads to give users complete ownership and control of their data now ai guided education is still in its infancy but we can already provide strong value to current users by increasing the interoperability of educational apps in my own teaching i've discovered that when i used a lesson creator with flashcard prompts a flashcard app and a classroom game they all used similar material but they were not interoperable let's check out our mvp for our nvp we made a simple flashcard app with multiple login options changes are synced we're using textile threads images are saved to textile using textile buckets [Music] we provide a way for users to see that their data is actually getting stored on textile but once we work out the kinks we'd like to put this syncing into our main app interplanetary flash cards uses space repetition algorithms to plan out your studies for the most efficient studying more than that it has a browser extension that lets you take notes highlights online make flash cards from them and have them sync to your review this just shows you some of the opportunities that are available when our educational data is more interoperable i'm mikhil muhammad and i explored the problems faced in regards to the product development and user experience interoperability data ownership and privacy means little if these tools are built to be black boxes to the general public we provide the optionality of choosing the trust model for the users when interacting with edual the goal is not to create another walled garden with a limited scope but to allow for true interoperability as a student i need to be able to gain perspective on how i use my personal knowledge base i should be able to easily share and collaborate with peers instructors and area experts to gain complete mastery in key subject areas i should be able to choose and utilize the tools that best help me learn based on my personal needs and learning style many applications exist that can consume remix and create these data sets in drastically different manners but it is necessary to provide context and functionality to the information and knowledge that i consume to build an alex or hanion's key takeaway it's all about the ux if the user experience and added usability is not drastic improvement on already existing systems the technology is not serving its intended purpose one of the biggest challenges that we encounter in our project was about authentication how do we provide a familiar web 2.0 experience let users sign in and provide them with the security and ownership of the data that they deserve so how do we avoid letting the client or the server see these private keys i'd like to give a shout out to the textile team to carson andrew for spending a lot of time on slack and zoom helping us figure out some of these problems i think we've found a great solution the next step is to make eduvale as easy as possible for developers to just drop into their app but they don't even need a backend we need more crypto wallet support better native app support more blockchain persistence and backup options and much more it's a challenge but we've got a great start awesome that was a really cool demo so i'll let our judges kick in with some questions and comments and uh yeah this is really really cool um i think i could definitely see myself using something like this and other people too i'm curious how how much um did you guys develop for this hackathon versus what was already um it seems like you might have been building this for a while yeah yeah there's so there's kind of like three parts there's the um there's the in the middle during akil's part you saw that was his ux design and that's for like the next version right and then there was the mvp that was the flashy cards thing um and that was all built uh during this time and that that's using textile and then there's the third part which is ipfc interplanetary flashcards which is an app that i've been building for almost a year now um and i'm using it to study for the gre so you can use it if you want to that's awesome you're your own power user yeah yeah so the ux stuff was uh done for the hackathon specifically awesome and maybe just that quick verification and feel was that uh a uh a mock-up for the mobile design or was that an actual screen recording of the mobile app that you already that is a mock-up right because there's a few things uh still required from textile to actually make it fully functional once those click in we can get something working awesome yeah because right now the it's like right in the the um the mvp that we made it's a very tight link between the the front end and the back end but the idea is to make an independent like basically like an oauth service um so that an app could let a user sign in with eduvault and then they would have they'd be synced up to the same database um so we need to make like a a separate third-party like sign-in page and we're missing a few features from textile but they're working on those i think it was a very ambitious project overall um i had a question though um like how do you see other people coming in and contributing towards the content and helping spread the edgy bald gospel if you will yeah so that's the i mean because it's almost like you're trying to get people to adopt a standard you know and and that's um and although the the format of the data in in it's basically just a thread db right and that that you can share with you between apps and but so we'd actually don't say what form format the data in uh has to be so it's agnostic in that way but the apps can just kind of examine what's in there or or we can make a registry um so it's not a standard in that way but it is like one login right and so how to get other apps to adopt that i guess the key is like for for open source projects you can like make a plug-in like for there's a flash card app called anki very popular um we could make we can make a plug-in for that to get people to start adopting it um and the key is just to make like really useful apps in the moment uh that are very useful right now and then kind of build up like oh this also works with this this also works with us and then that will slowly build an ecosystem um also to build on that i think if the data is there and we're giving users the optionality of taking it anywhere you really don't have lock-in effect so technically if it's on threads you can tag and use that information on eduvault and then take it anywhere you want so i don't think there's much uh lock in in that regard yeah like we'd like people to do for every educational app to be like sign in with eduvault so that they can access immediately but on the other hand we could like you could let the user like you could get they could get their private key and then use it on another system or something as well one thing one thing to consider um i think one thing that's really fascinating about this technology is it has like a lot of aptitude to be gained um and you can kind of leverage a lot of game theory and maybe uh introduce like an element of like really fun uh interactions into this system and use that to help build like a more uh viral response and get uh more adoption of this over time totally that's a good idea awesome so uh with that we are at time and now thanks again for a really cool timeline i hope you keep working on the mobile app it looks super cool and uh we'll move on to our next demo and that is project d thing so jonathan if you're here feel free to uh kick off with your uh perfect i'll get it started welcome to d fame our vision of evolving digital communities the current social media ecosystem creators need to create massive followings quickly in order to sustain themselves since they also don't own their content on these platforms they're at risk of losing all their work based on the whims of companies like facebook fans also have no incentive to participate other than just blindly consuming media so we took a look at some trends in the market for both fans and creators to see if there were any opportunities to innovate in this space creators are always looking to find new ways to receive funds such as signing up for monetization platforms like patreon fans are looking for new ways to contribute to creators like exploring token usage based on these insights we propose a new and exciting way to turn your community into a shared economy by leveraging blockchain as a foundation defame enables users to control their own data provide exclusive incentives create their own token and ensure that their communities are self-governed so how does defame work you launch a token for your community anyone who wants to become a co-owner purchases this token each interaction within your community grows the value of the token and everyone benefits what do these members of your community see and get when they join three concepts we're exploring are flows streams and shop flow allows you to communicate with membership stream uses the popularity of exclusive videos to creatively connect with fans shop enables communities to sell unique brand additional products and digital products similar to unisox now let's take a look at the app this is the defame demo when you first open up the application you create a user profile where you get to see both the number of members that you have number of followers and the total number of tokens that your community holds when you create a video we first choose a video title we pick the video that we want to upload and we specify the amount of tokens that's required to unlock access to the video the token name and then we click publish video now our video's been uploaded going to the feed this is a defame main video feed here you can see all the current videos that are trending already we can see the new video that we've uploaded and see that it requires 12 ting videos to unlock upon selecting it it shows us that it we already have the necessary tokens to start watching the video now the video plays we have full playback control as well as the ability to pause control the audio and go full screen defame is built on four main technologies we use three box for managing user profiles and video metadata like title and description and token amount to unlock we also work with role which does the personal token minting as well as access to user's wallets ipfs for video metadata storage and abridged to do efficient layer 2 technology for fast and scalable transactions our next steps for defame include an initial test period to gather more feedback for our targeted app launch by the end of 2020 we hope to see you on d fame and can't wait to create with you and your communities thank you amazing um it was a really cool demo so i'll kick it off to our judges for any questions or comments thank you yeah so cool question so that kind of showed me what you have working what do you not have working in the kind of uh tick-tock parody right now ah that's a question right to the meat a bit isn't it um what's not working so what's not working is the user on onboarding flow for converting fiat to currency right now uh we re redirect the user to a uniswap fork that roll has for exchanging uh ethereum to the target personal token but we don't have the onboarding yet for exchanging like doing the wire integration for exchanging fiat into ethereum or die and then having that exchange happen into the personal token that that that onboarding flow is kind of rough uh no matter what technology seems like you can use right now and so we're we're working on trying to find a clever way to implement it aside from um the on-ramp are there any other um kind of i guess rough parts of the user experience that i don't know if you had a magic wand that you could fix sure um we uh it's your user experience uh video upload is uh we do allow you to record uh from your camera phone as well as file upload although one thing i would love to have is the ability to actually edit the video within the app most video uh platforms have the ability to you know crop your video maybe have a few simple filters to play on top that seems kind of you know uh super flareous to happen in the application but these days that seems to be standard for a video social networking app yeah is there something about the crypto that doesn't let you do that or is just a function of your time and i guess maybe a follow-up would be is there something on the like web 3 side that you would answer that question with too oh yeah um so that's just a matter of time on the web 3 side i think the challenge is video encoding right now we're using video encoding uh within aws to take the user's input file and convert it within a to a type of data format that is can stream at multiple data rates depending on the device so it's optimal however there doesn't seem to be um a great option right now doing that in a decentralized way we looked at a little bit at pure tube and a few other solutions but they're still pretty young i say that's our main point of centralization with the app right now is the need for a centralized server to perform the type of video encoding that's required before serving video out to users have you have you looked in live pier i've looked at live pier there was a few minor technical uh challenges that we had with live peer to get it implemented okay one thing that i thought was really interesting is it seemed that when you when you first view the video when you're scrolling through the app um it kind of shows you a short like you know three second kind of gif overlay um and then so when you click on it you're basically paying to access the full video so right and how it's okay yeah yeah so i wanted to make it a very visual experience that like you get to kind of taste a little bit of the content before buying it because buying it is kind of a big you know step uh for the user so i want to make sure that they have a general understanding of what they're buying before they get it yeah that was a clever ux uh little hack there thank you appreciate that awesome so uh if there are no more questions i think we uh we're at time and uh with that i want to thank defame for showcasing the school social network and then we'll move on to our next demo thank you folks i am super excited for our next hacker to present what she did so i'll be playing her video and then i'll have martha come on after to answer any questions from our judges so just give me one second to set up and uh we'll get started i joined hack fs because when i saw that it was a 30-day event i thought that was a good way for me to learn about web 3 and anything else that was involved with it and have it in a condensed form over a specific period of time other than just reading something you know a blurb in a magazine or um ask questions over a whole bunch bunch of different uh venues i was rather amazed at what a hackathon really was it seems to me as though a hackathon is an organized event to bring together a number of people who have an interest in the subject that the hackathon was presenting and learn how to use and try themselves and come up with in the end a product as a 73 year old i didn't have a clue what coding was or programming or how to write anything so in the matter of four weeks it was going to be a real job to learn everything anybody else at the presentation already knew after probably a few years of doing some learning at a minimum and then come up with a project to boot and i decided rather than trying to do a a thing to build an app that maybe i would tell other people about this there was a lot of information early on in my research that said that people had a vision about how a new web would be created and i thought their vision was well thought out and surprisingly held together even as we moved on into a few years later and i wanted to try to catch that essence of the fact that this was something new and exciting um that people would in 50 years think this this was a really important step in the direction of web development of the use of the internet and inventions i mean apps are essentially an invention because they're they're something that you use that somebody put together for the hack fest i'm producing an article that would cover the research that i've done to indicate just what web 3 is and what i hope it will offer us in the future and i'm also adding to it and a audio of my thoughts with it and to consolidate what some of my work has been amazing so um maybe martha if you're if you're uh here on the call i'll have you uh just gonna give some additional contest and also ask uh i'm here welcome i want to thank you so much for being with us for the past month uh i know you uh you uh started from from the beginning and you had to uh catch up on a lot of things but i'm super glad that uh you were you made it to the end and you presented and you submitted something to talk about well i kind of wheeled my way into this so i had to stick it out and and show that it could be done and i'm really happy with with so far what i've done and i hope to continue well thanks for joining us martha it was uh it's a pleasure to meet you well thank you very much for your intro you kind of took my breath away with that i didn't i had no idea the effect that this might have and you've already helped make my goal possible which is really to spread the word of web 3 to everyone and not just the development group of people what was the most uh surprising thing that you learned over the past month oh um uh i'll i'll have to say that my most surprising thing was learning what raspberry pi was i had went as i said in my my uh report was that i wondered how baking got into this whole thing and i find i didn't ask any of you when we were in the midst of it what it was so i asked my family and come to find out my grandchildren have a raspberry pi that they're going to learn how to code with so i told them that i would come over and learn with them yeah it's amazing how much we like food when we talk about programming there are a lot of things that i learned with regards to how many people were really involved how worldwide it is and to be very honest um it's it's overwhelming i also uh have been um very happy to have been part of this you people are all very uh positive and uh in in in you and help us and to feel involved even me hi martha um i i just want to say i'm i'm so excited that you're here with us today and thank you so much for thank you so much for for coming on and being a part of this community i think you know i've been doing this for a couple years and and it always you're never i guess fully surprised when something just comes out completely uh unexpectedly but um man this is this is really cool and it definitely made my day um i'm i am uh i'm curious how you came about this uh the hackathon and and if there's anything that you think you know we as a community can do an even better job at okay i have to fess up if any of you don't know i have been involved with my son for a number of years starting with his college years and he has sent me information on a regular basis with what he's doing and i have been curious about web 3 since he was involved so when i did see the hack fest coming up i really wanted to to see what was going on i am a scientist at heart i love to learn i love to know how things work but uh that is how i really got pulled into this and i have to thank kartik very much for allowing me to to join this since i really am not any kind of a program or a coder and you were just making space for some little old lady with a crazy idea but my son is andrew hill in textile awesome that's so cool i have to say this is the first one that i felt compelled to tweet about so i sent out a link to the github repo i've been trying to bounce back and read the articles well thank you very much and let me tell you i really will help pass the word i want people of all ages to know about web3 i want it to get out there so people look into it and i want it to be when it really becomes online and people can use it that they are ready to embrace it and go for it i think it solves so many problems that have been going on within the web world internet world so you got me and i guess i'll just keep trying to pass the word on now this is absolutely incredible and we're uh we're so thankful that you were able to be uh part of this whole event with us i mean when when i learn when i learn javascript you might see me back again i i i can't wait for that moment to come on um i'll be looking forward to that and uh yeah i mean kind of just from our side the part of each global is to ensure that we give opportunity to anybody who wants to learn about this thing because we know there's so much information out there there's so much noise in and it's so easy to get either confused or overwhelmed with how you actually make the best set of what's possible how you keep up and that's kind of why we do these events so we can have a mix of everybody from all different backgrounds and experiences come in and learn from each other and i think this is uh the the best example since the beginning of 8th global that uh that i can say that definitively show cases that we've been on the right track to accomplish our goal and i'm super glad that you're able to join us today and i want to thank you again for taking the time not only just to come on the demo today but also just being with us for all the webinars the tech talks the workshops and all the sessions you've been not part of so thank you so much thank you thank you very much for your kind words um and uh with that i'd like to uh thank you again and invite the next team on for uh for the demo so i see that uh the gallery's already here and set up and i'll let d gallery take it away from uh from here hello my name is carl and this is the demo of a application that we called d gallery i worked with adam and wonky on this effort and did gerry stands for distributed gallery it's a android application native application that basically takes a photo gallery application and packs all the pictures onto ipfs we created a automatic sync capabilities so that all pictures takens will be backed up to ipfs and then you can open the pictures on ipfs via the ipfs gateway we use infira as a proxy to upload to ipfs and just to to what to mention here is that we use the simple gallery from tebow kaputa which is gpl license and this is the github uh url to access that gallery we also used ipf scotland library to ensure we could have like ipfs calls into infera so what's next well we want to see what we can do by sharing with friends and family so having the same application on different devices and having the ability to share with friends and family and finally the ability to sync uh onto a new device all your pictures so what did we notice well we would notice that the web is well represented uh javascript is certainly the language framework of the web three but unfortunately mobile uh mobile is not so very few libraries target i'll try to target android ios which makes native development a bit more complicated uh react native or native script could still be problematic because it's lack of web crypto uh implementation there but all in all we had a lot of fun and we learned a lot while uh hacking along this month so let's jump into the demo so as you can see this is a standard like emulator if we click here we open the gallery application uh the galileo application uh as mentioned before is was already open source we didn't really build this but it's a standard gallery application that basically lists all the pictures that you've taken on this device what we did is we added sync capabilities so if you go to settings and you scroll all the way down you will see an option that says backup media to ipfs if you set this up um it start the sync process it takes a tiny bit of time here because i'm on a very slow internet as you can see it uploads the images to ipfs one by one it's taken basically from the database of all the images that are on the device then loads them up into ipfs then gets the cid uh and up update the database with that id as you can see now my gallery has been backed up on ipfs and now if i go you see the little icon there that says that it has been uploaded to ipfs and now you can click on it and then it opens um the image hopefully yes on uh the gateway to ipfs and that's our hack thank you so much for this amazing month and for all the information that was shared it was a great great great success bye for now awesome thank you so much um i'll let our judges kick in with questions yeah it's a cool question so it looked like that was um android native did do you have an ios app are you using like a layer that will translate to ios at all or is that like basically like a separate kind of parallel app once you decide to do that yeah that's probably going to be a separate one um we would try to um i mean i i really wanted to to get a native layer um so it was quite a challenge because every time we were participating and trying to research some of the technologies um we always had like the kind of javascripts that would come about but every time we were trying to do anything in terms of native being android or in swift like kotlin swift um there was a bit of lack of of of tooling there um but certainly if we need to have like like to to create the ios counterpart we'll have to rewrite the same logic in swift um what was the most fun part about working on this something had to be fun yeah yeah no no there was plenty of things that were fun um i i think there was a lot of like playing around i mean like i haven't i haven't touched code for quite a bit and and i i played around as well with kind of native scripts react native uh i tried to use uh three box um and and and kind of hit a lot of of of walls along the way and i i i genuinely enjoy that you know generally come and try to kind of figure out whether how to hack things together and then kind of like jump left and right um that's probably like the i haven't done this for a while you know when you kind of like working into the evening so that was that was really fun um especially i was thinking with with two other people one one we're based out of mexico and another friend in london generally it's it's been it's been tremendously interesting and fun a lot of content i was completely new to the to the entire ecosystem and so yeah cool very cool yes as someone who's tried to build uh on android and with uh with a native app uh myself with ipfs i can definitely share your pain in that experience well i was at some point i was looking at like you know i i know there's like a mobile go ipfs you know project as well so like like without that pass um but that similarly is kind of like the effort um was quite high so try to get to a solution as quickly as possible like the intensity has really just play around with technologies and see what comes out of it uh where would you take this next this stems from like um okay so my interest is more in data sovereignty like so so like like um and i truly like my belief is kind of like you know the um where where the structure of like you know it's quite ridiculous that every time you use a service on where to you know you have to upload it to every different parties being instagram google photos something similar yeah and so um the way that i see it is like your mobile device is probably the one that needs the most amount of personal information much more than your browser and so can you create a way in which all that information is not you don't stop it you just like control it better so having like that represented on ipfs which you control everything but you still give access to parties let's say to find faces in your picture and so uh it's kind of structuring the underlaying to to to achieve this is probably where i want to take this and and the photo application is probably the one that is the most personal starting from there but ultimately is having let's say all the data generated from a device controlled by the user itself and then giving the capabilities to to application developer to then use that data for its own benefit um but yeah for for now i think like the next step would really just be to save two devices together i really want to basically re-implement you know kids and my wife and all my pictures are constantly shared with with my wife um but then you get scary stuff where google tells you like here's the last seven years of your kids uh and and it's scary thoughts that they know so much about my kids who are not even 18. and so like recreate that in a sovereign way is is what what i would like to achieve you know my attention very cool sounds like a great learning experience you have yeah yeah it was it was it was amazing amazing so well i i hope you keep uh working on it and uh hopefully we'll we'll see a better version of this thing for the next hackathon yes great well thanks so much and now with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is project box and drop and as a quick note after this next demo we'll take a quick uh five minute break that's where judges can get some coffee and stretch and then we'll resume everything back um at the halfway point so i'll be playing the video for uh boxing drop and uh looks like mikhail is uh he's on this call but i just give me one second to set up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] hi guys i'm here hello hello and at the beginning i really want to share my emotions because really it was a great journey for all the staff and today i have a really great news because today i got an approval from app store so i think next day this application will be an app store and everybody could use it on everyday basis so let's start with your questions and probably i can tell you more about the idea and how it could really from my point make a good things as a mass adoption for ipfs yeah thanks for joining uh i like the video it's uh this is a cool concept as someone who used to play a bunch of pokemon go uh a few years back um yeah it's it's uh so i'm curious why do you think um using web three for the back end for this is really important oh it's idea because i am a co-founder of blockchain developers association in saint petersburg and we have more than 4 000 blockchain developers the idea of this app was to show other people that ipfs and web 3 is not so difficult is not complex for everyday usage and here with this application you can share files because if you start this application using s3 from avs or i don't know dropbox or google cloud for storing these files the first point it's not a crowd source so there is one point of control and everybody could delete your file etc etc and the second point when you upload this file to box and drop nobody could change it because you share hash files and you can create really another customer experience of file like apfes from my point of view it's like a nature because everybody could have an access to files using their hash files and with box and drop as opposite of dropbox you can see you can really have access to files which could be stored in different locations and it could be probably as a platform which could help people to store their files in a totally new kind and provide totally new customer experience it was significant and of course if i would buy more and more storage for avs etc etc it would cost so much or i should ask customers to pay so i think it's a good point to go to web 3 and provide and show customers how it's simple to use ipfs how to simple store files and provide another loyal of possibility of sharing files okay have you put any time yet into the sort of security story around the location information it seems like you would probably be able to just like look at the data structure at sub layer and figure out where everything is without actually going there physically uh it's why i use database which store all this stuff and i use geospatial indexes to provide nearby boxes and the second reason because apple has so strict rules to information we could share using iphone and apps have to manage maybe some information concerning violence or sexual harassment etc etc so probably if some people provide me that it's not outdoors information in these boxes we have to remove it otherwise i store only ipfs hashes and locations so i think it's a good compromise between web3 and current ecosystem of apple applications i think it's really clever and i like uh you know that you're kind of it's just like a as a game to show what can be done uh it's a very neat idea it kind of reminds me a lot of uh there's this uh geocaching um craze that was like a couple years before pokemon go really went out and i don't know if it was over in uh in russia at all but it was it was just like it was a very similar idea you'd have little boxes at certain uh um lat long coordinates that you go to and you can put stuff in and take stuff out and this is sort of the digital version of that which i think is really neat um one suggestion or idea um if you haven't heard of them before as a company called uh phone space f-o-a-m yes i know i know them yeah it might be interesting to see if if it's possible to use that sort of more decentralized location in dancing and i think they think they have a better security story around that as well yeah and it was a really interesting challenge for me because i had to learn this uh augmented reality from scratch and it's a really difficult point and probably there will be some issues of course because for the moment gps s is not so stable so sometimes the box is jumping depends on the signal which is comes to phone but anyhow uh from my point of view it's a very very effective way for scaling because the back end is written in golem so it doesn't take any resources from servers so it could sort maybe a million items of connected application because go is very very effective as you know and it's written in swift so if your phone supports this augmented reality you can start and use it day by day and probably i really share with my friends and each of them start to suggest their creative scenarios so it's why i do not want to focus on for example you can create quest or geolocation because many other people with different backgrounds could really create new ideas how they could use this product for their goals and i think it's really good point to provide product as this and check what's will be next for them what is the most interesting uh things which could be implemented on this platform amazing well i want to thank you so much for coming on today and demoing this thing and a big congrats to uh having this been on the app store um can't wait for others to upload with this thing and uh do you send us a note on how uh it goes starting next week so um with all that i want to thank you again for uh demoing and we'll take thank you very much perfect we'll take a quick one-minute break for our judges and uh i'll ask you to turn your video off and when we come back in five minutes this is my signal when all of your videos are back on we'll uh we'll resume uh the second half of our demos we'll just uh wait for a spencer to confirm okay perfect so our team is is here and i will be playing their video so let me quickly just get that set up we'll get started hello everybody i'm excited to introduce to you the bitton overlay network which is a network that aims to provide a global overlay with the ability for routing and storage so nowadays most of the peer-to-peer applications developed over np2p are independent as in peers connect only with other peers that they're interested in the same content and services which is great but it's not necessarily good for anonymity so what we are aiming for is to somehow connect nodes across swarms across applications and mix requests and have some traffic that protects metadata about the user actions in order to do that we define the bit on overlay address space where its node generates a private key and they get assigned an address in the overlay space for example imagine that this node gets assigned to the yellow neighborhood and therefore they will also connect with other players in the green and the red neighborhoods and also to some of their friends and in this case while content still domain specific content remains within the local swarm we can still mix and have some storage replication across france domain specific storms in the global overlay in this case we have three different prtrust levels in order to validate our assumption that in in this way we can break down the clusters and have a topology that looks more like a random graph generated a small small world network and after assigning addresses to its node and connecting them with their overlay neighbors we see that the graph looks more random and we have some other theoretical analysis going on that i will be happy to share in another channel but not like in the four minutes presentation in addition we have a mechanism for starting the global overlay um in specific we have developed a bit on to work over bittorrent swarms and we are using the content address of the network we where each swarm corresponds to an overloaded contemplative network zone and this can also be used by blockchain applications so to sum up yeah the basic feature of fidon is that we have swarms for application and spaces but also for overlay shards we can support flexible social trust models and this is very useful for protecting just malicious nodes we provide low latency routing and redundant storage we are mixing messages around center and receivers and across rooms to provide some possibility but we still allow for greedy routing over the global overlay network which is also facilitated by supernodes which is something that naturally emerges in bittorrent if you would like to see a demo of [Music] how it works in the browser over as an extension web torrent and using the noise protocol for end-to-end and great communications you can visit this link and of course you can always reach out with this email address thank you very much for your time and looking forward to your feedback [Music] marius thank you so much for uh for that detailed demo um maybe i'll just kick up with a question first and then i'll let the judges jump in but uh what made you uh sort of pick this and uh what kind of guy you super interested in this problem uh well thank you very much for the opportunity because i understand this is a research project and i haven't done much coding in over july but it is very it is yeah it is very an early stage project and feedback at this time specifically from developers who are developing web free applications will be very useful since they are the target audience that could use such an overlay network absolutely uh maybe maybe one more thing just so that uh this is more helpful for the people who watch this video after but could you just quickly highlight what the benefits are of having an overlay network like this thing like what would somebody be able to do now um for them to kind of really understand the applications of something like this the main goal is to interconnect the different peer-to-peer applications developed over lip p2p so that you can communicate with remote peers outside of your social graph of your social circle and doing so by hiding your network identifiers like your ip address awesome and now with that i'll see if any of our judges have any questions or comments hey so baton as a project started a little while ago could you could you sort of tell me specifically like what you did in the month of the hackathon on baton like what wasn't there before and what is just there now as part of the hackathon um yeah during the hackathon we focused mainly on the mixing strategy which is a little bit special compared to other projects for example like uh torrently and itupin because it is mixing over a restricted topology meaning that for example in tor the user can select a circuit a path through the network that can go through any of the available relay nodes while uh in viton you are connected only through some trusted peers and then your traffic can go only through them um yeah and that's what i've been focusing on for the last month the implement of it the implementation uh was made yeah the demo implementation we focused on that throughout mid-may to mid-june then we started working on the mixing strategies before that we did an environmental scan on information controls [Music] yeah at some point we also took a look at the overlay topology that that little donut almost the end of the of the presentation it is a very very very broad and long-term project yeah um if like what more would you are you um do you think you want to work on long term for this project uh there okay getting anonymity right is very difficult especially if you okay the main the original idea for the hackathon was to take the the prototype and release it as a p2p transport module but this would only work for example if you would want to hide your ip address we go through all this fast because we also want to protect against other attacks for example timing attacks or traffic analysis attacks we also want to protect from malicious peers and civil attacks so there's yeah it is a new infrastructure project it's gonna yeah new ideas are more than welcome it's gonna take some time got it any uh last comments from our judges if not uh marius thank you so much for uh for demoing today and uh hope you enjoy your evening and uh and continue working on on making this research more application focused reality so um with that let's move on to our next team and that is azaris so let them uh come on and start with their demo this is azure store service and this is the project we created for hack fs 2020. russian commercially created the front-end app solution created the smart contracts and she won't share my created backend server we identified the lack of a frictionless transaction process at tollgates and designed a decentralized solution that allows the toll authority to conduct secure transactions by cutting out untrustworthy middlemen and on-chain verification how it works is this idea has the potential to introduce much-needed reforms in the traditional tool correction systems which in many countries is still cash only the registration will be swift and easy for users who most likely will only need to share a picture of their driving license and email for the registration process access tokens will be verified via google author once the user is registered users will be able to deposit fiat money into the account for us it's a cdn currency the in the postcode world contactless payment will be made via a qr code the user will scan the code and the program will verify account balance by maintaining an erc20 balance and transferring for each deduction which provides automation and transparency use fee can space demand for storage and encryption of customer and as well as store data now i'm going to give the demo of the application as you can see if i sign in it's done via google author i'm going to choose an account this type of account will be a gold plaza account i'm filling in the document id as any placeholder for now the car will be the price selected for cars truck bike and government vehicles which are exempted generally zero continuing now an account has been created if you can see the user info has my user name my document id unique ethereum address and the form status you can see the balance is zero and i can generate a qr which corresponds to this store i'm going to use this for users now i'm going to create a user account i'm going to choose a different account for this purpose now this will be customer account i'll be filling in the details requested for the driving license i'm going to place a placeholder again and the vehicle number would be this and as you can see that the fourth and fifth digit is bk which corresponds to that of a bike similarly cr is car ek struck otherwise the government now the user info is the user name license number a unique vm address the vehicle number and the form status now i can check the balance it's initially zero but i can add money to it in which case i'm going to mint my own currency and that would be a cdn currency which is the fiat currency now i waited some time and as you can see my balance has implemented and it's now 100 cdm now i can use it to pay to a tool i'm going to allow it and pay to the total browser this url would be charging now i waited some time for the transaction to go through and you can check the balance now it's 90 10 has been deducted as it's a bike you can view the transaction details on the only network and it says that's a success that was done one minute ago commenting on the contract details now i'm going ahead and deleting my account and this will revoke my account now i'm going to give a demo of using fleet as a storage as you can see the server is done in the back again i'm going to send a request to creating a new user details you can see hasht and over and download it you can see that it has appended the following values before that encryption so we'll go just uh i think it's way too fast let's let's uh use the youtube delay and just slow it down one one notch which has the value whatever it is so i think uh looks like we had some internet issues there so maybe you can just say out the last part on what the postman demo was showcasing and just kind of say that out loud yeah sure so initially in the last part of it we were trying to show how we are uh doing the encryption part using space daemon now we did it in our local host and not online so that's been implemented here and you can see that the hash is being generated which corresponds to the user info and we're using uh whenever we whenever your user or create user is called uh that goes ahead and that goes ahead and revokes audrey as the user in the database that we have oh um awesome so uh maybe one thing that'll be useful before we jump into the question from judges is just in general kind of uh what is your goal for introducing a project like this thing does this require private companies to implement this for tolls or does it require you to convince some government body to do this thing like what made you actually think uh that this is kind of the innovation needed right now in in this space uh we wanted to streamline the toll process that is being currently used and in most countries it's really slow and inefficient and it takes a long time so we wanted to make it uh transparent automated and we wanted to make sure that secure transactions go through uh so that it can be streamlined and fast track forward awesome um i'll see if any of our judges have any questions or comments sure i'm just gonna start picking on people i feel like i'm not sure if it's the internet thing or brian michael spencer any yeah i had a little bit of trouble um with the video so perhaps that's an internet issue on maybe i don't know what you said um but maybe what so so um what do you think was the most challenging technical aspect that you overcame in doing this project so as you can see in the video we had to uh use that last part because it was tough to take it in one take mainly because the space demon kept on crashing in our system and that was really frustrating to get on with it because that client uh we had we tried on first my systems and russians and then finally in the end we got it done insomnia system so that was a pretty challenging prospect to go through not only that i would say that the app also had a few bugs initially so for getting out those bugs fixing them took some time as well cool could you elaborate a little bit on like where um the decentralized technologies are and where you've had to kind of rely on some centralized pieces just to fill in some gaps with the existing infrastructure [Music] so we used uh flex storage and space daemon to make it decentralized uh we used uh block vigils api known as ethereum to build the smart contracts and uh we're not using any central server app per se so this is all in a decentralized space was this the the first time you've played with the smart contracts or uh awesome yep maybe before we move on to uh to the next one any last questions or comments from uh right um so so seemingly this would work with like um uh what's the word i'm looking uh governmental agencies um there's a better word than that um how do you think this would integrate with like um uh national digital currency initiatives that like uh you guys are from india correct yep i know they're they're looking into uh cbdc there so we are thinking of making the entire process of a vehicle as a wallet so uh that's what we have thought of our end goal to be uh and we can you have we have many uk use cases prepared for this like uh we can use this for buses trains uh we're thinking about uh integrating image recognition as well so that the process is more streamlined and we don't have to rely on rfid tags to get the cars moving more efficiently all right thanks great well uh i would like to give a shout out to swarup and onomit for helping us take this idea forward that's awesome keep up keep building on it and uh i feel like this uh this gives state channels a whole new meaning here so uh congrats on demoing and with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is project azares so like i see if they're they're here and i'll let them start with their demo that was hazardous wasn't it oh i i messed up data loft is what i meant yes so data loft uh if you are here you can start with the screen share [Music] that twitter hack that broke into the accounts of former president obama vp biden elon musk bill gates uber and [Music] others [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] okay so yeah so a few things that i wanted to um show that we didn't get to show in the video is part of our registration process so when you register at dataloft the main thing when we started building this that we want to focus on is keeping everything client-side as much as possible so what we did was we generated a um file coin address on the account creation and then we use three box and metamask to generate the um crypto identity and then so if i create an account here what it actually will do is create a bucket for me and then it's going to give me a ball coin address to send 10 fall coin to and what this does is when you find this address when you would click this button it will actually sign a transaction with the parameters of your account um in the the parameter section of the the fall coin message so we actually encrypt your your private key with your metamask um public key so if i provide that then we'll encrypt it will encrypt my password and my encrypted keys and then it actually publishes this um array onto the follow coin blockchain so you're able to recover your account from the actual blockchain and then um we used uh textile um threads db to save the user account locally as well and then unfortunately right now the the um fall coin chain reset today and there's an issue with the signature so this part is not actually working but um if i go to this tab you can see our home page um so these are the um files that i've uploaded into my bucket and so if i want to upload a file i could just upload this screenshot here um and then it will put it onto into a bucket and you can see here this is uh the bucket that it went into and so if i open uh the bucket here and um one thing that we do when uploading your file is locally we encrypt the file actually in your browser and then if you so if you go here these files if i were to download this file for example and then open it here if i extract that file you'll see it's it's it just has this file here that's the encrypted file so if i actually rename this to so if i rename this to file.dataloft you can um so i just save this and then i would go here and i can it in there and then you'll see it it downloads um the zip and you can see that the zip actually has the contents of the file so it it decrypts here in the browser and then you get the decrypted version of whatever files you have stored here um and one thing that we're wanting to add is to where um when a user creates their account they publish their um ethereum public encryption key so what we want to do is somebody wants to share a file with someone else that has account with dataloft they would actually look up the record for that user on the fall coin blockchain and then they would take the public key of the um that user and then encrypt their file to that that users public key and then they they could create a transaction um that would also send a transaction to that user and that user would get a notification that hey this person has shared a file with you so that's still a bit into development we're hosted on unstoppable domains and we're using fleek and i think that um we'll wrap it up and we can take some questions now so unshare my screen well first off i want to say that was a very great music selection i quite enjoyed that intro video i was really rocking out to that um it seems like you guys did a lot of work over the past month and uh and it shows yes um so what what made you want to use metamask um specifically for uh kind of doing this key exchange we like the idea of using meta mask because a lot of users um use it so a lot of people have it and it allows you to basically manage your account um from from as long as you have your metamask then you're able to access um your private keys or anything to do with your dataloft account and there's other options that we could use as well but originally we wanted to actually have everything done from the metamask as far as signing the file coin transactions but after burning about a week on that uh i realized that it's probably um not really possible to do just a totally random question is that one of those like uh like spear uh desks that like roll back um yes it is that's amazing so um if carlo wants to talk a little bit about his work he did the um file encryption um so i'll let him talk about that um hi guys um by the way with regards to the encryption uh we actually use a um what we call the aes encryption so uh basically it's um an in browser which which uses aes um md5 and shot 256 hash so uh basically um if you have the file and you don't know the password it's near like it's impossible to crack it down because um the the way we do it is um we actually hash it so that because in every hash if there's a single value that is changed in that it will not be equal so um we actually implement that one because for example like we know that there's a hack like on twitter and it's a an admin and we don't want that because we as a user like we want to have our own privacy and that's been taken out of us without most people without knowing it so here we actually introduce data love which is a day-to-day basis for example if you're um if you're a teacher if you have if you're a student if you want to save it on the on the on the web then you you'll have this google drive right we actually known google drive however we don't have the back end or we don't know the tools or who's snooping on it who's who's looking in it and what if you have this important file that you that you don't want other people want to access it so that's why we created data loft so for for us the user and for for us the web 3.0 for the decentralized of these servers instead of hosting it on one server which can be hacked in case because we know that um not all systems are perfect so if we encrypt that with a encryption that is on your browser so you as a user has the the confidence oh this is my file and no one could access it as long as i don't give the permission i don't give the password so let's see if they want to take some questions i'm sorry do you have any other questions i'm sorry uh um you mentioned md5 hashing uh what are you using that for um for um for the um for the file name so um here's the catch like first we actually convert it to a file buffer and load it to a aes encryption so once we have this aas encryption then we have um it's a bit more technical but um in layman's term um on on the um um on the shot two five uh was the question again i'm sorry oh just um you mentioned md5 and shot two five two five six i was wondering if um if if you were using md5 correctly because of the the pre-image resistance flaws it has uh yeah we're still uh we're still working on that one as well there there's some other options that we could probably use that um could be better but for the hackathon it seemed it it was it was a um carlos first time um learning a lot about encryption so for the hackathon i think that it was proficient enough and um in the future we can work on a more efficient system or a more secure system but i think it's pretty good awesome so in the interest of time we're uh we're going to go to our next demo so i want to thank they're left again for that really cool demo and and congrats on getting that project up and running and i hope you can continue working on it so uh with that uh i'd like to call up project basic vibe uh here and i'll let them kick up the demo screen share [Music] basic vibe we want to unlock the power of the decentralized web for you the artist using pinata crowd ethereum and the ipf ipfs network make it easy for you to register your digital art secure your bible and sell your with uniqueness payments based on ether we want to make it easy for you to connect with your audience you want to make selling your art as easy and painless is by so tony maybe it'd be helpful for uh you're just gonna walk us through uh what you wanted to do and sort of how close you got to it and uh just have some commentary on the video oh you're muted by the way uh tony you're muted yeah there we go right thank you very much for the time um yeah project basic vibe um so for hackerfest the idea was basically to try and create um something simple because there's so many tools you know it was like a candy shop but unfortunately not enough time to explore everything so what we did with this particular project was that um i've worked in sort of like the art media publishing sector for a bit and one of the things which has been really underrated is uh digital art originals and uh artists being enabled to kind of like sell those originals to uh to their customers sort of like buying a monet but a digital original monet so it's like you know you won't find a physical version of it digital native so the idea was to use ethereum and to use ipfs and pinata because they kind of made things easier for storage and hopefully when the commercials come out cheaper for archers to basically store their uh artwork online uh in ipfs and then uh once they've stored it in ipfs register on our site um and then they get a buy button which they are then able to sort of paste on any other site that they want to paste it on and then sell their sell their artwork so for example in like an exhibition you know they would have like a digital buy button and somebody can click that and go via metamask and and sell their their work i couldn't find any of the code in the repo is that is that somewhere yeah yeah yeah we do have code um in terms of in terms of the code uh let's just give me a second i'll share that with you here we go there we go all right so this is the code that we have um for the actual system and then a quick summary of how it works is that you have nina who's digital artist she's going to create her little piece of digital art she's then going to use pinata to post that onto the ipfs network and host that and then she's going to get her cid um which she'll then use to register uh on our site um which is hosted on unstoppable domains and it's used posted in ipfs as well and then as part of the registration she basically interacts environmental mass with us with smart contract and that smart contract will give her a bit of um html code which she'll then be able to post into her page right um and then that will help her to create a customized buy button yeah then once that buy button is now in place um you have jim who'll come along right seen in this really great piece of digital art decides he wants to buy it he'll interact with metamask which will work with his wallet that'll work with the ethereum smart contract again right um when he pays the contract the contract will give him the key it'll give nina her money and hey presto um everybody's happy in terms of the solution it's using unstoppable domains uh pinata ethereum uh it's primarily optimized for metamask uh from a web free perspective and it's hosted on uh ipfs so yeah basic that's basic yeah any questions well yeah yeah go for it brian you go first yeah i was i was just going to say uh first off really like how you set the vive uh that was a nice uh relaxing song um thank you um so have you had much experience with the ethereum ecosystem before you got started on this hackathon well with the ethereum ecosystem yeah uh well i won the london blockchain hackathon in 2019 yeah so uh yeah quite a quite a bit um and i've been working with uh quite a few people in the uk ecosystem with respect to sort of like blockchain so quite a bit okay um yeah i was just thinking about the nft ecosystem and it's actually kind of interesting that there isn't a lot of crossover between uh ethereum's nfta ecosystem and ipfs a little bit more i think it's kind of a natural thing in order to uh just store artwork of that nature yeah yeah yeah i mean that's that's that's that's one of the kind of the harder problems um with respect to it uh because in terms of the work that i did it's like working with a lot of artists who basically did all of their work purely digital so you know it's kind of like they just sit on the computer and generate all this really great stuff and then it's like you know trying to find something that will be able to share it and commercialize it in a really sound way is very very difficult so that's why i came up with this to see you know sort of like how we could do that and begin to bridge that gap because i think that that is that is the future in terms of artwork um i was talking to some galleries um a couple of days ago and and the way they see it is that you know art needs to have a media but digital is a media in and of itself so yeah i think it's basically about bringing more of that recognition but the other thing as well was also i really wanted to simplify the user experience with respect to web3 um because it's quite challenging you know i mean i've been in tech for a while um so you know i want to bring people who haven't had that and who have very cool ideas you know so like the tick tock people right because they're not going to sit down and figure out how to write solidity or any of that no so if i could give them a nice buy button then they could start doing some really creative things and you know take a whip three and the whole community in a really inspired direction yeah i definitely agree i really like the simple buy button i think it's a good idea yeah i would i would um wonder i mean do you have any interest in kind of adding like a token to the individual pieces of artwork i think like you know obviously we want creators to be able to to sell their their artwork and i think a big piece of that is like the the demand like the buyer community right and people are increasingly conditioned to to have tokens and to to use them and i think that also allows you if you i mean nfts are great but even with something like an erc20 right you can leverage this entire defy ecosystem that's kind of like being built before our very eyes right now um yeah curious if if you like decided not to do that or if that's something that you would maybe do with future uh time so so from from a token perspective um i kind of used ethereum because the problem is the on-ramp with respect to that um and also sort of like um what are the rights that i'm gonna give you that's a kind of big unanswered question you know i gotta go buy my original million pound money and put it in my house but does that also give me the right to actually go up and do a nice big billboard with that money and doing some sort of you know funky ad with digital it's kind of like those type of questions are still unclear because it's like if you're going to buy a digital original then you might want to put it out on some physical media and so it's kind of like once we have some sort of idea of how we're going to navigate that i think the token question will begin to manifest itself naturally because i do agree there there is a really strong space for that um it's just sort of like trying to navigate you know so like the ins and outs of the legalities around you know i've sold you a piece of artwork right but i didn't sell my soul that sits around that awesome any other last questions or comments before we move on to our next demo if not well uh thank you so much tony i hope that you continue working on it and congrats on demoing phenomenal thank you very much guys take care now bye and uh before i quickly uh move on to the next one i want to just point out that we had to skip one project uh and that was uh project caramel uh because uh the the team has had a personal issue come up so we'll see if they can be scheduled back in just make sure that you're mindful of that on your uh on your side as judges and with that i want to call up project prana and i'll have them play the video this is a platform where each ebook is treated as unique entities so that readers can actually own their copies and in on a platform everyone can interact us either as an author or as a reader so the cycle begins with an author going into the platform and publishing a book he passes in the title name and uh an isbn number that he's already got the price that he's asked and a transaction cut that's an author's cut for afd subsequent transactions on individual copies and of course he uploads the book that he didn't publish and and the book gets published onto the platform and it shows on the listing yes it shows on twisting and you can go as a reader and then you can buy the content uh directly from the publisher that's where a token gets minted so if if someone wants to consume the content he'll have to go to the publisher first and so he's bought the copy now this copy is owned by this particular reader he can do whatever he wants to do with it he can read it and then he puts it up for resale if he wants to he can ask any price that he wishes to ask and that shows up on the listing where you can buy secondary copies copies that has already been bought by users and has been put for sale by the readers themselves and so you can see that they have uh copy numbers associated with them as well copy number one copy number two etc each with uniqueness and someone buys it and it comes on to his collection he can read it he can again put it for sale or he can like give it away to his friends for free like whatever that particular reader wants to do with it so and so you can see that this particular uh reader or the account hasn't bought any uh copies from the publisher or anyone he's actually never spend any time on the platform but because a friend of his has actually given away uh his copy this particular guy becomes the owner of this particular copy and he can again like read it or resell it or give it away to another one or like keep it with him he's the sole owner at this particular point in time so he's able to do whatever again like whatever he wants to do with this particular copy yep yeah so yeah he's able to read again like put for resale give it awesome uh love the soothing rain sounds in the background and i'll uh i'll let uh i just ask the questions um yeah should i explain something more or no i think it was a great uh great project i think i really like to use the nft idea for books i uh and i think a lot of people consider books to be like content and consumable content but really books can be art too and i like the concept of unique ownership of the book um i think it's a really interesting idea especially in the digital age yeah yeah like you know if you have a paperback you you you kind of own it it's your own you can do whatever you want to do with it i mean no questions asked right there are secondhand bookstores uh like physical bitcoin modern bookstores but uh you don't really have those kind of stuff in the digital realm basically so yeah whether or not you can do that yeah it might be interesting this shell uh sell like a limited unique supply of the books and see how it propagates across an ecosystem of readers and and maybe that'll be a different experience than just you know buying books from amazon ebooks from amazon or wherever you get them from oh yeah exactly and like you you have copy numbers attached to each of these uh tokens right so so it's like let's say you're publishing harry potter and i on the very first copy of harry potter so i then have like i can sell it for a premium if i want to or it it becomes a collectible in itself and you know people might be willing to buy it for i don't know like you know thousands of dollars if if they are into that particular book and into that particular author and yeah stuff like that and especially if the authors are actually given you know if the authors actually asked like twenty thirty percent of subsequent quests then a particular book that sale would sold for like thousand two thousand dollars twenty percent of that cut comes to the author as well so yeah what was the most challenging part of building this out in the tech deck uh okay oh well we actually had free big plans and everything we kind of had you know well textile buckets we went the textile bucket way but we for various reasons the whole project went sideways towards the end we had to abandon the whole thing and it was it was pretty basic ipf is hard at the end uh uh but yeah and the contract a little bit uh yeah and if you guys want to like you know explain more on that actually and so actually um we would like to get more on the encryption part and all uh we hope to get it on to this at the end of the hackathon but we couldn't so a plan will be further work on that and stuff yeah that's how many future plans are like renting books and all yeah like that on you'd like to work on that also yeah yeah when things pretty much i think pretty much done on the contract side but the ua and the the further things that that's uh couldn't finish it i mean it was pretty much like to the last minute submission yeah so yeah all my questions were answered but uh great job guys thank you okay yeah thanks thank you i appreciate it awesome congrats again and uh yeah this is really i like the the entity of real world stuff which is something that's already existed as you kind of wondered um so with that we have two more projects to go so for our second last team i like to call up uh blue coedi and uh teams are here so you are ready to go feel free to kick off with your screen share we are team coty and with blue cutley we are building a prediction based a prediction market-based operation system using off-chain betting it is inspired by vitalik veteran idea on prediction market and curation the main difference is our unique algorithm that allows all bets to be done of chain so no transaction providing a much better user experience in this demo we showcase a decentralized web stream forum where all content is posted on ipfs and where anybody can post content or bet on them that's the only requirement is the initial deposit the content posted on blue quality it goes through a very simple life cycle um anyone who have deposited can bet during a betting period a moderator would come in at a certain time um to execute the judgment aligning with the community rules which is an on-chain transaction and then after that any curators with a correct outcome would be motivated to submit their bets on chain to deem their rewards here i'm a content creator here in this web forum i will simply enter a text and submit and to do that uh the only thing i require is the previous deposit and then i sign the bet that the content will be approved by the model now i've logged in as it looks like anyone who's uh who's browsing the platform with some deposit and i feel like this pro should be embedded so i submit a could you pause change the signing um it just it designs the bet and this bet is then posted into [Music] ronan looks like uh the internet yeah that's unfortunate i i said we switched but so um i don't know do we what do we do here sorry if it's the same video i'm on i could try i could try okay if not i can play it on my end if it's the same video you submit it and uh we can just resume that if that's better does that work uh i can i can yeah all right so i'll do that and we'll just resume yeah okay so it looks like this this is working just yeah this seems to be fine you can just uh [Music] now i've logged in as um as a curator anyone who's uh who's browsing the platform with some deposit and i feel like this pro should be embedded so i submit a off-chain signing um it just it designs the bed and this bet is then posted into into into anti-ipfs so yeah now i'm looked at as a moderator and i look at the post and i see that but now there is no staking implemented but we could add that so now as a creator um and the first president i've seen that the judge has has has decided that it was valid um and because it's been judged so now i can submit this transaction and basically be my reward from this so that was the demo a lot you you don't see the is the the tech that we use behind the scenes so first of all we use uh for the the application run on ipfs the nostalgia and we use three box both for the identity so you can either the icon use the treebox and then we also all the content uh the bed and the course are stored on ipfs as one of the main challenge we faced was about how do we ensure the bed all bets are counted and that they can be used to prove invalidity and that they cannot remain hidden without being used so with the non-changes then this will be easy as a better but for us we had to find a way to ensure that we use a pre-structure where bets are paired against each other so for a bet to be committable for regular you awesome so uh i know this was a slightly rough start at the beginning but thanks for that really cool demo and i'll see if our judges have any questions all right hey ronin it's uh it's brian we've worked together beforehand yeah on uh theory magicians and such i think we've had some good arguments back and forth yeah i remember that yeah um yeah i think it's a pretty interesting project so um what what do you think are the kind of uh potential use cases for this do you think it could help um curate social media content um with like the kind of the rampant disinformation campaigns that have been going on this year on like facebook and twitter and such yes basically i mean it's meant to be used as a spam prevention so what's the vitally describing is in his blog post uh i guess what we bring to the table is really the off chain aspect so that we don't have an issue with gas it's just very easy for a user it has no uh you just click and sign a message uh and then yeah it but it can't be used more or more you need to be using spam something that is obvious as soon as it becomes unclear then suddenly them can uh be more difficult because you bet on the like on the prediction that something will be removed yeah your examples are all sort of people making these bets and predictions but like i think that the more interesting use case may be people coming up with their own prediction models and kind of duking it out for whose prediction model is better and and essentially using that to eventually inform much better models of just what would moderate content in general right like it's almost like an open market for for production modeling around like uh i mean around yeah i mean i mean we show it as a as a bet but for the user it's not really your best it's like i consider this content valid or not and uh we didn't really the model and showcase that but the idea that uh every we wanted to actually do that we wanted to create you can create your community and you set the rules of the community so it could be okay there is only a picture of a cat hello and then obviously if someone puts a picture of a dog then everybody will report that it's an invalid content because the rules are very clear um yeah but obviously maybe there is a cat on the dog uh i breathe in some uh some thought and then suddenly become ambiguous and in that case that's where i can maybe unfail but i think it work in most cases that we for twitter or things that pornography or communities that don't want some stuff i think it would work better than a algorithm yeah yeah i mean i i think this is really cool it's it's it's um far more efficient than doing everything on chain i think so it'll have a lot of um just interesting applications that a lot of people haven't really been thinking about um yeah what if you had more time or are you going to turn this into a product yeah i mean that will be great i think it's something that i think crypto community is always waiting for i feel like personally and i think what i've heard whatever it would be great we could have a forum i think a forum is a basic example but it can be used for anything it could be used for uh like um a nfc marketplace where you you don't want copycats to come there is a lot of use case so we did it as a system but i think a good way to continue the project is to make a demo like a actual application i mean and i think that the forum is what we went for we like but there's a lot to do still yeah one thing that could be cool is like a a chrome extension that sits on top of twitter or something right like and then people can come and go in and uh like flag things and and use the what you built i don't know but yeah i really like it nice job cool awesome uh well ronan paulsy thank you so much for uh for demoing and uh i hope you continue working on this and with that we have our last demo for the day and now that is project co-create so i see ezra analons over here i'll let them take it from here yeah just so we know that things are working as planned we don't have any audio here so if the video has any audio i think you forgot to check off the the audio share box on zoom so i'll ask you to do that one more time do you hear me now yes yeah sorry i was muted uh yeah no i'm talking over the video so i was okay perfect so just give me one second yes coconut allows musicians songwriters producers to work together the idea is we don't have the screens here now sorry for some reason i'm getting kicked out also okay there we go oh man looks like you got some hot corners in in there i can't figure out what's going on yeah i've never seen this before it's like it just keeps locking out this usually happens if you have a hot corners enable so if you go all the way to the top right on your mouse you'll just log yourself out um to prevent uh putting the mouse tagging corners usually i usually do on the bottom left channel just one second third time's the charm let's let's go yes okay now i'm still here just let me get back to her right okay so code create allows musicians songwriters producers to work together the idea is you collaborate produce music together um and cut out the middlemen cut out record companies managers lawyers um so the idea is to agree the ownership rights on the chain so work together to put the music on the chain we built the technology using fleeks space demon textile ethereum so the idea is that you upload and download music from buckets on textile uh now the reason we need ipf s is because there's uh like a crazy amount of data so like a professional audio studio would have like hundreds of tracks you'd have lots of backups you have lots of different samples and things like that so a huge amount of storage required to get up and down so that's why we built it on ipfs um we built it as a mobile app so here we just jump straight into the mobile app what we wanted to do was create this kind of great ux for users so it should feel like sound cloud or like spotify it's you can you know you can log in discover different tracks search through tracks look through different categories of music uh each of these would be music that somebody has created or they're working on so you're basically discovering projects that you can collaborate on um and then once you which what we also looked at is trying to make it um as easy as possible so people come into the app we built an onboarding flow here that you'll see here which is basically just kind of explaining people what is it right so it's the idea is you've got songwriters uh if if somebody can help with lyrics if somebody cannot a musician could come along if a producer can come along you know we want to make it easy and the idea is to share ownership and control of the music to co-create um so yeah what we also wanted to do was we wanted to build it as a full uh mobile wallet so a lot of the work we did was around integrating um trust wallets uh wallet code so that you can you know you create your own seeds you go to a workflow to verify your seed uh you know so so the whole thing is everything you can download the app from the app store and go straight into a workflow of of being web3native hello in this example we are going to create two tokens that represent different parts of a song these parts are going to be joined creating a third token that will represent the full song let's check that the balance of the our current owner is zero exactly let's create the token the first token now it's created so we should see one okay and let's create another token using a different account let's use this account okay so let's create a token now we are going to join that tokens to create the third one and the 51 of the ownership of the first token will be for the first owner and the 49 for the second one so let's transact now let's check these values that is the ownership percent now we see that it's zero because the token is not created yet uh let's see percentage approved that we see that is the 49 until we have the 50 at least the 50 percent we can create the the token so if we approve that transaction using the first account that is the owner of the 51 percent we will see that the token is going to be created now the token uh here we should see that in the ownership person that it's 51 the token is already created we can see the owners of the token we see that it has two owners the first account and the second one and we also see that it's a hundred percent approved so the third token has been created successfully and has the owners the ask two owners thank you [Music] awesome i'll let our judges jump right in i thought it was pretty interesting actually um i really like the idea that you're kind of representing people's collaborations as uh tokens that can kind of be composed with each other um as a suggestion there's uh this standard carl uh erc998 uh that matt lachier had worked on a couple years ago i'm not sure if it's like a fresh standard but it could uh help inform um it's it's a it's about uh composing nfts together so it could help you out uh in some way um yeah we did we did actually discover that yeah i i was googling around i sent that on so i think alonzo was that would you look at that yeah i'm not sure if it's recent but it's at least of interest um i i also was curious if you had heard of this uh app called audience okay um yeah i think audience would be like a big part of how this feeds in like i guess we look at this as disrupting the supply chain of how you create music right audience is more about discovery and distribution right so we're at the other end of that so it could could could feed into audience and i think something like foundation as well is very interesting here early in terms of i haven't heard of our artists um yeah and i just wanted to point that out too is uh because they have an open api they allow you to add new music into the system pretty easily so it definitely seems like a natural fit if you're you're looking more at the supply side of the music and they're sort of attacking the demand side of music but there's this natural natural artist focused um aspect to it i think in both cases so what isn't working yet lots we we had a bit of a problem actually we the the web tree we built this in swift so the web3 library we used for swift i think we just made the wrong choice uh didn't quite hook it together uh so we need to we're still working on on getting that working uh basically there was an issue serialization issue like we picked one of the older swift libraries um so just getting this hooked from the app talking to ethereum is still working we got the um the space theme piece working so we can you know we can upload files to books we can pull down files to book it so that's so that's in place um in terms of what i'd like to get working the other bits that i think we want to work on next are just the whole flow of just managing the the negotiation of rights uh and the we'd love to get aragon built into this as well right so the idea would be that as a song as more musicians collaborate on a song this song becomes a dao and then you can use aragon to manage like how how the right's there so people can vote on different activities on a song like i said so we and each song could then be forked and you know a song could end up being fought as multiple devils that have different owners with different rights um and and exist in different ways so i think there's just some of the ideas that we'd like to work on yeah i think this is this is really cool um yeah maybe one slight alternative or additional way that you could take this too is with podcasts right i think there's a lot of like collaboration opportunities that could happen with podcasts and i think you've got a community here in web3 especially who's super into podcast um but yeah great job yeah like imagine imagine if you had a guest on and like they shared 49 or whatever of that particular episode and if that particular episode did really well then they get more of the share you know totally amazing so uh i want to thank co-create and and everybody else who presented today so congrats on on demoing
