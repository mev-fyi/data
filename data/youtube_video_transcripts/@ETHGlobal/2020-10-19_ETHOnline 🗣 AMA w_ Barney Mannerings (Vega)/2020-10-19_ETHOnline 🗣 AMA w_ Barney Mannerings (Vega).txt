for sure okay looks like we're good great we'll just wait another two minutes or so just get some people in here you oh there's christina all right uh ready to get started barney yeah ready to go awesome great um so yeah so we saw some people trickle in so we'll see that as well here um and yeah as a reminder for everybody who's joining first of all thanks for thanks for coming and of course if you have any questions or anything feel free to ask them in the chat here um and you know we'll get to them as part of this uh you can actually just ask them directly um so yeah so i guess you know first of all big thank you uh barney for taking the time to chat with us and uh and of course uh for vega being a part of ethonline um i know it's the first time we've got the opportunity to work with your team and and with your company and you know we're really excited to have you supporting the event and i'm excited to see people what people end up building on on top of vega um and of course you know it's exciting timing for for vega in general which i'm sure we'll get into um so yeah so i'm just kind of all around you know very very happy to have you on board and very excited to be working with you awesome thanks jake i'd be really excited to be here super excited to see what people build with vega as you kind of mentioned it's a really exciting time when we're opening up a lot of a lot of what we've built over the last couple of years and uh it's really cool to see people doing all kinds of fun stuff with it so yeah looking forward to it awesome so yeah we're gonna touch on vega for everybody who's not familiar as well in the chat um but uh i think you know for these you know i'd like to kind of start a little bit earlier back back before vega and and before everything there um so you know i kind of would love to kind of hear a little bit more about you know her early career and sort of i know you were involved in in capital markets and markets in general you know love to kind of just get a sense for uh you know what what basis did you kind of have as as a knowledge before you came in and started working on vega um just get a little sense of sort of what you were working on before yeah absolutely so i mean i was uh you know university i was a computer scientist i studied studying computer science and and decided i didn't really want to be a programmer um yes full-time so i went into management and technology consulting and very quickly found kind of a space at that time in london the scene was nowhere near his as vibrant as it is now so the kind of the obvious place for kind of cool technical problems with was trading account markets it still is you know in many cases there's still a lot of that there now um so i went and worked in that space and started working on kind of trading systems design we spent a bunch of time consulting for people like major exchanges and investment banks and you know meeting traders and incredibly smart technologists and and quants so people who are sort of you know phd and above mathematicians designing algorithms and you had a huge amount of fun just designing stuff and doing cool cool stuff with trading but you always kind of got that that feeling that it was this kind of special rarefied world that was really only only open to a very small number of people like and compare that with d5 where everyone can create something whether it's a good idea or not it's going to happen and you kind of get to find out and that's that's really fun um but that wasn't really there it was kind of you know the sort of in group and if you were in the in group you got to do all this kind of cool stuff and have access to these products and systems and learn these you know all this maths and all this stuff but the rest of the world was just oblivious and that was kind of one of the things that got me sort of into the blockchain scene um it's always kind of interesting privacy and cryptography and so that was interesting and i started doing some bitcoin mining and you know getting involved in the ethereum pre-sale in a very small way but you know enough to get me interested in building stuff with it and kind of all snowballed from there once i realized that um this kind of closed-off ecosystem that existed didn't have to be that way and that really really is what brought me here awesome yeah so i guess like i normally ask people for kind of what their aha moment was with book blockchain or crypto right where you know it really just kind of clicked and uh became that mind worm that it is for really so many of us would you say sort of that was like you know was it related to that or was there any specific moment in time or thought that kind of sticks out to you that you know really you decided you know this was the thing that i'm going to start thinking about quite heavily yeah i mean i i don't think i know when i first started using bitcoin it was interesting and cool but like you know kind of end-to-end encryption is cool i thought it was really important technology but maybe you know not something that i was going to get involved in i think it was you know ethereum coming along and obviously i guess you know with ethon line being the thing that's uh it's kind of serendipitous that that's the case it was if they're even coming along at me kind of sort of thinking actually i can start writing code and that means i can do all this stuff um that was the moment that blew my mind and you started reading articles and books and it was like this is not just a way of moving money this is a way of doing all of the things that a server on the internet can do without having to trust anyone to run a server on the internet and that was that was super cool because that was just an entirely different thing that was this kind of you know this kind of way of controlling anarchy it's kind of like you can have an anarchy everyone can everyone can have their thing there's no central government but yet you're all able to agree and get organized and that's like super cool because i always thought you know anarchy is a pretty attractive philosophy but it doesn't scale so this is like scalable anarchy and that sounded it sounded pretty exciting and it was kind of that concept that got me excited to uh to dig deeper and start developing yeah yeah that's right i've never heard of it described that way but i mean that totally is is accurate i mean you know it it's a trustless system with you know in a way like it has kind of a set of axioms that that sort of is its basal layer but really kind of anywhere outside of that you can and operate in any really which way you like right yeah and people don't realize you know how much how much that's true like you know even with bitcoin there will only be 21 million bitcoin unless all the people running bitcoin nodes decide to change that and that's probably pretty unlikely because a lot of the attraction of bitcoin is that they'll only be 21 million so they tend not to make that kind of decision because it would be self-defeating but the fact is no one in the world is going to force them not to make that decision and that's that's super cool awesome yeah no i i think it's uh i mean it's definitely an incredibly unique experience and i guess in a way like um it almost kind of seems to fuse a little bit of your your interest right of your past degree in computer science and of course markets and everything like that so um yeah i mean particularly interesting for me for i think the same reason and then the next the next feeling after the excitement was crushing disappointment because we've seen it written before on twitter ethereum has all the power of a pocket calculator and if you've been working with quants on yeah these are the kind of these organizations would have software running on every desktop machine of their 28 000 employees a harvest cpu cycles the second they log out and go home that machine just becomes loans itself to part of their computing grid to do crazy hard maths so you you use that and then you try to build things on ethereum and you suddenly go whoa there's not actually that much i can do and you know that creates a lot of creativity but it also creates a lot of restrictions so they then realized they couldn't do what i wanted to do and and stopped doing a lot of the development stuff for a good while until we started vega at the beginning of 2018 after meeting you know some of the researchers at ucl who went on to found chain space who are great friends of ours and you're chatting to them about some of the latest stuff and the proof of stake and talking about what it is i was trying to do that i was so sad about not being able to go on ethereum and that really those conversations and meeting my co-founder ramsey and you know him introducing me to those people and others that was really that was really the start of getting really seriously involved when i suddenly realized that there was people were coming up with solutions to those problems and the whole thing had sort of moved on right yeah totally i mean i mean maybe a great opportunity to kind of talk about you know i guess the early idea of what vega was and sort of you know what it has become over the last couple years as you've been working on it um yeah we'd love to kind of delve into maybe the motivations behind why you thought this was kind of the right time to start working on this problem and why it's the right problem to work on um and then yeah maybe just kind of a quick walkthrough on sort of you know vega in general and what sets it apart and what it's actually trying to do yeah absolutely and you know the motivations i guess it all comes out of that kind of you know why why is it comes out of the why but also looking at the internet and seeing seeing what happened you know in terms of the explosion of creativity and openness to everyone on earth when information stopped kind of going through a small number of channels and became open to everyone to contribute and we have some teething problems with that you know with certainly but in general i think it's good and it's great to open things up and um i think i think of bitcoin and ethereum and all these things is kind of the same but for value and finance in that we're kind of making it much easier to innovate much cheaper to innovate and opening the system up ripping it apart at the seams and letting everyone participate and so that was the starting point for me it was kind of like okay so let's say i've got these bitcoins or these die or these usdt or whatever they are and i want to start using them for stuff and what i realized from my experience in the markets was that finance is very little about bits of finance or about money most of finance is about agreements and derivatives and special purpose vehicles and instruments and products and insurance and all these other things and so if you decentralize money but then didn't decentralize anything else it wasn't necessarily going to be super helpful and if you kind of had this idea of a world where finance is as programmable and as open as as the internet you kind of have to decentralize the whole system and the bit of the system that i knew the best and that also was probably the hardest to decentralize and was the most resistant to it because of all those properties of sort of things like margin trading and the complexity of risk models and all of that was was derivatives and so i kind of sort of thought well it was also the one no one was trying probably because it was harder and so i kind of thought well what would it take to do this and i basically decided it was impossible um i sort of looked through and thought well we need to be able to run these super sophisticated risk files we need to be able to have a much fairer blockchain than the kind of minor extractable value sort of situation you have with ethereum we need to be able to do all these other things and i concluded it wasn't really possible and then my co-founder came along introduced me to these researchers and these other people and we kind of started pulling this team and talking about it with all these people and realized that one by one we knocked down all these hurdles and it was actually it was going to be possible and so that really was uh yeah it was what got me thinking about it but i think it's the most exciting problem because it's that it's one that you can't sort of there's sometimes with problems you have this you can't get there from here type of problem which is kind of like you know you can start off with something that's halfway there but that thing might actually not be anywhere near the direction of where you where you need to be to do it it's like kind of if you designed the airplane and you wanted to go to the moon the aeroplane is never going to get there no matter how much better you get making you've got to design a rocket and i kind of felt like that's where we were with with crypto you could have decks as you could have kind of unchained atomic swaps and things like that and you could make all that stuff happen but none of that was going to get us efficient good quality derivatives that would let us fully decentralize the financial system and so we saw this opportunity to take what i learned and tamlin on the team and david you know next derivatives traders she's done it for like 15 plus years and she makes sure that we're building things that traders will really use and david's the next front office quant and he understands the risk side and we have the ability to design something by throwing away some of those starting points and starting again with that that set of requirements and needs we had the opportunity to design something that could get there and that would be would sort of decentralize this critical part of the infrastructure and that was really why i thought it was a crucial problem to work on but also why i thought that in this space for super smart people we had a slightly unique team and take on it that meant that we had a chance of success awesome yeah i mean it sounds like you know to me a bit of a tall order right to be able to replicate sort of you know the entire sort of centralized finance or traditional finance uh kind of derivative system um and then model it in such a way with you know smart contracts and you know in a way that is also you know offers kind of the same guarantees on performance or you know what have you as as traditional markets right like i mean you know you need to be able to have a compelling enough product to have people move over to it um so i guess like what i'm what i'm leading at here is sort of um this seems like a very large problem and typically the way you do large problems is you solve small pieces and then work your way up to this kind of larger solution so i guess sort of um maybe just kind of what were some of those earlier small pieces you worked on and in general like what was your approach to solving those kind of otherwise quite large and outlandish problem um like how did you actually approach coming to a solution you know there's a couple of advantages you know the first thing is to remember that a lot of the small pieces have been solved but like i mentioned there was this kind of small club of people who worked on finance and you know there are a few people now in the crypto space actually is it matures who've done the same and who've seen these things before and who get get some of this but you know certainly two or three years ago there were even fewer of them uh so a lot of these problems have actually been solved they've been investigated the research has been done the phds have been written so you know part of first thing we did was was take all that that kind of knowledge and experience and work out what was already solved just somewhere else and then we kind of looked at the gaps and said well what is it we've got to do for you know afresh and then you go look on our website at vega.xyz and the papers section you'll see a bunch of research that we've done where we had exactly that problem well exchanges actually do have a useful role even though we want to get rid of them they bring in liquidity they decide what products and markets to create they deal with fraud yeah so how do we get rid of that so we had to work out how to incentivize liquidity provision and market operation in a way you know that both encourages people to provide liquidity but also encourages them to create liquidity because one problem a lot of decentralized exchanges have is that if there's a big market you have an incentive to make liquidity but if there's a small market why are you the why are you going to bother being the one creating it you you kind of rely on the project team to create this thing because there's no real incentive to be there first so we wanted to deal with that make it like equity like start like like founding a company so that you actually if you create something valuable and it gets to your point about sort of entrepreneurship you create something of value you should get rewarded because you're the one creating it took the risk and so we did the research on that and then on how to how to actually measure and price liquidity on an order book because on amm every dollar is worth a dollar on all the book an order that's worth a dollar that's right an aggressive price is worth a lot more than an order that's just sat out the price that's never going to trade so we had to solve that problem and then the other big problem for me was fairness like you read the stuff about the ethereum and the dark forest uh blog post and you see you know mev and front-running attacks and you kind of think well there's two problems with that the first one is why will anyone move from the traditional products to one where they know that people can get away with it and just jump in front of them and the second one is the fee problem if i can pay a higher fee to get in front of you and steal a bunch of money from your trade i'm going to well i might not but someone's going to and if that keeps happening you're just going to have an arms race where the block gets filled up with higher and higher fees and we've seen this happen on occasions before until no one who's in the block really was the people who were trying to trade they're all these bots trying to you know get one ahead of the other to take that advantage and so right that okay it pushes the fees up and so we really needed to solve that problem to actually say just like in sort of other markets there's got to be a different definition of what it means to have fair access to a blockchain and and we solve that and you know classes research called wendy the good little fairness widget provides a consensus layer protocol for giving fair access so they're probably the biggest ones and there's a bunch of other things we've got through on the way um you know and lots of little little things we've had to solve to make it all sort of pull together and work and thankfully it did all pull together and work and and it sort of you know does work now and it's in testnet so yeah right yeah um awesome yeah so i mean like yeah i would love to talk about the test net as well i mean obviously it's like the test net is in a way the uh completion of kind of this epic process of like putting all these things together and then you know actually having something that's available um for people to use and play around with um you know i i wonder sort of um i guess you know what what is sort of the goal for vega behind the test net like what is sort of what would you like to see happen with it um for it to be deemed you know in a way comfortable enough to move to a mainnet situation and then you know also like uh what what are some of the cool things you have seen so far at it being utilized for yeah yeah so yeah it's it's the completion but it really in many ways it's the start i guess what i mean is you know if you're building something quite simple you might spend three or four weeks pulling something together and throw it over there you know the first thing you do you may not even have to raise any money you write some code you throw it out there you've got an app on the app store or whatever and you get feedback and you know unfortunately in this domain when you're talking about blockchains and derivatives of building your own layer one and all of this stuff uh it's not three or four weeks it's kind of one or two years and so you know in one way it's kind of the start we've managed to convince enough people to kind of to back the vision that we've managed to build a version we can throw the first one over the fence and see what's what works and what doesn't and that's really exciting so the first thing is you know it's its own goal in that having thrown it over the fence and having people use it is super exciting um and that's really the start of the of the journey for vega is a protocol that exists that people can play with and touch and use so that's that's one way to think about it and then i guess the other one you're turning it into a main net the biggest problem is expectations like you know if you're a reasonably well-funded project that puts something out that offers someone this incredible capability they might not have had before you have to be very careful about not overselling it's how tested it is and so you know we can do a bunch of testing and test now and we're responding to feedback and trying to make sure that it's ready to go into mainnet as far as we can tell them there's nothing glaring left but yeah one of the most important things is to go go into mainland in a very um you know in a very honest way and kind of this is this is his first time you know the people running the validators all these things that are completely new and sort of set it up in a way that is uh it's out there and it's an experiment and it's an experiment with the community everyone can use it we can all test it together we can all feedback and iterate and then actually as a community we'll get to a point where we decide we're trusted enough to kind of go go for the big guns and allow anyone to trade anything in a really big way so i think you know for me that that's it's about building that that community and that trust and it's about being the very beginning of proving to to everyone here and everyone on this call and everyone in the team and everywhere else that vega is worthwhile and trustworthy and that you can put serious value on it and i remember when ethereum launched there were similar things here nothing was ever going to going to be like bitcoin and everything else was a scam and some people still believe that but you know ethereum i think has kind of proven itself at least being you you trust it with a reasonably serious amount of money now i think you know vega's got a little way to go before it can prove that and so it's the start of that journey and just getting there piece by piece i think is is the real goal for starting with the test net and and yeah the first main net will be kind of a wild west net where a similar sort of thing will be going on where we're actually kind of saying hey this is the this is the crazy version but come test it with us and help us get there right yeah that makes a lot of sense i mean we kind of are touching on it with this but you know i love to maybe explore a little bit about um how i guess you and how vega you know thinks about risk in association to this right i mean it's it's a big topic especially in d5 you know around you know making sure that uh you know contracts are sufficiently audited people are throwing tons of money into contracts that aren't audited at all which it's quite insane but uh so it goes um yeah but kind of i mean i think risk here applies to vega in two different ways and would like to maybe explore both you know one is obviously the protocol level risk which i think we just sort of discussed a little bit aside um and then the other would be you know just inherent risk around derivatives right like derivatives are kind of a different risk profile than most people are used to trading um you talked about opening this up to the masses right and having you know kind of everyone be able to access these types of products um so maybe i think the first part i would love to kind of talk about what vega's doing on the protocol risk side of things and then the other side you love to kind of think about kind of overall philosophy of education and making sure that people are taking on personal risk that is comfortable for them yeah so the protocol risk is i mean it's a really important topic and you know there is almost no no such thing as too much you can do you know when we when we get to the right point there will be there will be audits there will certainly be bug bounties and community stuff there will be open source reviews of the code um there will be our internal testing and we'll be very transparent about the work like what we've tested internally and what we see in the results and how we're doing that there'll be like modeling and scenario testing and we'll bring in sort of externals through that as well as internal we'll say we'll do just a huge amount of that kind of testing um the other thing we can do is we can try and design to reduce risk so we can design safeguards so we can basically say well if this part fails then this part will catch it there's a governance action here that can solve this problem so you can kind of make things multi-layered and that's that's helpful as well you know and then another thing you can do is you can kind of you can design things to be kind of robust over time or less robust than you and a good example is if you know if every derivatives market is either an order book or an amm then ideally maybe you just have one order one bit of autobot code and one amm code and now every market that uses an order book is further testing for that order book whereas a lot of the time what you see in you know kind of some of the other defense stuff is everything is reusing everything else and everything is different and everything is a fork so if there are 50 amms and 50 order books i've got to review 50 sets of that code and every one of them has been tested one fiftieth as much in reality so one of the things that is designed for reuse within the vegas system in a very radical way so that actually every market is testing cenco to get a lot more coverage a lot more quickly and so that's another big part of it and i think you know ultimately we'll you'll only get there by sort of proving it eventually maybe even with sort of formal proofs to some parts of the system um but realistically a lot of it is going to take time it's going to take people's belief it's going to take documentation and just involving the community and taking them on their journey and being honest about the risks that are there and i think that's that's one part and then i guess the other part is this uh it's the sort of derivatives themselves yeah so um uh you know i was curious about sort of just your overall thoughts around um you know in in general like ethereum is making available kind of different tools and um vehicles that just you know aren't available i think to like a traditional investor right for like in america if you're not say like uh like either through an institution or a an accredited investor you may just not have access to some of these tools right um so i was kind of curious about sort of um your your thoughts in general about like is it sort of an exciting push towards kind of a more decentralized more kind of everyone else access to this um and and what kind of value that could bring to people's lives versus sort of a trade-off discussion around sort of uh the inherent risks and sort of you know what maybe you know if anything kind of falls within uh the providers to like make sure to mitigate sort of um the educational risk side of things if that makes sense yeah and i think it's really it's kind of an important topic it's a difficult one because you are you you kind of have two models which is the the educational model or the or the sort of nanny state protectionist model and i think finance mostly falls into that kind of we're going to protect you from yourself model so even though people can make a bet with one of their friends who actually is notoriously bad at paying up and will probably not pay if they lose if they win that bet no one's going to stop them doing that that's a bad financial risk that's credit risk but no one's really going to stop you um or you know you can go skiing and you have to take on that risk yourself you have to educate yourself when it comes to financing this blind spot which is kind of like you know the government is going to tell you what you can safely do so anything i do must be safe and i think we need to you know that that mindset is a bigger problem than the risks themselves because people assume that it's going to be safe and so i think i think people who are providing this stuff do have a you know they do have a it is necessary to be to communicate about risk you know it is necessary to if you're hosting the front end to vega or another protocol is necessary probably to host to say this is risky make sure you know what you're doing you could lose money if you put money in and it's the same with losing your keys to your blockchain wallets as well like people are taking this on themselves they've got to understand and agree the risk and know that it's right for them so i think you know there are some some bad actors that sell this stuff at consumers and people who are not really not really designed for anything you know in in our case we're very very focused on building building software and building the protocol and giving it to the community and at the moment we have a reasonably educated community of people who understand technology and risk and you know some of them will do crazy stuff but you can only assume it's because they know they might lose all their money every time they put it into a d5 protocol and they're okay with that um by this point if they're not they are definitely crazy um so yeah i think you know you do have there isn't there is a need to educate people where you can but there's also you know that fundamentally the technology we're building is technology that is not yeah we're not building platforms where we can control what people do or we can put up a flag that says you're taking too much risk here you know we're building platforms that are decentralized and we need to need to try and give them the tools and education awesome yeah i you know i think i mentioned this because i think that in particular vegas doing just i think the right approach like you know like the education side of things i think is important and um i think like to your point about even when the main net comes out you know this is the wild last maintenance right it's not the uh throw all your money into it you know like i think that that kind of approaches um in the long term is is going to be you know the best kind right because it mitigates the the use risk or protocol risk or any kind of australia absolutely and you know one one of the questions that i always wonder is whether or not you know that some people have the dream that everyone has their own crypto wallets and certainly i have my own crypto wallet and also host my own web server and most people don't do either and you know i don't you know the internet's now mainstream but most people still don't host their own web server and i think you know maybe web 3 and some of the sort of future things will change that but if they do they'll do it by making the ux very different um i still wonder the same with define and crypto is you know will it be worth people's while actually paying a fee to companies that will manage that stuff and that will be insured and they'll be registered with the government and they will make your money good if they lose it all you know for them for the average person in future maybe d5 will be on the back end maybe they'll end up just paying a company to remove the risk and the difficulty i'm not sure um we certainly haven't fixed enough of the ux that i'm currently convinced everyone will manage their keys but i do think it's it's really important to give people that option to make this the system transparent either way yeah i think that that's a great point and it's interesting that you know we actually have the opportunity to work seamlessly within both systems right like you know that's not an option you get in the traditional world where there is really only one access and you don't get your key right you know at least here the ability to at least access that um and then to have the optionality to to be in full control and to say i know what i'm doing um is is unique i think to blockchain really and is i think really one of the most desirable chunks of it i think i think it's really important it's uh it's very fundamental sort of fundamental kind of freedom i guess that people need to have awesome cool um just a note for everybody in the chat you know if you have any questions feel free to either raise your hand or drop them in the chat happy to have you come on uh this will be my last question um at least which is a question i ask everybody um you know if you weren't uh sort of you know very busy at vega and you were kind of taking a look at the hackathon and maybe attending as a participant or or what have you what would you be excited to be built be building what would you be thinking about what kind of problems are you kind of mulling on that you wish you had more time to take a look at um basically you know what would you like to see yeah that's a really good question and um you know the boring answer is i'd probably be very attracted to all of the stuff that vega's doing because you know i've worked late and you know care about that but there's there are a lot of problems out there which i think um which i think kind of deserve attention and time and i think you know some of the interesting ones around kind of you know decentralized sort of reputation and decentralized um you know it's kind of interesting like i i'm not i don't think um i'm not sure that like say things like ample author particularly the the future of financial money but there are some interesting things they're trying to get at in terms of sort of you know how money can be distributed evenly to people how you can kind of create fair money um and i think there's some really some interesting sort of research and interesting work could be done on some of those things um so that kind of reputation and sort of monetary systems that kind of understand that i think would be very very interesting to me um yeah that's probably probably the kind of thing i'd be working on uh yeah probably something like that awesome yeah i mean i think you know if you think to centralize finance reputation and credit scores and all these things you know play a strong role in the ability to access that type of uh a lot of the parts of the world right so i mean it would be kind of a no-brainer i think and relatively under underexported areas still on blockchain you know under collateralized loans etc imagine if you could build a currency where you could guarantee that every single human on the planet would get a certain amount of that currency every week or every day or every block and no human will get it twice and everyone will get it once like kind of like a universal decentralized ubi like i don't know how you go about making that happen but i think it would be really really cool it'd be like a universal universal basic income basically um awesome so we'll just see if anybody has any last questions otherwise we can wrap up all right maybe we'll just wrap it up here well barney it was great to uh have this conversation thanks again for taking the time uh to walk through everything and of course to spend the time with us um and a big thank you uh for for being involved as vega and being part of the event like i said at the beginning looking forward to seeing what people create using vega and of course looking forward to see what people create in general um and of course these events cannot run without the support of our sponsors so uh you know really you're a big part of making this happen so a lot of appreciation from my side thanks jacob and i thank you to you guys and all of your team for the work that's gone in the organization i think it's been a great event so far i'm looking forward to see see what we get appreciate it all right thanks everybody for coming and enjoy the rest of your day thanks
