foreign [Applause] [Music] hi everyone um so today I'm going to be giving you a lovely talk about why you should definitely move your project to optimism so just because everyone looks a little bit dead and sad right now I know it's raining outside but we can be alive so I just want to figure out how many of you are hacking this weekend that's a good number of you how many of you work full-time in crypto even more of you okay and then how many of you have struggled to get support on chains that you've deployed on wow all right lots of top-notch support all right so um there are so many opportunities on optimism to get what you need to like make sure that your project does the absolute best So today we're going to be going over just some of the amazing things we can do for you on optimism and uh help you get you know actually deployed there is a QR code at the end with all the information so I got you um right so um first things first is the vibes optimism's Vibes are unmatched anyone who's been in our Discord or like at any of our events you know the Vibes are just immaculate we have retro pgf so we retroactively fund public goods which is just think about that for a second so we've funded the solidity team the Viper team web3.js ethers.js uh we've given away a million dollars so far in retro PDF and we have another round coming out a little bit later this year maybe next year depending you know timelines are a bit sticky on these things um so yeah we fund public goods and uh you should definitely be supporting that so if you deploy your app on optimism the a portion of the fees that your users pay when using the app actually goes towards funding public goods so your dap doesn't even need to be a public good to help the ecosystem generally uh grow um we also strongly believe in collaboration I know a lot of chains will make you fight to the death with other projects on the chain for like resources and like oh you know you want to get an nft Quest like ah fight with the other chains um we're not like that at all we will we will help you we will support you you will don't have to fight anyone to get help um and yeah uh collaboration beats competition every single time um we also are on our path to decentralizing you know we've actually we've actually started this so we've launched our token house governance and our two token house a two house governance system which is actually one of the largest experiments in government's uh you know in a hot minute um yeah so the token house is fantastic and a completely open process that anyone can go join uh and it is obviously a token based governance system but we'll get in more into that a little bit later so as a crypto project it can be really hard to get your project in front of users right so we have some amazing opportunities for your dap to get discovered so we run uh Twitter spaces quite regularly we have the Op radio which is a Twitter space that happens weekly we have demo days which happen bi-weekly uh where you can come and demo your dap to users it also helps if you want to go through the governance process to demo it so that the delegates have like a space to ask you questions um and like the delegates love to ask you questions so just uh be warned they will ask you questions and that happens once every two weeks and it's in our Discord and it's open for any project that has deployed to uh participate in whereas the Twitter spaces you know we do do a little bit more digging before we'll uh join you on Twitter we also have some incredible Discovery things so we have quests which are the most adorable little nfts you've ever seen in your life if you haven't checked out our Quest program definitely go look at it they are very cute and you can actually as a project apply to join our Quest program um we haven't started accepting new projects yet but we will start so definitely go and apply for that uh so you can get on that wait list um and they're really really cute like I cannot emphasize how cute they are I wish I put a photo up um we also have a token list obviously for our Gateway and our bridging that you can go get your token listed on as well as our website listing for all of the apps uh in our ecosystem which is a really nice way to get discovered so how many of you have a full-time QA tester or do QA testing at all yeah yeah I see you um so we have the most fantastic ambassador program group who are just like have such an insane energy so if you wanted to get your project to have like a real QA testing process you can come and offer some small incentives to our ambassadors and they will do a full bug hunt like clicking every button of your dap so and they've done this before for other projects and it's been amazing so they give you like a full list of uh bugs that they found as well as the steps to reproduce those bugs so it's like proper QA as well as just general features that they think you're missing because obviously they interact with lots of dabs so they'll be like oh well you're a wallet why don't you have this feature which can be really really helpful especially if you're in the earlier stages of being a project to just have someone go through your dab and click on everything and it's not just someone there's like 500 of them so it's a a proper QA test and a little bit of a stress test if you haven't actually launched to a lot of people yet um we also have Grassroots Community content so if you want some memes made about out your project you want a little bit of hype you want some articles maybe some tutorials on how to do it you can definitely come to our community and have that done for example with the quests which I was talking about earlier a whole bunch of our community members just started making tutorials about how to use these apps because you kind of needed to know how to use them to do the quiz so you can get like genuine Grassroots content made about your project which you know you can't underestimate the power of a little bit of a Twitter barrage of your project and then of course we support you we will support you with developer questions if you're struggling to deploy or you have like some unrelated question about like what to do with my solidity bug we have a very active community of developers as well as general users who will just help you um which is really really nice we also have user support so if your users are struggling to use your app our community loves to just dig into that and help out we also of course have project support so you know this is everything from like um figuring out how to deploy infrastructure connections like getting connected to other projects that you would work well with like synergetically I can't believe I just used that word but yeah so we have we have project support and like you will be supported you know um we also have incredible infrastructure we are the most forked L2 with I think Three Forks right now might be four um and tons of audits from like the top auditing companies in the crypto space so you know it's like we've done our  it's secure we also to have Bedrock coming out soon which is the next version of the optimistic infrastructure which is amazing I'm not going to talk too much about that because we actually have a bunch of talks happening at Devcon about it so if you're not there they will be online so you can watch them live we also have been championing the EAP 4844 process which is going to push L2 fees down to like their theoretical lower limits which is super exciting because obviously you know fees are expensive you don't need them to be uh as expensive as they are we also have the prettiest docs you've ever seen I'm definitely biased because they're my baby but they're on the prettiest docs like go click around you'll see what I mean um and they're great for developers they're also great for users they also have like if you want to deploy if you want to get a proposal throughout governance process all the information you'll need is there how to write a proposal where to post your proposal how to get feedback all that kind of stuff is in the docs um it's really really good we also have a lot of content for like absolute beginners you know if you've never written a smart contract before we also have tutorials for you if you've written lots of smart contracts and need like very sophisticated you know like how to integrate with the bridge smart contracts directly like there's also tutorials for you so we really cover everyone and just because I really do love them these are our docs look how beautiful they are guys look at that look at that they cover everything this quick start how it works dark security we're very honest and open with our security settings like how like our security models uh governance contributing it's amazing it's all there go check it out um then finally of course well it's not finally but of course you know everyone wants a little Opie in their bag so uh you can get op through two methods one is through our governance grounds which I've been speaking about which is completely open and transparent process uh so you can um go and apply it's completely like open and again you can go on our docs for the process of how to apply templates all that kind of stuff uh it's good for small to medium-sized grants you can get a larger Grant but then you're really going to have to like justify it um very good if you've got like Milestone based grants and you or you want to iterate on your ground again in the docs is the whole process that you can go check out we also have a partnership Grant where you can get op but that's a private process so you can apply but it's not going to be like publicly listed you're not going to be able to look at previous uh proposals for inspiration or anything like that um yeah and this is how you submit again the docs guys I really do love them so this is how you submit a proposal like all the steps are there the templates the links everything you need to actually um do the thing so actually last but not least is getting connected so as I said earlier you know we really really really believe that collaboration beats competition every single time and as such like if you want to get connected to a centralized exchange or an infrastructure provider or a wallet or an on-ramp or an audit firm we like very much if we have a connection with them and they want to talk to you we will definitely try and facilitate that relationship because we think it's really important you know like um crypto and blockchain is built on collaboration and that's where the real Innovation happens you know when you're actually able to like innovate with people without like weird competition Vibes going on so we really really try and encourage that and like we've done a lot to make it easy for you uh and then of course what is a talk without a little bit of alpha so we have actually a very exclusive uh partnership server that will be coming out in the coming months to the supply uh that you definitely want to get on the waitlist to get into where we will make connecting between projects even easier and much more like automatic and facilitated so you should definitely go check that out because that is going to be amazing um I have also left a lot of time for questions because uh I know I covered a lot very quickly this is the QR code you're going to want to scan to get all this information um so definitely hit that up but yeah so what's up guys who's building who wants help love you thank you [Applause] no one wants to apply for free money wow impressive you all must be doing really well in the spare Market yeah yeah you totally can apply for a grant so you don't need to have like you can apply for a grant a governance Grant before your Project's even finished so you know you can apply for a grant you can use the ground for uh developer costs obviously because like you guys need to eat um and also for things like um you know like user grants and like if you want to do like an airdrop to your users or like a retroactive reward to your users for having used your application you can totally totally do that you just obviously need to lay it out in your Grant application about like what you're going to use it for make it very clear so that the delegates understand what you're doing but you can totally do that 100 also shout out thanks for building such Cool Tools that is a great question so the question was how who how do we determine who gets the retroactive public goods funding right so the way this works right now is anyone in the community can nominate a project right so you could nominate a for-profit project that's not necessarily a public good or they would nominate themselves that's normally what happens um and then you know everyone else is nominating public goods then what we do is we select a subgroup of the community so it's a smaller group normally less than like 50 people last round I think we use like 30 people and then what they do is they sit and they go through all of those applications we use a quadratic formula for voting so they will quadratically vote on those projects and then list it out you know obviously from the highest to the lowest and then we distribute the funds proportionally to how many points you got in the voting from the sub community so the next round we'll probably do something quite similar where it's actually like the community that is voting on uh the projects and we do that because obviously you know we're not necessarily impartial to what is and isn't a public good so we want to leave it in the hands of the community uh and make sure it's like very values aligned people yeah just community members they don't have to be token holders at all yeah yeah we do yeah yeah no shout out vitalik you wrote a great article about our first retro PDF round uh we also wrote an article but obviously it wasn't as popular as his so you'll find his first thanks oh thank you yeah no optimism really is like it's a very wholesome Community like especially for first-time Founders or first-time projects like there's a lot of support especially for the earlier stage stuff um and the community is like very supportive you know if they find a bug they'll tell you about it they're not gonna like scream at you um which is really nice and then also because it's an L2 like the fees are quite cheap compared to like deploying on ethereum so it's much cheaper than for your users to like claim the nft use it that kind of stuff yeah we also have a decent amount of Dow tooling so if you did want to launch like a dow with your nfts um it's quite easy to do that yeah I got you girl anyone else I don't bite I promise at least I won't bite you um yeah make sure you've uh scanned the QR code if you want to get all this information later otherwise go check out our docs literally all of the information I've talked about is on our docs um yeah Deploy on optimism it's good vibes and your projects then funding public goods which like what a better Flex you know yeah you know you don't have to jump you did the jumping earlier you're done with the jumping now you got socks though so you won really you know like yeah okay hold on let me just go back a few slides okay so if you see at the top there we have a security page on our docs we're actually very open and honest about our security um setup so right now we have a multi-sig that had can like Fast upgrade the entire network so it's like completely centralized really um but yeah we're definitely we have um so once the so the kind of the timeline of like things that are coming is first we're rolling out Bedrock which is like the like next major upgrade to the optimism Network um which is going to like reduce fees a little bit um and really just like make the infrastructure much more robust and hardened and much more like you know we're not going to need to upgrade it for a while because it's going to be very like stable um so once that's out uh it's in Alpha right now once that's out and like on mainit and like actually running and we've got like good data that it's like very stable then the next step is going to be rolling out Canon which is our fraud proof uh mechanism sorry fault proof mechanism um and the fault we're obviously going to start that on like a very whitelist you know no slashing mechanism as we're like testing and figuring it out uh once we show that you know the full the fraud proof fold Proof full proof itself is secure and it's not like accidentally saying things are wrong or right when they're not um then we will roll it out publicly so then anyone can like call uh you know uh say like uh I think there's fraud let me like prove it uh but that will first roll that out with no slashing so like they can call it without any repercussions for the sequencer then once that's stable and we know that's working right then we'll introduce slashing and then we'll start decentralizing the sequences so maybe doing like we haven't 100 chosen how we're going to decentralize the sequence unnecessarily but I think the way we're thinking about this right now is that we're going to do like some kind of sequencer auction where the rights to be the sequence that can be auctioned off and then obviously you know in order to do that we have to have 100 functional fault proofs with slashing enabled but also in order for it to be like decentralized um yeah you kind of do need the sequences to be decentralized because for example like if the entire optimism team died tomorrow the sequencer would go offline and that would not be great um I mean it would run for a while but um yeah so definitely that's a part of being like fully decentralized we definitely need the sequencer to be decentralized but there's this concept that we've been toying with which is like minimum viable decentralization so the minimum viable decentralization for optimism would just be fault proofs because once you can prove fault and have a slashing then like you don't really need like the sequence of being decentralized is like the final step rather than like a necessary step yeah great question though sorry I'm Veronica yes yes I'm Veronica obvious if you see me on Twitter we good yeah let's build it let's go all right well I wish luck to all the hackers uh obviously optimism has lots of cool prizes if you're hacking on optimism uh so definitely check that out um yeah thanks all for coming love to see you [Applause]
