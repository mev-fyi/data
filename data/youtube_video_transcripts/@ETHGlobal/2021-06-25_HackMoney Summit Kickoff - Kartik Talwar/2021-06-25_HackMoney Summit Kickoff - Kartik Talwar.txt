good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of heath global and welcome to hackmoney2021 now all of you are watching this from etheglobal.tv and for those of you who haven't been on this website before this is the interface we use for all of our our summits and our talks and our events and uh i just wanted to quickly give everybody an overview of how everything works uh you're watching this thing live this is not recorded anything you type in the chat will be able to read and reply to we're going to host a lot of content today whether these are there's talks interviews workshops and as these panels and talks happen if you have any questions for our speakers you can simply log in and ask your questions on the chat and we'll be able to relate them to our speakers directly uh when we're taking breaks you get to enjoy our radio and for everybody who signs in you'll be getting co-app nfts to prove that you actually participated at this event so uh be sure to take a minute uh log into your profile and sign in and say hi to all of us so with that said this event is organized by eid global and for those of you who don't know if global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we primarily do this by running hackathons and summits so this event is no different we're going to be running a summit today and and for a few more weeks we have three summits planned for the entirety of this month we're going to have a summit on uh meds and and we're hosting another summit on the unesco grants program and the progress that they've made since the beginning of the program and today is our kickoff summit where we have a few talks from some amazing speakers and we're covering everything from what is happening with d5 on the regulatory side to some interesting macro economics uh on on crypto and security best practices for auditing smart contracts and everything in between now let's talk about the hackathon some of you are joining us the second time for hack money what's super interesting about all this is that hack money uh the very first version of it started in 2020 just about 12 months ago we brought together 350 people to work on some interesting projects and we didn't know what would happen this was right at the beginning of us trying things out online and we were absolutely blown away by the amazing projects that came out of it uh these are some of just our are amazing and interesting highlights i'm sure you've heard of a lot of these companies already they've come up from from our hackathons to now successful protocols in this space to some incredible products and that's just the tip of the iceberg these are just 9 out of 120 projects that came out of the event and we can't wait to see what hackmoney 2021 would look like so this really brings us to our second version of it from 350 people to almost 3x the size this event absolutely blew us away this is by far our biggest event ever we have over 975 state packers they'll be participating over the next three weeks we have over 500 summon attendees for just this week's summit and the hackers that are going to be participating are coming in from 75 different countries and 18 different time zones this is just a map of where everybody's joining us uh from from the rest of the world and it just blows my mind that we have so much diversity in so many different perspectives and so many interesting people that are going to be participating at hackmoney 2021. on top of that we also have over 170 mentors these are some of our our partners these are some of our on staff mentors who are going to be there to help you with anything technical design or protocol related questions whether it's a solidity bug or you want to get advice on how to use a certain protocol we have so many incredible people waiting to just help you on our discord and we have support from 50 amazing companies in in our space these are protocols projects products foundations incredible names and partners from the defy ecosystem that are just waiting to to talk to everybody here and to top it all off we now have over 300 000 in prizes that will be given uh as part of different sponsors and integrations and um various sort of tasks as we have planned for the rest of the hackathon so the most common question we've been getting from everybody who's joining us for the first time is what can i actually build um is this three weeks enough is it do i need to have really specific skill sets what am i just learning something right now and kind of the answer is that there is so much more that you can do in that time and kind of from looking at all the the excitement that everybody's put in and talked about in their applications there are so many applications for lending indexes trading options derivatives nfts that you can play play with whether that's building some new primitives or integrating existing primitives or using similar protocols to now piece together and make more composable products you can do so much more in yield hacking and optimizations whether that's making something more stable or more fixed to to optimizing the yields by doing arbitrages there's so much more in just that sector alone and it's not just that you have to do everything in in protocol development or only stick to writing code in solidity you can do so much more on analytics you can design dashboards to retrieve data or better represent information that's that's already on there on chain uh to design products that let others use these protocols without having that too intricate of a knowledge of how something works under the hood and that's just on the most obvious side there's also opportunities to do integrations on xero knowledge side with that's adding privacy or or adding some sort of composability whether that's integrations with roll up or other layer 2 protocols and there's a lot more you can also do on building developer tools so others can also do this thing in the future a lot more easily so these are just some of the high level categories there's so much more we have to talk on all of this as a topic and we'll be there over the next week just to really showcase some interesting themes and ideas and and brainstorm with you on what else is possible so the way this is set up is that uh i want to take the next 15 minutes and talk about the logistics for the hackathon and then we have some information about our prizes and then immediately after that we'll be able to jump right into our summit talks and and then we get to go get back to hacking so what i want to cover is how team formation works uh this is the most common question we've gotten uh we people are looking for teams people looking to join others uh to either work on an idea or bring on others to build the idea that they already have in mind uh over the next few weeks what happens if you are still learning how you can get help all the prizes you can win what's the structure and how all the talks and workshops work how the judging is going to work for the hackathon and then also how the summit is structured including today so the most important piece here is that all communication for this event is going to be on our discord uh what this means is uh we're minimizing as many opportunities to do something live with the exception of judging this particular uh video right now and all our closing ceremonies in in july everything will be done asynchronously and uh that means to manage all the time zones to manage all the communications to manage all the help that we need to uh to either provide or or check in on all that happens via discord for everybody who is staked as a hacker you will see an option to click on discord and join um and connect your discord to our our our channel and they'll give you access to all the private channels for hack money and this means that anybody who is under the hack money header on on your discord is part of the event and you get to talk to everybody there whether those are our sponsors or protocols or our mentors or see information about the event or judging just everything that you want to know is going to be on discord so please make sure you have access to it please make sure that you can see the hack money 2021 header and uh and if you can't ping anybody on uh on discord on the global team or email us and we'll be able to help uh address that on top of all of that there are a lot of talks and workshops that are happening some already have happened and started over the past few days there's more over the next few weeks or sending calendar invite for all of those events to everybody who is hacking and this means that it will show up on your calendar you get to quickly click on a link and join those conversations and ask anywhere from questions to participate um and and if you forget where the calendar invites or you haven't received it yet um you can always go on to the event website and just see the full schedule immediately and join anything uh from there we want this to be as synchronous as possible which means that if something doesn't work because of your time zone that is completely okay because we are going to be recording all of that and making it available for you to consume immediately after and all that is available on dfi.edu global.com this has all of our event schedule this is all the list of uh the partners that we're working with and all the prizes you can win and how to get in touch with anybody on the global team so now the question is how does the hackathon work we talked about just communication uh we want to highlight some of the rules for this event um before i get to the rules in more detail the the gist of it is that the hackathon begins right now which means as of me saying the sentence you can start working on your projects and you can have up to five members on your team and you get the next 2.5 weeks to submit your your hacks uh that 2.5 weeks ends up being july 5th so you have almost three weeks just to work on anything get feedback get any help or show us what you've been iterating on and really refine from an idea to a important prototype in the course of almost three weeks in the rules and criteria for being a eligible participant to win a prize or or just be considered a hack are fairly straightforward anything that you are going to be submitting must be done over the course of this hackathon which means that all work must start today and spend the next two and a half weeks all the submissions that you are going to do to work on must be related to defy on specifically ethereum and if you have not rsvp'd on our dashboard you will not be eligible to win any prizes so it it's really important that if you are working with a team that all of your team members are listed on your team um officially through our dashboard and if that hasn't happened yet or they're not showing up please ping anybody on the global team so we can really help you address that because we really do have to make sure that everybody is a qualified candidate and everybody is following the exact same rules and then the broader question is well what if i'm new to all of this there's a lot of you who already came in with ideas there's a lot of you who only wanted to work some work on defy in this space but did not specifically know what they want to hack on and i just want to tell everybody that that is completely okay you don't need to have something immediately figured out and you don't have to have an idea already ahead of time there's a few hundred of you in that situation and uh and this is uh this is expected this is normal and uh we have a lot of things that we do to help um address that uh the the first and the the biggest comment i wanna make is you get to head over to a finer teen channel on your discord and you can see everybody else who is looking for teammates or looking to join a team with a certain skill set so if you're looking for a designer or a smart contract developer or a front-end developer you get to ask and and talk about what you're working on or what would you like to work on or what you are able to do and find others who um can work with you for that project on top of that you get to also use the the slides we've made for finding team members there's a those are constantly being updated by everybody who's in that position so you can see he was still not looking we're still looking for a team who was it was already found a team um and and on top of all of that aside from just being on the find a team channel you can also introduce yourself in the hack money chat where you have a thousand plus people just waiting to say hi to you and and give you help on anywhere from refining an idea to understanding if something is possible as you think about all of this and really engage with people from 70 plus countries that are participating at this event and lastly um even if you don't have a an idea or you know that you can do certain things for a team uh we have a couple more opportunities to join a team formation call later today and also on monday so uh time zones aside if if you were able to make any of these calls work today or on monday uh you get to come on live on a zoom call and talk to others who are also looking for team members and really kind of find them and talk to them in real time that specific call is not going to be recorded so if you are able to make it uh you would have to be there live but if because it's later on in the day if you are not able to make it due to time zones the one on monday will be early so we can accommodate for all the other time zones and and all that aside i also want to highlight that you don't necessarily need to have a team it is it's absolutely beneficial if more than one person is doing all the the work and sharing uh the load but it is completely okay to just pick something for yourself to learn and work on for the next few weeks but you don't have to necessarily find somebody to to be eligible to participate in this event is completely okay to hack solo lastly on on talks and workshops uh whether it's the summit talks or some of the workshops on how to use specific protocols uh there's a whole spectrum of content for all levels of experience in the space whether you're a beginner or an expert we have so many opportunities over the next few weeks to to share what's happening in this ecosystem not just d5 but also broadly in ethereum and you can attend any of those from our event schedule you should also already have calendar invites for those of you who are watching this thing that are not hackers these are still all public talks so you can immediately watch them on youtube because everything is recorded and if you're wondering how to think more about the events or get more questions on whether the talks or or how team formation works or what are some rules and criteria for this event you can head over to the info center that all of you can find on your dashboard to get all those details in all those explanations a lot more details and just one more time all of that is public and available on defined on each global dot co so you can see each of the talks on the schedule you can click you can sign up for uh the summits and be notified over email as we as we announce and we're ready or we're near the next event and any talk that's already happened can be found on the website with a link to the recorded youtube now one of the most important pieces of all of this experience are the check-ins there's about a thousand of you that are participating at the hackathon which means that there's a lot of stuff that's happening asynchronously and we have this checking system to really get stay on top of what's happening for this entire event for just the global team and for our mentors to really help you um get unblocked so uh check-ins happen once a week uh so you'll have two to three check-ins for the course of this event uh and the what happens in checking is it's fairly straightforward we just ask you what you're working on and what did you do uh last week or since the last check-in and you can write a couple sentences there and press submit that's that's all there is to it you also get to define some of the prices that you're applying for and are are going to be um planning to to integrate and that also helps us understand that uh if if you need any help with integrating any of these things we can connect you with the right people to make sure that you don't have any issues or technical integration problems this really kind of helps us get you the help you need to stay unblocked you'll be able to follow all of that on the discord channels and you'll be assigned you'll be kind of prompted to kind of just post your check in there as well and we'll find we'll kind of share all those details over the next few days and as you respond to check-ins and submit a project the stake you've put forward uh gets returned and all this happens again asynchronous dba dashboard so you don't have to look up for any email or specific message as soon as you log in onto your dashboard on monday you'll be able to see the next steps and after those check-ins and after a lot of uh talks and workshops and two and a half weeks of hacking um we kind of get to the submission space and what i want to talk about here is just a quick format of how judging works we really want this thing to be a synchronous so uh to submit your project all you have to do is record a maximum four minute video of of your demo this covers who you are as a team what you've been uh doing over the past few weeks what inspired you to work on this project and a demo of how it works and everything you were able to do and as you do that you get to submit that on your dashboard again and we get to then uh set up for judging slots that happen the week the days after judging is due so the quick reminders here are do not do this thing last minute because uh to get to get looks like we're having some technical difficulties so um to not do this thing last minute to get a there we go uh douglas last minute because uh to get a four minute working video keeping all transaction confirmations in mind does take long so it's important that you kind of get to record everything and plan for how the whole demo works and you're able to anywhere from cutout and efficient or waiting periods from the video or really make sure that you have a way to still snapshot what you did in case something breaks as you're presenting it to the judges for the judging live and all these details again are going to be made available on the info center and also on your dashboard and we have example videos that you can look at we have example submissions that you can see through on what details you need to provide and you can also watch some of the live previous judging sessions from previous events on this and really see how that whole process goes um if you'd like and then as part of all this i want to make sure that this is a still an event even though it's online and we have a code of conduct that we want everybody to abide by and uh the rules and the code of conduct are are uh over at each global dot co slash rules uh this talks about some of the best practices for how to behave in in our online community and also what it means to participate at the hackathon uh the gist of it is that uh in terms of rules i've already highlighted them before which are you have to work on something that's as part of this as part of the window the hackathon is is open and officially running and anything that you build over the course of this event um the ip of that solely belongs to you so you own the full rights to do whatever you would like for your project um and uh the gist of the code of conduct is that please be respectful to everybody on on the discord and on the calls and harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any capacity um if if you believe somebody is behaving uh not like they should uh please reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be there too to help and lastly just as i wrap up the logistical pieces i want to quickly just take a deep breath and tell everybody to really pace themselves uh you have a lot of time to understand what's happening you have a whole week just to learn and catch up and explore what's possible we do not want this thing to be exhausting for you this is not a competition we really want you to have fun there's so many people that are participating for the first time that are just getting started in understanding what's what's out there in the world of web 3 and we really want this thing to be about learning and experimentation so it is totally okay if at the end of this event you don't get to finish what you wanted to do or you only get to 50 instead of 100 we want you to learn and that's our primary goal we want to make sure that you can continue to build in the space and we have the whole set up to ensure that you get the help you need whether that's during the event or even after the event so please don't hesitate to ask any questions as simple or as complex as they may be on our discord because we have so many dedicated people just waiting to help you and help answer all of your questions so don't be afraid to to be in a place where you think you may not have a full project this is very much of our experimentation and we just want you to learn something more than you did as of today all right so that was a lot of logistical information all crammed into the last 20 minutes so i'll take a quick five second pause and and uh and we'll walk through any questions that come in from our chat and uh we'll get to address that uh in a few minutes as we move over to the rest of the content but until that kind of comes in what i want to do is quickly highlight the schedule for today and what the next two to three hours look like so uh immediately up next is uh prizes and some of our our videos from uh some of the sponsors that we've asked to uh to introduce themselves and then we're going to jump in just exactly an hour and we're going to jump into our very first summit talk and that's going to be an interview with the sec commissioner esther purse and uh marvin amari from uniswap then we have a an amazing chat with dimitri kofinas and hasu on just the macroeconomics of crypto then we have our d5 security panel where we'll have mariana conte sam emiliano and martine talk about some of the best practices in writing safe smart contracts especially as you deal with people's money um and then we have some just quick 60 second closing remarks i'm just wrapping up the day and then uh later today we have uh our first live team formations formation session after the event kicks off and and that's that's pretty much it so a few more hours from now we'll be on track and with that let's get ready to talk about some of our amazing partners so i want to quickly thank all the amazing people that have kind of signed on to help over the next month for for attendees from our mentor side and everybody in in the space so there's a lot of amazing companies and protocols out there that are going to be present at this event so i want to first thank all of our presenting sponsors and that's unique in a swap grants program compounds grand program uh circle one inch ave and steak dial so um they've been an immensely helpful partner to work with over this event and we also have badger the ethereum foundation superfluid and balancer next up we have our pillar partners want to thank protocol labs kyber network vega nexus mutual wearable the graph liquidity uma 88 miles per hour enzyme harmony paraswap element finance pillar polygon and flashbots all these protocols are here to help you integrate what you can do in uh in the defy ecosystem and there's so many incredible primitives that you'll get to explore soon on our provider partners we have oasis foundation acropolis economy consensus umbrella network gas station network streamer upshot startware connects covalent idle finance pots finance instadap bitco chain link teller ens and lastly are our supporting partners matcha kwan stamp lemniscap hermes coinspect and saddle this is an incredible lineup of so many amazing companies uh and if you're thinking about anything in the categories i've named about whether that's lending options insurance protocol uh indexes uh aggregators nfts like layer twos you have a full spectrum of things that you can do and you can ask any of these companies on what is and is impossible or how you can remove some work from your plate and just use these protocols just to get started and focus on the core value prop of of your experience for the hackathon project so those were some of our our amazing partners uh we also asked a few of them to record a few words uh talking about who they are what they're excited about some of the culture at their at their team and and why they're excited to to be part of this event for the next month so i wanna can i have them share a few words here and as we get ready for that we'll be able to jump into talking with the details for our prizes so without further ado let's let's roll uh some of our partner videos hello hack money my name is jesse weiss and i'm a marketing director here at circle we're so excited to be participating in this hackathon with all of you as the company behind the fast-growing stablecoin usdc and a suite of apis that help businesses around the world build financial apps across payments treasury and digital commerce use cases we truly believe the future of finance is being built on chain by developers like you our goal in participating in this event is to help you get a better understanding of the role both usdc and our apis can play in the development of defy and blockchain-based finance apps we're here to provide access to the resources and tools you need to implement usdc into your project on thursday our vp of product joao reginato will be hosting a workshop to help you learn exactly how you as a developer can leverage both usdc and our apis to build on and off ramps into defy he was the product lead on both usdc and our apis and he'll give you a quick overview of the products as well as a couple of customer stories from companies like ftx dapper labs and dharma will be available on discord for the entirety of the hackathon so feel please feel free to reach out and connect with us there you can also connect with us at circle.com we're so excited to be here and we can't wait to see what all of you build hey everyone my name is nick martich and i work on business development for compound labs for anyone who's not familiar the compound protocol is a set of globally accessible open source interest rate markets allowing anyone to earn an interest rate on their idle assets and use them as collateral to borrow other assets since september of 2018 compound has processed over 140 billion dollars of supply volume 40 billion of borrowing volume and has cemented itself as a core piece of financial infrastructure for the decentralized economy compound is a developer first protocol that opens up a new universe of innovative financial applications we've seen folks use compound for a variety of use cases like savings accounts prize pools leveraged tokens portfolio trackers and fixed income products just to name a few our team is now working on a new project called gateway that will expand compounds interest rate markets beyond just the ethereum ecosystem gateway allows users to upload assets from connected peer blockchains which are used as collateral to borrow any assets supported by the network the ultimate vision for gateway is to prepare for a multi-chain world where assets interact seamlessly across multiple layer 1 blockchains the success of both compound v2 and gateway will depend on talented developers who build new integrations upgrade the protocol's code base and actively participate in governance there's also never been a better time to contribute to the compound ecosystem and get rewarded for doing so hackathons grant programs and the governance system all present great opportunities to get funding for your work we're excited you're here and can't wait to see what you'll build next this is sonic from the uh other protocols uh genesis team so we are the team that uh built the other protocol and and gave the protocol to the community ownership and uh so excited to be here in in this hackathon participating uh and being able to judge different projects here and uh to give some context what hub is so obvi is a our protocol is a decentralized interest rate market where you can come and deposit different kinds of cryptographic assets and see those assets grow in terms of interest rate uh in in form of balance and your deposit also uh acts as a collateral in the protocol meaning that once you deposit into the protocol you can actually borrow other assets from the protocol or you can delegate that borrowing power uh to someone else and uh as a protocol the the market consists of different kinds of assets that you can use and and the protocol is deployed on the main ethereum network and also uh test nets uh such as the common test net and also in the matic uh network so if you're building on automatic or or the mainnet or covan desnet this is very interesting uh proposition for you to test the cross chain operability especially if you have some sort of a hack in mind that uh could empower both of these communities and uh anyone who is participating uh should also mind that uh we as a team are here to support you and and the other grounds style as well and there's various prices that you can actually uh win uh during this hackathon and and so once the prices are for example for the best uh pack you will get 7 000 usdc and for the second price you get three thousand and thirty two thousand there's various things you can actually build on top of the protocol itself and we'll go more into detail in that or you can ask any questions uh in in the uh discord happy to be here and thank you everyone hey my name is karil and i am the lead blockchain engineer in one inch network as you can know one inch was built in 2019 on ethereum new york hackathon and the initial protocol of the one inch network was a dex aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources and offering users better rates than any individual exchange this protocol incorporates the pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over 50 plus liquidity sources on ethereum 20 plus liquidity sources on one and smart chain and seven plus liquidity sources on polygon in less than two years the one inch dex aggregator surprised 50 billion in overall volume another product of one inch ecosystem is one inch liquidity protocol this is a next generation automated market maker that protects users against front railing attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers and our latest release is one inch limit order protocol this protocol offers an unmatched level of flexibility which shows in two major features dynamic prices and conditional execution use our protocols with pleasure thanks hey guys i'm turin bootaloo i'm one of the contributors of stake down stackdau is a decentralized exchange uh with a very nice ux in ui and we from buying selling assets uh into some very advanced uh trading uh other routing mechanism to investing in some very advanced strategies euro us dollars bitcoin ethereum all the different ones into some different networks like binance ethereum polygon and then staking inside native native protocols like solana polygon cosmos and all the different ones and then earning extra views on the top of it to some governance things or you can earn the different proceeds from the dow and also some nft mechanism where we are the only one providing advanced mechanism on top of nfts for you to boost your api or have access to some vip strategies or vip products that we have been building you can also like build for arbitrage liquidations uh different strategies so if you're looking to participate inside this architecture you can click on the top of the binary instructor and it will bring you to where we are offering those different prices so 405 uh 4 and 500 us dollars for the best strategies and also some very exotic ones so example apy hunter we've been working on some of them but would like you to join and help us build and ship those different strategies and also like two thousand and five hundred year stores for two links uh so we have a typescript sdk uh helpers on the top of soyut contracts zaps and some modular strategy framework we also have a partnership with superfluid 1000 users for uh building on top of it and a world card and pool price which is uh four thousand usd so if you're building some really cool stuff that we think is really nice to add inside the state that will be willing to reward you so if you can you can join us uh on discord uh sponsored sponsors take down uh on the east global channel and be answering questions you can also like tag or hashtag us into the twitter and if you have questions for me directly about the hack you can contact me and reach out to me on twit on twitter at beanelsh i think that's it uh happy hacking guys see ya [Music] hey everybody chris battle for here from badger dao just wanted to say we're super excited to be participating with hack money this year and i'm looking forward to seeing what but everyone builds to give you an overview of badger we're a community owned project that has really a singular focus which is build the products and infrastructure necessary to bring bitcoin to d5 you know today we have a handful of products that enable users to bring their bitcoin to ethereum and other chains and then when it's there put it to work our foundational product is uh sep vaults which is a yield aggregation product for tokenized bitcoin so we run non-custodial smart contract-based strategies on tokenized bitcoin across other protocols in d5 like sushi swap and curve and uniswap and so forth we also have a badger bridge that enables you to bring bitcoin to ethereum and put it to work with one click and then we also have a few synthetic products like intersperon bitcoin and dig intersperon bitcoin is a basket of yield bearing bitcoin tokens and dig is a synthetic rebasing bitcoin so as it relates to the prizes which we're super excited to announce we have 12 000 total and prizes and 10 000 of that 12 000 dedicated to bitcoin yield strategies that means is for this hackathon the top three yield strategies that are tokenized bitcoin focus on either mainnet or polygon will be rewarded that ten thousand dollars you can get started super quick by using our badger strategy mix and follow the step-by-step tutorial and workshop video to start building on badger right away and then we also have a two thousand dollar open prize really for anybody that wants to build anything bitcoin dao related governance oriented so couldn't be more excited to see what everyone builds and looking forward to the had fun [Music] hello everyone my name is francesco i'm one of the founders of superfluid and i'm extremely excited to welcome you to hack money this year we really wanted to sponsor this hackathon because hacking money is exactly what we do at superfluid we have rebuilt tokens to what we call the super token standard now super tokens are like tokens on steroids we have amazing functionalities like money stream rewards distribution and batch calls built directly into money and what this means is that you can have native experiences like for example recurring automated payments so let me tell you a bit about money streaming so money streams are these perpetual uh instances of transfers right so basically you open a stream and once you've opened it money will start flowing from your account to the counterparty's account without the need for any intermediate transactions so as a user you simply have one transaction to sign on chain and then hands off you can walk away money will keep flowing forever until you close the stream or until you run out of money now what this means is that we can enable a very good ux for recurring payments and recurring payments are an incredibly important piece of payment infrastructure because if you look at web 2 what we've seen is it's basically made the fortune of a lot of companies now for us it's very important to monetize webfree in a sustainable way and we believe that money streaming will be the way we do this so using money streaming you can do subscription payments you can do salary payments but you can also build real-time finance finance where you use streams this is something we're very excited about and you can find out more on our website now i'll tell you a bit about our bounties so the first and most exciting thing for us is enabling anyone on the internet even if they don't know that much about crypto to accept streaming money for subscriptions so our top prize for this hackathon is 2 500 for the best checkout experience you don't need to know solidity just dazzle them with a great ux now we also have free bounties which are basically building a savings account where you can stream in and out the savings account can be staked out or ave and as a user you should be able to stream your money into it the second bounty is a streaming exchange in this case imagine you have die you want to stream and buy ether every second third one is for the best use of erc777 callbacks which enable you to stop using token allowances so improving the ux of defy throughout now we also have a price pool of three thousand dollars which will be split with everyone using superfluid so if your idea doesn't fit in please have a look at that now there's two ways you can use superfluid either on the front end where you basically use our javascript sdk to interface directly with the contracts in this case you don't need to know solidity and you can get away with literally one line of javascript to open a flow so this is very very very easy for you and i think it's going to be a great a great first step into web3 if you're more advanced you want to take on the second third or fourth bounty then you will use the super app framework which allows you to create applications which react to streams now what this means is if i open a stream towards your contract you'll be able to execute logic and when i close my stream you'll be able to execute logic again enabling these really complex uh financial applications which have never been built before now if you want to play around with it go to our dashboard it's very easy to use you don't need any specialized knowledge just go to app.superfluid.finance and send your first money stream now i'm extremely excited to welcome you all to hackmoney if you do have any questions or if you want to get in contact with us go to discord.superfluid.finance you will find the team you'll be able to ask questions we'll point you towards your resources we'll help you find team if you don't have one we'll help you find team members if you need them and in general it would be great to just have you join the community and create new money with us good luck guys hey guys this is fernando from balancer welcome to hack money it's great to have you here i'm sure many of you know that from hackathons like this come great protocols and projects i'm sure i'm going to see some big things out of this hopefully using balancer so why are we so excited about balancer battle survey1 was all about creating liquidity pools that were like index funds so you could create a pool that has 20 watts 30 dime 50 mkr and balance of v1 make sure that that distribution of value kept this way now we talked to other teams like ocean power pool and idle finance and so many others we realized that this was a bit too strict to limit it so we create a balancer v2 with some very interesting features that allow for it to be a lot more extensible and for other projects to build on top of it much more smoothly now two main features the first one is that you can have customizable amm logic so it doesn't have to be the index fund style pools can be like curved spools where you have stable points that have better trades for price one and this is already live and coven going to mainnet soon but you have other teams creating um like element.finance amms that change over time because it's better for their zero coupon tokens or stablecoin projects that have taxes for people who are selling the stablecoin below the pack and those taxes go to the project's vault for example so that that's very interesting the second nice feature is the asset managers why would we use the idle tokens in balancer pools and create a lending platform ourselves if there is amazing platforms like ave and others around so the idea was that asset managers allow you to do whatever you want with your token with your pool's tokens and it could be lenient ave or urine or doing other stuff but you could also be used for voting which is what powerpoint is doing so there's so many nice things that you can build in battle city too make sure you ask questions and and come to our discord or to our discord channel and we'll be very happy to assist you on whatever we can really excited to see you guys beauty and balancer thanks hello everyone uh this is sandeep from uh polygon network uh i'm really excited uh that that polygon is uh yet again a part of uh global hackathon uh hack money and uh you know we have been uh always developer focused and uh being a part of uh e global hackathons has been uh one of the best things uh you know in most uh you know kind of rewarding experiences uh in terms of learning in terms of getting to know the community so really excited for this um about polygon so polygon as uh you know many of you guys would know that polygon is a basically a ethereum scaling aggregator it supports it is expected to support more multiple you know scaling mechanism eventually and we also recently launched polygon sdk which helps you spawn up your own chains um and then you know we have we are going to launch uh you know very soon uh more into the roll-up domains more more solution the roll-up domains um and especially for hack money like recently you guys must have seen uh exponential growth of d5 on polygon we have i think more than 10 uh more than eight billion dollars worth of tvl logged in various applications all the big you know applications in the defy space like ave curve uh and then you know many many more sushi sushi they are all available on polygon uh we are offering 8k in bounties and uh you can uh you know find more details on our notion page all the best to you all and hope hope you guys are able to come up with really fascinating applications which has been the legacy of uh all the eth global hackathons thank you so much and feel free to reach out to uh to any of us over discord or anywhere else and we would love to help you out all the best amazing so hope you got to enjoy some of those videos um from from our sponsors they talked about everything that their protocols can do and their platforms are designed for so i'm sure um as i'm seeing some on the chat there's a lot of ideas flowing and there's so many new things that you can experiment with that we haven't really even seen kind of the possibilities for so those were just some of our our messages from the sponsors early on and what we're going to do now is just talk about some of our prizes so you've been waiting for this for quite some time we have a list of every every company that's giving out a prize and what they're doing and we made a a quick compilation of uh them talking about their prizes as well so we will see ave compound one inch uni swap circle staked out badger superfluid bouncer for collapse mega wearable kyber nexus mutual enzyme harmony 88 miles per hour liquidy uma pillar element and polygon just going to come on now and and talk about all the prizes that they're giving out and how you can qualify hey everybody this is ken on behalf of phoenix off grants program and we're so honored to be sponsoring another fantastic youth global event this time for act money we've come prepared with six jam-packed bounties with up to twelve thousand dollars in uni four of which are unison specific so two for the most innovative and two for the most impactful hacks built on top of unit swap and we have a social surprise for you in collaboration with flashbots we're offering four thousand dollars for two bounties the first of which is for the best hack building one of the challenges to put forward in our hacker guide and the second is for the most creative usage of both flashbots and unit swap so let your imagination run wild check out our hacker guide if you have any questions find us on discord or hit us up on twitter best of luck everybody all right on to the fun stuff let's talk about prizes circle will be donating 12 000 in usdc to the prize pool and we'll be splitting it between three of the projects that we're judging the first prize is the best overall solution and this is something that we think is going to fundamentally change the world that prize will be seven thousand dollars in usdc the second prize is the best out of the box solution this is a project that honestly blew our mind how the hell did you think of that that prize will be three thousand dollars in usdc and finally last but not least um the most practical solution will be the third prize this was simply a great idea that was well executed and the prize there will be two thousand dollars in usdc good luck to everyone participating and we can't wait to see all the projects hi i'm larry and i'm the lead for the compound grants program if you haven't heard of us the compound grants program is an independent community-led grants program established earlier this year so far we funded dozens of grants and plan to fund dozens more over the coming months we're really excited about hack money and as part of that we have four prizes that we're featuring for this hackathon the first prize is for two and a half thousand dollars and it's for someone who builds the most original use case for supplying assets to compound the second prize also two and a half thousand dollars is for the most original borrowing use case on compound the third prize is for someone to build an open source interface on top of compound and there again the prize is two and a half thousand dollars and then for everyone else who's building really cool things on compound we have a prize pool of two and a half thousand dollars if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask we'll be in the hack money discord channel all day long happy hacking so three three top three projects on the uh other protocol side are able to win from the other grand style uh three different kinds of prices so the first main price of the winner of the uh protocol usage will get seven thousand dollars worth of uh usdc and the second one will get 3000 worth of usdc and third two thousand for the usdc those are there's different examples with uh imran is going from the overground style going to elaborate more and and yeah thank you sonny uh so there are three areas of focus for ave in order for avid to grow to next billion users uh the first is looking for integrations startups are looking to integrate with uh ave as a protocol and building on top of ave the second is really understanding growth and understanding what are some of the tools that users need so things like uh credit delegation dashboard or thinking about bringing real world assets into ave or ave pro and then finally it's bringing more analytics and tooling to to ave and its users so things like being able to uh build out ave transaction explorer is something that we're looking deeply into um and these are the the three areas of focus for us please ping any of the ave team members and we can give you more details on the types of startups we'd like to support thank you so much thank you everyone hey one inch network prepared five tasks for hack money hackathon with the words of 12 000 usd in one inch token the first challenge it's a margin trading on the one inch limit order protocol the second challenge it's a limit order adapter for the one inch liquidity protocol you need to build an adapter for creation limit orders over the one inch liquidity protocol or over any decentralized exchange based on their available liquidity the third task it's a automated market market making strategy for stable coins using their one inch limit order protocol and the fourth task it's a mesh network for one inch limit order protocol you need to build a peer-to-peer network that will validate receive limit orders and distribute them among the network spears and the last track it's open track you can suggest your own solution keep in mind that one inch limit order protocol has conditional execution and arbitrary price discovery we wish you success with your tasks [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] hey everybody chris here from badger dao just wanted to share our prizes for hack money we have 12 000 in prizes total 10 000 of those are dedicated to what we call bitcoin yield strategies and that's building different types of yield farming strategies specifically for tokenized bitcoin on main menu on polygon and we've given a quick start guide on how to start building yield strategies using the badger dev infrastructure and protocol and then we also have an open price for 2000 which is essentially built anything on top of badger you know that could be tied to uh btc that could be tied to multi-chain governance that could be tied to some of our products like interested in bitcoin or dig but nonetheless could be more excited to see what you build hello everyone welcome to hack money come join us and build the future of online payments using superfluid so we are extremely excited about providing everyone online even if they don't know much about crypto with the opportunity to accept streaming money as a way for subscriptions for this reason our top prize for this hackathon is thousand five hundred dollars for anyone who can build a dazzling checkout now here you don't need to know solidity all you need to do is create extremely good ux so that even merchants who don't know crypto can use it our second prize is to put that money to work so as the merchants receive it they should be able to invest that money into a savings account that gives them a yield like ave or stakedown the third the further bounty is for streaming exchange so imagine you want to stream die and buy ether every second the

prizes from various sponsors and from various uh integrations that you can qualify for and uh if you didn't get all of them or you missed out some details uh don't worry all these are available on defy.educlopa.com prices you can see all the details along with the documentation and some workshop videos on how to use them and some sample code for all of all of our our partners so if you have any questions on the prizes or how everything works you can check all that out on this url a quick note about how pooling works is that instead of having a a particular first second third qualifier for or a winner for any of these integrations anybody who uses the sdk integration in their project and qualifies with an acceptable use of that integration will get an equal split for the total prize money so for example if 10 projects use a protocol and are qualifying for the pool price of 4 000 then each project we'll get a tenth of that and we'll split that into individuals so if there are 10 individuals in total then each of them will get 400. so hopefully that clarifies some of this verbally all those are written down in a lot more detail onto this prize page so be sure to check that out over the course of the next few weeks and let us know if you have any questions so all that said we are at the end of the logistics of everything that you need to know for the hackathon i want to wish everybody happy hacking as you embark on two and a half weeks of super awesome and hard work on just seeing what's possible with with defy and especially on the protocols in the integration side so with that um i want to thank everybody who stayed for all of our logistics piece as a hacker and for those of you who are joining us for the summit pieces we are ready to start that now so first thing i want to do is just for everybody who's just joining us now um i want to take a quick break and uh oh sorry here we go i want to just take a quick break let's just get everybody a couple minutes to relax um so we'll we'll just uh put on a two minute break and uh hope you enjoy the radio in the meantime and we'll resume everything in about two minutes and we'll kick us off with our very first talk of the day
