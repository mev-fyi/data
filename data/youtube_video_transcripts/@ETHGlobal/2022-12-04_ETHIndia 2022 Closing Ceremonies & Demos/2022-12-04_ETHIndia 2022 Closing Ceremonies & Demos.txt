foreign we are about to begin there we go are you all ready let's get started [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign ERS of equal and I thank all of you for your patience on us getting this started this is the closing ceremony and the finale of 8th India 2022. this is a global event and it is global we want web3 to win and eth India is our final event of this year and this is the most incredible thing we've ever done 2 000 attendees from 321 different cities are here in this room 44 of these are new to web3 just look at where people came from in just India alone and we can't wait to show all of you what this weekend yielded not only that this is officially the world's biggest ethereum hackathon [Applause] all these 2000 attendees worked on incredible projects and our goal for the next hour and a half is to show some of those amazing demos and of course talk about all the amazing prizes 459 projects came out of this weekend that is the most we have ever seen from any one of our events and this is exactly why everything is running slightly behind schedule turns out that humans are not linearly scalable we learned so much in making this event from a logistical standpoint Alone um I got excited about all the new challenges we can do and I'm already thinking about how do we exceed this number for next year so let's get the party started I want to first start off by thanking 45 of our incredible Partners who are here this entire weekend talking to everybody working with all the teams giving them feedback so I'm going to try to do this thing as fast as I can which means the faster you Clap the faster I'll say the logos and three two one go thank you by economy polygon Quest Book World coin push protocol ipfs file coordinate theorem

we're gonna go through all of that in just a little while let's get back to these 459 projects this was a behemoth of a task in just us reviewing and going through all of these things we had 46 incredible judges come in scale up 20 parallel processes to go through all these projects over the entire morning and most of the afternoon and through all of their hard work we are proud to announce 12 finalists we're gonna bring these 12 teams on here one by one they're going to demo what they built and after that we're going to talk about all the prizes that all of you have been waiting for so please join me in congratulating these 12 teams wet 3 rescue chain pay block alerts Bowl D paper so when I bought all detection so Dave CI proof of trust eat guard chart swap Trickle and Safeguard these are our 12 incredible finalists we're gonna get started with bringing them on stage to show their what they built and do a live demo and right after that we're going to go into all these prizes but before we go into the first demo I want to take a quick second to thank here the 447 teams who are not on that 12 list but still did an incredible amount of work this weekend just because you were not one of these 12 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong our goal was just to highlight something that all of our incredible judges and people in this space were excited about and that's who we bring on on stage but I want to congratulate to every single team here that presented we we really appreciate this and you want to congratulate yourself for doing all this incredible work over the past 48 hours so please give yourselves a big round of applause for just submitting a project which is a no easy challenge a huge shout out to all of you can see all these projects on the defolia projects page website they'll soon also be visible on the global showcase but enough of talking from me let's get started with our very first demo so please welcome web3 rescue on stage thank you hey hello guys we we a team at Webster rescue we are building a solution let us see what's our problem so problem is all developers over here you could have did one mistake that is committing your private keys to public repos at least once in a time so and another mistake is at least writing your seed phrases somewhere and giving it to your users or maybe sharing your private case within WhatsApp and by mistakely showing this private key to someone so there's this problem so what we are today doing is we are going to rescue nfts from your compromise wallet addresses so that's something which we are gonna do today we are gonna rescue one rescue we are going to perform a rescue today itself and live in front of you where we are gonna beat a sweeper bot so what I would want you to know is just a minute about the sweeper bot sweeper bot is someone who is monitoring your transactions so if your wallet address is compromised sweeper bot is monitoring the beam pool transactions so whenever any incoming internalization is there let's just suppose it's of one ethereum sweeper bot will instantly remove this out from your wallet by giving a gas fee of 5 500 why that's really high and for you to bid this you can't so right now what we are going to do is we are going to show a wallet address which let's suppose it's a compromised address which any amounts sent on that wallet address will be sweeped instantly so now we are gonna take a look at the exact rescue so what happens is right now we are supporting five methods panic mode web and erc20 collectibles erc20 tokens ens and smart contracts wallet today we are gonna rescue anchor token which is stuck inside and wallet address this is the wallet address which is being stuck right now not yeah let's just go for a rescue so a wallet address which is stuck right now starts with 0x3d6 which you can see in front of you right now hold on yeah so we are facing a private key you can take this privacy but it has nothing inside it so right now this is the private key which is having 30 anchor tokens inside it right now what we are going to do is we will also enter safe address safe address is an address where you want your assets back so light right now I am the compromised one I want my save address on some safe address address which I which is kind of secure so we are going to enter the safe address let's just go forwards through and Rescue click on S yeah that's it that's it you just have to enter that's it and what we will do is we will sponsor your transaction and everything is live on magnet right now so what will happen actually we will be using making use of private transactions by flashbots so what will happen one of our wallets will deposit funds into your compromised account it will instantly remove your second transition that is transfer your anchor tokens from compromise account to your safe address both of this transactions will be happening in the same block so even if someone is monitoring your meme pool transactions he won't know this is gonna happen and this is an instant transition which will happen in front of you right now let's just wait for transaction to be processed yeah it is rescued successfully let's just take a look at what happened exactly so I am going towards an ether scan right now as you see we were having one token which was around 30 anchor as you remember what happened a wallet address named as rescuef3.eat put inside of what they just want it put a transaction it sent around 0.01 ether and in the second transaction if you see all those nfts were transferred sorry erc20 tokens to the safe address and this all is done within the same block number so if you see the block number ends within same ending 016016 so in this way you can just perform any kind of transaction which you weren't able to do because your private key was hacked when someone is sweeping your teeth from it so right now you can do this you can do any kind of ens rescue any kind of contract transactions any kind of things like that you can also remove your staked assets so if you have stealed something like around into some kind of LP tokens or anything or somewhere they are gonna be unlocked after an year so what you can do is you can use this platform and rescue this token instantly and send it back to you and what I'm mentioning is you can also claim the rewards alongside so over here you can just literally do any kind of transaction which you were not able to do normally so this product R solves these problems [Music] amazing all right please give them a big round of applause going first is not easy and this worked flawlessly all right next up we're going to bring on proof of trust our second project finalists of the day please give proof of trust a big round of applause and we're gonna have to do a quick switch on laptops so let's hope that Murphy's Law doesn't kick in all right um GM friends I know it's not morning but you know we have crypto Builders that's how we introduce and roll all right um as we are we are basically hackers and Builders from not finance and our project is called as proof of trust so before I elaborate we have this which kind of is a very very quick and short you know uh kind of graphical summary of what our project is about we I don't think I need to describe this any further all of us are aware of what it is essentially what we're trying to do is change this around right we are trying to build a proof of trust a protocol layer that every single centralized exchange out there can kind of take inspiration from if not directly Implement so as to that uh we are able to prove the solvency of all the major large crypto uh currency centralized exchanges that are out there so uh in this right like we have two main parts of it what is essentially that proving solvency there is proof of reserves and then there is proof of you know liabilities reserves is essentially proving that the exchange has enough funds while liabilities is accounting for all the various deposits Investments Etc that have been done on the Chain by itself sorry on the exchange by itself so now we're going to run down through a quick demo of this okay so as we know right currently how the things working all the exchanges are trying to prove their reserves and just let me right go through one of the way they're doing it so recently last week only binance has proved their results by transferring 123 K BTC right to some public address and at particular time is time and that time stamp bus is defined by an auditor so problem in this one is first like binance has to transfer that much amount to that particular address so unnecessarily they have to pay the gas cost and the most important here right the the all the things are getting audited by the single auditor so what we are proposing it will be a consensus between the multiple Auditors so and the company like binance can hire write more than the the one auditor at least that that I can right assure so suppose take example binance is hiring right 50 Auditors and there will a consensus between those and they will Define a Time stab not in the future because because you know right what happened in the last two weeks because whenever these guys try trying to put the reserves then what they are just transferring the fronts between these expenses itself so that is one of the biggest problems so what we are doing so we are asking these Auditors to come up with a Epoch time while consensus between other Epoch time will be in the past so after deciding the Epoch time these all these Auditors will just announce okay I am going to audit your reserves and so after that results should be able to right prepare whatever things needs to be done so so that's where right uh these these all these what we call Auditors right will be able to uh prove their results and how it will work so they will take the snapshots of all all the wallets whatever they are declared by those exchanges and apart from that not only this this will always reflect how much balance they have so most important here like uh just example uh suppose binance has the five account and there are 50 Auditors so what we are adding most complexity here so they can't cheat this system they each each all the uh what we call Auditors right Auditors has to give the some challenges challenges to exchange in terms of the nouns so each each supposed in our example there was a five accounts and 50 Auditors so each exchange has two sine 250 transactions and all those transactions will be validated by this group of auditors and once it is done so that's proof that those exchanges are holding the private key of all those wallets and they have certain funds thus fund is not validated it so that will be validated by the liabilities so that where comes the profile liabilities right unfortunately we cannot go through these specific steps our repositories of course public feel free to hit us up on any of the social media platforms and we'll we can go over it better so I'm going to quickly switch to the other part of it which is proof of liabilities um Can the screens be switched all right uh while that's happening essentially how the proof of liabilities will be done is ultimately the snapshot of the database where the user liabilities is maintained is with the centralized exchange so uh one of the ways this is done is one of the ways it's done is essentially uh by generating a mobile tree now even this with this Mercury approach there are certain uh you know drawbacks which is a particular exchange could add a leaf node with a negative value what this means is while the root sum should have about 100K dollars it could you know you could add a minus 10K dollars and essentially the root sum will end up with 90k dollars that's not what you want so to prevent that we've added a few layers to that and I will go over it as soon as we have the screen live um so your idea is very simple user is the perfect guy who will validate the proof of liabilities and nothing but the how they think select all the whatever the the Mercury right The Exchange is generating so that will consist in the leaf nodes that will consist two things one is the has has what has of the user name I'm saying there is no privacy because it is hashed with some salt value and the most right important is security security thing is here these highest value right and salt is will be transferred to the users and using that they can prove the liabilities and once once if they Reserve whatever defined during the Auditors is greater than equal to liabilities so it will prove this solvency if something is happen how something is wrong in whole process then whole Pro whole things will be insolvent building or something okay um just as a side note and disclaimer we are just hackers and Builders not the perfect presenters disclaimer just excuse us for the few glitches technical glitches that we've had today but we have a fully functional protocol um you could maybe come and meet us later on or you know pull from our and due to time constraint we have the right uh to wind up with very quickly so I will we will have here right and you can come to us I will give it a proper demo I will explain all the all the functionality all the technical aspects everything and I will answer all your questions because I know that this is the topic you already have the 20 Questions already that I can assume yeah thank you an accident thank you congratulations I need my mic to be always on please well this is a very apt topic because we have seen a lot of things go wrong recently and now we get an implementation that also came from a recent research from uh from vitalik if I recall this was the implementation of this all right next up is our third demo and that is Project block alerts please welcome block alerts on stage Good Burger I think some technical difficulties there we go hello guys so today we are going to show you demo block alerts so block alerts provide you a platform here where you can set up alerts on your smart contact function functions whether it is Transit transaction or events so let's get started with the demo so here I will try to create alert and I will enter the alert name here I need to enter a smart contract address and now I will enter the select webhook so once my alert is created so what I'm going to do is I am going to execute a transaction of erc20 token transfer via uh this remix so addresses already said the amount is already set so I will just click on the transact just give me a minute sorry I will just click on transit and once I click on transact then I will wait on Slack to reflect to get the transaction reflected so let's wait for some time yeah so the transaction came and 12 my token one tokens are being transferred from this address to this address so this is what we have to show you thank you guys thank you all right next up we have IM bold please give them a big round of applause perfect hello hello [Music] so good evening everyone so how is all the energy here so this is maduka that's dhanush and tejasini and we are presenting you uh bold bold is a strategic Team Management game where you join and you are the owner of a T20 cricket team and when you join us the owner you get access to a franchise with a set of 15 players and a club and Fitness training facilities and all of that stuff so as a manager and I don't know the team what do you actually do you take players no uh after every game you find that one player is not doing so well or you know uh one player that's exceptional maybe you give him a hike or you attain them any specific skills you send them back to Academy and you mainly set the match lineups you know this this player goes back first this player goes to bat second and this bowler goes to back first 10 seconds and so on so without further Ado let's jump right into the demo so here we have a website bubble.gg uh let's get started we have a wonderful sign up supported by economy and welcome to power Let's uh give it to my name and you're all set up as you can see on the screen you're seeing individual player nfts which are cricket players so you can see right hand backsman left-hand batsman and different form Fitness and each of these things each of the player has specific set of skills which are unique to them in in terms of Fielding Wicket keeping batting was the scheme back to your suspend balling Main and balling variation and where does this all go into right let's talk about the match as you can see right now there's a match going on between your own team and Bot Army which is yet to back as you can see uh it's just oh that's very sad we just got all out in 12.6 hours so we have built a match engine which simulates the match Ball by ball basis so for every ball there's a batsman and a bowler and there are certain attributes that they have you know in terms of spin in terms of batting and bowling Fitness from age and even pitch So based on the specific attributes of the specific players it will run a probability distribution and it will generate an outcome so that's what you have built here as you can see the game is running live uh let's uh jump back into here so what else can you do in the in the game you know as a manager you can also buy and sell players you can scout for new Talent if you find that you know your players are not good enough you're played in a your place in a league with 10 other teams and you're going to be playing against them of all 10 or so matches and uh your goal is to win the games so you'll be placed in one of the leagues and as the season ends you go up in lakes and you become the champion so let me also just talk about why we are using web3 here right so especially when we build a game like this which is based on probability probabilistic distributions and probabilities which is so Random which can give you random outputs if you put this on a centralized server or if you put this on an algorithm which people cannot see or you know people cannot trust you then they're not going to play it right people play games for fun whether they put their money in it or not it doesn't matter they play for fun and if they become sad that and if they don't touch the game engine they're not going to play the game anymore so other than transparency itself we are also using the out of the box capabilities of nfts where you can sell them trade them or you can do access control and all these sorts of things I think that's your time uh get ready to be bold amazing this is a pretty cool and just a really fun game um all right next up is team Depot please give them a big round of applause hi hi all right everybody looks tired so okay so our team name is Giant and the name of our project is stands for decentralized payment to send and receive crypto basically connecting the accounts using the phone numbers so any receiver and any sender can actually claim and create their phone number as an identity using polygon ID app so we'll straight away jump into the demo so we'll register a new number and we'll do it live so we first connect the metamask wallet which is basically an account address that mapping we'll be creating and storing as a unique identifier all right now can you just go ahead and send the money to any specific phone number that you have all right so basically the whole idea is that this DPN becomes like a passport so in a passport you have visas for various different countries so similarly this particular phone number can have multiple account addresses linked across multiple chains so the resolver actually basically the receiver and receiver phone number would be added over here so when the sender is actually sending the money he doesn't need to remember about the account address anymore you can actually link it directly to any specific phone number you put in the phone number you send the money voila crypto transfer and we have integrated various different apis using covalent and also the push protocol yes so due to some technical glitch we'll just create and connect the wallet again and just send in the I know it is on test net but we will still Reserve our funds so we'll try to transfer probably uh 0.002 okay like the currency that is going to be the Matic token and send no no you can just put in my number okay A plus nine one seven zero three two nine zero seven zero three nine yeah seven zero three two nine zero double two one six right all over the claim and resolving has been done using polygon ID just add the number and just turn now make the account so you can register any new phone number if you want and you quickly do that yeah so we would try to resolve and claim the identity using polygon ID app over here um so we'll receive an OTP from twilio now once the issuer has actually issued the QR code we'll scan this QR code onto the polygon ID app now once this number is claimed congratulations your phone number is registered along with the metamask quality address that was already registered with it okay continue now you can just send from this VPN to any other number why don't you try my number again 7032 90 double two one six and zero just select that net okay it has less amount okay let's actually try to finish the demo once all right so all of this is actually the notification that should be coming from push protocol uh we can actually see him on the dashboard too and all the notifications are on the right over here so uh that's team Depot thank you I know live those are uh not always perfect but we got a really good demo still and uh please please give them a big round of applause all right next up we have our sixth finalist please welcome Persona bod wallet detection this is a cool one hi guys we are from Team we all know that most apps are broken or abandoned because of lack of real users and there are these airdrop campaigns which are immediately claimed by these airdrop hunters and Bots taking away the true value of all these new user acquisition campaigns run by the dapps so we wanted to solve that we built a board detection model to help dads engage with real users so how did we do that the main problem is that bot labels don't exist So based on our literature review we we created a Time Time series anomaly Detector by that what I mean is that think about it humans the average time between 10 transactions of humans is never whole numbers but in the case of bots they repeat transactions at regular intervals say like one minute or one day for the purpose of this hackathon we chose the active users of openc in the month of November this is the frequency plot and from this we generate our generated our bot labels now that we have our bot labels which engineered more features such as average send value average time between efforts and transactions maximum value sent and such features and after performing normalization of the features we ran k-means clustering to get a visual representation of the Bots versus non-bots here you can see that the blue the blue dots are the non-bots and the orange are the birds you can see that clearly in the center the Bots are clustered based on these features to get a better visualization we down sample the non non-bought accounts here you can see the clear separation so if you choose the right features you can clearly identify the Bots now that we have the labels and the features we wanted to perform supervised learning we ran a random Forest classifier and we got like a good score but how do we test the hypothesis how do we predict an accuracy score so this is where we apply transfer learning but that what I mean is that we train the model in numbers data set and predicted on October's data set and then we also generated the labels to get a accuracy metric I know all this might sound like Greek and Latin to a lot of people but basically like we got a good accuracy score we have like a what detection accuracy for like 0.7 and accuracy for non-word direction as 0.8 so this is just a proof of work uh proof of concept for the bot detection we know that both can also change their behavior at the same time even we can come up with new features to understand their behavior and be dot Bots to build more sustainable dabs beating our Bots is the way to go thank you amazing well on the internet nobody knows you're a Bach and it's even more true on on blockchains all right next up is our seventh demo of the day please welcome sir Dave CI there you go hi everyone so we start yeah hi everyone my name is CI so let me start with a quick story here so you can see on the screen that how many of you have used GitHub today like everyone does because even the Dao's the decentralized organizations are also using GitHub to store their content so GitHub has become the the source of Truth for all the projects which we have today but it is not right in in the past we have seen projects like truncate cash and tons of others which can be taken down because of the so much power GitHub had today they can take down the projects and even you know after GitHub taking down their projects when they were live again they're still using GitHub today how how stupid is that that you can use the GitHub uh the platform which revoked you so the solutions like Utopia to it uh which are decentralized GitHub but no one is using it so why are we we're not using Utopia because guitopia is having like or the similar projects are having you know one of the worst user experience because it is not onboarded till the experience the seamless things and the Comfort which GitHub provides us so there's definitely a problem here that we can address so here becomes AI so sadev in it's a Sanskrit in Hindi word which means uh forever so what we are trying to build is basically we are backing up your GitHub repositories onto the file coin and the web3 infrastructure so how does that work is basically right I'll quickly show you up in the image you can see that the GitHub repository with just two steps you can basically run a cicd implementation onto like you can set up a workflow and it will automatically going to backup with every new commit onto the filecon blockchain it is going to index it onto the polygon uh filecon Network and then going to index on the polygon blockchain additionally it is also using sub graph to give you fastest queries of these uh things so like everything what you want so the thing which you are seeing on this place is basically live from the sub graph indexer about different things like you can click on here to see the ipfs and every single thing on the polygon chain transaction as well so how do you set up let's quickly see the setup process here so if this Wi-Fi works so you can see like this is uh deployed on the zip file is on there and I'm going to use the taking time to load people but like there's simple uh where you can let me disconnect from the Wi-Fi actually that is the Wi-Fi causing the issue once one second give me a second yeah cool oh now it should work so yeah here you can see these are just two steps what you have to do first you have to open a GitHub repository let's say this repository which I created five years ago which is not even a web 3 project it's a web 2 project you can still back it up what you have to do is basically go to the settings of this GitHub repository go to the secrets and click on actions here what you have to do you have to create a new repository secret so it's a public good project where you can use just simple uh web3 uh dot storage and copy the access token there and paste it here and go back here paste the copy this paste it here and one step is already done now just the Second Step which is even simpler than this what you have to do click on the GitHub actions and you have to basically set up a workflow and workflow setup is also very simple you just have to copy this thing uh go back here paste it check this thing it's good just make a comment about it like uh work flow let's say and then done now you are already done it is auto the use if you go to the GitHub actions your project GitHub action is already up and running and it's going to uh like take your project to the decentralized infrastructure as a so the source of Truth is transferred to the recent infrastructure and I request all of you people to use this project and do the similar thing right in the circuit then it's live and you can do it on the polygon Mumbai test net um now like let's moving up like taking one more second so GitHub and gitopia are actually like that's why our team is called itus is that on another so we are using both of these and figuring out our path in this so yeah let's let's see if what would happen all right so let's discuss if what if this hackathon was up 48 hours so what could happen so the first thing that it we could have done was on chain identity and reputation for developers basically uh by using lens profile and linking it with web3 social auth GitHub so uh the next is uh two-factor authentication for releases so the release manager uh based on the so based on the smart contract will receive a notification using push protocol and will be able to approve the release and then it can also be used to send the release notification to the their respective open source communities so yeah that's it thank you everyone for listening uh the project is live just try to use it and let me know your feedback on this thanks this is uh this is so cool hopefully we all get to use it for the next hackathons all right next up we have Team chain pay please welcome team chain pay on stage so hey everyone uh we are team champion and I would be telling you what we are really about so giving you an overview quick overview there are about 100 million crypto users and barely one percent of the user actually uh transfers and uses crypto in their daily life transactions so what is chain pay it is basically a self-custodial wallet which lets you transfer crypto payments in a UPI manner the problems that we have faced so if any one of you have used binance you might have used peer-to-peer transaction that is you give someone money and you know that it's really timeful and you need uh 20 to 30 minutes for that to progress so giving you some numbers there are seven percent of the world population that uses crypto one person barely uses it for normal transactions um and 20 minutes is the average time that one takes um for p to P the solution that we are giving we are removing P2P we are directly giving cryptocurrency into INR um one benefit is you can actually buy tea from this app you can literally use any QR code scanner and you can buy from it the second benefit is we are actually liquidating crypto that is the biggest part of it crypto is no longer looked as an asset and it is more sort of a liquid currency that one can use like a fiat currency and the third thing on a long-term perspective is like we are actually encouraging businesses to accept crypto as well so that the more liquidity aspect comes into play now why should I be using chain pay it's basically because like over a period of time when the ecosystem becomes it has zero gas fee if you're accepting it um in crypto um so this is our target market um we are planning on expanding it in a few months but now I would like to give an app demo of our app so this is our app um I would like to go um we would be using web3 authentication because most of the people that we are targeting don't even know what metamask is so we are using social login where people can easily log in with the Google accounts and they have an address generated towards it so I would be showing that and by the way it's built in react native so it has support for both IOS as well as Android both of them can use it I would be choosing one of the Google IDs and I would like to nominate anyone from the crowd who can come and show me the QR code for a UPI and I would like to perform a live transaction to them is anyone willing to do so yeah please foreign we would be playing this presentation on fuse mainnet and the internet is giving some issues just a minute yeah so you can see the wallet right now it's a 4.22 fuse right now it is the native currency um I would be performing a transaction awesome yeah we're giving him his back his phone and um the back end is running on stack OS that was a partner in this ethereum hackathon and we are also implemented push uh for basically notifying any user that your transaction has successfully completed so give it a few time and the payment has been done from our end he would be receiving it soon the wallet difference is there so now and yeah so yeah and it's really quick like you don't need to wait for 20 minutes like you can just have it so we'll show you the Push Messaging one minute so this is the push Network where you get notified that your transaction has been through everything about the app is completely decentralized and that is nothing Central to us so this is from our side it is super fast and we are planning on it being the next revolution in terms of payments where everything is going on crypto smoothly across the world so thank you wow that was absolutely incredible and uh this gets to be a real life application for all of us all right welcome team ethguard as our ninth finalist for the weekend let's give them a big round of applause hello everyone I'm himanshu and these are my colleagues Stanley and ajinkya we all work at this startup called very nice where we do auditing and develop fall method tools for auditing and here we are presenting a tool called eat card which is a responsive mlbased smart contract vulnerability detection for vs code so uh just to lay the background for this why do we need this tool we see uh hacks everywhere in D5 in specific like so D5 is where we have so much money logged in just last year there were 2.1 billion dollars lost due to such hacks and these hacks are a lot of the times preventable and uh for that it's recommended to go for audits but audits have their limitations as well audits takes time and uh tools are trying to bring that to speed but it's still a slow process usually and people want to get on chain as quickly as possible due to all the competition that's there in the market so what we have the idea that we have is we should try to find bugs as much as possible during development itself and that's why what we have what we build here is a vs code extension to detect smart contract bugs so we all are developing uh our smart contracts in vs code usually or maybe something else but yeah vs code is also nice so we are we have developed the plugin for vs code right now and what we do here is we uh at the uh so during the development phase itself you can find these vulnerabilities that we find using eighth card using machine learning like we have trained our models and uh those models are the uh producing an output telling you if this this vulnerability might be there in your code and the vulnerabilities that we detect are re-entrancy Access Control bugs front running attacks unchecked low level calls so this is what we did in this hackathon but it the list goes can go on as we get more data and as we like get more time and why do we use a machine learning technique in specific is because form we could have used some static analyzer as well at the back end or a fuzzer but usually what happens is these tools take a lot of time to uh to run like to produce outputs to tell you if the if the vulnerability exists and that's why we are using machine learning here now I would ask ajinkya to present a demo for the tool yeah so what do we what we have here is basically a vs code plugin that you just install in your system and uh whenever you in current form whenever you have a save action for the vs code plugin it fires up the machine learning model and if it's uh if it's if it finds any bug it reports those bugs back to the user so we just begin the vs code plugin we get a new vs code window which has the new extension installed and here we have already chosen three buggy programs and I would just initiate a save action on those so uh I request your attention at the bottom right of the screen where it says analyzing code review code upon save and it starts running the machine learning model uh in some time we get back the results and whether they are vulnerable or not one of the future ideas that we are planning to do with this is uh try to get the attention numbers from machine learning model to locate the line and the data path on the model that in the code that causes the entrancy or the bug to be triggered okay so the model has been fired and we're waiting for results I am not sure let me try that again okay uh something seems to be broken yeah I guess that's my time thank you I personally get always excited about a lot of devtools and this was a pretty meta demo we were debugging the debugging tool but we got to see it nevertheless all right three more demos to go so please welcome finalist number 10 chart swap hello everyone I hope you're doing very well uh let's get straight on the problem statement at first so by the Niti ayog of India the government of India aims to achieve 30 percent of vehicles on road should be electric by 2030. now there's a significant challenge to this especially in a country like India regarding the infrastructure of charging stations another problem is the low range and the problem with batteries so there's the first conventional ways to use charging stations another proposed solution is to have stations where you can swap your discharge battery with charged batteries on the station well there's again problems with this solution number one how do you uh keep a price on the usage of the battery number two uh how do you attribute the source of the battery which it was made from why you can call it ecosystem truly renewable only if the source the battery was made from is also renewable right so here here's what we present presenting chart swap uh we we aim to put every charging station onto the blockchain using with the help of an iot enabled device so the idea is that every station will be on the Chain what it helps us with is that number one the data is going to be immutable and number two you can easily attribute where the source came from and number three things like how the uh like how the battery was used who used it Etc how the health is will not like you can attribute all of that and no one can actually affect the prices of the usage right so we'll quickly get in the demo right now let's quickly get started and log into the application we'll use metamask right now we've used a economy to integrate that so this is the dashboard which the user gets after the dashboard the user gets access to seeing the stations the nearby stations that he can go to so if we quickly go to the stations you quickly see stations that are nearby and then you can search for stations that you would like to go to either it also indicates how far it is and if batteries are available or not then you when you reach the station here's where the fun part comes out you see the how much uh how much you have to pay because we already know which battery is owned by the user okay okay so there's a so I'm not sure if you guys can see but I have quite a bit of electrons in my hand okay so there's actually a display over here it shows you the details about the iot first thing I do is I take an RFID key I scant on the RFID scanner it shows like a yeah I mean it's currently on the screen it says loading it's fetching data from the smart contract in a few seconds you can see all of the details of the smart contacts I've seen such as a battery ID who owns the user and if it's in use so with the help of all of this so when the user scans this information uh check is run a check is sent to the smart contact saying users present at this station let him transact with the let him transact to the station and let him get new batteries so we click on the pay now button yes we can then we click on the and click on confirm so this transaction has been sent to the blockchain in a few seconds uh I mean in a few seconds the block will be verified so once again when I that I mean take the ID and then tap it on you can see uh you'll see that the RFID is now deallocated and a new ID and uh the user will now have a new ID so I know you're not able to see it clearly but yes yeah so that's about it we can also we also have like notification support using push protocol so whenever a new station is added you can subscribe to the channel and they can also see uh whether or not I mean the stations are added so we also use ipfs for storing the metadata of the battery and we have deployed the contract on polygon thank you so much awesome all right two more demos to go next up and our second last finalist of the day team Safeguard please welcome team Safeguard on stage hello hello everyone we are team Safeguard and we build customizable on-chain Financial controllers for your nurses safes so we actually let less time and a lot of transactions to go through so I'll explain you on the way what we are doing so we have a safe over here and I'll copy the safe address and we want to install an allow list card on it and we have a list of whitelist addresses that we want to use and continue so what are transaction cards transaction guards are like a final check before the execution of a safe execution transaction and if they say uh if the guard reverts the safe execution rewards as well uh so these final checks help you improve the account security of your saves so what's happening right now is I'm using an allow list card an allow list guard allows you to whitelist certain addresses so that the transactions can only be sent to those addresses this is very beneficial for cases like a Grant's Dow where they want the transactions to be only sent to the grantees and nobody else accidentally so what has happened now is that the guard redress has been deployed onto the blockchain and I'm now signing a message so that I can set up the guard on my safe so this safe has three people and at least two signers are necessary to do any transaction I see that the safe has been created and I received and there is a queue and this said guard requires a confirmation I cannot confirm because I was the one who proposed the transaction so I'll change my account and now I can confirm the transaction and I have submitted the transaction I'll need to confirm the execution in my wallet here it is and confirmed so now what has happened is I have deployed a guard address the guard is the allow list guard and I've set it up on my save now if you do it the normal way you need to know how to code the custom logic of the smart contract deploy it and then set it up yourself but we have made it into a seamless manner so that you can do it in just one click and all the signers just have to do their sign signs and it's indexing over here so the uh it's already accepted by the blockchain okay so it's history so now we have already set the guard if you can go to the settings we see that in the modules page we have now installed a transaction guard so using this transaction guard let us try to send a message in transaction to this address which I had not quite listed before I'll use the girl lead and let's say I want to send 0.001 and submit I signed the message on my end and it seems to go through now you might wonder why even though this address was not whitelisted I was still able to submit this transaction this is because the guard only kicks off when the last person needs to execute the transaction and only one sign has been done as of now foreign account address back to the first one who is the other signer and check the queue [Music] and however it is if I try to confirm now it says now it says that the transaction is most likely to fail if we try to simulate it on tenderly it says that the transaction failed because I'm not sending the transaction to an allowed address that means the guard worked exactly like it had to and if even if I try to submit the transaction will just reward we have a lot of other guards like a denialist guard which allows you to Blacklist certain addresses a gas volatility guard that allows that helps you not to overpay during transactions because uh until all the signers say the gas price must shoot up and but with this guard you'll never overpay for your transactions and a timeline guard where you can uh set a validity period for a safe and after the validity period ends the person who has been unlocked the safe will not be able to use it anymore these are just the simple cards that we have started now and we have plans to launch many more thank you all right are you all ready for our final demo of the weekend no are you all excited for the last demo of the weekend there we go please welcome Trickle hi everyone my name is Roshan Sharma and I have my co-founder shalu with me how many of devs haven't slept tonight nice so it's very difficult to engage you guys but what if I said that hey I have two hundred thousand dollars which I am throwing a party tonight and whoever wants to come for one hour how many of you would for that hypothetical situation would come to that party nice couple of them others are not interested in money but uh one of the core problems as content creators so we both are content creators and one of the core problems which we face is low engagement so we built a mobile first platform that rewards you for engagement content creators can build communities they can create chart chat rooms they can create exclusive communities as well they can get tips all those kind of things and now whenever the user interacts with their content they get rewarded the users get rewarded the trick over here is we are unlike any Dash to earn kind of games or kind of any platform we are sustainable engage and earn platform which works on a giveaway model now shallow is showing you how the platform works we are mobile first so bear with us with a small screen now you can tip the content creator uh unless the transaction goes through so you have to speed it up but just go to the second tab yeah so we have created a Tinder like or in shorts like interface where you can swipe left and right check different articles check different posts so that you are always engaged your audience is always engaged your profile is looking quite good on the right hand side of the screen and now you can see all the people who have who have participated on your profile you can see the active pool and how this works is how this reward works is there are three ways one uh as a content creator you can fund your own reward a couple of folks will join second if you are sandeepan and uh people follow you you can join their exclusive Community pay for them to join a portion of that goes back to the community and third you can get a sponsor let's say uh deaf folio and I am a good Creator and defolio wants to sponsor my content they want me to talk about their content so they can fund my reward pool a portion will go to me and the rest of this will go to the end user as well who is Dev folio's most genuine user as well so you are not only paying the influencer you are also paying the end user now all these are the different transactions which are happening on the platform and uh yeah so we have built this platform in two days uh so bear with us in uh terms of how it looks so this is all these profiles all the content pieces which you upload goes to the ipfs or decentralized storage networks we have deployed on polygon ethereum and shardium in this time and since we do not require any native token to work we are platform agnostic we can work with any platform any blockchain and we will be integrating more uh we are also integrating with lens protocol uh and yeah so this is the portfolio and just show this leaderboard yeah so every time people engage on the platform they are added to the part of leaderboard and whoever performs the most highest they get rewarded so yeah that's our platform also uh if you want to check it out you can drop a tag us on devfolio's Discord or eth India's Discord thank you amazing all right now you're gonna have to wait for me to connect my laptop and we hope no practical difficulties come up on this one all right let's switch to uh my screen foreign the only demo with the broken Aviation would be mine all right let's see if uh it shows up in the next few seconds well good thing I have two backup HDMI cables let's try that foreign one more time can we see if uh this laptop is receiving the signal or the other way around I think this is quite funny because once you see what the slide is I feel like the the build up will not be may not be worth it but now we're just all waiting okay I'll just all right well I want to thank all 12 of our amazing finalists for coming on stage and demoing 12 incredible projects we're going to talk about all the prizes soon but for the next 10 minutes I want to give the stage to Denver who is the CEO of that folio you've seen him running around making sure everything is on track and he's probably way more tired than all of you combined but they have a lot of amazing things to want to talk about so please give Denver a big round of applause nothing like GM GM GM how's it going back lord GMS we manage we managed is one last uh one last demo before can we do it again GM MGM how's it going back lord yeah I could clearly feel the tiredness but I hope you all have had fun in this hackathon last few days have been hectic um tiredness I know a lot of folks haven't slept yeah I haven't slept in the last few weeks but seeing such great projects being built makes up all for it Maria how do you feel Denver I feel great yeah like all the sleep and like like nothing matters uh like it's all worth it to see like all the hard work that all of you have put in we have had over 450 projects uh submitted and then it's like it's truly an honor uh to be able to bring bring ethania to you all right uh but this isn't it uh like we at defolio believe that ethereum is the infinite garden and ethereum like eth India is really like part of a much larger movement uh than the hackathon that you're attending uh over the years like we have worked really hard in building a community of ethereum aligned individuals from India and uh who are building for a decentralized future and this is where defolio steps in defolio is a community of over 250 000 incredible Builders like you leveraging proof of work to get access to opportunities that build for the future while today defolio deploys hackathons fellowships and grants to support these initiatives this isn't how it always was it all began at in out 2015. yeah long time back I think we both weren't there back then but these folks really really wear the stepstones of what defolio is today so big kudos to all of them some of them are already here some of us some of them are not with us but their memories always stay with us um so yeah so what began as a hackathon to test out how far we could go the folio today is a community of incredible Builders like you I think over 250k Builders who use that platform to get access to Opportunities and if you think about it all the actions that someone takes on the platform be it attending a hackathon winning hackathon getting into a fellowship getting a grant becomes your proof of work and that's what defolio is empowering therefore is kind of becoming an alternate credentialing platform completely based on your proof of work we have been building a lot of interesting things in the past few months few quarters and we have been really excited to show what we have been building some very interesting things that I have been personally excited about including implementing quadratic funding as a feature on the platform which probably I think one of the coolest things which came out of crypto is coming to the folio platform all ethereum hackathons going forward would also have quadratic funding enabled by default we are building a very interesting feature which we are calling tier project where the intention is to help builders make more money by helping other builders cheer them so for example if I like Denver's project I could cheer him with some heat and in return I could get some Seekers right so all of that becomes my credential and Denver gets some money to sustain himself yeah and a very interesting thing which we are doing is revamping our new profile which would probably look something like this but yeah these are the lot of interesting things that we have been building over to Denver to share more things about initiatives right and as as you as we built this proof of work like defolio is also the platform where you get access to build your proof of work through all of these initiatives that we have you get to participate in the best hackathons we have a community hackathon program that's massively popular we have hosted over 500 plus hackathons we have a definitely official hackathons other than uh eth India we have in-out and women uh something that we are really passionate about on defolio we also have like you can also get paid to learn we have hosted uh seven of these fellowships so far and we have an announcement coming up in five minutes or sooner we you can also get Equity free grants uh on uh defolio uh if you're building out of India and you need uh any money to like just support you through your process after the hackathon ends you can apply for an equity free grant up to five thousand dollars uh through ethenia grants and yeah this is uh yeah I guess this was in five minutes but yeah this is the announcement uh and like the next the next uh eth India Fellowship is open uh applications are open for it and we're really glad to be able to get Builders give Builders the opportunity to take off the worry about like where do they get internships and stuff like that uh and just give them the opportunity to purely focus on building so unlike unlike any other of the any other courses uh that you would see out there you actually get paid to learn and you get paired up with the best mentors out there and they give you all the support you need we are also very glad to announce our newest hackathon the next in the eth India online hackathon series uh this will be the eat for all hackathon taking place from uh Jan 20th to uh 5th February and on that note uh we're very glad to be partnering up with the government of Telangana will be providing their support uh and they are building a bunch of cool stuff including a Sandbox which is and which will for the first time let you work with the decision makers to be able to actually Implement all your Solutions uh with with the folks who can make it happen so very glad uh to be able to bring that and I have a short video uh that will be we'll be playing and it's a message from uh jayesh ranjan he's the principal secretary it and industries uh Telangana government foreign Industries in the Telangana government I wish all the delegates and participants all the very best from our side that is from government of Telangana side we have a very major announcement to make which is that we are starting a regulatory sandbox focused on web 3.0 many of you have expressed in the past also I have made some of the leading the three players in Hyderabad and many of them have expressed that the regulatory ambiguity which prevails in our country actually prevents them from bringing out more Creative Solutions developing new products in fact many of you would be aware that some of the best talent actually is moving to Dubai Singapore Etc and under the guidance of our Minister for it Mr Katie Ramada we felt that we should arrest this as a state government there are certain things which he can do and one of it is to ensure the creation of a regulatory sandbox identify a number of loose cases bring all the government agencies together and start cohorts on different aspects of for web 3 application so I'm very happy to make this announcement today and the other good news to share with you is that some of the national regulatory bodies also have chosen to join hands with this regulatory sandbox so this also gives an extra level of assurance to startups to domain experts that this regulatory sandbox experience of Hyderabad hopefully can open many more doors for them at the national level even Beyond so look forward to Industries participation support large number of startups participating in this sandbox activity and hope to see all of you in Hyderabad in February we are doing a big event in algebra called eat for all the focus on public goods so I invite all the delegates all the participants all the speakers to come to rajabad as well in February and by that time we would have made the reasonably good progress on the sandbox as well so we'll be happy to share all the updates with you thank you very much [Music] all right I'd also like to invite on stage the director of emerging Technologies uh with Rama Devi Lanka from the government of Telangana [Music] thank you so much a very good evening to all of you well those 12 solutions that were demonstrated were just fantastic and on behalf of the government of Telangana uh I'm saying this here that we will evaluate a couple of them to see if we can Implement especially the EV battery swap you know solution and others other solution also will actually evaluate and see if we can you know Implement for our use cases within the government while you have just heard of principal secretary you know announcing the sandbox thank you announcing the setting up of the sandbox in Telangana so I would just like to briefly say a few words about the state most of you may not know that the government of Telangana I mean it's a first state or the younger State set up eight years back and we have had the opportunity to formulate Innovative Frameworks policies especially in the area of emerging Technologies our first day to set up a separate way you know which is called emerging technology swing that focuses on new age or Frontier Technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain drones Robotics and so on and of all these Technologies blockchain is the closest to a heart because we started working on this way back in 2018 you know when we launched the international blockchain Congress event in Hyderabad since then we have implemented a number of use cases within the government to solve problems at scale you know uh so to share a few projects that we have implemented these are these range in domains such as microfinance supply chain supply chain within the government you know there is lot of potential like because direct benefit transfers we actually transfer cash to various you know millions of people across state food grains traceability of seeds there's huge potential in the supply chain area and the third one is to enhance citizen convenience and we did an exciting solute project you know a solution uh to make voting easier I know all of you are young here I don't think any one of you would like to go to a physical both and an old right old I mean general election sorting so we have developed an app using the web3 Technologies artificial intelligence to authenticate an individual you know whether if you are the right person or the eligible voter voting secondly DLT technology you know to secure your words so most of uh you know the politicians are saying that how can you ensure that the old cars by an individual is secure you know so at the back end we are using blockchain technology to secure those there's a fantastic applications that we have developed and we are really proud which even the Bihar government wanted to implement it there are a range of applications that we have implemented in blockchain now is the time to move to web3 so that's why I mean we are exploring new use cases for the government and as part of the ecosystem development you have heard a principal security announcing the setting up with the land sandbox regulatory sandbox so any startup innovator any organization if you have a solution or you know a project that involves Regulators it could be uh RBI or CB or even a health regulator you know so if you submit your solution in the sandbox we will evaluate and bring on board the associated Regulators that's one thing secondly we'll also onboard customers for your product say if it's a fintech solution and your customer is a bank we will get the banks on board to test your product to validate Your solution and also provide the data that is required for your solution so this is what we at the end if any regulatory changes are required our governing Council will recommend these changes to The Regulators it could be RBI it could be say be any of The Regulators in India because as a government we can actually you know do that so I invite all the startups innovators to make use of the sandbox the website is web3 sandbox dot Telangana at the rate gov.in it's actually available on our website and we've also created a Discord Channel wepri sandbox Telangana weapery sandbox please share your you know if you have any concerns on regulatory front or any issues I know most of the startups are facing that's exactly the reason why we have set up the sandbox but we haven't had a chance you know to actually uh discuss with you or uh you know get your views in person so kindly you know use this Discord channel to share your concerns issues around the regulatory framework we'll try to at least you know attempt to resolve them well thank you once again for giving this opportunity especially uh eat Global and defolio uh for uh you know uh helping actually we thought of enhancing it in Hyderabad but we realized that the entire you know Talent is here the blockchain community web3 community so we thought that is actually a non-city in Bangalore and then you know probably in the month of February when we are actually going to organize uh eat for all the theme is public good probably then we would have made some progress on the sandbox and we'll further discuss when you are there so welcome you all once again to Hyderabad in the month of February thank you and this is the post you know where you you well the QR code is there for you to register and access the application so yeah thank you all and all the best you know for your effort that you have put in these past four days and congratulations to all the winners thank you amazing well it's not every day where you get to actually involve people who can make a change at a national level so uh we're looking forward to uh making sure more and more organizations can be positively additive to this entire ecosystem and we want to make sure web3 in India wins all right looks like the AV issue is still there but the good news is that if I'm on stage we will be about we'll be wrapping up in about 15 minutes so the only thing we have to do is now the prizes so now the anticipation is actually totally warranted don't no no no no there we go okay no no we leaked the prizes at least it works okay 350 000 in prizes two we won there is a lot of prizes and a lot of winners and I'm gonna go as fast as possible so what I would recommend is You all take

of you are super tired including myself but before we do that I want to bring on a special guest here to talk about what comes next this is almost the entire web3 ecosystem here in this building and we want to make sure that we can figure out how do we help support everybody who wants to bring this uh bring your projects to the next step and to kind of talk about that and how do we sort of continue building the weapon ecosystem in India actually well I missed a disclaimer big disclaimer I I jumped the gun okay quick quick announcements everything that we just announced is tentative and not final which means that we are going to be verifying everybody's Source codes and if we detect that somebody has cheated or worked on something before Friday the prizes will be removed and adjusted so anything that you see now is assume 90 final and not 100 final we'll be notifying you over email once everything is final so the values might change especially if you want a pool prize so keep an eye out for that and all the prices will be distributed on December 23rd if we get this message on Discord tomorrow or today we'll say the exact same thing and if we say that every time please make sure that we have 500 projects to reply to so it's going to take some time and the next two weeks is when all the logistics happen for the price delivery so please be patient and now I'd like to call in Juan Benet from protocol labs to talk about how do we help take these projects further welcome all right everyone uh great to see you congratulations to all of you this has been an amazing set of days you have learned an enormous amount you have invented you have designed you have built you have deployed you have tested you have demoed you have presented you are well on your way to building amazing products in these small hours you have taken a huge step towards building the future now where to go from here you should consider creating a web 3 startup let's first talk about why India you have an enormous amount of advantages as people in the India Community you are brilliant and hardworking you're super well connected online and in human Networks you're deeply technical you're deeply product oriented you're the largest country lots of you have lots of people lots of Builders and you have huge markets you have lower cost of living products and services which gives you a huge advantage over the rest of the world you have a huge economy and it's growing super fast and you have lots of new people joining the internet you have a tremendously rich and diverse culture with deep roots worldwide and of course you have an amazing stable growing country that is welcoming of the web free community and is creating all these new regulatory sandboxes for you so this is a phenomenal place to get to get going now I want to call out the few logos here on the bottom if I could get the team members of huddle push Lighthouse coin shift parcel incident to stand up for a moment uh yeah some of them are standing up great so if you're interested in building a web 3 startup look through These Guys these are your advisors you can ask them how to get going how to how to build uh projects you can get their feedback you can ask them to help you navigate this environment they got started right here with an East Global hackathon they were in your shoes and they built uh the future they're now pretty fast growing startups so now this is the the startup Journey it takes a few different stages you're already well on your way you're in stage two experimenting with lots of ideas hackathons are the best place to get started with this because it gives you this environment tune for learning this environment tuned for exploration where you can create new ideas test them iterate get feedback design things and so on and it gives you the most important thing which is a deadline and it gives you a deadline to present your you to finish your project it gives you a deadline to present your product product and it gives you a direct feedback loop from a lot of other people giving you the early stages Source validation so keep doing this keep experimenting and iterating keep hacking it at these Global hackathons and through that you'll find a strong idea and a strong solid pitch and a strong solid product from there you can get to the second stage I want to talk a little bit about the next stage because many of you have already aspirations of turning your projects and your products into startups when you go into validation the most important part is that you get in signals and feedback from the world as to whether or not they want to use your product that is not just an idea that's cool but it's something that people want this is the validation comes in different forms for many different kinds of projects if it's say a consumer application or some product like that you can just launch it and try to get users and see what they say and give you feedback if it's a larger scale thing like a protocol that's going to take longer to build you can put it on GitHub you can write about it you can get other contributors and get going that's how I started ipfs and palcoin that's how ethereum got started now the most important part of this stage is that you keep going and keep building and keep growing the thing and get get towards traction from there you can once you have enough uh interest and enough uh evidence that the thing you're building could be a great startup you're ready to get hit the next stage which is getting into accelerators now the acceleration part is doesn't necessarily need a program though there are really great accelerator programs that you can leverage these programs tend to give you initial capital and initial funding to get started as a startup they can help you with product Market fit with how to hire teammates how to how to find and connect with investors and can help you in the in the early stages of the startup Journey these accelerators tend to be extremely great learning environments but they're also super competitive so what you want to do is you want to apply early and often when you apply even if you get rejected you can get a lot of feedback from them and that gives you usually a signal and a vector that you can keep iterating on and then you you know you can apply again so those are the three stages that you should focus on right now keep experimenting with ideas keep hacking sometimes it'll take five ten hackathons until you find like your project uh to get going once you have something that you really want to stick with something you feel really passionate about something that you think has legs get to validating it and from there get to that acceleration stage good luck India You're Building
