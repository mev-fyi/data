foreign [Music] good morning everybody go ahead good morning hi well good morning everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to pragma this is a conference our goal with this event is a lot of things so we're going to talk about today this organ this event is organized by youth Global a lot of you are here in town from a lot of different parts of the world and a lot of you are here from Toronto and Waterloo and for those of you who are joining us for the first time I want to give a brief introduction to what Heath Global is 8th Global's mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the wet 3 ecosystem and we do this by doing hackathons and Summits that's what today and the next three days are about we're gonna take over Waterloo and have a thousand people learn about what's happening in wet 3. now today I want to focus more on pragma what this Summit is and the next three days are going to be for the hackathon which a lot of you are also coming by if you're an ethereum developer you already know the reference and the significance of the word pragma every smart contract starts with the word pragma it's not just the beginnings of a builder's Journey for us this event is about pragmatism our goal is to talk about what's happening in this space really distill the things that people should be looking into should be excited about and then reflecting on how things have gone so far to get more people a real sense of understanding the real things happening in what three and through that we want to bring in a lot more people and open up what's happening here to an even wider audience and talk about how everybody else can also partake in in this ecosystem and as a result today is going to be set up differently than any other conference you've been into what we're going to do is focus on very key things today is going to be a one day single Track event which means we're not confusing with multiple things happening at the same time all of us are going to be in this room we're all going to watch the same things and nothing else takes up your attention our focus is going to be very much on the feature it's going to be less talks and presentations more about seeing what's actually happening and talking about where things are going and we're going to keep things on technical you may see some references to specific topics but you don't need to be a developer to be in this room and we don't want you to be a developer to be in this room our goal is to have you still understand what's happening at a very high level and still make sure that if you are interested in something else you can use the next three days or your own time learn and deep dive deep into all the things that you're interested in so the way today is set up is as follows there's going to be seven interviews and four product announcements seven people are going to come on and tell you of what they're working on we're going to do a lot of interviews with what they have accomplished what they're looking forward to what they are excited about what they're not excited about and the four announcements are going to be around four different products that are launching today you're going to see some of the amazing projects from our ecosystem tell you about what the next step is in terms of their milestones for their products and some things that you'll get an early preview for that you can check out as as you're part of this room now I want to take a pause here and and reflect on the significance of us doing an event in Waterloo Waterloo and youth Global have a long history together almost six years ago we hosted the very first hackathon in this space called eat Waterloo this is in this exact building where I'm standing right now I think I'm still standing in the same spot and that took the World by storm that was the initial moment that started and kicked off what eth Global is now from one hackathon to where we are getting 100 000 people in this space and we are super excited to come back here we most of our team went to the Waterloo University of Waterloo we've been here we've been in this town for a long time we're all Canadians and we want to make sure that this is a moment that we also recognize and tell you all about where things started including the early beginnings of ethereum which we'll also get into and one of the most notable thing is with the very first sakathon we did one project specifically stood out you may know this as cryptokitties and if you didn't know that this came out of each Waterloo you may know and probably have by now heard of the erc721 nft standard all those were the early Beginnings about six years ago that sort of propagator across the world and when we're coming back here after all this time uh we wanted to do something special to remember and memorialize how things officially began so everybody who signed up here you were all told to verify your wallet because you were totally getting an nft and it's with amazing excitement and pleasure I'm excited to announce that we have purchased a crypto Kitty for everybody here and it's now in all of your wallets I don't know I don't know why it took us this long to do this but I'm glad we did and the wallet you verified you finally get to own your very first cryptic Kitty and officially the first ever 721 nft that was out there all right enough of the intro let's go into what the next few hours are all about so today I'm gonna just do a brief overview of the schedule and we're going to kick us off with our very first talk of the day first there's 300 people here from 37 different countries it's already incredible to see so many people here coming in
