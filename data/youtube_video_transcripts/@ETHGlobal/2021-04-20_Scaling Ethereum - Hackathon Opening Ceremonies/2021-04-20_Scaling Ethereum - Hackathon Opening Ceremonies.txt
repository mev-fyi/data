hey everybody good morning good afternoon good evening um my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eath global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to scaling ethereum uh we're getting all of you kind of rolling in i see already a few hundred people joining us on on the live stream so i'm super glad to be welcoming all of you again see a lot of familiar faces a lot of new faces and uh can't wait to kick off this hackathon so um all of you are joining us on eatglobal.tv that is our live setup that lets you experience this whole event with us in a really shared state so uh just as a heads up for all of you who are looking at this thing for the first time we'll be using this platform for the entirety of this hackathon and for today which means that you'll be able to watch the stream on on the left side here in the window and for any of the questions you have for our panelists for our talks or us you can ask them here on the the chat and we'll be able to relate these questions directly to the speakers onto the live stream also as a note i really encourage all of you to sign up or log in to the chat because we will be giving out poep nft tokens for all the people who participated during this summit today so um if you haven't already logged in try sign up and say hi to us in the chat so with that said um this event i want to talk to you a little bit about youth global so scaling ethereum is brought to you by 8th global and 8th global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to make it easy for thousands of developers to come on into the web3 ecosystem and really shape the future that we're heading into and we do that by hosting summits and hackathons uh scaling ethereum is exactly that this is a three week long hackathon and we also have a handful of summits as part of this uh month and i'll be kind of walking through what's happening uh starting with the summits so we have three summits uh each of them will happen on friday today is our first summit which is a scaling summit and you learn all the things about different scaling techniques to different scaling protocols and and how they work and all the details of anywhere from their internals to where they are to just what makes them possible and we'll be covering all of that as a high level overview right after uh this kickoff for the hackathon then next friday we'll have our merch summit we'll be talking about what is happening with the 2 merch uh and you kind of get to hear all the things about what we're doing to scale the layer one side of ethereum and then two weeks from now which is friday the 30th we'll be doing our zero knowledge summit and we'll be kind of talking to a lot of interesting speakers about what is happening in the world as your knowledge um especially as it relates to scalability programmability and overall the things that are just not possible without some of these new primitives so all that said there's a lot on the summit side that we'll be sharing on our website and with that i want to get off and talk to you about the hackathon so this is a massive event for for us there's over 425 hackers that are participating just for the next few weeks on the hackathon side and just alone for the summits we already have 400 people attending or not the hackers but directly watching just the talks uh the hackers themselves all the participants are coming in from over 56 different countries spanning 18 different time zones so we're gonna have a lot of fun over the next three to four weeks and i can't wait to see the hundreds of different types of projects we get to see that tackle scaling this is just a simple map of where all the developers and participants are coming in from we have a really really diverse set of audience and it's just going to be super fun in addition to all of that we also have a 100 plus mentors who are here to help you with your projects especially if you have any questions related to scaling technologies that are out there and they are uh coming in from over 20 different companies who'll be there to help you really get to the project and and really ship something super cool and fun and on top of all of that um we tallied up the numbers and this is the first event where we've broken our own records uh we're giving away over two hundred thousand dollars in prizes for this event and uh it's gonna be super fun to see all the amazing things that you built with different protocols to different solutions out there and just challenging yourself to try new things i want to especially thank some of our amazing sponsors here so i want to thank arbitrarium optimism zk sinks darkware scale loopering the graph seller connects polygon raiden zk swap taurus compound grants program protocol labs the unit swap grants program ave super fluid chain link new cypher covalent zapper one inch teller secret network the ethereum foundation ipfs main dp near protocol diversify uh rare build let me cap and ens for being with us for this event there are a lot of amazing scaling solutions there's a lot of cool d5 products that work on layer two and a lot of our our supporters from the community that are helping us out with this event and uh i'm super excited for all of us to join and just put our forces and heads together to really make something cool for the next month so this event is called scaling ethereum and a lot of what we talked about publicly has been really carefully shaped around what it means to do something related to scaling and the most common question we got for this event was uh what can i build if i don't know how to do things on on there too um so when i quickly highlight the intent from our site and sort of what this means for all of you who are listening in uh the key thing to take away is that we don't want you to necessarily come in with all the context you have you need to have to do anything on layer 2. this event is designed specifically for us to see what it's going to take for the whole ecosystem to make the transition to layer two a lot easier and and as a result we have support from a lot of existing d5 protocols and a lot of existing layer two solutions to help make it possible for everybody to see what we need to do to get everything done as smooth as possible and as a result if you're not sure how something works this is the type of event where you get to ask the lyric solutions that you might be interested in using to understand how you can actually deploy something that you already have on mainnet onto layer2 and that means you can try to port existing things you've done in the past from in the d5 world or if you were a participant in the last nft hackathon and see if you can deploy the same things on a layer 2 system and really make it easy for everybody to use your your application without any gas or additional costs you also have now the ability to really work on brand new applications whether they're in d5 or just any other category to deploy directly on layer 2 and really start and pave the way for a brand new ecosystem to emerge on the layer 2 side there are a lot of developer tools that we need to make it easy to have others also try out and bring l2 to mainstream and on top of all of that you don't have to necessarily only have to do a programming related project you can also use this time to make it easy for others to learn how to do something on l2 and that means you can work on documentation you can work on guides you can work on anything you can to make it easy for everybody else out there to really explore how they can move everything to a more scalable solution so that gives you a little bit but a little bit more context and i have a few more things that i want to share on that and we'll go through that in just a few minutes so we have the summit today and we have the hackathon kicking off so i want to give a quick overview of how the hackathon is going to work for the next three weeks for those of you who participated in nft hack you probably saw our weekend version of a hackathon and we're kind of going back to a month-long series where we give enough time to really understand and really make sure that you are getting the help you need to submit and work on your projects so i'll be walking through what it means from the team formation side how you can get help why you can think about new ideas all the prizes you can win uh how the talks and workshops are going to be set up how judging submission is going to work for this one and then lastly the the summits and how you can expect to be a lot more engaged with our summit related talks so for all of the the purchase events of the hackathon the key thing to notice here is that everything is happening on discord which means that if you have staked on your dashboard and you've connected your discord you will see what's on the left side here on the screen shot which means there's a scaling ethereum category and there are more than one channel that show up and that means you've successfully gained access to all of the the event specific channels and if you're not seeing any of these uh channels please message anybody on the global team on discord but this is where everything is going to happen this has channels for all of us to talk with each other this has the channels for you to ask any of the protocols questions specific to those protocols so you can see on the bottom of that screenshot if you have a question about a really specific company or a protocol you can message them there and they'll be there to help you you can have uh all the things from just generic help you can need on the developer side with a solidity or front-end or back-end all these things are all going to happen through discord and that's where all of our mentors are also going to be uh on top of all of that uh we've also sent a calendar invite for all the key talks and workshops that are happening over the next few weeks and the entire schedule for everything that's happening whether it's the hackathon or the summit is already on the website we want this thing to be as asynchronous as possible so if you are in a position where you can add you can attend something because of a time zone or a conflict we want this thing to be as easy as possible for you to catch up on so all of that is available on scaling.educable.com and you can check everything there from all details and it'll be updated live every time we do something so with that let's go into how the hackathon is structured essentially you can start working on a project now in terms of the rules and the characters for this event everything that were you're going to submit must begin during the course of the hackathon and you can start coding as of today uh you can have up to five members on your team if you would like to work on a team and you have three weeks from now to submit so that is three weeks and the sunday that's coming from there so in terms of quickly just going over the rules more granularly everything that you are submitting to be eligible for a prize must be done during the course of this hackathon which means that anything that you're submitting should be done from today to the next three week onwards um all the submissions should be related to scalability and this is a very broad rule that we're bringing on for this event and that means whatever you're doing should interact with something related to either a layer 2 system or a layer 1 scaling side which means that if you're only working on something that's entirely just d5 and does nothing to address anywhere from throughput to gas costs or any sort of abstraction it will unfortunately not be eligible for this event we really want everybody to see what's possible on the layer 2 side and there are a lot of options out there that have different trade-offs and different features that you can explore and we would like you to give that a try on top of all of that only rsvp attendees are eligible to win any prizes which means that if your teammates are not on your team from our dashboard officially and you do win a prize we will not be able to give a prize to somebody who is not listed as a team member during the time of submission so you really want to make sure that everybody who's on your team is confirmed as an attendee and is successfully added as a team member on your dashboard and on top of all of that we know that there are a lot of broad categories here that that will always have their edge cases so if you have any other questions or clarifications you would like you can ask anybody on the global team to uh to clarify and we'll be happy to answer those questions for you and and i kind of really want to just dig into the fact that a lot of you have said i don't know how certain things work on l2 or i don't i'm super need to i've only been doing solidity for for a few weeks to a few months and i'm really new to all this thing am i still a good candidate to be a participant at this event the answer is yes because we want this to be exploratory uh by design and on top of all that uh there are a lot of others who are also in a very similar position as you and we really want to make sure that you have a chance to find somebody who's in a similar position and work together so as a result if you are still looking for a team you can head over to find a team channel on our discord and you can talk to everybody who is also looking for team members whether that's a complimentary skill set or they don't know what they want to work on you can use that channel to see everybody who's in a similar position and contact those attendees and potentially pair up on top of all that we really encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the scaling channel because there's over 500 of you from so many different parts of the world and it'd be awesome to get to know all of you from from our side and on top of all that um we are doing a few live calls as well for it for you to help uh find potential teammates so there was one earlier today if you missed that one there's going to be another one on monday the schedule and all that information is on our discord also the website so you can join that call if timing permits and really use that to talk to people who are also looking for teammates and on top of all of that it is not required that you have a team obviously it makes things a lot easier if you have a few people doing certain things um but you are totally also welcome to work independently and hack solo so all that said uh let's talk about talks and workshops there is a lot of content that we're we're working on for this event because this is really the opportunity for everybody to see what's possible and what's happening on the layer two side the h2 merge side and zero knowledge side and uh it this content touches every everyone from beginners to experts in this ecosystem so there's gonna be talks panels workshops uh there's for that for the hackers here we're going to be doing a feedback session every week which means that if you're working on something you would like real-time feedback or help or any guidance you can join a call with us once a week and really showcase what you've been doing so far and really kind of use that as a way to get uh direct help um in in a live setting on top of all that all this information is also available on your info center uh which all of you should have a link for uh in every email and calendar invite and uh because this is designed to be as asynchronous as possible if you cannot attend a talk or a workshop because of a time zone or any other conflict you can immediately watch that after it ends on our youtube channel because everything is recorded so there's no need to try to do everything as it happens or make any different trade-offs we are recording everything and one more time everything is available um on scaling.ethglobal.com so lastly oh there's a few more things um so check-ins so everybody who has staked here knows that we are introducing the notion of check-ins for our three-week long event and the gist of all this is a check-in is something that happens once a week where we'll message you on discord and and also your dashboard and ask you to give an update on what you've done since the last time you chatted this is designed as a way for us to help make sure that you are not blocked in anything or you're getting all the help you need and this is the time where you get to ask us for things that you would like to get anywhere from help on or on stock on or you need to really think through something or or just tell us what's going on what's happening because it is a three week long event we are not expecting you to to spend too much time or all of your time on these uh on your projects so these design these check-ins are designed as a way for us to get a pulse of what's happening with your project your stake is returned if you respond to these check-ins on your dashboard and if you submit a project and all that information again is is available on the info center and also on your dashboard and all this will be managed directly through your dashboard um to give give a quick overview a lot of you are i usually ask us what it means for these check-ins and uh in uh this is like a simple slide where i just want to give an idea of like what this means and how you should think about structuring it we like you to spend the first week which is the next seven days exploring sort of what is possible if you don't already have an idea on understanding what you would like to work on or find potential other people to work with or really think through what you're trying to do as possible and in kind of the best things the tools or the protocols you need to work with you should spend the second week really having a basic version of your idea done so you can try it out get feedback from us get feedback from any mentors or sponsors and on the third week you should just polish it up to see if everything is good to go and add any additional things you want to add to make it really nice and ready for submissions and that should be the week where you're kind of in a state to submit everything and record that video and submissions are due again on the ninth which is three weeks from now so the way judging is going to work is that as you are readying the the day of the submission deadline you'll be required to make a four-minute video for your project and this video will be the official submission so for everything will be video submissions only so this really gives you all this time to make sure that you can really tell us about who you are what you've been working on and and what your app is and your submission is and uh record that and submit that on your dashboard and we'll use this video to do the judging for the event which happens the week of uh the few days after submissions and all this again happens to all of your dashboard so just a quick reminder that because you have to make a video please make sure that you don't do this thing last minute because it does take a little bit of time to make sure that the video is uh just anywhere from within the time limit to doesn't have any audio video issues and is really the best encapsulation of yourself as a team and your project and of course um this is an online event with hundreds of people so we want to make sure that all of you are being mindful of our our code of conduct uh the rules and the criteria for how we want everybody to behave is outlined on ethel dot co slash rules and uh even though we have a lot of details there the gist of it is that please be respectful to everybody on the discord and for this event harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any form and if you need any help or if you have any questions or concerns whether it's about how your experience has been at the event or on our mentorship or any literally any topic about the event um please don't hesitate to reach out to anybody on the global team and that will be happy to address and answer any of your questions and finally because there's a lot to wrap up um i want to remind everybody here that you should definitely pace yourself uh we don't want this thing to be a marathon uh the event is specifically designed to be three weeks because we don't want you to actively make any trade-offs or choices between your work or your school or any other full-time or longer commitments and and this having all this time makes it easy for you to really pick uh the time and the hours you want to spend on your projects and we don't want this thing to be exhausting for you in any form we want you to specifically have fun doing this thing because all these events are designed as a platform and a way for all of us to share what's happening in this ecosystem and how you can learn what's going on especially at the cutting edge and this specific event is very much about experimentation because not only are you learning about what could be possible on layer two all of our our protocols are here to get that feedback to understand how they can make that transition from layer one to layer to the best experience as possible so really focus on the learning side of this and that we want to be there to help you get to where you want to be as part of your events so all that said that covers all of the logistics i want to wish everybody a very happy hacking for the next three weeks and i'm going to quickly shift gears to what is happening today with some of the prizes the our sponsors and then move us off into our scaling summit so today's schedule is as follows we are going to have a lot of amazing talks about what is happening in the world of scalability uh we're going to learn about what the what all the types of roll-ups are and how they work then we're specifically going to focus on how optimistic roll-ups work and how the ovm is designed we're going to learn about how optimistic works from the arbitrary side then we're going to do a quick panel on different trade-offs and how these world architectures are are different and how they work we're going to learn a bit more about how specifically if your native chains work with layer one we're going to learn about generally how the broad ecosystem of layer 2 has expanded from side chains to uh generally just other native app specific blockchains we're going to learn about the nuances of what it means to think about security of your assets for uh for optimistic roll-ups uh we're going to learn about how liquidity and specifically d5 things will be possible in the world of l2 we're also going to have a lot more talks around just how do we actually make a lot more financial applications on the layer 2 side as we move everything over then we're going to switch gears and learn more about the world of zk roll ups so we're going to have a talk on zk porter we're going to learn a bit more about stark nets and what star wars doing and then we also want to really show what's possible on the protocols that have already existed on layer 2 for for a little bit a little while and that's when we'll learn about how synthetics is uh is currently on optimism and what they've learned and how they are thinking about their transition to there too so a lot this is just a quick preview of some of our talks but um i'll kind of go through all those as they happen in about an hour and a half and uh with that i want to really kind of focus on some of the prizes for this hackathon and some of our amazing sponsors so there's a lot of things happening on that front and what we're gonna do is we ask some of our sponsors to share and record some videos for us to talk us through um who they are why they're excited to be part of this event what they're working on and how you can use their their protocols or their apps into your hacks so we're going to be quickly walking through some of these companies and these protocols and uh what we'll do is we'll have arbitrarium first kick us off with uh what they are going to be sharing and uh we'll play a recorded video for them real quick [Music] welcome to scaling ethereum i'm stephen co-founder and ceo of off chain labs to team building arbitrary we're super excited to be sponsoring the hackathon and can't wait to see all the awesome projects that you'll build and we hope that you'll hack on arbitrary arbitrary is an optimistic roll-up scaling solution for ethereum that's currently live on coven with an open public and permissionless test net and coming soon to a mainnet near you we'll be actively participating throughout the hackathon and some events that you don't want to miss are the brainstorming session at 8pm eastern time on thursday night the arbitrary keynote at 1 45 pm eastern time on friday followed immediately by the optimistic rover panel which we'll be participating in and on monday at 1 pm at 1 pm eastern time you can roll up your sleeves at the arbitrary workshop and work with our developers to start building on arbitrage if you have any questions throughout the process technical questions just want to bounce ideas off us or definitely to show us what you've built please join us in on discord we'll be active in the scanning ethereum discord as well as the off chain labs discord and we're there to support you every step of the way and if you had so much fun on that in the hackathon building an armored room and you couldn't get enough while we're hiring so please join our team hi everybody i'm ed felton i'm co-founder and chief scientist at off chain labs let me tell you why you should use arvitron arbitrum has low cost and is scalable we get the gas cost of most transactions down to around 2000 l1 gas arbitrary is fully evm compatible you can send evm code directly to it there's no special compiler there's no special version you don't have to use solidity or viper you can use whatever tool chain you want there's nothing to download an arbitrary node speaks exactly the same rpc api as an ethereum node so to deploy a contract or to submit a transaction you can send the very same bits that you send to ethereum arbitrom is trustless it's built on top of ethereum its security is rooted in ethereum and arbitrary guarantees that any one honest party can force correct execution of the entire chain arbitram lets you break out of the limits that ethereum puts on you you can go beyond ethereum's transaction gas limit some other solutions have a lower gas limit than ethereum ours is much much higher you can go beyond the contract size limit because of the way that arbitram works we never need to deploy your contract on l1 or run an entire transaction on l1 and therefore we can break beyond those super annoying size limits and finally arbitram is a more mature technology we've been running an open public test net for about six months now it's that's a full system and includes the fraud proofs all the security features and everything not a demonstration a real system uh you can use our coven for test net today we're a community project we have never limited access to arbitram and we never will our test nuts and our have been and our main net will be free and open for everyone to use uh um what you see on test nut now is a main net release candidate we are close to main net release we're not yet ready to announce a date but you'll be hearing about a main that date very soon how do we do that we do that by using an optimistic roll-up type of approach with a little bit of secret sauce so we record the call data of transactions on the l1 chain we move computation and storage off chain and the protocol merely confirms on the l1 chain what everyone already knows is the correct result and it's optimistic that means that in the normal case in the normal case people simply post on the l1 chain a correct claim about what your transaction will do what the chain will do we have a special and a super efficient dispute resolution protocol that allows us to resolve any disputes that happen very quickly so arbitrary checks all the boxes i don't think any other system can say it checks all five of the boxes low cost and scalability fully evm compatible trustless breaking beyond the contract size and gas limits and mature and and fully available in a system today if you have any questions using arbitrary please reach out and let us know hey there my name is harry kaladner and i'm co-founder and cto of off chain labs we've been sponsoring each global hackathons for almost two years now and we're pumped to be back we're especially excited because this hackathon focuses on scaling ethereum which is an area near and dear to our hearts as we've been developing arbitram in order to make sure that everyone is excited as we are we're offering our largest hackathon prizes yet totaling twelve thousand dollars i'm going to tell you more about how you could win these prizes building on arbor from this hackathon our prizes are broken down into four categories scalability cross-chain interoperability protocol development and tooling the winner of each category will receive a three thousand dollar prize i'm going to give you a bit more detail about each category so you can start to build develop ideas for what you'll build this hackathon our first prize is eligible to any team that deploys their smart contracts on armatrum but we're most excited about teams that take advantage of the scalability that arbitrary provides to stretch the limits of what's possible in smart contracts this is a pretty open-ended prize so we're so we'd love for teams to have fun with it and can't wait to see what you come up with [Music] next up i want to talk about crosstreat interoperability arbitrary provides the general capability for ethereum contracts to make arbor term transactions and arbitrary contracts to make ethereum transactions this sort of general ability to send transactions between the chains is a powerful building block for new cross chain primitives a few ideas in this category are cross chain new types of fast withdrawals and cross-chain synthetic assets and we'll be happy to brainstorm with teams working towards these ideas or others for this next prize you'll be integrating directly at layer one with the arbitrary smart contracts themselves this is your chance to get into the nitty gritty details of protocol development by integrating directly with the core arbitrary smart contracts or the arbors from token bridge smart contracts work towards this prize to make the arbitrary roll-up protocol even better for ethereum last but definitely not least our final prize will go to the best arbitrary related tooling developer and user experience is critically important for the migration to layer 2 and we'd like to recruit scaling ethereum hackers to help this prize will go to a team who makes an awesome piece of tooling to make arbitrary easier to understand easier to use or easier to develop for thanks for listening and i hope people are excited to learn more and dig into arbitrary over the course of this hackathon good luck and have fun amazing thank you so much harry and ed um those are super well thank you so much harry and ed for uh giving us a review of arbitrum and what you'll be doing for your prizes um for all of you uh looking um who did not have a chance to catch up on on the prizes that were just shared let me just quickly summarize that arbitrary will be giving away twelve thousand dollars here and uh they'll be giving prizes for the best use of arbitrary scalability they're the best use of crosston interoperability the best use of arbitrary protocol in general and the best tooling related submissions for for arbor term so we'll we've shared all this again in in our prizes page and with that i want to go on to our next sponsor and that is optimism so we'll be sharing a quick video about optimism and how they're excited to be part of this event hello hackers welcome to the optimism keynote this maybe should have been a presentation on the technology and how it works but it is not that it's more like some kind of montage in any case i hope that you enjoy it and i hope that you stay hydrated and that you stop by our discord to say hi at the dawn of time the first ever response to the bitcoin white paper http colon forward slash forward slash www.bitcoin.org bitcoin.pdf we very very much need such a system but the way i understand your proposal it does not seem to scale to the required size a long long time ago what i'm trying to think um okay how do i do it okay um blockchain scalability oh yeah it was a real hard problem we came together from all the little corners to solve it hello i'm josh stein i'm the ceo of harvard all right so i'm carl i'm a researcher at the ethereum foundation hey everyone my name is kevin ho and i'm gonna be your lecturer for chapter three i'm i'm morellian a founding member of consensus diligence and a smart contract auditor sure yeah absolutely so i'm ben i'm a part of plasma group which is an open source community driven plasma implementation all right everyone so next up we have liam horn he's going to be telling us about state channels club come on now there we go [Applause] all right um hey that is that tv show the slides or no you know a couple posts by vitalik and you know 17 plasma implementers calls later my god these have been crazy plasma xt plasma mvp plasma unlimited plasma cash plasma debit plasma cash flow yet another plasma thank goodness what what is going on um plasma prime this is this is i would say fun with names to be honest with you i mean so the the kind of history of plasma is somewhat interesting iteration after iteration you know first plasma mvp came out but we realized that there were mass exit vulnerabilities and then plasma cache kind of addresses this but it has its own it has its own weakness with fungible assets and transaction history growth and then you know plasma xt trying to address transaction history growth and then uh you know plasma debit trying to address the fungi fungibility problem and then finally you know plasma cash flow and you know plasma unlimited these are the kind of the frontier frontier which you'll hear about soon we did some user testing with ideo actually and we realized that people wanted functionality they wanted smart contracts they wanted a web 2 experience not scalability and we you know scaled thousands of transactions per second with plasma like an annoying parent i would hear can it run uniswap and the sad truth is no we couldn't at the time run unisoc and so we went back to the drawing board and we thought of generalized plasma transfer one coin on chain the coin on chain one of the main research hurdles that we surpassed this year with plasma was the creation of generalized plasmas what generalized plasma allows is for some limited subset of what you can do with an ethereum smart contract so you like kind of have smart contracts on layer two which is pretty dope so all this has there's like a function that should ask that if it can be exited but can it run uniswap and once again the sad answer was no it cannot we did not have the unstoppable smart contracts of ethereum layer one generalized plasma was a lesson on many fronts it honestly sucks ass to scrap something that you've been working so hard on for so long but ultimately it wasn't pragmatic and we learned that ethereum smart contract devs want to build with ease which means preserving the existing experience not onboarding devs onto a whole new development paradigm so because of those fundamental limitations we scrapped the whole project and started anew we're very clever and so we came up with the name optimistic roll up um and so it turns out that within this in this trade-off space you can get general computation and you can get the no data withholding you know problem the kind of unstoppable nature and it turns out that the ability to have data on chin basically just gets around some very fundamental game theory issues that have to do with data availability and so that gives you what really resembles smart contracts inside of layer 2. but can it run uniswap yes my gosh of course it can run you in a swap first question down let's go all right so what are we building so we are here building optimistic ethereum now what is optimistic ethereum in one exhale domestic ethereum is fundamentally a proposal to enable scalability on ethereum it's an upgrade to ethereum it's not a different thing that's the goal of the optimistic ethereum network it's the goal of optimism as a project is to make ethereum scale not to become something different that tries to scale ethereum uh optimistic ethereum is just like ethereum but with better scalability 10 to 100 x cheaper and secured by l1 okay guys i want you to tell me what optimism is with as many buzzwords as possible and it's okay if they don't make any sense what is optimism optimism is the layer 2 scale ability stack for ethereum that's what it says on our website  roll okay carl okay what are you learning from this i'm learning the reality of george hatz's advice of keeping things extremely simple and using the simplest tool to get the job done the optimistic ethereum design philosophy is keep it simple i that was completely wrong where did we fail we failed by having a feature that was not going to be used by our protocol were integrated by our protocol until it was complete so we didn't do have an iterative strategy for building this feature instead it was a full top-down approach where we built out all the failure modes all the edge cases from day one i think we've learned that premature optimization is a trap yeah so despite our best efforts to build an mvp every single time we went within a waterfall approach and then we slapped the agile process over it and pretended like we were doing some agile mvp the optimistic ethereum design philosophies keep it stupid simple and uh don't get wrecked plus also aligning yourself with ethereum as a whole what does that mean if you write a bunch of code that you design an entirely new protocol is it still ethereum theorem anymore it's like a ship with these type of thing right we're not sitting here trying to go oh ethereum doesn't work because in scale we have to reinvent everything so that it scales is to say well we did the best that we could at the time we now understand how to scale underlying blockchain systems better and we have to apply those models to the existing amazingness that is ethereum not running our code as a standalone bit of software that now people need to understand the depths so we're running it as diffs against the existing tech stack and our and our philosophy is like very very minimal diff what really gets me going is like looking at that 200 line div compiler you know what i mean like think of the complexity eliminated from like you know early days of transpilation of like your 6000 line javascript you know bytecode ingester versus now you just like write you know 200 lines of fuel and it's done you know it's just it's just phenomenal if you're wondering why it's taking us so damn long to write a 200 line compiler that's because it takes so many more than 200 lines to get to the right 200 lines that maximizes functionality for minimum lines and that's just for the compiler optimistic ethereum is extremely complex because it has a lot of moving pieces and so it takes many many iterations to get that right just because there's not a large dip like doesn't mean that you can't you don't have to put a lot of thought into like what that dip is you know none of this is perfect yet we have to find the right balance between pragmatism auditability shipping speed and it's all trade-offs um code is really sensitive even very small changes can have very big breaking impacts so one benefit of minimizing the diff is compatibility with a whole ecosystem of ethereum developer tooling ridiculous for us to think that we could come in and catch up with five years of like global you know global open source development is just not practical there's a reason people have been doing that work for years and years it takes a lot of effort to make things good there's something really awesome to be said for going from corporate to startups because uh as a nurse i felt like i knew everything on the ground but i was a drop in not even a bucket but the ocean you used to work at a hedge fund why are you working here now this is where the action is holy come on thousand way thousand way oh it was exciting oh my god no computer they got in oh that was a disaster i went to my first ethereum hackathon in 2017 eth waterloo i was really worried that it's going to be these crypto anarchists there's going to be they're gonna be unwelcoming to a noob like me what i found was a community that was super inclusive and willing to help i remember someone stayed up with me until 2am walking through the ethereum yellow paper yeah and i just think working at optimism i can feel those same vibes of welcoming inclusivity um yeah um why is solving fundamental problems in blockchain fun solving fundamental problems in blockchain involves solving fundamental problems in computer science and that's fun yeah they're hard problems in computer science problems that haven't been solved before so why not do it at google or something because i don't really care about serving ads faster to people i don't really wake up excited in the morning to track people on the internet what do you wake up inside the world to solve fundamental problems in blockchain [Music] okay prize although i okay i am the sucker for compiler so that would be good too some new compiler could be fun like a viper compiler yeah exactly exactly yeah or faye adding uh increased time to death and in optimistic ethereum guys we want to give back to the community as a whole so we have prizes dedicated to hacks that benefit ethereum as a whole this could be contributions to hardhat or ethers or an eip really you name it we also have prizes dedicated to hardcore helpful and mimi hacks so it could be guest mods viper compilers ports of existing contracts new layer to native contracts cross chain you know t-shirt designs riffs on our brand or our logo beautiful nft artwork that we can gift to our community members all of these count i'm super looking forward to what you guys are building the distinction between categories is not that clear so just give it a shot oh and you should go to the website for the detailed price information but we are putting fat stacks in each category so definitely go check it out okay last note carl is going to be giving a presentation later today if you want to get a little bit more in depth into how the technology behind optimistic roll-up works so look out for his presentation at 10 30 am pt [Music] that was extremely fun and entertaining to watch um thank you so much the entire optimism team and uh that was super illustrative um and uh just reminds us back when we can go back to the uh the in-person events uh that global does and i can't wait to see so many more stories and teams like this um so that was super awesome to watch i hope all of you got to learn a bit more context about optimism and optimistic roll-ups in general as well and uh just to summarize what jing said at the end the prizes are available on the website for global as well as the optimism specific uh domain but the prizes for optimism are the most hardcore hacked we'll be giving four thousand dollars for that the most helpful hack uh four thousand dollars again for this the best use of memes will get um 17.50 in total and the best good for the community hack category will have three thousand dollars being given away so um hope you had a chance to enjoy that video as well and we are ready to learn more about our next sponsor and that is zk sync so um let's watch the intro video by then everyone uh really really happy to be here and honored to greet you at the east global scaling hackathon and what a time to be in crypto in this crazy crazy times uh i just bought this two nfts from a local otc at a great discount to celebrate the coin base uh going public but let's start my name is alex i am ceo and co-founder of metalabs and one of the co-creators of zika sync which is a the first evm compatible zika roll-up uh and zika roll-up is the the most interesting uh scaling protocol l2 scaling protocol uh because it has the same security properties as a layer one which is the the it's the only protocol which has this ability and we are very excited about the evm compatibility which is coming on testnet in may and will be released in production in august please come join us at a zkevm talk at uh global zk summit uh in in in two weeks i guess uh where we're going to deep dive into the details how we did that but ziki sink is first and foremost a mission-driven project it started because we wanted to make a contribution into acceleration of mass adoption of crypto we believe in freedom and we believe that freedom will be enhanced in all of the world through the mass adoption of crypto and we are building our philosophy on the ethereum's values of fairness inclusion and resilience and we do everything around those values to support them from technologically uh using the power of zero knowledge proofs which i think is the the most uh the the the the most underrated and the most promising technology for crypto for the coming decades uh so uh we are happy to support this hackathon with a number of prizes we're going to offer you mentorship we will be able to we will be there for you to answer questions about easy kissing about your knowledge proofs share ideas uh provide any feedback um and i just wanna offer you one of the recipes how to pick great ideas to work on which are which are gonna catch a lot of attention and will lead to something really big and successful and that is please think several moves ahead don't build something that solves an immediate problem don't build something that is obvious today build something that solves the problem which will become acute once the current problems are solved and if we look back at history we started dk sync a couple of years ago with uh defcon 4 where i first met my co-founder and we discussed the idea back then the fees on ethereum were minuscule the the scaling was vaguely in the air but it was not at all a burning problem however we realized that uh if cryptics were going to become big and all the depths which were being built back then and those were like the the actual things that people needed like defy and um and nfts and all the protocols we now we have and enjoy most of them were not available back then and they were kind of obvious things to work on uh but we thought okay if those are going to be big and get a lot of traction and get a lot of usage 20 tps is by far not going to be enough so we started working on uh on scalability uh also because your knowledge proves were becoming mature and it was clear that we will be able to use it and solve scalability breaking out of the scalability of trilemma for them uh so yeah we we launched in uh summer last year we are now live on mainnet with a zika roll up for payments in may this year uh nfts and trading is coming to mainnet and also we release the test net for zika sync 2.0 with support for solidity and general evm compatibility or evm portability um but this year yeah of course we expect the summer of scaling with a lot of scaling solutions launching and a lot of users who were excluded from from the participation in ethereum because of high fees are coming back from side chains from other layer ones uh and a lot of new users who got excited about nfts and and all the crypto bus are coming to ethereum as well uh but let's think one step ahead again what's going to be like once those solutions launch and all these users come back what's going to happen and retrospectively we look at what happened in the over the past year we will see a very interesting phenomenon the number of users in ethereum the active defy users grew around a dozen times but the fees grew quadratically proportional to that and the reason for this is induced demand a a term which describes what happens where you increase the capacity of some uh some public good and a lot of more users coming and you have a lot of more new use cases and also trading just intensifies the existing use cases already intensified and this is likely what's going to happen with roll-ups unfortunately uh the expectation is that we'll get 100x more users with 100 x scalability boost but the reality might be closer that we just get a lot more trading again and some more use cases plus all the or multiplied by the number of os users which will just eat up the um the scalability boost and the the prices currently roll up transaction prices are around one dollar like more or less if they grow 10x 50x 100x we again are going to have a whole class of users who are excluded from the ethereum uh um ecosystem and this is this is not cool so we we we were thinking about this and we built a solution called ziki porter which is which falls under the class of evolution and it combines the the best properties of zika roll up and and validium and we encourage you to come to our talk on friday at five o'clock eastern where we're going to deep dive into that and this brings this is really interesting i'm very very excited about this please come to the top really you're not going to regret it and uh yeah but then there's going to be a next problem that a lot of roll-ups the launch will have centralized sequencers and this will jeopardize the resilience of these protocols because all of a sudden we are subject to a lot of pressure maybe political pressure maybe some economic or like just some faulty behavior uh which we will solve for the keysync with an l2 consensus which we're currently working on already and then we think one more step ahead about the the problem which will come after next which is a minor acceptable value which uh jeopardizes fairness because the class of users will be in a lot better position than others uh using those those values so we will solve it again with cryptography and with your knowledge proofs with time-locked encryption uh so yeah looking forward to what you guys are going to build we are there for you uh and yeah have a lot of fun at this hackathon thank you amazing so that was alex talking to you about zk sync and zk porter and just to summarize what they're doing for prizes they'll be giving away 4 000 usdc for the first place of zk sync use there will be two 2000 usdc dollars for second place and then four teams will win 500 usdc for the third place for the best use of z concerning technologies so uh with that let's move on to our second zk roll up sponsor and that is startware and i'll let them share a bit about themselves hello everyone so my name is ellie bensasson and i am co-founder and president of starkware and i would like to tell you in this eight-minute talk a little bit about the role we're taking from zk stark to starknet and i would like to tell you that it goes through cairo which is a very cool programming language to which you're all invited to come and start programming in that's the purpose of our address to you in this hackathon so startnet is going to be an ethereum like stark rollup it's going to have very low amortized gas per transaction it's going to have tremendously good tps transactions per second so everyone wants to come over to it right just a little bit more about what it we mean by ethereum alike it is going to be universal and support any smart contract logic that you wish just like on ethereum it's going to be permissionless you can deploy smart contracts without asking permission from anyone you can anyone can submit transactions in a decentralized manner it's going to be fully decentralized both operators and provers are going to be decentralized it's going to have some form of crypto economic incentives to the various participants in the network the approvers the operators developers and so on um now to your question whether there will be a token so the answer is no comment good so we'd like to get there and we're already on our way so already in 2020 um starkware has deployed the foundations for starknit and i'll talk about that in the next slide and all of these foundations are already humming in practice in production and delivering scale for our customers and we want to expand this to everyone so uh during 2021 within a couple of months we will give access to uh planets which is going to be run by a single operator and offer only a single app on it by summer we're going to have constellations that's going to allow multiple apps to compose with one another running on a single operator and by 2022 we're going to reach the stage of universe which is going to be this ethereum like decentralized multiple operator system permissions for everyone great so a little bit about the foundations the stuff we achieved so far and i want to mention all of these things are right now operating in production and supporting our customers so first of all we have cairo which is the programming language in which we express our logic and this will be the programming language to be used also for getting scale and efficiency on start connect we have starcx which is an application layer and it will be ported and streamlined and ported over to become smart contracts over starchnet and currently we have three starkex applications so think of these as three preliminary um anchor smart contracts that are going to be ported over to stark net and we have the framework of stark provers the most powerful provers in the world with the leanest fastest meanest and most secure cryptography behind them that also reaches the you know vastly greater scale than that obtained in production by any other proving system so the three applications we have already running um the first one was diversify spot trading deployed already in production over the past summer it reaches currently a tps of 000 per for trading so 9 000 trades can be done per second and all of this on main at ethereum uh for payments you can double that and have 18 000 transactions per second uh a week ago we deployed two systems immutable with nft trading it is the only uh solution for scalable nft trading right now that also sits on ethereum it gives you a a price of not forty dollars per minting of an nft but rather one-fifth of a cent and during the very first day it went live the amount of trading that went on on immutable x was greater than all of the nft related trading that took place on the week before that on ethereum l1 um and and it didn't really you know affect gas prices all of this scale uh the third system that was also deployed last week two systems deployed in production within roughly two days um this is the first stark roll up it is dydx and uh and it supports perpetual and margin trading and it reduced the gas cost per trade by a factor of 50x again it's the first roll up for stark that is right now running in production so these three anchor uh systems are going to be part of starknet and they are all written in cairo which is the language that gives you the best acts the best access to using the power of starks so what are starks and how do we get from starks to starknet through cairo so zk starks are a family a very powerful cryptographic proofs that offer computational integrity and computational integrity in the context of block in the context of blockchains roughly means doing the right computation even when you're on an l2 and no one else is watching so zk means that you get the privacy of zero knowledge proofs uh the s in stark stands for scalability which means that the verification time per batch is only logarithmic or exponentially small in the amount of transactions going on in the batch while the proving time stays nearly linear it is a universal system meaning you can get it for any computation in the world it is transparent that's the t in stark so no toxic waste no trusted setup it also gives you unlimited scale without reconfiguring the system and it is based on lean and battle hardened cryptography basically on the security of hash functions like shot 2 and shot 3 and it is post quantum secure so uh how do you use it well you take many transactions so each one of these transactions one of these little red squares each one could be let's say an nft being minted and instead of uh processing each one individually you send them to approver the prover doesn't have to be trusted the math of stark uh implies that it cannot produce a proof the proof is this red pie that is generated the approver cannot get a proof if he's not asserting a statement that is correct and then there is a verifier that runs an exponentially small time and checks whether the proof is correct and again the math of it allows you to move from the current system on the right which is verification by naive replay so you need to check each one of these nft mints and you know each one of them may cost let's say 40 dollars in gas you can move to a system where basically you get one proof that can assert for six hundred thousand mints being mintings being the correct and a new state of the system captured by a merkle root and now you only need to verify the exponentially small um proof and then you move to the new state of the system so this is how all of our systems work right now in the starx mode and they are written in cairo a few words about cairo cairo is our minimal viable language for getting production start systems it is it follows the goldilocks principle so it's the just right balance between the expressibility needed by developers and getting the start prover efficiency it is very simple in its structure and virtual machine it has only three registers and a minimal instruction set but on the other hand it is extremely powerful it supports functions recursion branching random memory access being production grade means that it comes with a very elaborate set of tools that is needed by developers like a compiler virtual machine id extensions tracer application code examples and so on and so forth so summing up our applications currently have been written in cairo they support diverse business logic and sometimes this logic is quite complicated and this is the best way for you to jump on the wagon or this train that is heading towards starknet and will its next stop is going to be in summer 2021. so um the next step is to join us on discord that's the left qr code or and go and start tap into all the resources of cairo using the right qr code so thank you very much amazing thanks ellie um so you kind of got a quick overview of how starkware and their work to start net is is uh going to make um their debut here for this event and uh what starcraft is going to be doing is they're going to be giving away a few prizes so the first uh place for the starcraft prize will get five thousand dollars for the best use of integrations with the with the stark net protocol the second place there will be two winners for uh the second place for two three thousand dollar prizes and then there's going to be three one thousand dollar third place uh winners so um we'll be sharing a lot more details on on these specific prizes they're already available on our prize page and uh you you also kind of got a gist of cairo and and how uh the starkware scaling solution works and there'll be another talk for our summit later in the day going more into details of how starkware works with ethereum so with that we are ready to move on to our next uh two sponsors so we have scale and connects and we'll be sharing a quick video for both of them hello everybody my name is jack o'halleran i'm co-founder of scale the scale network and the ceo of skill labs really excited to be here today we've been doing hackathons or global hackathons since august of 2018. eth berlin was our first hackathon and we've done everyone since so really really pumped uh to be here to be supporting you and this hackathon in particular is very unique in that it goes for such a long period of time so i think what that means is an opportunity to build even cooler things get even more creative put more effort and time into it the other thing that i want to call out before we get into this we've had the pleasure of having over 60 submissions on scale and uh we've given out over 60 000 worth of awards at youth hackathon so i've seen a lot of a lot of these over the time the last last three years and one thing i've noticed is that when you look at the teams building on hackathons and the sponsors that are there supporting them you fast forward 18 to 24 months later this is the the future of of crypto decentralization these things being hacked on become the things that are being used so um a lot of the things we see out in the wild today were actually ideas and thoughts and submissions at hackathons before so um it's a phenomenal way to build recognition as a developer get uh get awards get um awareness for your project your team but also to innovate and push the industry forward so the people here doing this are the ones that will set forth the uh the future agenda for ethereum and web 3 and d5 okay without further ado i'm going to i'm going to get into some slides and show you more about awards and how to hack on skill all right here we go um so we'll get into the awards talk a little bit about scale talk about how to deploy on scale um i want to cover hackathon support resources quickly and then we'll close on on a bit of a summary so all right i am i'm really excited to see this is by far the biggest set of awards we've been able to give uh through scale and that's because the scale tokens now live the network's live there's two billion dollars staked into the ethereum main net which gives pool security to the uh the scale network and this is again uh coming from a community pool and going to going to developers so there'll be five awards given one will be the denali award which is the name of the most recent upgrade this week the scale network is upgrading and you're going to see scale chains going live you're going to see a lot of there's over 100 teams in the skill innovator program that'll be pushing out different uh applications in d5 web 3 gaming nft uh b2b disruptors social music streaming etc all right um and then we'll have three kilimanjaro awards which is the name of the first mainnet uh upgrade uh the fame first decentralized mainland release last october and they'll also be one partner hack award where you build something on another uh partner at the hackathon or an ecosystem partner integrate that with scale we want to show off uh and award people that are using the ethereum ecosystem all right so before i go further i want to talk a little bit more about what it means to be an ethereum native multi-chain network and so we need to then define what is a multi-chain network and what does it mean to be ethereum native so let's first talk about pooled security and and pooled security is a key component of a multi-chain network you have a large set of nodes they're secured the stake across all of those nodes and any given time a random subset is pulled into a blockchain that blockchain and in this case of scale those are called scale chains and that's those nodes are not just randomly assigned but they're they're rotated in a random fashion all right the cool thing about scale is the ethereum network is actually orchestrating all of that uh that assignment and rotation and stake and slashing etc and there's already two billion dollars plus in pooled security in the scale network at your disposal now that we are at the denali upgrade i'm ready for you to help support you push scale into the wild all right um and so that's a so that's a multi-block chain network where you have not just one blockchain that's shared each application has its own blockchain so when you deploy to scale you get your own skill chain when you get a scale chain at this hackathon you get your own endpoint that you that you point to your own rpc port and that's where you uh that's your skill chain you don't share it with other hackers okay and uh these are blockchains on demand so to speak or ethereum on demand now this is not a new novel thing we've been building this since 2017 building a multi-block chain network or a multi-chain network but there are a lot of them out there i mean you see these are some big brands that are building multi-chain networks and i think they also see that the world's best tooling and developer traction is on ethereum so what they're doing is they're saying hey we have evm compatibility we're going to build a bridge to ethereum and that's pretty much the extent of their integration scale i want to call it is very different and that's why i'm passionate about this term ethereum native because it means something it's not just marketing the scale network through the skill manager actually is is guided through the skill manager so in the skill network um any orchestration as i mentioned which nodes go to which chains any rotation of those nodes happens through the scale manager uh and uh and in in conjunction with scale nodes but smart contracts in the mainnet make that happen in addition there's network management that happens on ethereum so there's an erc77 token it's called the skl token that's on ethereum it lets you delegate from ethereum to the scale network and then when you do that when you stake that stake actually lives in the scale network and it's pooled security that supports decentralized applications all right um that lives on ethereum same thing with any bounty awards scale chain fees paid by developers for scale chains any sort of inflation the inflation in the network that helps bootstrap the network and augments the the fees in the first years any sort of slashing so if a node operator is malicious and they get slashed that happens on ethereum through skill manager uh check it out on github skill manager and the scale github it's a very complex set of smart contracts and um and uh you know and the other cool thing is when you use scale you pay ethereum it's a it's this modernized rev share model that is decentralized which very cool way of partnering and as opposed to competing and just kind of connecting over through a bridge you want to pay for a scale chain you have to pay and scale and you have to pay gas fees send a scale token you pay ethereum and gas fees etc okay um scale also is i think doing really cool stuff with containerization and these elastic block chains or elastic shards um are actually can be selected in different sizes based off your needs so won't go too deep on this today but it's one of the cool components here where every node has virtualized subnodes and a core that speaks back to the skill manager on ethereum all right um so again deploy to scale uh you can have sub second block times much larger block sizes uh very great easy user experience as if you were just deploying to another another chain without a lot of complexity but it's an ethereum native chain all right and so the way you at this hackathon in order to do this one you have to request the chain which i'll show you how to do in a second um it's pretty it's very easy to deploy two lines of code then you need then if you want to bridge it's not a requirement but if you want to bridge and show tokens moving back and forth between ethereum and scale you can use the scale ima which uh is there at your disposal or another bridge maybe you want to use connects or something else or maybe even you want to create a bridge i think uh that would also be a cool award winner and we'd love to see somebody do something creative um or connect another bridge that exists to scale and show something happening that also i think would be very creative um and and then lastly once you have your chain do something cool in the ethos and spirit of ethereum show off these larger block sizes and smart con again uh closing on awards so there are five thousand dollars uh will be given in scale to the denali winner um and hey again do something cool uh do it in the spirit of ethereum um number the next piece uh three two thousand five hundred dollar winners uh the kilimanjaro award again build something cool have fun uh get creative and uh lastly partner hack award and uh there's there's some integrations that already exist between chain link uh the graph connext uh and others covalent new cipher um so build something cool uh integrate a partner ethereum is about the ecosystem that is a strength of ethereum it's it's not just solidity it's not just evm it's not just uh the security within the ethereum mainnet it's the developer ecosystem and scale wants to support that by also giving an award for someone that can show this integration between scale and another piece of the ecosystem all right so how do you learn more the first step would be in a few hours today at 11 30 a.m pt chadwick strange vp of product for scale labs will be giving a talk um so join that for a much deeper dive you can go to scale.chat to the scale discord and learn all you need to know how to hack on scale get connected to the team you can also uh go to the the discord run by uh for this this hackathon and we'll be there to support you as well um there's also a dev portal here uh link and uh a link to get a scale chain lastly there's a scale store it's a zero profit store it's a community store anyone who hacks there'll be a discount codes given when you get your scale chain so so please check that out all right again just want to close to say you know this is a phenomenal platform for for you to build something and [Music] the secure all right it looks like we're having some minor technical difficulties but luckily we're at the tail end of what the scale prices were so i want to just quickly repeat uh what jack was saying about scale prizes and they are as follows so for the denali grand prize you'll be getting five thousand dollars in in scale tokens uh for the kilimanjaro prize you'll be getting three 2500 in scale tokens and for the best partner integration there will be uh twenty five hundred dollars in scale tokens that is over twelve thousand dollars in prices being given by scale and this is the largest they have i've done for any global event and uh this is just absolutely incredible so i hope you had a chance to learn a bit more about how scale is structured from this quick talk there's also going to be a another talk doing our summit in a couple of hours by chadwick going in more depth around how scale works under the hood and uh and yeah hopefully that was informative and with that we are ready to move on to our next talk uh for our next sponsor uh video and that is uh connext and we'll be uh sharing what connects us to say momentarily hi everyone my name is arjun i'm one of the founders of connext welcome to scaling ethereum connext is a protocol for communicating between different layer 2 ecosystems so that's side chains any other kind of evm compatible chain and then eventually also like non-touring complete or sorry non-evm compatible touring complete systems uh like zk roll-ups um connext works by connex is basically a network of liquidity providers called routers uh those routers hold liquidity pools on different chains similar to like uniswap lps and they allow you to swap value between them and you can even do more interesting things like pass call data between as part of these swap interactions that allows you to call a contract on a given chain from another chain so uh we this kind of looks like a cross chain meta transaction pattern um connext is live today we've been live for the last few months uh we've been working with well pretty closely with the polygon ecosystem xdi and a bunch of other uh early early kind of l2 pioneers um and then now we're we're kind of we're hoping to go live with arbitrary optimism soon and then zk sync as well when it rolls out uh connects works so a few examples of where k'nex works right now so decentral games is a is a metaverse casino that exists on on polygon uh decentral games uses kinext to onboard in and out of polygon from ethereum um one of the great things about k'nex is that you can because you're you have this like swap of assets on one chain for another chain you can bypass like entry and exit windows completely so polygon has a six minute onboarding and a three hour off-boarding time normally from ethereum and then with with connects that ends up being uh pretty much instant users can kind of just do this in in a single session so especially particularly for people who are not necessarily as familiar with ethereum and particularly like the nuances of ethereum bridges connects ends up making that experience a lot more seamless um another way that people are using connects is uh is direct layer two to layer two interactions and we think this is a an incredibly powerful space uh that is going to be really really valuable in the future because uh well to be honest heath is just so incredibly expensive right now that that like it prices out a lot of different types of activities so we've had folks say that they have like funds stuck on xdi or vsc or eventually things like arbitrary optimism um and and the funds are not really worth bridging out of the chain but if you can do if you can move them directly between their twos then they become interesting to play with um and right now that that threshold is kind of like 40 to 50 which is actually a pretty significant amount of money uh when you're not you know just being like an absolute d5 d-gen um we found that this larity to layer two uh these these swaps are actually really really great for people who want to aid into protocols from from things like finance um because there's a very clear and easy path to go from like finance chain uh to move liquidity off of binance chain and on to into like the actual ethereum or clear two ecosystem and the last last kind of used user flow the last kind of way to use connects that we're most excited about is uh is is basically this cross-chain meta transaction pattern so connext has the ability to build uh what are called withdrawal helpers um basically we have like middleware contracts that that you can you can deploy between the connex contracts and then whatever else you want to do outside of connects and then you can pass call data into connects when you when you make a cross chain transaction um and by creating withdrawal helpers like this you're actually able to like call any contract directly from connext um and do that across chains without having to pay gas on the on the receiving side so what this looks like is it's kind of similar to a meta transaction relay pattern where like you uh you know you you only need funds you know you're able to pay for a transaction um that normally would cost east gas but only using you know usdc or die and in this case you're able to pay for a transaction on a receiver side chain um only using funds on the sender side chain so for instance like uh paying for uh an arbitrary transaction using uh like using eth from arbitrary rather than eth and like an arbitrary transaction on on optimism uh paying only east from arbitrary rather than eastern optimism um a great example of a project that's building with this technology right now is super fluid the superfluid is a cross-chain money streaming protocol or a money steering protocol more generally and then they're building cross-chain money streams using connects by uh by enabling users to be able to like set up these money streams on different chains um we think there's a there's some really really interesting new kinds of uh of places to explore here so for instance you can build like fully atomic cross chain uh dex aggregators which we think is are incredibly powerful and are probably what dex aggregators would look like in the future where you're not just aggregating from all of the amms on a single chain but you're also aggregating across a bunch of different chains you can use the same kind of pattern to build things like cross chain money cross chain lending um you know cross chain um uh yield aggregation potentially even like costume interactions and things like that um there's a couple of ways to integrate connects today we have a sdk so we have it we have a widget that looks like this that you can pretty much just drop directly to your ui um that is extremely fast integrate and we have we have like great instructions for that in our docs um we also have a lower level sdk that powers this so in case you don't want to use our ui or you want to do more more complex behaviors like the you know the cross chain money uh cross chain uh contract calls that that we just talked about um you you you'd be able to pass those more more detailed like call data calls directly into the sdk um both of these uh integra like resources for bit integrating both of these mechanisms are available in our docs um and for the for the duration of this test we're actually um hosting routers on testnet specifically for this so if you if you have a project that you're building on top of us and you don't want to have to go through the headache of like hosting a router and supplying liquidity and things like that we have some public available routers that you could use we also have some additional resources so we we've put together like a list of things that could be helpful to hackers uh in a hacker kit you can find that at connex dot network scaling eth and then of course you can also find us and ping us anytime in the sponsor for next discord chat on on the global chat we also have we also have our own discord if you want to join it um we are super responsive there as well and you can find the link to that on our on our landing pages connex dot network um and then lastly we're giving out a bunch of prizes as part of this um so uh we're giving out 1500 each to the best applications that implement the widget sdk um the best applications that that use this like cross-chain meta transactions pattern um we're looking for a team to build like teams that build metrics and powerful data analytics against our network so we're we have we're exposing the process of exposing that currently and if you're interested in that definitely come talk to us um and then we're doing a couple of joint mounties with the graph and optimism where if you build using both of us you you would be eligible for for those prizes um yeah that's basically it from our end thank you guys so much for uh for coming to scaling ethereum and really really excited to potentially work with you and good luck in a hackathon thanks so much arjun for that intro and uh just to sum up the prizes for connects uh there is going to be two thousand dollars being given for the metrics uh related hack uh it's fifteen hundred dollars available for the cross chain dap submission and uh the best use of a cross chain transaction on connects will also get 1500 and there'll be two 750 prizes for the best widget or sdk integration so uh that's a summary of the connex prizes and then we have a few more sponsors who would like to tell us about their excitement to join this event and we'll be doing protocol labs and cellar together here [Music] hello welcome to scaling ethereum i am dietrich ayala and i'm the ipfs ecosystem lead at protocol labs protocol labs is an open source research development and deployment laboratory our projects include ibfs filecoin lippy2p and a whole bunch more we aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through the technologies we're developing we're a fully distributed company our team of more than 100 members works remotely and in the open to improve the internet humanity's most important technology as we explore advances in computing related fields protocol labs has four prize options for scaling all the things which it may choose to split up amongst multiple winners if too many of you build amazing projects our first prize the nft metadata updater 1875 us dollars file coin momenting mo problems right now everybody's minting ft's and figuring out how to manage them there aren't a lot of tools or services for managing large numbers of nfts or even personal collections being able to update metadata dynamically and bulk across multiple assets so this is a prize for the best method for managing signed permissioned timestamp updates to nft metadata stored on ipfs via any l2 chain the chain of your choice our second prize filecoin turbo retrieval 1875 in file coin for the best method of bundling managing warming up preflighting or otherwise speeding up the payment channel creation process for easy mass retrieval from the filecoin network our third prize sailing the seas of cids 1875 in filecoin right now you're publishing everything to ipfs but where's your stuff what is it all so this prize is for the best tool the best service website library for working with and managing visualizing large collections of ipfs cids our fourth prize the file coin super disputer 1 875 in file coin disputing optimistic window proof of space-time proofs is a fun and profitable hobby that will also impress your friends but how to show that off this is the best prize for a disputer history visualizer a leaderboard or some other way of understanding what the set of potential disputes that you could take on are who's disputing them and any other way to be able to manage and help the dispute process and allow people to participate in this opportunity thank you very much for listening thank you for joining the eth global scaling ethereum hackathon protocol labs is very proud to be part of another amazing event we are looking forward to the things that you build with ipfs lit p2p and filecoin if you have any questions join us in the lab sponsor channel we're here to help you and answer your questions and make the things that you build even more awesome looking forward to evaluating and judging your projects and we'll see you on the internets hi this is mo from saturn it's great to meet you all at the scaling exam hackathon today we're bringing a new project called layer2finance for you to use and actually build on top of it uh this project is really about the bringing access due to d5 for everyone and just to give a quick intro if we look at the entire device landscape it's almost like a city where your wallet is basically your home and you have different kind of a default shop you can go and park your money at and earn yield the problem about this particular d5 city is that right now the only way of transportation is this kind of a super expensive limo service which is a l1 transaction and ideally for any kind of a modern city we would expect it to have some a pretty good public transportation system where you know people can aggregate together and go to certain destination and split the cost this is essentially the idea of layer 2 finance which is providing a trust free d5 public transportation system through layer to roll up scaling architecture we have already launched on task net and you know currently there are uh quite a lot of activity on this test ad but most notably we're seeing about 80 times lower cost comparing to directly using layer 1 d5 protocols the good thing about the layer to finance here is that it really is a composable uh product where it doesn't require uh layer one d5 strategies or layer one d5 protocols to migrate to a different chain instead it only requires a simple connector to bridge the layer two liquidity back to layer one and this is what we call a strategy adapter now this hacksaw is really about you know bringing innovation on that strategy adapter layer and we're providing a seven thousand five hundred dollar prices to build with a layer two finance strategy sdk to connect and combine different strategy protocols and divide protocols to into noble strategies the first price being three thousand dollars and we have three runner ups of 1500 each we're hoping to see some really noble combination of d5 protocols in these strategies with a fully functional uh strategy contract built and to find out how to build the most easy uh the easiest solution is probably just join the discord and follow us on twitter and we also have a github of course but we will always you know send notification in the discord channel and also publish our workshop uh you know talk about how to connect the existing d5 protocols into this layer 2 finance you know product and we'll have a summit later today to talk a little bit more in detail on how this is realized uh in later to roll up construct well looking forward to your submission and good luck with the hackathon thank you so much protocol labs and sellers so just to quickly summarize their prize protocol labs will be giving nft 1875 and file coin tokens for the nft metadata updater hack uh another 1875 and filecoin tokens for a turbo retrieval hack for falcon which relates to scaling uh they also want to help uh give prizes for anybody who's helping scale cid retrievals and uh and also a 1875 and falcon prize for a super disruptor category winner at the details of all of which are on our prizes page and to summarize seller we uh they'll be giving first place three thousand dollars for the best seller integrations there'll be three fifteen hundred dollar runner-ups uh for the best use of seller protocol so with that uh we have zk swap and loop ring up next and now we'll share their videos with you momentarily hello youth global hacker this is ck swap this is a quick video overview of what thick swap is the ticket swap is a layer 2 a.m decks based on second roll up we launched in february 14 2021 it's been three months since our launch we already have 1.5 billion in tbr and 1 billion in liquidity and 150 million in trading value ck swap has payment and thereto uh literature trading and liquidity money and it's based on develop it uses validity proof instead of flood proof it has unchained data and there's no extra period it has low gas at low gas v and low latency we have about 100 times the capacity of ethereum and the gas cost the transaction cost is my 50th compared to their very wide solutions and the the confirmation is instantaneous the technical challenges and innovations were encountered while implementing zinc swap uh so the circuit complexity is definitely one thing as the complexity of the business logic increases the the block size and the proof time also increases so we had to spend a lot of time uh optimizing our circuits and our proof infrastructure we implemented a gpu algorithm to generate approves and we achieved a three-time improvement using our gpu implementation and the other technique we used is aggregation proof instead of generating one degree knowledge proof per block there is a way to generate a single proof for multiple blocks so it decreases the the proofing cost engine as well because we can verify multiple blocks with a with a one single aggregation proof and we also look into a lot of data compression uh of our ancient data on-chain data storage is definitely the the biggest component of tk world cost a little bit about our 2021 roadmap in q2 of 2021 we're going to launch version 2 and we'll support a token listing for anyone for users and we're gonna keep working on our our uh proof dk proof efficiencies so we can improve our tps as well and we plan to launch a governance token for cks and in q3 we're going to add a stable coin swap so we're going to implement different curves for stable coins and for example trading between different types of btcs in q4 we'll be looking into supporting smart contracts on layer 2. for the hackathon and there are prices we are offering for arbitrage tools uh so you could implement arbitrage purely on there too or you could also implement some sort of cross-platform arbitrage strategies between uh the swap and say a centralized exchange the other thing is you can you could possibly implement some sort of uh d5 protocol based on dk swap lb tokens so the the case of lp tokens are available on their one uh the liquidity providers they they deposit their assets on there too but they're a corresponding option on their own and this is something that you could use to build some sort of d5 here's our uh links like our official media twitter telegram discord and you can follow us on twitter to guess what official that's it thanks hello my name is daniel wang i'm the founder and ceo of blueprint welcome to this hiker song i wish everybody can enjoy this event learn something new make friends and deliver something cool uh as one of the sponsors of this event i would like to introduce luprin and our two challenges for you blueprint is a dk roll up based on layer 2 scalability solution but we are not a general purpose layer 2 we are a text specific layer tool for transfers emm swap and out book trees we also offer a smart wallet powered by social recovery so with the wallet you don't have to manage your private keys you don't have to do backups we have two challenges for you one is a front-end challenge we want to build a blockchain explorer for the principle roll up the other one is related to our cross blockchain bridge of cross layer 2 bridge i want to share a few slides with you regarding the bridge there are three small components of the of the bridge the first one is what we call a flash deposit so basically on layer one you can mint some token out of thin air and then deposit to loop ring layer two and then at the end of a layer two block you have to withdraw the same amount of token and return them to layer one to burn the second one is a bridge the bridge allows multiple users on layer 2 to transfer tokens to one single account on layer 2 and then we draw the token to layer 1 interact with d5 and then optionally return another token back to layer 2 and redistribute those tokens to users the sec the third one is the converter which is a special implementation of the bridge so that you know we can optimize the layer one footprint a little bit so these are very powerful tools that you can use to bring inter operability to blueprint so i wish again i wish everybody to have fun at this great event bregt and myself will be here to help thank you awesome so that was zika swap and loop ring and just to quickly summarize their prizes uh zk swap is giving a two thousand dollar prize for the arbitrage tool uh the best use of arbitrage tool a fifteen hundred dollar prize for an aggregator related hack and uh twenty five hundred dollars for the lending category related hack and loopering is giving about five thousand dollars in prizes and the first place gets uh 2500 second place gets 1500 and the third place gets about a thousand dollars for the best use of loopering protocols in their hack uh with that we are moving on to raiden and the graph so i'm excited for them to quickly share uh about their prizes and themselves hello everyone this is jacob from the raiding team today i'll give you a brief introduction of reading and the prizes that we have for the scaling ethereum hackathon the raid network is a payment channel network it consists of all chain channels that allow for fast transfers because we don't have to wait for the blockchain it scales linearly with the amount of users using the system it is very suitable for high frequency token transfers and in this hackathon specifically we'll focus more only mostly on the light gland so radon is a good fit for you when you want to do many frequent transfers you want instant finality on those transfers and you want to work with a simple api that lets you focus on building things so the prices and the challenges that we offer for this hackathon are two thousand euros sorry two thousand dollars in rdn for the best hack that uses the red light client sdk to power payments so this is a very broad category and if you're not entirely sure what you want to build we also have a list of ideas and inspiration that you can get from us in discord so this is probably for you if you if you have some idea that includes payments secondly we have uh two thousand dollars in rdn for the best hack that ports right into a roll up solution or sidechain so this could be putting written on optimism or putting rating on x die optimism is probably harder than putting it on x time so for this if you do extra i would also like to see some good tuning around interfaces and bridges for x-style to ethereum and the other way then there's two thousand dollars worth of rdn for the best hack that builds a new front end for that client or rebuilds the current one so we would like to see a front end that focuses very much on making it easy and simple to do payments uh in raiden for all the categories will also uh reward 500 in rgn for the runner-up submissions if you're looking for some resources inspiration and support you can find us in discord and ask whatever you want we can brainstorm some ideas together we also have a list of concrete ideas and you can check out the workshop that andre did when you want to get started building on the sdk a quick intro to the team we have andre palmer and myself and we will be uh following in discord for this hackathon and we'll be very happy to help you out if you have any questions we're here to help and lastly i just mentioned that we also have a grants program that could be relevant for continued collaboration after the hackathon that's all for me thank you very much and good luck and have fun hacking hi there my name is eva bailin and i'm director at the graph foundation for those of you who don't know the graph is the global querying and indexing layer for web 3 and querying any blockchain data at all we're so excited to be sponsoring scaling ethereum and helping you hackers build better and more sustainable applications to learn more about the graph i suggest you go to docs thegraph.com you can learn how to deploy a subgraph what a subgraph even does and even learn more about our network and how to become an indexer now we have a few bounties for this hackathon so listen up the first bounty will be one prize of 1 500 die for the best use of one of the following existing sub graphs by one of the other sponsors of this hackathon so that includes the wearable subgraph the ens subgraph the matic or polygon subgraph unit swap subgraph or the aves subgraph and again you can learn more about how to use these subgraphs by checking out our docs you can also head to the discord the graph.com discord to speak with one of the other engineers in our community that's built subgraphs before and even you know talk to other app developers who are currently querying active subgraphs the cool thing about building a subgraph is that it's you know part of an open source crowd source community and so you're contributing to the global graph of data not just using it yourself and that's also the cool thing for you as an integrator you know if you're not interested in actually building the subgraph yourself for whatever reason you can use an existing one and that means that you're reducing your own redundant back end work you don't need to set up a server database and you also don't need to maintain it but we do encourage you to build a subgraph for your use case and so that might be as simple as making aggregations just combining data between smart contracts tracking events or call data really anything to get your app functioning some of the other bounties we have are one prize of one thousand die to the best new subgraph and we also have three prizes of 1500 die each to the best new subgraph on a scaling solution that's supported by the graphs hosted service lastly we have two prizes of 250 die each for the best memes related to the graph and scaling ethereum lastly if you want to learn more about how to deploy a subgraph on an evm chain you can tune in at 4 pm eastern to see dave a blockchain engineer at edge and node and you can ask a lot of questions and just hear more about what happens behind the scenes if you want to learn more about the graph itself i'd also suggest checking out the forum so forum.thegraph.com is where you can see a lot of our ongoing community work whether that's a governance proposal for the network or maybe even information and resources around subgraph development you can also check out you know example subgraphs by heading to the graph.com explorer this is where you can literally you know find the endpoints for some existing subgraphs you can search to see what's been deployed already and you can also play around in the playground so you can test out graphql queries before committing to it if you want to learn more i'd suggest also following us on twitter where we keep up with announcements on multi-blockchain any other integrations and our progress on the network excited to see you guys hack bye so there's two awesome amazing intros from raiden and the graph and just to summarize their prizes uh raiden will be giving uh two thousand dollars in rating tokens for the litecline sdk use uh anybody who's porting to roll up or l2 with raiden will get two thousand dollars uh in rating tokens as well and a like client integration for on the front-end side with reagan will also win a two thousand dollar prize in in raiding tokens and then uh they'll also be a runner-up category for each of those uh give getting 500 dollars each and for the graph uh the best existing subgraph uh related hack will get fifteen hundred dollars and die the best new sub graph uh that gets published will get a thousand die the best new layer two sub graph that gets worked on there'll be three prizes for 1500 die and the best graph meme related submission will get to 250 die uh in prizes so with that i want to move on to our last set of our our sponsors and we'll have polygon and compound grains program uh share some of their interesting perspectives hey everyone this is muskan i lead developer relations at polygon so very excited to be here like sponsoring uh ethereum scaling hackathon and like i'm really i'm sure like all the uh hackers participating in the hackathon will definitely enjoy experiencing all the scaling solutions and building upon them because like scaling is the need of the time right now so i'm really excited i'm really excited to see like some amazing hacks uh coming out of the hackathon so yeah let's see uh so telling you like more about uh polygon so polygon is basically a a well-structured easy to use ethereum scaling uh platform so polygon which is previously matic was found in 2017 with this um hybrid pos plus a plasma kind of uh chain approach and since then we have like seen good like great amount of adoption on a pos and plasma chain so basically these chains are a commit chain to ethereum so by commenting what i mean is that every like 256 blocks the merkle root transactions to ethereum and so so by this what i what i mean is that the stains are like uh tethered to ethereum uh chain and uh like just just uh like seeing seeing like in our journey ahead like or going deeper into this uh scaling spectrum uh we realized that like there are there have been lot of like solutions coming up uh like uh ziki roll ups and optimistic roll-ups and uh some like there there might be like more solutions coming in the future uh so um there's there's no like one-size-fits-all uh scaling solution uh so uh like developers have to keep on like uh like learning about new solutions and see like which which solution will be like applicable to their kind of use case so just just like working on like seeing all these problems and working upon them so we just came up with the idea of uh polygon so polygon is basically a kind of a layer to aggregator like uh i can say like be it like zq roll ups beat optimistic roll-ups will be beat any other stand-alone chains so you will be fine you will be able to find it every uh you'll be fine everything on one uh platform so now it depends on the developer like which kind of solution that developer needs for his kind of application so if if like he is working on some nft kind of solution so there might be another like he might need another like he might need a pos kind of solution he's working on some d5 application so you might need another like optimistic roll-up kind of solution so like he'll be able to find every solution on one platform so basically polygon is a cis army knife for ethereum scaling and infra development so like of course of course this will take a little uh time to develop but right now the production ready chains are like matic pos and plasma chains which which is like uh quite of uh like which is which is well adopted chains by the ecosystem they they're right now if i say like there are like more than 200 plus applications which are um uh being developed on these pos and uh plasma chains so so i think i think you guys will also really enjoy like building on uh uh this these these chains because it's it's really simple to develop like we usually say internally that if you are an ethereum developer you already a polygon developer because all the toolings and like functionalities which are compatible with ethereum chain that are compatible with polygon as well and it's really simple to deploy you just need to change one rpc and it's done you just you don't need to like change any other things you just need to change one rpc and you're like contracts and you are and you are done that's it now now telling you about the uh bounties so um we usually like to keep it very open and like whatever you want to like build let's just just let your imagination let your imagination run while and like uh you could build anything because it's really easy it's really like cheap to experiment things with polygon because gas fees is really less so you could build anything but like there are some of the ideas which which i would like to share so you could build some like a marketplace setup using uh azura contracts and polygon any any kind of mentor to move like to mint nft is directly on polygon and nft bridge which which can be used to uh like move these entities nfts from polygon to ethereum main chain then you could like work on some like folks of uh uh the popular d5 protocols like balance or curve or any other uh protocol you you want to work upon uh next to some d5 tooling like something like healed calculators or like d5 analytics pages for uh polygon other can be uh like bridge for the fx portal uh so last is like use super fluid on matrix to build the scalable streaming money applications so yeah these are these are some of the ideas that i would like to share uh but it's quite open unless you want to work upon anything else and like uh like make a use of polygon sphere and skeleton scalability just feel uh free to do that like sky's the limit here um so like we will we will be awarding like uh 7 500 usd to hackers which are building their hackers hacks on polygon so like this is the distribution uh yeah that's that's all from my end i guess and um let's see like i'm really excited like what uh what kind of amazing hacks will come out of this ethereum scaling hackathon so really like thanks to hey everyone i'm adam from compound i'm the developer relations lead my job is to help you out with building your ethereum related development projects that include the compound protocol compound grants is sponsoring this year's scaling ethereum hackathon with eth global and if you haven't heard of compound it's a protocol for supplying and borrowing of assets on the ethereum blockchain so developers can include interest rates in their applications by using the smart contracts uh popular apps that use the compound protocol are argent and pool together exodus zurion and there's a bunch more at compound out finance developers can learn more at compound.finance docs we have method documentation for all the smart contracts api docs as well as open source code and blog posts that explain how to include the protocol in your app lots of education materials there you can also join us in discord at compound finance slash discord there's a development channel where you can ask questions and bounce ideas off the community and they'll help you out there getting started with your project so this hackathon's compound bounties will include projects that scale the compound protocol the current challenges for users are high gas fees with supply and borrow and also claiming comp as well as governance proposals and voting so projects that implement general compound protocol gas savings or zero knowledge technology or layer two will be considered for the compound bounties so you can join us again at compound.financeslash discord and uh we'll help help you out there you can chat with us and yeah we're always here to help so we're excited to be a part of scaling ethereum and we can't wait to see the creative projects that you all are working on see amazing so thank you muscon and adam those were the last two videos we wanted to share from our sponsors and just to summarize the polygon prize uh they're giving away six thousand over six thousand dollars for the best use of uh polygon and pneumatic network in the first place will get twenty five hundred it'll be two fifteen hundred dollar second place prizes and three one thousand dollar or two one thousand dollar third places uh as for compound uh we encourage you to check out the list of open bounties and ideas that are being proposed by compound grants and they're here to support this event and really get in the zone of helping out and seeing how we can make defy and compound more possible on the l2 side now of course those were some of just the sponsors that were able to share the their prizes and tell us about themselves directly but there are a handful of other ones that are also doing prizes and i'll just quickly uh give you a heads up on who they are and what's being given out by each of these companies so taurus is giving away seven point five thousand dollars in prizes ave will be giving away five thousand dollars in prizes super fluid is also giving five thousand in prizes uh both chain link and new cipher are giving five thousand dollars in prices for the best integrations for all these protocols covalent is doing three thousand dollars in prizes uh tyler is also doing three thousand dollars in prizes uh zapper is doing four point five thousand dollars in prizes one inch exchange is doing five thousand dollars in prizes the secret network is doing five thousand in prizes uh and enos integration prize is one thousand dollars in total and there's a few more sponsors that are finalizing these uh the the total numbers for their prizes so we'll update that in the prizes page and uh just so you have all this handy all of the prizes and that information with the details for what what it means to win enterprise and how you qualify and how do you use anywhere from documentation to the details of each of these protocols is available at scaling.edu global.com prizes this will take you to the info center on the prizes page and you can see all these details of two hundred thousand dollars plus in prizes they are directly
