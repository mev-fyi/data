foreign [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to autonomous Worlds the next hour is going to be talking about all the things that we're going to be doing for the next few days and let's get started you are all watching this on heathglobal.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is the platform we'll be using for most of our ceremonies where you get to interact with everybody here including myself and the speakers and put anything in the chat as well as kind of participate in any of the stuff that we'll be doing over the next few days and for anybody who signs in we'll be also giving poas or participating in this event so be sure to say hi autonomous worlds is brought to you by youth Global and if you don't know what each Global tests our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and Summits in person and online in the next few days are about hacking on autonomous worlds this is an incredible an amazing event we have nearly 400 Hackers from 51 different countries participating for the next few days from 22 different time zones we kind of put together where everybody's coming in from and it still constantly blows my mind to see people from so many different parts of the world and six different continents so I'm super excited to welcome all of you and excited to learn about what you will be building and what you're excited about on top of all of that we also have 10 amazing mentors and six incredible Partners they're going to be here with us for this entire time making sure that we get to build everything that we want to build for this event and to top it all off we'll be giving over fifty thousand dollars in prizes for building along with these autonomous worlds so I want to thank all of our six incredible Partners here especially Xerox Park lattice optimism follow coin ethereum foundation and nfd.storage they'll also be giving away some prizes and we'll cover all those prizes in just a few minutes so that's just the intro on what the event is and who everybody is participating from across the world what I want to do now is talk about what the next seven days look like we're going to cover a lot of logistics for how everything is set up and how you can make sure you get the best of everybody's help and everything you need to know to be successful for the course of this hackathon so we've been talking about all the team formation stuff how you can get help all the prizes of course how you can get direct feedback and how office hours work and then also how judging itself will work for the hackathon so let's talk about communication first this is the most important piece everything that's happening here is through Discord all 400 of you are on the Discord which was automatically connected through your hacker dashboards and you'll have all the right permissions to see everything about Justice event this is only for the people who are confirmed to participate so only the people who are actively hacking or are our mentors or our partners will be in these channels we also are hosting office hours that are live daily the entire time and there are dedicated channels to get help and ask any questions that you have about developing on mud and you can also talk to all the core devs here and all of our partners directly to make sure that you are not blocked on anything and we can help you understand how everything works and any other nuances or anything that you want to know on top of all that we've also given out all calendar invites to all of you so you should also have a direct invite into your inbox and you can choose to see what you want to part participate in based on your time zone and we really want this thing to be a synchronous which also means that anything that you are not able to attend you don't have to worry too much about because it is recorded and will be made available instantly after it ends the whole source of Truth is going to be the website and whatever the website says in terms of the schedule is what will be follow so how does this hackathon work effectively the hackathon begins now and you can start working on your projects we will have people working on teams and you can work on teams of up to five people and you have the next five days to hack every project that you're building and submitting should be using mud and keep in mind the submissions are due on Tuesday at noon eastern time that's May 23rd we'll cover a lot of this and unpack a bit of these details but this is the quick gist and you can also work individually you don't necessarily have to work on a team if you want to learn something just on your own you want to challenge yourself that is also totally okay so we have a a separate test net for all of you which has been kindly provided by the op laps team and this test net for seeing things on mud will let you uh can I experiment with things fast and also on prod effectively and this will be made available to you until June 1st the hackathon ends on the 26th which is next Friday so a few days after that this will be shut down so keep keep that in mind as you kind of built and used the the test net here and we really want it to be a place for you took experiment and interact with everything in real time this is just a really interesting concept for you to all kind of explore so this should be super fun all the details about the test Nets are on their Discord chat so just check out the Discord channels here to see how you can get started with deploying on the test net so let's get into the rules and criteria everything that you are going to be doing for the cyclathon must be done from scratch we are not going to let you work on a pre-existing project want to make sure this is fair to everybody as part of this event so you cannot extend and add features to something you've already been working on and only people who are fully confirmed from their dashboards are eligible to win any prizes which means that if you're working with a team member and they're not listed as a team member on your dashboard or they did not confirm participating in this event and you win a prize only people who are listed on the team will be given that prize and not anybody else if you have any other questions if something is broken or you realize that you're running into some bucks it's taking or confirming ping us on Discord or email or reply on naive Global TV chat we'll be happily able to address and look at anything that doesn't seem like all things are usual all right let's go into judging so submissions are due at 12 pm Eastern on Tuesday the 23rd and what does that mean it means that on your hacker dashboards I need global.com you will have to fill out the information for what you built how you built it and everything else in between in terms of what prizes you want to go for or all the specifics around how everything works under the hood for this you have to make a four minute demo of your project this keeps everything aligned so that we can make sure that everything you are doing and presenting is concise as well as if something goes wrong with a demo for our judging we have this video to play so there are no technical difficulties in any sort of demo process video submissions are required so please make sure you account for this and save some extra time to really make sure the submission is successful we really don't expect you to do this last minute so please make sure you have at least one to two hours saved for submitting your project the form itself will take you at least 30 to 45 minutes because you have to cover how something was built you have to link specifically which lines of code are being used where for what different protocols you're applying prices for and the video itself will also take you the same amount of time to really record a concise four minute video if the video is over four minutes It'll be automatically rejected on your dashboard so please make sure that you are following all the rules and giving yourself enough time to fill everything out and make your project submission successful all that again will be all on your dashboard the second you go there in the next couple of days especially over the weekend all those interfaces will become live so you can see the whole submission process and check out all the steps before the deadline now there's going to be two ways that a project will be judged it'll be a main judging which will be a live Zoom call so all the teams will come on a zoom call and they'll be demoing what they built to our judges on the 24th which is the Wednesday but if you applied for any of the prizes especially with any of our six Partners all that for judging will be asynchronous which means that all of our partners will be watching the video that you made and you submitted and they'll be reviewing that as well as the project description and your code which must be open source and if they have any questions they'll be reaching out to you directly through Discord or email or any other means that they they have to contact you and then on Friday we'll know all the information we need to tell which teams want what prizes and who are top 10 projects are from this icon so the way this would work is it's a zoom call you will also have seven minutes per team to present what you built this includes the four minute demo that will be played that you submitted and then a three minute q a will happen after that from our judges to help them understand how everything works or clarify anything that they want to know this call will happen at noon Eastern on Wednesday this is a synchronous call which means all 400 people will be on the same call so we'll have to make sure that we coordinate everything from all different time zones but this will be a single call to everybody must join and a lot of those details will be made available to you on your dashboards and over email very soon and the partners will be able to reach out directly for any of those additional questions that they have to determine who is the best recipient for the prizes that they're offering and this will be all async done directly at the partner's discretion and their time to keep it all short make sure the video is good because the more questions you can answer and the the quicker you can get to your demo and really show what you built the easier it gets for somebody to understand what you did and why which is understanding your motivations understanding the thought you put in and understanding all the complexity that was abstracted or your project so really really really buffer enough time to make your four minute video really good we have a lot of examples for you to draw from all that is available on your infocenter you can see some really good submissions and submissions that we recognize as well done from the past events and you can use all those as references to make sure that you are also successful for this occupant and now of course we want to make sure this event is open for anybody with any skill set so if you are new we have a lot of things planned for you so don't worry too much about not adding enough context there's a lot of workshops and talks here we are also doing a few sessions some of them have already started a lot of them will happen right after this intro and kickoff and don't forget that we are doing Daily Office hours and we're also hosting feedback sections for you to just kind of demo what you've been building on and get Live help from all the mud core developers all that information is also on your info center and just to repeat everything is recorded So if you miss something and you want to catch up on that later or you saw really something really interesting but you want to be able to pause that and spend more time you can just head over to youtube.com youth Global and see all the videos and all the talks and all the workshops including what I'm saying right now on demand as soon as it ends and if you're still looking for an idea or a team you can head over to find a team channel in Discord and though you can talk to other members of this event who are also looking to partner up with somebody and of course we want to know who you are and what you're excited about so don't forget to introduce yourself in the autonomous World chat and there also is going to be another session on idea brainstorming and forming other teams that's also a zoom call so you can check out all of that on the schedule and message us about anything else on Discord and as I mentioned before it is totally okay to be able to hack solo you don't have to work on a team but if you are working on a team or you're looking for somebody to offset a skill set that you wish you had to make your project successful you can use those channels to find somebody that you want to work with and on your dashboards you also have this tool that lets anybody who opted in find other team members with specific skill sets if you're looking for somebody with solidity background or design or front-end or back-end you can build opt-in to this tool and search and find other members as part of this hackathon looking to join a team or looking to add somebody to their team based on a different skill so check this out on your team page on your dashboard and office hours and how you can get help is all also set up to make sure that you are successful building on top of mud so the office hours will happen twice daily all this will happen on Discord this will be a Discord call and you can also there get direct feedback and help and really anything you need to know to make sure everything is successful during this event there's also a specific Forum channel to be able to ask questions and have more longer discussions instead of a real-time chat so you can use the might help Forum channel to have larger conversations about your project or anything you want to understand better these sessions are happening from 1 pm to 3 P.M this is the feedback session specifically on Saturday which is two days from now and this will be a way for you to get direct feedback from the team to Showcase what you've built so far and how you can make that project even better and I also want to talk about our code of conduct this is a an event that also follows all of our rules and code of conduct from youth Global you can check out all the specific details by heading over to youth global.com rules but the gist of it is that please be respectful for everybody in this community and as part of this event harassment and abuse if any phone will not be tolerated and you will be kicked out at band and anything that you build as part of this event is solely owned by you in terms of intellectual property of your work and nobody else and if you have any other questions or anything we didn't cover here feel free to ask those questions either on the chat or message us on Discord or reach out to us on email and anybody on the ethical team will be happy to answer any of those questions for you and if you get in case you want to get to this event quickly to understand what the schedule looks like when judging gays how do we normalize that based on your own time zone because we're keeping everything in Eastern time you can just head over to Keith global.com autonomous and check out all the information here about this event directly on this website so let's quickly talk about all the prizes to really make sure that you are able to score some amazing gets here um Xerox Park is going to be giving away a lot of money this is five thousand dollars and they will be awarding this prize the first second and third for the best use of advanced cryptography applied to an autonomous world and mud so any theme that qualifies for this and is applying any advanced cryptography can submit and select this on their submission form and zero export team will be evaluating this prize similarly next up is lattice in the most creative views in mud will be getting five thousand dollars in total in first second in third place where first place gets twenty five hundred dollars second place gets 1500 and the list will be getting one thousand dollars for the best on-chain experience using mud then we have optimism so anything that mods the op stack and supercharges mud will be getting ten thousand dollars and then for the first team will get five thousand the second place will get three thousand and the third place will get two thousand dollars for the best hack that supercharges mud using the op stock and we have nft.storage so any time you use anything on the decentralized side of nft.stories the top 10 teams will receive 500 in file coin tokens and this is restoring a lot of that information on chain and using nft.storage I largely just skimmed over what these prizes are in terms of amounts but there's a lot more detail here and if you head over to youth global.com autonomous you will be able to go to the price section there where you can see specific details for what qualifies documentation links to their workshop an intro video about how the protocols and sdks work and specifically a lot more documentation and how you can qualify for these different prizes all that is on the price section on the website which you can head over to by going on nevglobal.com autonomous and finally I want to make sure that you pace yourself for the next few days we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you I know that five days is not a lot of time but it's still enough time to try something really cool and creative and use mud and built on top of these autonomous worlds we really want you to have fun here and this is very much about experience experimentation and learning you want to use this opportunity and this event to really make the sdks better and make this even better for you to build on in the future so a lot of it is about feedback on both sides and just seeing what cool things that everybody here comes up with so that's it on all of the logistics and we also want to take the time here to tell you about what can be possible with autonomous worlds and to do that I want to bring on ludens and albarius to really share what's possible here and get all of you all excited to make the next five days amazing and memorable so without further Ado please welcome Student Center various hey folks take it away can yeah let's go my slides are on okay hello guys welcome to the autonomous for hackathon my name is ludens I'm one of the co-founder of lattice we made mud in opcraft and I want to take some time to go through a couple of slides to put you in a generative mindset in a mindset where you can come up with interesting ideas that push the envelope of ethereum so this hackathon is about like pushing the envelope of multiplayer games performance art storytelling with ethereum and using onshine computation as a fundamentally New Media and when the status quo right now is when building on top of ethereum people usually tend to stick with the ideas that are wrong and successful EFI nfts and overall just financialization we can say that ethereum is proven to be quite good at creating system where the key verb is owning you know in most on-chain applications you own stuff and even for supposedly playful applications most gaming and art projects are skins on top of financialized applications so we believe that ethereum can be the world computer the computer for worlds not just the financial computer so for this hackathon we invite hackers to build mind expanding applications on ethereum let's get some of that 2016 craziness back you know when people were doing insane stuff on top of ethereum and like my question to you is what if we were in a world where the verbs and ethereum go beyond boning so come in and let's explore the concept of autonomous word together over the next five days um and so first I want to give a short history of digital worlds and the key technologies that have impacted the relationship with them I believe it's going to make it a little bit easier to come up with great ideas for this event so following tribal songs and books the first technology that fundamentally changed our perception of Worlds is personal computing personal Computing a lot early game devs to sculpt single-player worlds in which isolated individuals could immerse themselves in the rule-based structure of a text Adventure a first person shooter or even an epic strategy game and then came ethernet and later the internet and network computing a lot for these previously private interactive experiences to be expanded into multiplayer worlds you know things like server-based multi-user Dungeons mods and massively multiplayer online games whose Dynamic unfolding was no longer based on the participation of a single person it actually went from like 1 to n and we think that the arrival of unchain Computing brings something rather new things are about to change it's not about making skeuomorphic new things it's not about taking things that were enabled by network computing and putting them on chain we think that the possibility of autonomous worlds so multi-author maximally persistent worlds that can not only be experienced by multiple inhabitants but also expanded by them is something that is fundamentally enabled by blockchains and the unique affordances of these worlds can be glimpsed in early experiments with on-chain games with projects like Dark Forest op craft and others we have seen quite crazy emergence that was unheard of In traditional games for such a small player base it's almost as if these worlds can't help but be composable in emergence so we think the full potential of autonomous words very much remains to be realized and so we invite you to build games tooling narratives that test what you see as the fullest possible expression of what an autonomous word can be and remember these are not just worlds that happens to exist on chain it's not about swapping your backend from C plus plus to e v m so building words that could not exist otherwise how are you going to surface up the texture of ethereum how are you going to build the worlds that are uniquely enabled by this new type of computing and I I want to give a few pieces of advice um feel free to take them seriously or not it might actually be even more fun if you take them not seriously at all and and kind of like do the opposite the first one is have a very liberal interpretation of what a world is doesn't have to be a virtual world it doesn't have to even look like a world the physique of your world doesn't even need to resemble our universe world is just a coherent system of entities and Rule set for how to behave it can be a story it can be a game can be a set of physics be wild and expensive build the world first before building fancy tool on tops That's a classic you have an idea for a really crazy I don't know management system you can build on top of a world where multiple players have to a computer goal I'd recommend building the world first this is very different from a traditional ethereum hackathon where you're going to plug into a dozen defy and nft projects you start tabula rasa you start from scratch what physics will you create this is one of the reason we give you a fresh chain so you don't have anything else you have to build an application that stand on its own put it on chain one of the reason again one of the reasons we have a fresh chain with almost no tooling or external Services is that we encourage you to do everything on chain mud is going to make this easy for you be a maximalist don't care about gas cost live in the future and the last one here is explore composable engineering how can others build on top of your world exploit the fact that mud allows other people to expand your project by adding logic and state and ask your friends to build something on top of your world during the hackathon and if you have no friends do it yourself without using any form of privilege access that's one like this is some of the craziest thing we saw in dark first in opcraft were about composable engineering people coming in and expanding the world this is one of the unique opportunity you get by building something on top of ethereum which is a multiplayer computer and before I I hand it off to El various I want to go through four fundamental tensions of Worlds and how it can help you come up with great ideas for for a few days and for the next few days where you'll be hacking here so the first tension is controller versus autonomy right your world can be either fully autonomous and permissionless and treat everybody the same or it can enshrine a certain group as Gods will you let AIS join your world are you going to use proof of humanity to give advantages to humans will you explore NPCs automata on-chain life form what even are the relationship of control within your world the key phrase here would be if you love something let it go an extension is hidden Truth Versus agnosticism will your world be client agnostic or different representations of the world can coexist and will be valid or were you enshrine a specific truth will you explore concealed information ZK front-end development as an intake an integral part of existing within your world the key phrase here would be mini truths can coexist the next tension is stagnation versus composability will your world have a fixed rule set where you turn off permissionless composability in your mod setup or will you explore rules and additions visual programming user generated logic or even engineering as gameplay third-prest had its astral Colossus puppy craft its supreme leader what will be your composable surprise the key phrase here would be replace the rules with your own and the last tension I'm going to look for is entropy versus persistence will your word periodically die in reset or will it last as long as the chain runs which in our case is only two weeks but imagine it runs forever when you force your own diegetic version of State rent where plants grow on runes and storage slots in your smart contracts Fade Out and die is your world about renewal or conservation the key phrase here would be some things are meant to be forgotten so I hope these were helpful and I'll pass it to alvarius who is going to tell you more about mat2 the technology you'll be using to bring worlds into existence all right hello everybody I'm not sure if you can see my slides already there we go right all right there we go cool yeah so I'm here to tell you a tiny little bit about mutt which is the the framework that you should use if you want to make your life easier over the next couple of days we started building on mud after having years after having worked on a couple of other projects for a couple of years which is uh among them is Dark Forest and Ember and for these projects there was no framework yet that exists and so we had to build everything from scratch we had to build our own network stack where to build our own State sync we had to build our own indexer and we had to build our own plugin systems and out of frustration from having to build all of these low-level things from scratch for every every single game that we worked on we build mods as a way to abstract all of these loadable complexities away so that then once this framework exists we can just focus on the features and the games that we wanted to build and it worked for okay craft that we built last year using month it only took us one to two months to build it instead of one to two years as with the projects we worked on before and since then there have been a bunch of other products that have also been built with mutts and launched with mud among them are words 3 LP craft as I mentioned Sky stripe Asphodel Museum Heist Moving Castle just to name a few and then in the beginning of this year we took all the learnings we had from building mod 1 and also from building with mud and we builtman 2 which is a much more General and more powerful more extendable and more gas efficient version of the framework and if you're familiar with Mod 1 and you're still skeptical about upgrading too much too I can I can guarantee you that everybody else who is familiar with Mod 1 and Trident mod 2 has this feedback for us um about this is so much better than that one so I can guarantee you you're gonna love it and during this hackathon we want to explore autonomous world and we don't want to be held back by having to sync Network stack issues and whatever and so we made your life much easier with all of these templates that we prepared for you we have a mods vanilla template which is map plus vanilla vanilla typescript we have a mod react template and we have a mud phaser template we have office hours every day at 3 pm at 3 A.M eastern time and 3 P.M eastern time and we have a bunch of workshops three of them happening today and I would strongly recommend you joining them if you want to get a quick start format and we have the mud 101 starting basically right after this at 1 30 PM ET we have mud reacts today at 3 pm ET and we have a tutorial for how to build a 2d game with mod and phaser today at 5 PM ET and then tomorrow at 1pm ET we have a workshop with Mutt and unity and that's all the information I have for you at this point and all this left to say is Go Wild amazing thank you lewd and Sal various this helps us really get a big brief overview on what would be possible and we can't wait to see what all of you built and I'll just quickly before we end all right a handful of things that just covered so just to quickly tell you all what the next workshops are today and tomorrow mud 101 which is how you can get started with your first ever with bonus World from avarius will be happening in exactly 55 minutes and you'll be able to see where by checking your calendar and your hacker dashboard to see the zoom lick then how you build with mud and react will be taking place one and a half hours after that by kushaba and then Jason will be covering how is your knowledge machine learning with easy KL can be used to also integrate into any of your projects and then an hour after that will be how you build your 2D game with Mutt and phaser from kashada as well and then tomorrow will be another workshop on how you build a 3D World with mud and unity and that will take place at 1 30 PM Eastern on Saturday so that is all the workshops all this will be recorded so don't worry too much if you are not able to make something you can watch and instantly play any of these things immediately and that takes care of all of our Logistics I want to thank everybody who tuned in and wish all of you happy hacking and we'll see all 400 of you on Discord that's eveglobal.com Discord and we'll see what you built this Tuesday take care everybody goodbye are everybody goodbye
