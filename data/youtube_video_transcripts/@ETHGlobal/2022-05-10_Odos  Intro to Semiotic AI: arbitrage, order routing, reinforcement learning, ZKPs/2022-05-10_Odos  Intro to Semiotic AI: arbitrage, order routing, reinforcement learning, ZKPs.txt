great and we are live so i have sam here from semiotic ai he's going to give you an intro into their technology today and if you have any questions in the meantime feel free to pop them in the chat and we can answer them towards the end sam i'll let you take the stage thanks richie uh yeah so uh hi everybody um today today i'm going to be talking about uh similac ai we are uh also the creators of odos.xyz we're sponsoring uh we're sponsoring a prize for the hackathon and really my goal for today is to tell you a little bit about our company and some of the things that we're working on some of the job job opportunities that we have and then also how odos was born and like which he said if you have questions i have the chat window open so i'll see them um and uh i can i'll respond to them actually my chat wouldn't have disappeared uh so yeah i'll also ask for for uh questions at the end if i don't secure chat okay so semiotic was founded about two years ago and our initial focus was on fully homomorphic encryption and fhe lets you compute directly on the encrypted data so for example you could encrypt two numbers a and then encrypt b separately and then you could send it to an untrusted cloud provider and they could then add a and b or do whatever they want a and b only you can do the results so with that work we were funded through the us national science foundation and herpa but we weren't really getting other traction outside of of the government funding so a year into the company we pivoted into web three and uh now uh so then our pivot was to work with the graph and uh we we worked closely with the graph for uh most of the year last year and then by the end of the year we got a core dev a grant with a graph so now we're one of the one of the five core dev teams working with the graph and we're also the creators of western gate which i will introduce it's an arbitrage measurement uh project it was actually created through each global about a a year ago in june through a hackathon and we still maintain it because we're we think it's interesting and then through western gate so western gate is an arbitrage measurement website and we after westerngate it was we created odos which is a related tool for making swaps it's a dex aggregator and so i think a lot of people uh uh each global is famous for basically a lot of projects or hackathons that that are worked on in eighth global end up turning into products a lot of times so we were i'm a big fan of youth global and and this hackathon and hackathons that they run so i am sam green i am the head of research at semiotic my academic background is in computer science and i have a focus on reinforcement learning which is basically a class of ai algorithms that that uses trial and error learning that's how deepmind won or built a bot that solved quote unquote the game of go and if you if you want to if you want to uh follow me on social media i'm on twitter at xerox sam green okay so i'm going to tell you a little bit about the graph i i don't know um if the graph is also sponsoring if global i assume that that they are but yeah like i said earlier we're one of the uh the core devs uh in the graph and the the goal of the graph is to make uh giving access to blockchain data easy and the graph is a decentralized web3 protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data and i'm going to show you what it looks like what using the graph looks like so here this is a website this graphql online it's a it's an explorer for for graph data it's it's just an open source it allows you to actually uh interact with any graphql endpoint uh by the way graphql there is some kind of initially a lot of people who aren't familiar with graphql get confused about graphql and the graph graphql was invented by facebook as a query language that was easy to use and it's now used by many different companies and many different projects it just so happens the graph also uses graphql so graphql is a graphql endpoint so anybody who has a publicly accessible graph to an endpoint you can explore the endpoint with graphql uh and so here is the graphs uh mainnet endpoint and so really we're using the graph to look at participants on the graph like i said the graph is a decentralized service so there are many different people different users using it so here's an example of looking at the graph's data with graph eql and what i'm doing here is this is this is a graphql query if you've never seen one and what i'm doing here is i'm looking for the first 10 indexers and i'm ordering those 10 indexers by how much stake they have and i'm getting it in descending order and so here you can see here's the result graph graphql that makes it really easy for you to get data and that's why the graph is really popular for building dabs because you can just query this and then you can show it to your users and your dabs related to the graph we have the graph day coming up on june 2nd in san francisco uh the uh i think that there are still uh so so we have a graph down june 2nd and there's gonna be a bunch of protocols not just the graph uh talking on that day and then there's a hackathon on june 3 through 5 and i'm not sure but i there there were travel scholarships uh that were being uh uh that were uh available i'm not sure if there are still any available or not if you're around the bay area then ticket prices um ticket prices were just dropped to a hundred dollars for craft day and if you paid more than a hundred dollars you can you'll automatically get refunded uh for whatever you paid for your initial tickets okay so uh semiotic uh going into this our uh sorry our core expertise one of the areas of our core expertise is reinforcement learning and within the graph protocol we've we've done a bunch of rl related activities one of them is we we made reinforcement learning agents for optimal bidding so in the graph protocol it's a data data market where you have buyers and sellers of data this is part of the decentralized aspect there is no centralized service that's setting the price of data it's the it's all participants in the market that are choosing how much they're going to sell the data for and how much they'll buy it for and this animation you see right here was one of our early experiments um actually i have i'm gonna i'm gonna explain how it works uh or i'm gonna i'll show you this this video and then i'll explain what you're seeing um what on the uh on this bottom plot we are seeing that uh the we're looking at how much the reward of the agent is getting so an agent is basically being trained over time in this video and what you want to see in rl is you're always trying to maximize rewards and so what we're seeing is that during training the rewards of the agent this is for consumer agents so the reward is going up because the consumer is learning to maximize what it cares about and we can see that the error bar is that's the standard deviation for each training time step and we can see that as time goes on the agent is doing better and better and what is it learning to do well it's learning to make a bid that maximizes its reward in this case the reward is balanced between how much it's paying and the performance of the requests that it's getting so basically the latency that it's getting and so you can see that it's learning to make a bid that's more and more optimal over time by trying various uh various bids and so these various bids are represented its bidding strategy is represented by this gaussian distribution and the gaussian gets tighter and tighter around a certain price point and so it becomes more and more confident so that's that's an example of using with this rl agent you could then deploy this something like this onto mainnet and you could allow this thing to work on behalf of users on mainnet so that they can learn to optimize their price and performance we've also implemented our algorithms for automatic two-party negotiation so imagine you wanted to allow uh a consumer and indexer to agree on let's say equality of service we did some very early uh experiments on that line we haven't solved the quality of service negotiation yet but we did some interesting things we've also this is actually related optimization and not rl we've built a portfolio optimizer tool for indexers so indexers have a a really difficult uh resource allocation problem where they have to basically uh stake or allocate their tokens to the sub graphs for the data they want to serve and so for example a subgraph unit swap would have a sub graph live peer has its own sub sub graph uh pulled together has its own subgraph all dapps have their own sub and indexers have to basically stake tokens to serve data on that subgraph it's a very difficult problem because they're also trying to maximize rewards indexes are maximizing rewards and so we solved the math problem for indexers now they have a tool that makes it easy for them so we are um we are currently going to be especially so especially starting next year we're going to be growing more of the team on ml side for the graph and in particular we're going to be uh doing a lot more multi-agent reinforcement learning so you have you have two or more agents that need to learn how to either compete or cooperate and if you're interested in these in these sorts of roles please get in touch and uh yeah we're doing some interesting things it's not just on the algorithm side we're also doing a bunch of ml ops so how do you how do you run a bunch of complex simulators in parallel and how do you collect all the data in parallel um there's a lot of devops sort of flavored uh work that we're doing too and on this topic uh we have a workshop called wendy workshop on mechanism validation dot dev we we just ran that in amsterdam and the next one is going to be in pagoda colombia and we're going to co-locate it i think it's called blockchain week it's going to be co-lo located with a devcon so it'll either be the week blockchain week is either the week before or after devcon so we're gonna run a workshop there okay so we also do a lot a half of our team actually about a third of our team is doing reinforcement learning and ml related activities another third of the team uh is doing zero knowledge proof work this kind of this stems from the fact that we were originally a cryptography company so we still have a lot of cryptography expertise in-house and currently what we're building is a system called roadrunner which is a payment channel solution for the graph it's going to allow for these massive massively parallel payments to be tracked through uh for all of the consumers and indexers and it's going to it's going to save money for all all the users in the graph for for making payments and related to that we we collaborate closely with edge and node they've been working on working toward a zkp based payment as solution for several years and we're also working with a famous zkp professor at georgetown and if you have interest in zkp the best introduction to zkp and snarks is this url justin has a book on the topic and the book is intended to take you from nothing to understanding uh being able to understand the academic literature it's not an easy it's not like a it's not a trivial book to read but it's a very accessible book to to enter into this space especially compared to other uh approaches i've seen on trying to teach you this stuff and related to uh the roadrunner work we we have uh we're looking for someone who um knows both rust and cryptography uh basically uh to work with the cryptography team to be able to implement the roadrunner and all the they're going to be other uh systems that we're going to be building based on zkp within the graph after our payment channels solution is released okay so now we're gonna we're gonna transition into arbitrage measuring arbitrage uh our product that came out of this topic and a few ideas for the hackathon so our arbitrage is a simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in different markets in order to profit and differences in the assets listed price it exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms so arbitrage i'm sure well you you probably heard of it before um it's it uh it's very common the type of arbitrage we're doing most often exists in the foreign exchange markets and uh so for foreign currency uh but the those markets are so efficient that there is typically uh almost there's there's only pennies typically of arbitrage and crypto markets are not yet efficient markets and so you you actually have we have much more arbitrage that exists in in crypto markets and um the the caveat is that uh there's a lot just as in traditional markets there are still there's still a lot of competition in crypto markets to capture arbitrage because uh well i'll get into why the the paper that got us going down this or the paper that got me interested in arbitrage was an analysis of uniswap markets it is it is a very nice paper that explains how to calculate the optimal arbitrage conditions uh on uh on ethereum or other uh or other evm or other uh blockchains that have smart contract languages and uh yeah so i read this paper i came across it on the the zero knowledge podcast uh through an interview with one of the authors and this got me and then the rest of the team interested in this topic we we then um we then took the paper some of the algorithms or one of the algorithms given in the paper that um yeah that explains how to calculate optimal arbitrage conditions and just for fun for eth global we decided to build this westerngate.xyz website and the whole the whole point oh thank you for thank you for posting the the link to the book in the chat um yeah so the whole point of the western gate website was to measure arbitrage and the novelty uh at the time for western gate and maybe even still today was that we not only measured single chain arbitrage specifically arbitrage that existed only on ethereum or only on polygon or bse we also measure cross-chain arbitrage so arbitrage that exists across chains i'll show you in the next slide an example of that um the single chain arbitrage it's these are all classically called triangle arbitrages because the simplest arbit uh arbitrage uh the simplest arbitrage would be in this case would be uh going from token a to token b and then back to token a so let me walk you through what's going on here we had if you so yesterday there as many of you probably know there was a lot of chaos in the market and anytime there's chaos in the market if you go to western gate you can that chaos is always reflected at western gate it's always reflected in the amount of arbitrage that you see across these chains because there's so much volatility happening pools get out of balance um and so here we saw that if you would input about 68 000 uh wrapped matic in the quick swap and swapped it with their wrapped heath pool which you would have gotten about 24 each out and then you would have swapped that each for usdc also on quips quick swap all x all this is actually a quick swap and then you swap that usdc for matic you could you can see that these that you would have received uh about a thousand more matic this was on polygon so this was on the polygon chain and yeah so here you can see even though we're only interacting with quick swap we're but we're dealing with three different pools the matic eath pool the et usd pool and the usd to the matic pool these uh the matic was out of balance the value of matic was out of balance between these these two pools and this is how we were able to capture it um so here's an example of cross chain arbitrage so what if with a cross chain arbitrage or actually more generally it's called cross domain arbitrage um what if if you would have swapped on ethereum so here's this is a 600 arbitrage if you would have swapped 47 000 uh die on ethereum using sushi swap if you would have swapped it for eth and then if you were to swap that eath to rat btc uh also on sushi swap and and simultaneously on polygon if you would have swapped this amount the same amount of wrapped btc uh for eath and then eat to die you can see that we would have ended up with more dye on polygon than on ethereum okay so this this sort of arbitrage on western gate when you see this sort of arbitrage what's oh what's interesting to me is that the arbitrage always sticks around longer and why is that well we don't have a way if you're on single training we have ways to do atomic swaps using flat and you can use flash loans to capture this type type of arbitrage you can do all this arbitrage in a single transaction of course you have to have a smart contract that has these sorts of capabilities um but you could have single transaction which lets you take a flash loan to get this matic okay so it's it's capital free arbitrage but on cross chain arbitrage how would you capture this well you would have to have pools or reserves of for this one die on ethereum and you'd have to have reserves of rat ptc on polygon and it's it's not atomic so it's not guaranteed that it's going to it's going to succeed a lot of times i call this probabilistic arbitrage because things could happen so that one side you can make your smart contracts such that this entire transaction will either succeed or fail meaning if you don't get 48 344 die out you can make a contract bail out and so you only pay the cost of gas so you're not stuck left holding any anything uh because because it fails however it's possible that this thing this it's possible that one side of the arbitrage succeeds and the other fails so it's harder it's harder for you you may be left with btc on one side and actually may be left holding all of this btc too because this transaction failed so it's harder to capture and it sticks around longer on western so with uh with western gate uh we became we became really interested in this topic actually other people found it interesting too if you search for vitalik's end game blog post he published it at uh the end of last year you'll see western gate is highlighted in the in his endgame uh podca uh blog post and uh because no we had nobody had built anything like this before so we became really interested kind of obsessed with arbitrage i think everybody does who digs into it i think this this topic is a great entry point i've talked to so many founders uh uh so i think it's a great entry point into crypto because it's just fascinating and i talked to so many founders that now have businesses uh doing other other things not related arbitrage just because they got fascinated by the topic so we actually came up with we're math people we came up with a better um optimization algorithm than what's commonly used for calculating arbitrage it just so happens that the uh the math that you need to calculate arbitrage uh is also what you need to calculate optimal trading so we we then uh we then created a new tool called odos xyz here's a screenshot of a new feature that we're going to be rolling out within i don't know sometime very soon and this new feature lets you let's say you have a bunch of it lets you swap from multiple tokens to a single token so let's say that you have a bunch of you have comp wrap teeth ave matic all in your wallet and you'd like to make a single swap for another token in this case grt and if you do these individually you'd have to pay four separate transactions and you'd have to pay the gas our algorithm can solve uh the it can solve all of the optimal swaps to get you the most grt given that you want to take those input tokens and it costs you less gas than doing them individually so you can also do single swap it's a it's a dexa aggregator uh you can also do single swap single token trades with it okay so we're still interested in arbitrage uh there is a website um identify to io thank you franz for pointing that out uh they've done a lot of work on this project it's pretty pretty nice tool i'd recommend checking it out and we're we're still we're interested in cross-chain arbitrage across domain arbitrage specifically what we don't know with western gate i should have said is we don't know who's capturing all we can tell is hey there is this arbitrage opportunity but we know you will learn and you'll learn quickly if you look into this field people are capturing us all of us are arbitraged especially single chain arbitrage but western gate's not about measuring how it was captured it just says hey there's some imbalances in these pools um this is interesting and an extension would be who's capturing this stuff um especially this this multi-chain cross-chain arbitrage so this would be a hackathon idea really this hackathon idea we're not looking for you to extend uh extend odos necessarily where you know we're really just uh although with otos we're still interested in potential future opportunities around cross chain arbitrage which is uh you know one of the reasons that we're suggesting that uh you look into it but even for your own sake we think looking into it is going to be we think it's a worthwhile uh learning exercise and something fun and people you'll get a lot of interest from other people on this topic well we're also interested in nft ideas are there any uh western gate you know there are a lot of there's a lot of markets being built on top of nfts is there anything like western gate where we can measure uh arbitrage with nfts i don't know this is just a wild idea and uh finally if you're into uh high performance computing or optimization we have needs at odos for optimizing our uh are all of our uh infrastructure related to the solving optimal training and that's it thanks for uh thanks for attending thanks to sun time does anybody have any questions maybe we can take one um i have a question to odors sure so um from my understanding i thought it was like uh let's say it's like a transaction aggregator right yes so who would be the the typical user because uh i could imagine a consumer may have multiple tokens and want to change it to let's say west or something but um is it more something for uh larger exchanges or yeah thanks for asking franz uh so this is a it's a dex aggregator it's similar to one inch uh even if you have a single token that you want to trade it will pull the liquidity across all available dexes so right now available means that we can integrate these dexes into our optimization algorithm so currently we we pull all the liquid we pull liquidity across 30 uh different indexes and we find the your your optimal trade to get from token a to token b now if you're in this case i have a bunch of tokens that i've input but that's just a new feature the reason i'm flexing this is that there are there's no other dex or dex aggregator that can go from multiple tokens to one token so that's a that's that's a that's a feature of of our optimization algorithm that we're able to efficiently do that but you can just do one to one once token a to token b like you normally do with unit squad or one inch and yeah if anyone here in the chat is taking part in the hackathon and looking to join a arbitrage project i'm super down to partner yeah i and i recommend collaborating with france i've uh i've done some hacking with him in the past thank you great we just got a few questions and sam do you have time to take them or we can take it over discord yeah uh yeah i think um i i have time to take them uh if you want to spend one or two more okay so does the engine you made include tx cost or the bridging of tokens between no so a western gate our hackathon project does not include tx costs into this into the calculation it it simply solves uh kind of the more abstract problem looking across these token pools um yeah and and the cost of bridging so bridging actually i so bridging yeah is going to have to be you're gonna have to have reserves in this case you would have to have reserves to die in wptc and to actually make this a practical thing uh in my opinion you'd have to have pools uh in this case of dying btc and these pools would have to be occasionally rebalanced and these rebalancing uh efforts are gonna have bridging uh costs associated with them so that this doesn't take that into account thanks for that question how long do the arbitrage opportunities typically last uh actually um go to westerngate.xyz and you will see so today it's pretty quiet i know the markets are quiet today because i looked at westerngate.xyz and i saw that there was almost no arbitrage available and and when that's the case yeah i just know things are quiet and but that being said you'll always see small amounts of arbitrage and you'll see just check it out you'll see it disappearing quickly um okay i think okay i think just because we're at time i'm gonna go discord uh today i'll check discord and or throughout the hackathon we'll be watching discord and you can ask ask questions there thanks everybody for attending thanks sam thanks everyone see ya next one [Music]
