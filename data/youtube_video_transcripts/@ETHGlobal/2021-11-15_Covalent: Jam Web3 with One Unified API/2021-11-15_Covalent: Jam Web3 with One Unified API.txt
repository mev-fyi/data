hello everyone um good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you are in the world um thanks so much for joining us today for uh the covalent workshop hosted by lei and harish um namely the um give me one second so so excited to have you join us for the jam week free with one unified api workshop um so now let's pass the mic off to lay in harish and have them introduce themselves and get the workshop going hi my name is lay i do api marketing at covalent um excited to be here today and be part of a web 3 jam cool title for this thing love it uh harish to you yeah um hello everyone uh my name is harish i look after developer relations at covalent and again we've uh been part of the uh the youth global um sort of circuit for hackathons over the past half year and it's been really exciting a for just seeing what comes out of these these um these events just always blows our mind uh and be just the opportunity to interact with the you know a wide uh diverse group of developers it's uh it's definitely an exciting thing for us um covalent you know itself came out of a hackathon so we're very passionate about not only supporting and promoting but also just you know actively contributing as much as we can yeah um so i'm going to be giving a little bit of a walkthrough of covalent and our unified api um and i'll get started [Music] okay should be able to see um so yeah this is us uh welcome to jam one three with one unified api before we get started i just want to mention we've been doing something new where at covalent we host a lot of presentations where afterwards we'll have a little quiz that you can take to kind of like recap things and if you get questions right you get a co-app like one of those little proof of attendance nfts um so we'll post that after if you if you're interested uh yeah so just a little bit of background first about kind of like where covalent is and how we fit in the crypto stack um so crypto adoption is still very much on the upswing i know we've been kind of in this bull market for a little while now but as you can see kind of like from the past few years um it's really just this year where we're seeing big names like visa paypal nba stuff like that get into crypto and nfts um and basically the stage that we're at we still need so much more infrastructure in order to be able to support mass adoption so if you look at the adoption technology graph on the right you can kind of see like the insane growth of some of these innovations in the past and where we are like right over there at the bottom corner so a lot of work still needs to be done um and that's kind of what we're working towards at covalent is providing that data layer that can power the infrastructure of web3 so our vision we kind of like to do this exercise of five years into the future what do we see for this world that we're in right now um so we see a multi-chain feature for sure that's a really critical component for us millions of pieces of blockchain uh millions of data points on the blockchain and basically in order to have all of these users have a seamless experience you need a good way to get that data out and to be able to query it really fast so part of that is interoperability um and basically applications that can be used across multiple different chains that have a really user friendly experience so hackathons like this are a really good way to um to see what kind of innovation is coming out right now from some of the best minds here um and to see like basically how we can support more people being onboarded from web 2 into web3 um so as i mentioned data opera interoperability is a really critical component of adoption um basically what that means is like the ability to actually transfer information use it across different platforms in an easy and understandable way and that's something that we think is still sort of a struggle with blockchain in general so for reference like the read component is kind of what we're working on the right component of blockchains like writing to the blockchain is kind of solid in that people really understand code across the world it's something that's like established that people conform to a certain standard but extracting the data in a way that is homogeneous across different chains and easy to understand is kind of a problem that still exists and that's sort of what we're working on so the blockchain data itself is disorganized it's difficult to understand um it's expensive it's complicated it's kind of just a pain to work with um so what we want is to simplify that read experience and basically make it easier for people to query uh blockchain data to build faster and then to switch those builds between different chains so to show you better um it kind of helps to explain where we fit in the crypto stack so you can see blockchains at the top that's where all of the code is written into the blockchain and then you have nodes and nodes are basically like your window to to seeing that on chain activity and to extracting that data that's the part that's kind of messy and complicated a lot of the time so covalent is a middleware solution basically uh we do that for you like we take care of this we fully index like a full copy of the blockchain we have currently 18 different blockchains that we index um and then we host all of the on-chain data in a database which you can query with the use of our unified api and if you want um the part that's special about the unified api is that you can just change little parameters um like the chain id for instance that will apply your project across the completely different blockchain so that's kind of where the interoperability comes in in terms of applications there's really like a whole bunch of different use cases we like to say one billion possibilities because i think we don't even know a lot of what's possible yet but some of the common ones are like nft galleries um consumer apps analysts really like this because it's fast and easy and we we have like tabular responses supported so you can make charts and dashboards and like multi-chain insights um and then on an individual level too like crypto taxes are something that i think are often overlooked being able to like query your own historical balances and your own transactions so that's a pretty common use case for us as well and then you have the users on top of applications and that is who's ultimately going to change the world so we need to create a good experience for users uh in order to have more people experience the the benefits and the awesomeness of this space so currently we have about over 15 000 developers and over 300 projects built with the covalent api this is kind of anywhere from like big names some of which you might recognize on the website and then anyone that builds projects at hackathons like these because it's free to sign up for an api key so uh that we know of we're in more than 17 countries but i think that number's always changing it's actually like pretty hard to even tell at this point since uh yeah we could definitely do a better job like tracking who's actually using this because it's just very accessible at this point um but yeah you can check our website to kind of see if you want that that social proof a little bit of like coin echo zapper ave some more close partners um so for this hackathon in particular we're offering a oops there we go four thousand dollars usdt uh and some of the project ideas i'll go over and we'll do a little bit of a showcase to kind of show you um examples that we've seen in the past but these are all things that are really easy to build with our api specifically they kind of cater to the functions that make it fast and multi-change so dex and dao analytics dashboards for instance are pretty like they're pretty in high demand like all the time so basically different decks is when i really understand their users and like what's happening on their platforms and on the rise you've definitely seen more dow analytics dashboards too um because people want to like it's that proof of identity kind of concept to see like which dows you're participating in um yeah so and nft storefronts and marketplaces um we've seen some super cool nft marketplaces like 3d galleries that you can walk through that showcase your art so our our api supports um like all of the nft metadata and then you can find the url that like shows you that entire nft which i'll show a little bit later uh multi-chain themed crypto wallets blockchain explorers multichain asset trackers all of that good stuff if you want more project ideas i'll show you our docs later which kind of it highlights some of the past builds um and it's a good place for inspiration uh but yeah we judge the projects based on kind of like the creativity how well you're able to make full use of our different endpoints um and if you want more information on that it'll be on the the like prize info page of web3 jam under equipment so um as you can see it's just important keep in mind these are just uh you know high level ideas we've seen all sorts of interesting stuff uh well beyond um the subset of ideas that we present so let your let your creativity just run wild here that's the uh the the name of this uh this uh hackathon so uh don't don't be limited by what you see here this is just the uh you know the high level subset of ideas to start from yeah jam web web 3 jam is all like sounds sounds very coming together to create cool new stuff um so actually harish do you want to showcase some of the projects now uh that's kind of like our big cutout so maybe we'll wait till the end i've got them all lined up here and they're ready to go but let's walk through some of the hackathon resources and then we'll uh we'll showcase a few of those okay so hackathon resources um basically as i mentioned there's kind of two places to go so first is covalenthq.com docs i'll show you both of these a little bit too um and then the second is covalent api reference itself um so our docs page is our knowledge base that's where you're going to find like tutorials how-to guides it's a good place to get started and kind of get an overview of the api it's also where you can sign up for a key um and i'll walk you through that in a second and then our api reference page is where you could actually try live calls like right in the browser um we actually recently gave these a bit of a makeover so we have like some new features global settings uh that can kind of help you configure your like they help you configure your calls beforehand in terms of which chain id you want to look at or which currency you want to see uh in the response and that way it's just kind of faster because it applies it to all of your api calls so let me okay you should be able to see covalent docs um so yeah this is the knowledge based site uh you're gonna see when you get here kind of a quick start which describes all of these different tabs on the side you'll see overview a little bit of what i just talked about with covalent um campaigns which shows you some of the internal campaigns that we run on an ongoing basis like a wallet design competition and then like a data puzzle competition this is kind of like probably the relevant part for most people here that supported networks so these are all the different chains that we index um and if you click on any of these you'll see a little bit more in depth like which endpoints are supported kind of examples um and then the average block time stuff like that and these chain ids which you'll find again in the api reference page that's all laid out for you so yeah you can browse between the different chains for tutorials the alchemist cookbook is the place to go um i think maybe a little less relevant to the hackathon but just in general to kind of see like um different ways you can get started at different skill levels so these docs are kind of a good place to start for advanced people but also beginners developer tools you have primer topic calculator um kind of some new features on here primer is a way that you can filter your api calls even further and make things more specific um and then this project showcases kind of what i was mentioning before where people come for inspiration a lot of the time so these are categorized um by they're just kind of like broken into different categories so governance tools wallets dexes nfts multi-chain analysis if you click on any of these you can expand them and you can see some different projects that have been built at the like in the past and they'll describe which endpoints they use so this is kind of helpful to see like what's possible um you can also see the events that these were built at so for instance this one was built at a previous youth global event um but yeah we like to showcase awesome projects on here so there's definitely a chance that builds from this competition could be featured on here as well um we're always kind of like looking to feature more community projects it's just hard to like track them all down um but yeah these are a little bit more in-depth uh and then these are a bit about our service providers like our node providers and the changelog where you can see um like different updates to the api itself so that's the docs um and then we're gonna go from here is if you get an api key you're gonna go to the api reference page um so we'll just scroll back up to the top so this is where you land um it gives you an overview of the page itself and then you'll see on the side you have class a endpoints and class b endpoints and then pricing endpoints so class a en points are um like just kind of broad queries across any different chain that you want things like get transactions for an address or uh get like nft transactions for a contract something like that our class b endpoints are protocol specific so like you swap pancake swap sushi swap and then we have these new x y equals k end points here um which basically it's it's kind of like the the uni swap a m has been kind of cloned so uh the x y equals can points allow you to query any sort of like union swap like decks across any chain and then you have your pricing endpoints at the bottom so up here as i mentioned before you have the global settings if you want a specific chain that you're going to be looking at pretty often you can just set it here this will also show you all the ones that are supported so i'm just on ethereum uh and then you have your quote currencies um this is probably well actually yeah this probably is relevant we have an analyst mode that just shipped to which basically if you click this you'll be able to try these api calls and see tabular responses um because we've always had this csv feature but you'd have to like copy it out into a spreadsheet and now you can just look at it directly in the browser um so if you're doing more like analytics dashboards um definitely check out analyst mode and then we have a few different languages that the docs are translated into now as well so and it's like russian korean chinese right now and then we're gonna be shipping some more out um but yeah i'll just show you kind of like how these endpoints look so you'll see examples on the side you'll also see templates sometimes uh in here so like this is just kind of an idea of how you could use that endpoint we're actually currently running a hackathon to solicit more templates from our community um so if you want to check out alchemist dao you can be part of the hackathon and yeah if you you can try these live in the browser um you just need to sign up for your api key first um i have a couple kind of that i've just shown so you can see how the response would look um so this for instance one of these get historical token prices you just input a contract address you find that on ether scan you set a date range and then if you click run your response is going to look something like this so it submits like a json response unless you are in analyst mode and you choose the tabular responses for some of those endpoints i just wanted to highlight one that's kind of cool too which is this get nft metadata um so if you know like the contract address of the nft collection and the token id you can input that in here um so you can do this for like any kind of collection that's big on i don't know twitter or openc pretty much it's just kind of booming right now so it's a fun one to look at but you'll get all the metadata for that nft which looks like this in the response like the name and then like the owner all of the different traits which is kind of cool and then if you want you can copy and paste the actual url which is just going to show you like a full image like this in this case it's by ferocious so it's kind of cool and this is how people are able to uh display things in those nft galleries and such so maybe now is a good time to hand off to show you a couple more projects in depth uh how you can make full use of the api it's pretty sure on mute oh sorry okay awesome um let me uh i think you're gonna have to stop sharing in order for me to to share my screen here okay can you see that awesome so just going to spend a few minutes talking about a few of the projects that came out of previous uh mobile events that we've been uh a part of um and have used our api just to give you sort of a broad flavor of the different types of applications that can be built and of course to showcase the the creativity of the developers um building these these projects out uh so the first one here which was part of uh just the recent online uh these were one of the uh the finalists here so uh this is d gen dogs and it's a concept that combines nfts with with d5 so um being able to mint your own dgen dog nft and then creating um this sort of streaming service where depending on uh you know different uh you know the number of uh owners and a time period you actually get stream back uh a portion of the uh the proceeds from the the auction of that dgen dog so it's a really interesting concept where they're leveraging uh super fluid uh and and chain link um and a few other protocols here to be able to create uh this type of revenue model over uh various uh time periods and combine the creative aspects of nfts with uh with d5 so i'll uh i'll share the uh the link to all these projects uh shortly here but this is really one to check out to really you know embody the spirit of this space with both this uh non-fungible token or nft uh concept and uh decentralized finance uh the second one here that we've got uh gramatria is a very interesting concept where the idea is to you know if you're familiar with the web flower or some of these um you know drag and drop tools to create your uh web application basically the same concept for creating web3 applications so each you know for example there is a a modular section called zora or live pure some of these other decentralized projects and you can just literally drag and drop these components in uh to be able to to create your your web3 applications in uh you know a very visual uh manner so this was a really cool project um a couple of these mod sections and modules are using covalent under the hood and uh really enjoy showcasing uh this one as well and then the the third one um is what lei had alluded to with this concept of a 3d walk through through an nfg gallery so here i've just put in a wallet address and it's pulled all the nfts um from that particular wallet address this one actually runs on the the rsk network which is a partner of ours and so the idea is that you can have this digital walk through where you can see your nft items in sort of a gallery format and you know imagine the uh the use cases here where you can create your own little showcases uh you can obviously you know auction and have people be able to purchase basically take the the concepts of the the analog real world um experience and then be able to sort of capture that in this very unique and interesting demonstration so just a couple of ideas you know in terms of what you can do and and really there's no there's no limit uh to the creativity of developers in the web3 space as we've clearly seen so uh you know hopefully this serves as a bit of an inspiration for what the uh the community here can can do as part of web3 jab yeah awesome i see you've already answered some of the questions um but i think there's maybe a couple more in here um let's see i was just answering a few of these if there's any more and actually let me just share the links here so you can all um sort of uh go through it and so that's uh the d-gen dogs this is uh the web3 builder and for anyone who is excited about the the nft gallery um this is the the demo page for that awesome warning it's like really hard to get through the door i was really impressed that you learned i i spent i spent some time practicing just to make sure to embarrass myself just walking through that yeah that's a fun one to try i think the only question after the last thing you answered is is it okay to get multiple api on my environment um yeah so when you set up your your organization um in the covalent platform uh you can request multiple keys and you know if there's team members working with you uh they can have their own their own keys or if you've got keys for different functions um you know you're definitely able to organize it that way so right now you know again the api is is free um so it's uh you know go go to town don't melt our servers but uh definitely you know we want to see uh people build some really interesting use cases and uh be able to see what what folks come up with uh where is all the data on our centralized servers so yes that is correct so currently uh covalent service is a centralized service which we're actively uh decentralizing right now in fact we we um set up what we call our block specimen producer which is sort of the the first iteration of our of our decentralized networks and then we'll have the query nodes um and then the indexing nodes after that so it's really exciting for us to go through this process our first approach was making sure that we got our our data structure um in in sort of a manner that provides value to users and you know we've clearly seen the product market fit with the the number of customers who've um sort of used our product and uh you know powering over 350 projects now so through this process as we go through and and decentralize um just on this last question yes absolutely we are going to have this network set up in a way where individuals can actually run their their own node um that's where we're going to get to we're going to start with a set of validators who obviously specialize in in running nodes but i mean everybody internally has been asking can we also do the same thing and and we are going to work our way to to that model um so that uh contributors and also supporters of the network get rewarded uh for running infrastructure uh is there a way to request additional blockchains for industry yes um maybe you can quickly talk about the the governance portal um where people can propose different uh ideas but also different networks that get prioritized to be indexed you know there's constant questions that we get about when is this going to chain going to get index when is that chain going to get indexed so um let's just quickly talk about the uh the governance page and maybe i'll i'll share the link once you start talking about it okay i actually have the link so i can just put it in here oh perfect um yeah we've been using our governance forum a lot which i just shared the link to you can see there's actually a few different categories in there so i'll talk about the indexing but also um for people to request features on the api you can actually put those on here as well in the development section um because we're trying to kind of see like an archive for all of all of the feature requests but in terms of the chains we index we had our first full-on governance vote on snapchat um like a couple weeks ago and it was one of our community members that proposed we index harmony um because she wanted to use our endpoints for their change or like a project she was building on their chain um which was super cool we had like i think it was like 10.9 million votes on our first proposal which was super awesome to see um and in lieu of that we're continuing to basically take proposals from the community on different chains that they want to see us index so currently there's one underway um which actually you can probably find in here but the ronin yeah so for ronin for axey's side chain um we've kind of worked with vaccine in the past and some of their community members they sort of have a issue with like accessing their data right now or making sense of their data so there's some really talented community members on their side that have built like cool fan sites but more people kind of want to explore the analytics and the incentives of baxi so yeah there's a current proposal underway for us to index ronin um and then i think the some of the preliminary voting starts this week so yeah definitely check that out if you're interested um oh yeah harish somebody just asked about for the oh there you go yeah never mind yeah yeah for the the demo they they configured it for a particular address i think you should be able to try some some other addresses but if you want to ensure it works try try the one that i just shared there it's a a wallet on rsk that's got the guy actually created his own uh little collection and deployed it on on rsk to be able to use it for that demo awesome well we're active very active on discord so if there are any additional questions um we are more than happy to um answer them on our discord channel which i will share right here just go with hp.com discord so please uh join us there um and uh yeah love to hear your questions if you've got any um you know uh requests for feedback on ideas or using our api we're gonna be active in both the global discord channel as well as ours so don't hesitate to reach out we uh love taking part in hackathons and we love uh supporting uh you know creative developers like you all so good luck with your your builds um and uh yeah thank you again for the opportunity to to present to you guys thank you all right thank you so much lei and marie for taking your time to present have this wonderful presentation for all of our hackers um for hackers the live stream of this can be found on our youtube channel at youth global if you want to refer to it anytime in the future and otherwise just like harish said um language can be found can be reached through our discord at sponsor covalent or their own discord so yeah i hope the rest of you have a great rest of your day and thank you so much for tuning in
