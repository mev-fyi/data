our next presentation is going to be recorded um we have stefano um of long hash ventures coming in um we'll be sharing a video and audio for him and kicking that off right now [Music] hi everyone this is stefan robery from long hash ventures uh very excited to be with you today at haccfs a big thank you to stefan and the whole team at protocol labs for inviting us to share with you uh all of the participants in hackfest about the longhash x accelerator and of course applying to our program which is taking off in a few months time um so maybe to start off uh a little bit about longhash x so we are asia's leading web3 accelerator uh we're part of longhash ventures which is a uh crypto investment fund and accelerator uh based in singapore and for longhash x so we have graduated six cohorts in the last three and a half years we have over 40 alumni projects and we have helped these projects raise over 100 million dollars in funding and some of our notable uh alumni from the program includes zapper instep balancer and accola now in addition to 80 000 in seat funding uh if you join the accelerator program your growth is going to be uh you know boosted by uh the network so we have over a thousand investors in our network and of course quite a number of notable and high profile mentors and and also by by education through our modules so we have um six web free focus modules that include product strategy and design economics governance technical mentorship community building and marketing and of course fundraising now uh some of the investors that connected that connected with our products after uh our most recent demo day which is back in april uh include uh you know some of the things you see here so both uh crypto native investors like fembocher uh you know iosg or google cryptos and then some other uh you know non-crypto but of course notable investors such as sequoia now the program is segmented into two tracks so we have a d5 track and a file coin track now i think today you know most of the interest would be around uh the file point frontier accelerator track uh this one would run in partnership with protocol labs and what this means for you is that of course you get a lot of technical mentorship uh you know as you're building uh on uh file coin and you get access to uh you know to mentor sessions uh workshops and fireside chats with um some of the members of the protocol labs team uh yeah so i talked a little bit earlier about our modules so uh as you can see it's very crypto native um and so typically through the accelerator program it's uh it's 12 weeks during which we touch on each of one of these modules with you uh this includes going through workshops uh fireside chats and then of course uh one-on-one sessions uh with mentors and also with the low hash team now uh you do receive uh you know mentorship both from the team and from top crypto native uh mentors and investors so uh you know on a regular basis you'll have interactions with me as a program lead as well as with pranav who's our venture builder uh but then also you get access to uh you know to our network uh of course from our friends at protocol labs like colin like uh zx and then also members in our investor network like tekken from polychain and bobby from cms holdings now we just wanted to also illustrate a little bit on on how we work with you uh so so to do this we wanted to share an example of the work within the balancer which was a a project that uh you know i'm sure many of you have heard of and and who went through uh one of our most recent recent cohorts uh so with balancer uh some of things we did included uh you know shaping the decentralized governance model and we did that by hosting a roundtable with founders of ave synthetics and defiance capital who share their experience and ideas on decentralization we also wrote a governance proposal on staking of one of their protocol one of their pool tokens sorry uh as a precursor to uh you know sort of wider adoption of decentralized governance uh we also help them to develop case studies uh on uh why uh lps should provide liquidity into their pools uh and lastly we also uh uh you know post-programming got a grant from them to help develop their community um in uh in asia pacific so this is just an example of of the different ways that we actually work uh with us a project through the accelerator program okay so uh we're currently uh recruiting for our next uh cohort uh so applications are open and we'll have a qr code with a link to the description uh just in a minute but just share a little bit about the timeline so applications are open until uh next monday which is in about three days from now um and after the application is closed on the 9th of august there'll be two rounds of interviews uh and selection then by the 10th of september uh projects will be selected and we'll make the announcement directly to you via email and then the accelerator program begins in months from that so in the 11th of october it runs for 12 weeks uh and then at the end of it we'll have demo day that is scheduled for the 18th of january when you get a chance to pitch your project to uh you know thousands of investors uh and uh after the demo they uh you know we still worked with you and we with the investors to make uh one-on-one introductions now um you may also be wondering you know how do we how do we evaluate projects that are selected into the accelerator program so uh you know as a base criteria we of course look to make sure that you have a web3 native or crypto-native business model and that you're actually tapping into networks of public permissions blockchains and then we have both a top-down and bottom-up approach to uh you know to do the detailed selection so from a top-down you know we um we look to see you know where do you fit uh on the web free ecosystem and are you plugging in some of the gaps that we currently see in in the web3 landscape uh and or are you tapping into some of these upcoming trends that we're also seeing and then from a bottom up perspective we look at a number of things so one is we look at your business model so how are you planning to capture value um you know if you already have your tokenomics formulated or you have a rough idea you know we we also look at this you know is there a fair allocation to the community what's the inflation mechanism etc uh of course we look at the team you know what's the team's background what is your domain and crypto expertise uh your technical ability and of course your history of executing and building uh startups um and then last you also look at you know what's your starting position so um what kind of traction do you have have you done any fundraising and and who has been funding you uh do you have a community and how active is it do you have partnerships who are your competitors and how are you differentiating from them so you know hopefully this gives you a little bit of the idea on um you know how we evaluate projects that get selected into the program so uh thank you again for your time uh you know very happy to have been uh you know asked to share a little bit about the long hashtags program now very importantly we would love to encourage everybody to apply uh so if you uh scan this qr code with your phones this will lead you directly to our application uh form and uh as we as i said earlier uh applications close in a few days on the 9th of august and we'll start to evaluate immediately after that and so for those of you that apply we'll be reaching out to you pretty soon thank you so much and have a great day
