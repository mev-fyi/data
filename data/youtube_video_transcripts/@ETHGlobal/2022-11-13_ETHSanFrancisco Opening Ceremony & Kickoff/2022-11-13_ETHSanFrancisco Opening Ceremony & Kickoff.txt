foreign [Applause] [Music] are you all excited yeah maybe one more time are you all excited there we go welcome everybody Welcome to eat San Francisco my name is kartig one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the city of San Francisco now let's start with something really important this is not a conference these events are organized by Eve Global and youth Global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the wet 3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits and this makes this event a hackathon what differentiates all this is that our focus is on Builders We Believe showing is more important than telling and this is a place for all of you to learn explore get help and grow as developers and learn the skills that you all excited to gain and that brings us to all the things that we're going to talk about today the most important piece is that this is the biggest eat Global event we've done in person in our five-year history over 1700 people in the building from 46 different countries and 38 of them are brand new to web3 this is absolutely incredible we put all of them on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and I am so excited to see so many familiar faces and so many new faces and I can't wait to can't wait to meet all of you not only that we have 27 workshops a lot of them have happened already as you kind of came in in the afternoon 265 ecosystem partners and 18 mentors who are here 24 7 to help you with anything technical that you need and to top it all off 300 000 in price are being given away and we're going to talk about all those things on what the details are for each of these prizes shortly in the next uh hour I also want to give a special shout out to our 39 incredible Partners so I want to give them a big round of applause please join me in thanking ipfs and falcoin open C optimism polygon scale World coin cartesi ens lens uniswa Foundation Uma xmtp the graph hyperlane ey me now push protocol live pure luo zero X it coin near samudai fuel tenderly teller Dune unlock quick note noses chain empiric Network evmos spindora midpoint triangle covalent Samsung next and Pull and swing all these incredible companies are here this weekend and they're going to be talking about why they're excited to be part of this event and all the prizes you can win by using their sdks and protocols all right so I want to make sure I make the best use of the next 60 Minutes I want to talk about what this weekend is all about want to cover what the venue and all the activities that we're doing how you can get help when I talk about all the prizes in the workshops how judging and project submission is going to work and if you're still looking for a team how all of that is set up so let's go into all of that but before let's talk about a little bit of security everyone must have their wristband which you would have gotten with your event badge at on you at all times The Wristband is required to be in the building and if you end up cutting it and uh or losing it or somehow misplacing it we will not be issuing a second one so please make sure that you do not get rid of or cut your wristbands these are the things that are going to be preventing you from going back into the building and the security is going to make sure that we don't let anybody in without a wristband so just to sum it up no wristband no entry do not lose your wristband if you've been already put one on on your wrists on top of that please do not leave your belongings unattended the doors are going to be open this is a 24 7 event people could come in at any time whether it's 2 A.M or 2 p.m in the next two days and we want to make sure that you don't leave your stuff unattended so please keep an eye out on your stuff at all times there is no official storage that we are offering for this weekend and of course you've already been here for quite some time so just want to make sure I also take a second to remind everybody on the floor plan this is the main floor where most of the things are happening we are on the main stage on my left the middle spot is all of the hacking area the workshop rooms are in the middle at the end and at the end of uh this Hall and if you need any help there's going to be a 24 7 help desk right where registration was so you can find anybody on the global team at any given time a quick note here is that the doors that you came in from today are going to be closing at 10 pm so when you're trying to exit tonight after 10 pm you're gonna have to go to the end of the hallway and request your ride or your Uber at the end and not the doors you came in from and then there's also a mezzanine floor that's on the area on top and that's all of hacking space and a chill room where you can just kind of hang out and get some snacks and just chill and of course you've already kind of had dinner but make sure that you do not lose your meal tickets uh there are six of them for six meals they are what the food trucks are going to request if you lose them we're also not going to be giving you a new one and you will need them to get the food for the rest of the weekend so enjoy some variety of food options that you have here and give them a meal ticket when you want to eat something from any of the trucks and we have a lot of other fun things going on this weekend so there's an nft exhibition by noun style that's all the way at the end of this Hall uh there's a Relaxation Station powered by cartesi you can get some massage chairs and hammocks in there uh there's also a photo booth you want to get some photos about being in San Francisco uh you get them digitally delivered to your email and we're going to do an activity which is dyeing a scarf that's a very local thing from San Francisco so if you're interested in this this is happening here tomorrow afternoon from 3 to 5 p.m in one of the workshop rooms all right let's go right into a lot of the logistics of this weekend communication everything that we're going to be doing here is going to happen on Discord if you rsvp'd as a hacker you would have seen a prompt to connect your Discord to get all the right permissions the Discord is only open and accessible to people who are participating at the hackathon so these are all private channels and if you do not see each San Francisco on your sidebar that means you didn't connect it properly or something went wrong so you can find us and we'll help you debug that Discord is also the place where we have all the channels for getting support so you can ping any protocol that's offering a prize you can ping any of our mentors there you can also physically go to the mentor help station and get any help and of course remember that you are in person everybody that you're going to be talking to is also here in person you can just walk up to them and chat and get help also all the official announcements will be posted on Discord so if you miss anything if we're running behind or if we're running ahead of schedule or something change we'll be announcing all of that on Discord as well as updating the website and whatever the website says is going to be the source of Truth so if something is different on the website then what's been communicated it's the website that remains what we're going to follow and just to remind everybody the website is sf.eatglobal.com all right so the most common questions we get is how do this hackathon work and what do I need to do to prep for tonight we'll keep this very simple you can officially start hacking on your projects and you can work on a project with up to five members on your team you all have 36 hours to hack so submissions are due at 9am on the Sunday and we're going to talk about what all of that means in terms of submissions but before we talk about the submission there are a few simple rules that we want to follow for all the projects that are going to be submitted everything that you're going to do must be done from scratch which means you cannot continue to work on a project that you already started before everything that you're doing must begin today starting right now and you cannot extend a project otherwise you'll be disqualified you are allowed to use open source projects of course if something is already open source and you're either forking that repo or you're building on top or if you actually use the code from any other existing projects that is still totally fine but not something that you've done yourself before and you're adding a feature to it and only people who have been confirmed on the hacker dashboard are eligible to win prizes which means if your team members are not listed on your team section or they do not show up or they do not physically attend this event in person have not checked in they will automatically be kicked out tomorrow afternoon by a script and if you win a prize we will not be on honoring anybody who was not listed at the time of submission as a team member so really really make sure that all of your team members individually show up as you're submitting a project and of course if you have any questions you can find me you can find anybody on the global team we're going to be there 24 7 on a help test there to answer any questions and a lot of the workshops that are happening are designed for people from all different skill sets whether you're a beginner you're an intermediate or expert in this space and all that information is also available on your dashboard and all of our website and everything including this speech right now and maybe on stage is being live stream so you can catch up all of that instantly on if global.tv or going to youtube.com youth Global watch everything at your own pace you can see past stuff and you get to look at code and everybody who gave a talk today is here in person so you can just walk up to those speakers and ask them any follow-up questions that you had and for those of you who are still looking to join a team uh we are going to be running a team formation Workshop right after I stopped talking in an hour and that's going to be in Workshop room 4 which is all the way at the end of the hallway so that's going to happen at the at 9 30 for about an hour hour and a half and that means if you are still looking for teammates if you are looking to join a team or you want somebody to join your team with a different specific sales cat skill set uh you can be in that room and find each other and potentially work together on a project and of course if you have not already checked this out there's also a tool on your hacker dashboards to find other team members who are also looking for a team this requires both sides to be opt-in and you can search people for different skill sets what they're looking for and what you're looking for and find them and message them directly on Discord and connect them asynchronously all right submissions are due at 9am on Sunday and let's talk about that but before I go into this just a quick note Daylight Saving Time kicks in this Sunday so while you can start hacking at 8pm and somebody is a due at 9am you still have 36 and not 37 hours to hack so keep that in mind your clock should automatically change but things will be slightly different by an hour on Sunday all right let's talk about judging main judging and partner judges there's going to be two tracks for what judging means you can opt in for either of these processes and what that means is if you're going to be working on a project and you want to win a prize from one of our partners you have to select those prizes on your submission project page view and the partners will be notified that you are applying for that prize in that time you have to go to their tables and their boots and present what you did to them individually which means if you are trying to win prizes from five different sponsors you're gonna have to go to all five of those teams and present your projects to them in that same window there's also the main judging which is going to help us determine the top 10 teams which is entirely separate from the partner judging and this is going to be happening at the end of the hallway on the other side of this room and we'll be assigning an order for each of the teams to go present to our main judges whom you can find on our website and they'll be deciding who the overall projects are that are interesting for the rest of the hackathon you if you want to be part of the main judging and top 10 projects and also win prizes you're going to have to present to both sides so make sure that you are optimizing for your time and making sure that you have enough time on Sunday morning to look at all these things and go to everybody that you want to present to how does judging act exactly work you will have four minutes to demo your projects in seven minutes in total to present everything that you did which includes three additional minutes for questions we usually recommend that you record a four minute video of what you did in case something goes wrong or if you are relying on some transaction happening on mainnet and that may take more time or something goes wrong it just helps you recover and not be in a situation where at the final moment you are not able to demo what you built and we really recommend the do not do this last minute uh you need at least 30 minutes to submit everything because you will be asked to show proof of how you're using different protocols if you're applying for prizes and you're going to have to actually spend time writing different things about what you did and how it works so really don't prepare for this last minute and all that happens on your hacker dashboards you'll start seeing a form tomorrow afternoon immediately on how all of it is set up and kind of what I similar to what I talked about already the partner judging is part of the same process so as you're submitting you get to choose these are all the prizes that you're applying for and once you do that the partners will be notified that you are expected at their Booth which means that if you do not select a prize they have no way of knowing that you wanted to win or participate or qualify for those prizes and there's no way for us to control that so you're going to have to make sure that you select it the right price and you can do this thing in parallel which means that if you want to present to all the partners before and then go to the main judging you can or you can do it right after you present it to the main judges and then find the partners you get to decide what you want to optimize for and of course I want to talk about our code of conduct the rules and the code of conduct for being at this event are outline on e-global.com rules but in summary it's fairly straightforward everything that you build here is your own intellectual property nobody neither age Global or your team members or any of our partners own anything that comes out of it whoever is part of that project is the owner of that work and please be respectful for everybody to to everybody in this building harassment in any form is not going to be tolerated so if you feel like you're being treated in a way that shouldn't be the case please come find us and we'll take immediate action and whether you're not comfortable come finding us in person you're more than welcome to Ping us on Discord or email or if you don't want to do that and just actually talk to us in person please come find anybody wearing a new Global shirt and with that we are done with most of the logistics what I want to do next is bring on some of our amazing partners and there are some of our amazing Partners who are excited to be here this weekend they're going giving some amazing prizes they're going to talk about why they're here and what they're doing and I want to kick us off by showing a video from Papillon to talk about what ipfs and fall coin is up to so while we're ready our rest of our partners please watch this intro from ipf altcoin hey everyone my name is Papio and I work at ipfs in Fall point we're so excited to be a sponsor at East San Francisco ipfs and filecoin that's why we're here ipfs is a peer-to-peer content address protocol that makes the web upgradable resilient and more open and filecoin is the largest decentralized storage Network that ensures content persistence over time file coins total capacity makes up about one percent of total cloud storage and we're growing fast increasing storage capacity and developing multiple exciting Solutions like our recently launched filecoin virtual machine fully evm compatible smart contracts will enable co-locating storage and computation now there's twenty thousand dollars in the offering make sure to check the website for submission qualifications you can also find these great learning resources like nft.storage and web3. storage to get you started if you need to reach out you can find us on the Discord Channel or at our sponsor booth hackathons are a great place to experiment to get your hands dirty and to build projects the possibilities are endless we wish you the best of luck happy hacking awesome please give Papillon a big round of applause and next up I want to bring on Benji from optimism to talk about everything optimism loves to please welcome Benji on stage yo hey everybody um before I start I just want to say like this is my first time speaking at youth Global so I hired a public speaking expert to help me with the slides unfortunately I couldn't pay them on time so they just left their like notes over here if I was you I'd just ignore anything written in yellow just like you know just don't look at it um okay so how to win an optimism prize we have a bunch of cool prizes guys it's gonna be really exciting so again don't read the yellow a show of hands so could you raise your hand if you're hacking today let's go nice uh can you raise your hand if you don't have an idea yet okay I see a few hands in there okay cool cool our our area is right around there so hit me up and we'll talk a little bit about various things you can do uh a bunch of ideas for you to try out as well so you know one nfds or digital Collectibles we have prize for two teams two thousand five hundred dollars each you can make an nft collection you can make something to make someone else make an nft collection you can make something to let someone else making something that makes an nft collection a bunch of stuff um or maybe build some games we have we released the op stack recently so you know lattice made opcraft and that was exciting so you guys can do the same crypto is all about human coordination so you know ethereum lets you program money money lets you program incentives incentives let you program societies and novel structures um damn all right we already have the collective on optimism thousands of active governance participants and we need some tech we need something to help that be organized so if you guys are interested in gov Tech anything you can create for Dows we have prizes for those three teams two and a half thousand dollars each for the winners and um I missed this slide we do a little Dev tooling as well so anyone who wants to do anything that can help a developer build anything at all um we have three team prizes for two and a half thousand dollars for the winners uh this could be Discord in for a inferent general or automation uh we do a little devtooling and lastly if you guys are interested in even more content please uh scan this I'm going to leave it on for like a couple seconds and there's a bunch of other prizes as well so you can look into it thank you amazing awesome well thank you so much and next up I want to bring on Ryan from openc to talk about everything open C please welcome Ryan on stage hello everyone my name is Ryan I work on the protocol team at openc on the engineering team uh I'll be here this weekend I'll be wearing a bright open sea shirt I'll be sitting and hacking away if anyone wants to build on Seaport which is our new Marketplace protocol that we launched this summer uh it's an ownerless uh based protocol that has no inherent fees to any parties so anyone can build orders and hack on it and combine orders from different marketplaces and be able to execute them uh in a very gas efficient manner there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with that you can build contracts that can validate orders on chain that people can fulfill uh you can create multi-cigs that hold nfts that lists them uh on the openc website and cool things like that um so it's great to be here uh if anyone would needs open C Keys find me and I can help uh uh create API keys for you guys so thank you thank you next up I want to bring on Steph from polygon please welcome Steph hi I'm Steph I'm from polygon GM ethsf uh Jacob taught me that San Francisco has eight bridges and the one over there is the Golden Gate Bridge I got that wrong today and I'm not going to get that wrong the rest of the week um but I'm from polygon I love working for polygon because polygon believes in web3 for all so that's you your mom your grandma um kids in kindergarten their teacher literally every single person in the world and we love that our Builders feel that way too so I challenge you this week to build things for anyone and everyone get in Builders we're hacking all weekend uh we have three different solutions you can build on for the hackathon the first one is polygon POS which is our proof of stake side chain I love building on POS because the transactions are super fast and the gas is low it's very scalable and it's also evm compatible we also have our zke evm testnet that went live a few weeks ago publicly so you can build on ZK evm if you scan this QR code you'll get the RPC URL and have all of the information you need to build and then we also have polygon ID which is our decentralized ID solution my co-worker Rahat did a really great workshop at 6 pm today so check that out on the eat Global YouTube channel uh and you'll have everything you need to build with polygon ID we also have twenty thousand dollars this weekend in prizes um our prizes are for best use of polygon ID best public goods or refi metaverse or gaming project best ux and then my personal favorite best developer tool or Dow tooling project so tons of different options for building and really excited to see what you all build thank you so much thank you next up I want to bring on Jack from scale please welcome Jack hello all right pleasure to be here who's hacking all right awesome okay um first off we have 20 000 in hacker Awards all right you can see the awards up here uh first and foremost I just want to talk about the the pool award so anybody who deploys any team who successfully deploys to scale will share in the the pool Awards so um our team will be here all weekend here to support you um and let's have some fun so really quickly what is scale scale is a modular multi-chain blockchain Network designed to help scale ethereum all right it's ethereum native meaning it's built into ethereum one of the coolest pieces about skill is it's actually a zero gas fee Network in a sustainable decentralized manner I'll get into that in a second so we've been around for a long time we actually sponsored this event 2018 it was awesome it was a blast um we're all gonna have a good time um now we've been around for a while but just this last June the network went through a major upgrade and today we just had the 15 million 15 millionth transaction since June um over 77 active users a lot of action on the chain and um uh just excited to see what's happening in scale so getting a little deeper of skill skill is actually a network of app specific blockchains it's not a single chain whereas most blockchains are one shared database scale has a system of pooled security blockchain so these are in many ways shards or pooled pool chains that share a collective validator set but then have their own individual blockchain that all and they work as an active group for collusion resistance and redundancy okay and they're all emboldened by the ethereum mainnet and really controlled by the ethereum main Network and Synergy with the ethereum mainnet and help bring fees and revenue back to the ethereum mainnet um I now hey I've got a lot of pictures here about the containerization of the network the technical architecture I have two minutes so I'm not going to go through this but if you're interested in learning more you want to learn about how the network functions if you're into containerization if you're in a threshold encryption uh come by the booth and talk to us we'd love to talk to you about how scale functions and works and operates um I also would love to talk about how the there's a hub and dap chain model we already have 18 chains in the evm chains and the scale Network each one can do over 100 transactions per second in terms of throughput um that can get pretty messy in terms of coordination without hubs so there's a hub model would love to talk about that too okay last thing we have an announcement my our comms team wouldn't let me you know announce this yet so I'm giving a little sneak peek but keep your eyes open next week it starts with a z and there's gonna be some cool stuff coming out on sale soon all right uh come come check us out on the uh Discord if you have questions skill.chat all right let's have some fun thanks yeah thank you and our last partner on stage please welcome Thiago from worldcoin hello what's up all right I do have a few slides that the team sent me probably too long so we're gonna skip through a bunch of them but yeah so I'm telling worldcoin and we're building a bunch of stuff at worldcoin uh we're building a token that anyone in the world can claim except if they're in the US for free just for being a person we're also building a wallet for normal people it's super easy to use and then lastly and most importantly we'll building what we call a proof of personhood protocol and that's what we're here to talk about today and so there's this really pesky problem that we all have to deal with which is Bots or people abusing systems right this is called civil attacks and the idea is that when you're online you don't know if someone if 20 accounts or 20 people with individual accounts or one person with 20 accounts and so we built uh a protocol that helped us solve it for a problem that we had and now we're opening up so that any of you can build applications that leverage the same civil resistance and so in essence with our protocol what you can do is people can anonymously prove to you that they're a real person that have never done something before right and so for example if you're building an app that lets people claim nfts people can prove that they're a real person that has never claimed this nft before without revealing who they are or they can prove that they've never joined this Discord or that they've never redeemed an airdrop right whatever it is uh it's all Anonymous and people can prove that they've never done it before yeah so this is with World ID very exciting this is our protocol but what I want to get to is how we do this we do this with this device it's called the orb it's a little Beauty And The Ore basically does three things it makes sure you're a real person with a bunch of sensors then it looks at your iris it generates a unique code it destroys the other images that has taken of you and using zero knowledge proofs you can verify that you've never been to an orb before and so this is exactly the type of Serial knowledge proof that you can integrate into your project uh to reuse the signal that the orb gives you now it's super easy to implement all you need to do is embed a widget like this on your website which looks like a captcha but instead of having to select images people just click on this they scan a QR code that generates a zero knowledge proof and then we do everything magically for you we have Integrations that can be done either on chain or through a web API so you can really build anything on any chain and if you want to do it on chain it's on polygon there's a bunch of things you can build with this I will not get into the specific use cases but if you're curious about resources this link is actually wrong I'll show you the right link at the end but uh there's a whole bunch of things we have documentation a developer portal the widget the underlying protocol and a bunch of examples most importantly to help you build this this is what that looks like we have a bunch of prices um a lot of really cool categories uh people have built really interesting things in the past so go have fun and then this is the right link if you want to build on world going this weekend go to welcome.org ifsf22 and anything that you need to know the rules uh the documentation fun facts about the orb interesting things you can check it out there all right have fun hacking thank you all right well there's two things left before we go back to hacking I do want to get to the prizes but before that I want to bring on somebody special and we have a really interesting talk prepared for interview prepared for our next speaker I want to bring on Dylan field who is the CEO of figma figma if you don't already know is a design tool that is taken Silicon Valley by the storm it has fundamentally changed how we think about collaboration and just doing design at scale and we're going to talk about how do we make good products how do we think about building more consumer-friendly applications and all things web3 so please join me in welcoming Dylan field from figma on stage
