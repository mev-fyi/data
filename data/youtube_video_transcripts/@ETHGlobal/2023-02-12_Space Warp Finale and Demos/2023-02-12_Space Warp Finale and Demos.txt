foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of a global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to fvm space War all of you are watching this on eveglobal.tv this is what we'll be using today for all of the live streams and talking about all the teams and that's projects we're going to see as well as answering any questions that may come up from what we will show off today so for those of you who are joining us for the first time this event is brought to you by Heath Global and Heath Global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal was to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and summits space war pacabon is our first event of the year and we did both of these things for this event over the last couple weeks we kicked off the whole hackathon on Friday the 20th of January we talked about what's happening in the entire world of our conversional machine and getting ready for the mainnet launch but the next hour and a half is about the hackathon foreign this is officially the world's biggest fem hackathon out there and our goal is to talk to all of you about what came out of this event over the past three weeks and all the amazing things that were built we saw over a thousand people participate from 82 different countries and in 23 different time zones this is already such a massive widespread participation from our Global community and we're going to discuss all the things that everybody builds and care about we put everybody on a map to see where they're from and it still continues to blow blow us away that we have representation from solely in different countries continents and cultures on top of that we also had six amazing ecosystem partners and 32 ecosystem mentors who are there to help you really understand what you can do on the conversion machine and all the creative things you can build when you have programmable data and to top it all off we are giving over 125 000 in prizes and we're gonna talk about all the prizes that all of you have won very soon want to give a quick shout out to all of our amazing Partners so especially first and foremost ball coin and also hudlow one live peer Lighthouse which protocol and spiron they're all giving an amazing amount of prizes and showcasing cool build the coolest things using their Technologies and sdks so we'll learn all about all those winners very soon but let's get started with the demos so submissions would you four days ago from two and a half weeks worth of hacking time and we were absolutely Blown Away to see that 1042 of you collectively worked on 275 projects that is already amazing to see this represents such a big part of what's Happening Now in the fvm ecosystem and I'm going through all these submissions over the last few days through kind of an intense judging process and a live feedback session in Q a we got down to 12 finalists these 12 teams are going to come on here today and demo what they built for all of us to see and our goal is to highlight some of the really cool things that were built and are possible now on that video so in no particular order I'd like to announce and congratulate our 12 amazing finalists so please keep a big round of applause a shout out to sapo filesaver Collective Dao ninja Dash is a kaggle on a spill data blocks Eclipse fuel swap fvm Explorer FNS lookup and Cosmic chicken these are our 12 incredible teams that are going to come on here one by one and demo everything that they built and her goal is to Showcase to all of you the cool things you can do with these New Primitives that are now possible by deploying on fbm so before we go into our very first demo I want to take a quick second to highlight all the other kind of projects that were built during this event the 263 teams listed here were amazing amazing projects that we we're just absolutely excited about we talked to all of our judges and our partners to get some feedback on what they saw and one thing we're excited about and the excitement was unanimous from every single one of them and I want to congratulate all of these teams for taking the time to build so many really cool things and building things that you were excited about and really pushing what's possible in the world of web3 just because you are not one of these 12 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something that was not great our goal with the finalists to highlight some of the things that we were super excited about and the goal here is that we want to help you and provide you any result with any resources we can to continue encouraging you to build and make sure that you get to continue building these projects after this event ends today so please give yourself a massive Round of Applause for pushing to the end and building something that you can be proud of and not only that but also showcasing that and demoing it to all the amazing people that are part of these events from our ecosystem and now broadly om3 space so congratulations to all 275 teams but let's go back to our final list so if you are interested in seeing what came out of this event you can now head over to Keith global.com showcase you'll be able to see all these projects here now and that includes everything from how they were built to what they built screenshots video demos and live demos and their source code all of that is now public invisible and you can check this out immediately on our website so let's go into the first demo so without further Ado I'd like to welcome our first demo of today and that is team Cosmic chicken and they'll come on and show you what they build so Jose welcome and excited to see what Cosmic second is foreign or let me just share my screen cool so I'll I'll start to do the presentation hey everyone and thanks for your time I'm I'm a presenting on behalf of the team that builds consulates Cosmic sticking for this fcm space warp hackathon we these were the active people that spent the last few weeks working on it and build something cool so what was our motivation first we wanted to diminish Capital costs for storage providers then we wanted to create a yield opportunity for field token holders and finally we wanted to leverage the chicken mechanism that was created by liquidity in order to bootstrap some tropical liquidity they could be positive force inside the Falcon ecosystem so high level what do we build so we want to check out lenders and storage providers so each one of them will deposit 50 of the collateral into our sticking pool and after that we'll be depositing the full amount of collateral that storage providers need on behalf of those storage providers and maintenance and accruing the rewards into towards the people so what does this mean in practice so in this example we have three chicken Bond holders that together pull the shield into the sticking pool we have two search providers that together deposit 25 shield into the stacking pool and afterwards the sticking pool is depositing 57 2013 for your storage provider on behalf of them and recruiting the rewards from the work until they repeat the loan so how did we made it both the Chicken Lawrence and the staking pool are solid with smart contracts that we deployed to wipers planes so you can check them these addresses and afterwards we built a front-end next JS where you use other JS and one time you can directly with the contacts and it like using an amplifier you can check inside at this URL so now it's time for the demo this is our home page where we have the time to do some cool animations to explain what this is all about as I explained we have some information from lenders and storage providers explaining everything that happens when you join this protocol and we also explained about this in web itself chicken one is an ERC 721 nft token it basically has three states you have the bonding state where we initially win the NXT where you are recruiting the balance of the boosted field you have chicken name which means that your relinquish the initial Capital that you used during the means but yet the yield that you recruit so far and finally you got the chicken now where you'll lose the deal that you accrued so hard but to get back the initial Capital um we have a few more things in the one page so feel free to check it out afterwards I'm going now to move into the Lander dashboard and I'll search by linking a new bonds so I'm making and your bond for me 0.8 we got the metamask notification where I'll be confirming and we should get a transaction within fill Fox that will be confirmed in a few seconds you know I'll explain to you what should happen in the storage provider dashboard so in here you need to deposit some money to act as your college afterwards you can start alone as you can see here the total one was for tofio and eventually you pay it off and you will have it on the on the expired loans for this I'm going to switch to a new account just because this one already had a loan then I deposit some some tokens previously and now I'm going to create a new loan for a search provider I'm going to put my address in both of the miner and the owner to use my zero consort and I'm going to consider to keep my X on the switch again we got this smart transaction it's not contract transaction biggest open up on Shield Hawks and I'll be going back to the landing so in here we can see that we already got 0.8 that I I did a transaction that should assume it's behind and that's pretty much it now I can either Chicken in as I explained or she cannot in both this will trigger and transaction that are not going at that now final um I want to explain a bit about the journal Logics the chicken Bond itself as these five components you got the bending bucket where the funds deposit might only reside you got the reserve work that accumulate steel rules from the pending bucket the permanent bucket and itself and finally the permanent bucket which is the funds required by the protocol during this chicken finally we got the virtual balance of boosted fuel that is the state where you are still bonding and recurring the boosted shield on the virtual Wells and when you shaking in you get the actual boost here which is an erc20 token that then can be used to claim from the reserve bucket funds finally I just wanted to talk a bit about the future work so we think we should have some cool visuals for people to see what's going on to make sure that they are making it sound financial decision we of course need some acts that need to be fixed in the future we also plan to deploy this to me Nets and we need to still require a few changes for that that's it from my part thanks for your time hopefully to enjoy it amazing thank you so much for our first demo of the day and we're already seeing Deep by Primitives on fbm and uh also amazing t-shirt thanks for having me last year lead global all right we are ready for our second demo and that is team Collective Dao so knocking art welcome and uh let's see what you built I'm curio from Collective Dao team and uh during this Capital we have been working on the non-custodial liquids taking protocol uh on South coin and what does it mean for example if you are if you holder you can take your field to our staking pool and get back interest bearing shell field token later you can use it in the future of Falcon device system or you can swap it back to your field with rewards uh which reward from mine which report from miners and let me show how it works uh here is our UI connected to hyperspace Network and now I can State my view and get my Celsius in exchange so we are sending transaction now and it will take some time from hyperspace to approve it and later I will see my change balances here also I can unstake it later and uh so or swap to still feel myself you don't feel if there is not enough to create in the pool so and now what will tell you how it works how can we help storage providers hello everyone um on the hyperspace we have a gym who is an active hybrid space network storage provider in order to cover exchange's initial pledge requirements on filecoin storage warning he needs to provide some form of collateral called initial pledge and the collective liquid sticking pool allows miners to back like to get some file clinic in order to cover those initial requirements uh to get some of the Falcon Miner need to perform two operations first of all is you need to register in the collected dial and change the beneficiary of his minor actor to the liquid staking pool and uh to do so he can use our goal in SDK which is a native Lotus extension model uh that you can see here a list of CLR command for example storage provider can register in Collective dial protocol you can change the beneficial address and also interact with smart contracts such as collateral and the staking pool right now I want to perform an operation which is called pledging operation in which liquid stating pool will transfer some of the amount of filecoin to cover the initial pledge requirements in order to pledge we need to provide the number of sectors which is 53 and it's proof and go long as the case has generated our call data that we are going to pass here which is our Lotus nodes actively running a hyperspace Network and now we are going to wait for about one minute for this operation to be performed in the meantime I will come back to the presentation and continue our team consists of three people Our Song being our main designer myself working on Smart contracts and career uh beings our full stack engineer when it comes to our next steps we want to integrate further with Native proof built-in method called proof commit sector which will finalize the ceiling process with collecting dial protocol also we want to introduce taking router which is an abstraction layer that will give an opportunity for my storage providers in the network to aggregate capital from multiple sources after that we will perform a public audit and hopefully make it to the mainland as you can see now our transaction is still has not been confirmed in the meantime I will show you what is the miners that we all know the file on hyperspace Network our Miner has ID 2480 atas and its balance is about 1 378 file coin uh we actually we have two active sectors for uh half of the gigabytes and now you see that our operation has successfully completed now this address is an owner of our hyperspace Miner actor and if I refresh here I will see that the last my transaction which is a pledging operation and in this pledging operation you can see that we successfully delivered 20 file coin to this address if I click to this address it's the same Miner called 20 vzd24 ag8 and its balance has successfully increased by 20 field we used 20 field as a test value uh to show you that it's animals are discovering both pre-commit deposits plus initial pledge requirements in this case we deliver the collateral on on-demand uh on the new sector added to the network without delivering the collateral up the the amount of file going up front oh thank you amazing I was really good to see and uh another amazing primitive to add to the D5 bucket where we can do an fbm well thank you so much for that demo and with that we are ready for our third demo of the day and that is team fvm Explorer whenever you're ready so hey all this is drove and I will just go ahead and share my screen yeah attention to you all fbm explore and for fcm space notification and I will destroy from the back end part I have my teammate of Boss Khan with me was work on the front end platform so let's go over the problem first but developers will discover the full potential of caffeine chain and take advantage of all the perks it provides which is important for it's important that the developer experience to be more accessible and easier to interact and contact deployment verification interaction and testing is a time consuming process for developers and it can result in loss of private Keys as well so we came up with the solution it our platform allows developers to interact with those smart contracts on the fdm chain with the easy and user-friendly interface and it also allows developers to not only compile the smart contract with a built-in compiler but also deploy verify smart contract directly from a platform with just one click we also provide apis for developers to build on top of our platform so now this is our time let's head over to our platform this live one fvm explore.ferson.f we provide three features which is explore that allows you to explore the currently verified contract and interact with it then we have got deploy which allows you to deploy a contract on the fvm hyperspace testnet and then also verify it from the itself then we got verified and this will allow you to interact with the contract a little on this flow page let's Dive Right In to the deploy page so we have got contract right here and we will be deploying it from our interface when we enter the Contra code and hit the plot so what will happen in the back end result it will send Arabia request to our API endpoint on the backend and then we will quickly see that it is compiled and now we can go ahead and deploy the contract on the fbm apples.net and yeah we have got a transaction right here as soon as we hit confirm it will deploy and we have got the contact address in the notifications we can go ahead and copy it and save it for the purpose of exploring then we have got verification feature so when wait verified it will first compile all the data into apfs URL and it will upload to the ipfs uh using FC dot storage in the packet and then the later the content will be better to registry in the back end itself we can also copy library's click and check it out one hour performing that you can go ahead and check out desktop for Explorer we have already replied A verified contract for you to interact with and you've got it right shift so as soon as I enter the contract and hit search button we've got the source code of the contract it's a time lock wallet config which uh here is a source code for the whole contract and then we can go ahead with the right contract section right here we have got all the functions so it shows that which function needs arguments and we have got a easy to use interface with all the information on the screen itself and then you can go ahead and enter some value and then private it and you can see how easy it is to interact with the platform with all the bifurcation as it also shows the payable functions and all the value you need to add we will go to the contract 2 and here all the read functions are understood perfectly and then you can interact with one of these so let us try to interact with the owner function and here we can see when we don't know it shows up the address of the owner right here and we can also submit prior out of the functions too in the meantime we as we have seen that you have got the contract address which we just deployed so you can also go ahead and Export that too and we have got it right here and yeah the contract was Source Time block called one itself so yeah this is here and now yeah in case you have what already are deployed convert you can add the contact data site here and the source code so that's what I'm gonna do right now we have got a contract which is already deployed on the hyperspace test net which we are going to verify right now which are platform and right here when we enter everything we just hit me to it compile again and it will compile the contract and then we can hit verify which will include the same process of verifying the contract adding the data to ipfs so ifc.storage and then it will at the contact door registry and then similarly we can interact with it to for our Bluff and interface in the meantime let me tell you about our apis so we have got bunch of apis which users can use and developers can build on top of a platform which includes compile which can be used to compile The Source smart contract Port and we have got a documentation right here which you can use to interact and then we've got verify contract API which can be used to verify a contract with the data you provide when you API call then we've got contact data which you can use to get the contact data right in just one click on a platform and let us go ahead and try to explore a few contracts map so we'll just wait for the contract to be add another history and then we're good to go so yeah right here we have got the contract address yeah and the repo is live on the left so you can also try out that hypo and use a platform in the main type let's just wait for the source code to be fetched yeah so here we can see the source code has been searched right now and yeah we've got the contact source code we've got the right contract functions and the read contract functions so on this way it's how easy to interact with the isvm hyperspace testnet right now we are on hyperspace statement but we are soon going to launch on the mainnet2 and we are going to come up with the CLI tool that allows you to use deploy compile and unify conflict from a single tool progress CLI thank you for your time have a good day thank you so much this is uh just an awesome Improvement on developer experience so uh in addition to other tools available out there on on the FM ecosystem you get to actually make it a lot more easier for everybody to build and debug things better all right so again and now we are ready for our fourth demo with that I'd like to welcome team file saber whenever you're ready okay so good evening everyone we are in the MVP Workshop team and our project is called filed saber so fault coin is great for a decentralized storage but it's not that great when it comes to guaranteeing that data will be available five 10 or 20 years in the future right now users only have unlimited storage deals and once the deal has expired a user has no guarantee that their file will be available to them and valuable data would be lost this way until now the only options available were to manually create new storage deals or to turn to centralized Solutions which kind of defeats the purpose of filecoin's decentralization and that's why we want you to meet file saver and start storing your files once and for all what is style saver so it's the first fully decentralized storage drive on filecoin it provides Perpetual storage for users without requiring additional user action users can increase the Storage security by setting the number of replicas to be stored on file point and build for private and public use file saver is designed to preserve Humanity's most important information the community can donate to preserve data that matters to them and receive rewards for their service in the form of VRC 20 tokens we designed this mechanism to promote preserving sensitive data and to promote sharing knowledge in an open way so here we have a demo of our application where the user first connects their wallet and opens their profile page where they can see all of the files that they already uploaded or contributed to they can perpetually store a new file on filecoin by selecting which file they want to share selecting the initial storage period for that file and the number of replicas to be stored on fileco when they select upload the file is temporarily stored directly on ipfs and then the user creates a new Perpetual storage offer through the filesaver smart contract additionally they also send this uh initial funds for the storage Awards through this transaction now we need to wait a bit to do hyperspaces block delay but once the offer is published on chain the user should see their file appear at the bottom of the list but with the pending status in the meantime we can see what's actually happening behind the scenes so when an offer is being created the storage providers will be notified of the storage offer they will download the file check the offer parameters and if they find them acceptable they will claim their spot to store the file and create the first provincial storage deal with the file saver smart contract once that happens we should see the status of the offer switch to active as it has service providers storing the files through filecoin so the storage deals are set for six months and for existing deals service providers have automation built into their clients which periodically check uh if any storage deal is about to expire if it is the service provider claims the rewards for the previous period and will use the storage deal for another six months and this process is repeated as long as there are funds available for the specific fund so we can see now here that our file has been uploaded and it's pending so we're waiting for service providers to create storage deals uh users can also see they're already uploaded files and Supply additional fill tokens which will be used to create more storage deals and extend the storage periods for the desired file below the user can also see other popular files which are publicly available and to which they can contribute by donating the same way they would do with their own file and finally the user can easily download any of their own or publicly available files just by clicking the download button and I think we shouldn't see that our file should switch to active and for the last part here it is and finally we want to share with you our product product Vision which is a publicly available feed where the world's most important information is preserved through sharing and donating and also a private Drive where every user where they have full control of their data and where they can choose with whom they share their data and for how long so in this example let's say we it's shared for 30 minutes so that's it from us we thank you so much for your time man we hope you enjoy it thank you so much Perpetual stories on thought coins says uh kind of even better and I can finally just worry free starts uploading stuff that I have and uh we're gonna see a lot more themes here on the same topic but thank you so much for demoing all right um demo number five that is Project ninja Dash sugar whenever you're ready uh hello everyone today I'm going to present ninja disc ninja is a basically classic platformer game which is now on web3 so before I start I would like to introduce about my team 10 years I am zigger full stack game Dial of uh with me I have with graphics and game designer Advanced with blockchain developer we are creating and Publishing games then interactive applications since last 8 years now if we talk about where three gaming problems then these games are basically focused on play two and only so basically we have to buy some nft to start the game so basically it's not playable by everywhere and this game has basically Less Fun and uh this game set basically unsustainable to overcome this we have developed a game which is more focused on entertainment and gameplay we have implemented web3 features like web 2 games so any Wave 2 users can easily dive into web 3 world and this game is basically free to play and user can also play in on in this game now if we talk about development technology then we are using fpm hyperspace test net for uh deploying two smart contracts one smart contract is for nft maintaining in-game purchase a user native balance and other smartphones other smart contract we are used for creating in-game token erc20 a token exchange and getting token balance we have used a falcon ipfs for storing an array driving nft data like metadata we have used unity game engine for developing this game we have used a remix ID for a solid engineer programming for smart contracts and Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator is used for a game UI ux and assets design now it's time for live demo so we are in the gameplay we can easily sign in with metamask so we have signed it and you can see our wallet address is there and our username is also displayed so top of the left side we can see the in-game points which we can earn during this gameplay next to it we have erc20 token which we can earn in this game if we click on this soap button then in this so we can buy coins with a FM testnet or we can exchange with our in-game and tokens now if we click on the store button here we can buy different characters these characters are basically nft double one double side and this character are stored on a filecoin ipfs in settings we can easily change a music and sound effects and in edit profile we can change our username and this data is saved on server if we click on play button currently we have 15 levels if we complete any level with a 3 star then we get chance to earn esa20 token so let's start level so we are in the first date first stage is basically interactive tutorials where we have to learn how to play the game with normal arrow keys or aswd we can move around in this game with the space button we can jump and if you can uh press space button twice then we can do higher shaft we have to be aware from this Spidey trace and on laptop side we can see our lives and next to it we have number of tasks which we have to complete in this game if you can complete those tasks then we can get three star we can also do this uh in this game we can easily click on the on UI button or we can press uh control button to test so we can do this like this we can also climb over the wall and we can do also sliding from this wall as we go further on our further path we can see there are obstacles we can cannot cross the row so for this we can do teleporting with this on-screen button we can do easily teleporting as we go further we can see there is a hostage girl list there we have to say what we can uh just have to jump and we can Savor whenever one task is completed as we go further we can see uh one anime is there we have to kill him to complete our task so yes we have killed him and we are going further and yes we have finished the level as we have completed this level with three star we can get chance to claim a game token so by this we can get erc20 game token in future we want to add multiple uh levels in multiplayer system uh more character in this game so definitely yeah we want to do many things in this uh game so if you like this game do not forget to try this game and uh thank you so much for giving this opportunity have a great day figure that was awesome and uh congrats for making not only just a fully functioning game but also going down and doing multiple levels uh or uh everybody's gonna have fun with this because the game is live you can check this out on the Showcase page and I think it's probably safe to say that this is already now the best game that exists on the fbm ecosystem so congrats all right next up is our sixth Dental we're halfway through this so let's check out what FNS lookup is and we'll come Stephen and Jeffrey hey guys thanks for having us uh let me share my screen all right uh so today we're going to talk about the FNS app and the fs FNS integration uh in the fox Explorer as we call it the FNS lookup uh function uh FNS is developed by uh fieldfox team which is originated from defy coin developer Community um and during the space back we have made much progresses uh first we fixed the key functions and update events of contracts we also developed a deployed musical tool contracts our hyperspace and uh on top of that we upgrade a UI ux and release B2 apps and add five coins CID index the FNS V2 app has already been deployed on the hyperspace and feel free to try it we have put the links here um here's some here's some pictures about the website the new website and how the data is presented um so we do hope that FNS can be used as a basic tool for the FICO ecosystem to help promote a better usage user experiences so we first integrated FNS in our uh the fox Explorer to provide more functions for our users FNS is open sourced and any other projects they can integrate the efforts into their own project as well so uh some key features here um FNS FNS lookup uh synchronizes or events related events and analyzes into DB providing API Services it also displays FNS reverse resolution in address detail page of fieldfox and all FNS registering registrations and name details uh furthermore it supports FNS name search and both T4 and the 0x addresses search so this is a picture shows the tech architecture and how it works uh within the limited time we have implemented uh sorry Technologies to make it full screen all right just forget So within the limited time we have uh listed all the contracts uh shown here and we also open source DD uh fv2 source code and the FNS lookup API server code uh for more detailed info you can uh goes to the GitHub links here and for more information so in the future we are going to provide a lookup open API and SDK to facilitate uh developers to integrate the FNS functions into their own devs and wallets we also gonna finish the integration with Fox wallet to provide all the functions on the of exploded more importantly we're going to release FNS based features which is a web 3 portal you can basically put all your information and you actually immense on the website and showing to others and we got or and we on top of that we're gonna release if flipfox Source game and profile Society protocol all right um let's go to the fieldfox uh Explorer and the show how and show how it works so this is the fox Explorer under the blockchain tab you may find FNS lookup here and click on that it shows you the FICO name lookup function you can basically can either put your FNS names or addresses here let me try the addresses first so enter and it would come come up with a overview of your addresses which including reverse record registrant names related transactions uh all the data's shown here if I tried to another like try to fill domain here um and enter it will give you another overview also about the domain and if if you clicked on the registrant again it will provide you a address overview which including the addresses uh your ID actor balance account change message list transactionalist Etc uh with if you want to check your domains for more details simply click it click out here it will take you to the FNS detailed domain Details page um let's wait for a second yeah it comes out all the information is about your uh domain and even you can renew your domain here which is uh very easy to use and uh all the records as shown below all right this is the this is at the end of my presentation and thanks for having us listen thank you so much this was a really cool demo and uh glad to see it and it's going to be officially part of fox um this is great and also continuing to build on your work from the last event is even better because now you get to actually make an ecosystem out of FNS it's going to be amazing thank you very much all right next up we have honest fill Henry Ken bond welcome thank you very deep hello everyone uh we are the team on honest field who is behind these projects to the equal others uh great full stock from Argentina from Mexico um we built on a still uh the Furious project the print transparency and security to reserves uh to all verticals that were exchange build and fight ground right now uh but why we built this as you know that the FDF disaster the whole thing if they have to change all the investors users and need to know where the assets are all the time and we need to think more on verification over across trust privacy transparency first and if we can uh often chain data why we can verify all the time with the audit that's why once in on steel and then with the real-time uh reserve for protocols were that are registered and over dashboard we provide all the transparency that never seen before on this space but we don't stop there and we also provide alerts for potential issues or hacks of the reserves and to make an informed decisions on time and even for the revenue model we think we see an opportunity to reward transparency where protocols or Labs will pay to audit the reserves in real time and others who verify that result will reward and it's time to add them up let's see when you actually go to our home you can enter and connect your wallet here's on the Falcon testnet after that you can see on the dashboard always your balance of field uh also in real time the price of the market let's make an example if I was an owner of protocol I could put an example of course here just choose the continuing with the URL logo and we use more data for this I'm going to address the judge section on the while we can see in the dashboard also all the trending or the goals that you can follow on that are submit his proof of reserves and you can see also the favorites that alert that you can set in that you want to monitor in case um in a problem that you want to follow also we can see on the liver all the transactions already are doing and are pending to hold any contract that already has one on the while we can see also downloads in this part you can create alerts for the protocol that you want to follow or monitor in the field Reserve are Minima you can check all the alert that already you have and put as favorite if you want and on the lowest part on the dashboard I also edited or switch off and you can set up also notification here with Rich protocol it's very simple you have to go to push protocol and configure you connect after that you go to the channel and select the honest View we can see right now we have already added the protocol demo here and if you click it you can see the five dollar reserves and how our tracking in real time and also the balls and others that you probably want to check out and also the updates of the observes but you can include it as we see we can create also alerts here I'm going to put an alert just for the last particle that already create foreign you can go to the dashboard of push vertical you have the chains of network after that you go to channels you look for honest test you can subscribe to the alerts and also you can see that all others are already set up right here in the Inbox and you just ready to go we are ready it's everything for the demo right now under the hood how is this build we use the sperium for the front end we also use the push for the alerts and notification and we deployed the smart content of Falcon as well for the future we want to add different types of protocol Partners the schematrix for and test MVP also near why we can improve from our leaders and users and build in many very soon transparency begins with Anna still thank you it's already open amazing we'll thank you for that wonderful demo and sticking to the values of open finance and transparency and great to see that it's also now available for everybody to use congratulations thank you all right on to our demo number eight we have Dell swap with vinay whenever you're ready yeah this is soft for space swap hackathon so this is basically one of the first D5 platform for honestly and let's start with the demo the demo is in two sections which is swapping and ending uh and Loans so uh so you know so you can just take any assistant or token which you have on your side of the state fun uh so this is my Affinity token and I will add this uh import this into uh into one digital serpent platform and here I can uh my different tokens for FLT so if I add like uh 0.1 I can get seven different tokens my balance is six zero with that class I will swap it as you can see it's asking for 0.1 he console the transaction Okay so as you can see this is it isn't pending and as a Pages goes on I can show you from there so for this shopping to perform that actually add it add a poems for it so I've already created a tool you can use this adjectively button to create a pool for uh sldt cell pair or any acid 30 token you have uh yeah like this I have to order it let's move on to lowest which is the major like major and project serving loan uh like the base is the storage providers who need uh known for the purchase for their Hardware cost they can borrow from the standing pool okay like clone pool so uh anyone can lend but only the actors or storage providers who are who have validated the can only borrow okay so let's start with Landing so I will try to learn uh World token as you can see then okay I got a conduction also yeah okay uh as you can see in the send token I've already lost with letter one five and uh silicon and here you can see it uh the one final but to the smart contact address so I will go back and try to you know like uh search for an actor or a search border so I have this one uh that adapter with the ID ones or triple zero and you'll see that is Phil fox or FM chain so I can just go and borrow and I can add his apparently I've been a high-end person need to add the correct B lighting okay as you can see he doesn't have any pending loan on his account so I will just click on borrow and as you can see it will ask for another transaction okay I'll confirm this and uh till this goes on I can show you like oh I've already borrowed for 1130 actor ready it also has either to start a day on the SN chain so here you can see uh like uh the actor the story about 1.15 uh as a borrow load and uh as you can see one uh one one three zero already has a loan so if I if I add his you know actor ID then I can get the option to pay his e minus okay so uh so here you can see like his Landing uh his total depth is now just 0.7 and this Emi is like and depending on the credit score it will get like you know that less amount of Interest or uh the more amount of loan purpose for every low okay and this uh the loan is needed to be paid back in six emails so I will just uh try to Paris Emi yeah so you can see 0.99 uh like a token story question and uh yeah so I already have like a Emma and it is uh on his account so you as you can see uh like uh I've paid like 0.9 sale for one one three zero one one three zero uh uh storage provider yeah uh so the major focus of this loan platform was it was like you know uh when the service providers need some specific amount of uh loan for their own storage suppose they're gonna uh they're gonna take uh some one or two DB of hydro cost and then they have to pay like they need some amount of money for that right so that's why this whole uh platform came into existence uh yeah and also like suppose uh if you have like 14 tokens lender then you can easily revoke those tokens you can just add here click hours on purpose you have already ended to the platform or to the platform and you can just stay okay and it will like uh ask you for it on the action and just revoke the topics back to you so this is the whole democration of this uh github.com in future we are going to support like you know uh maybe increase more validation in aspects for actors to uh water the loan okay like those things yeah thank you very much this is the demo forces thank you so much this is already great and uh we now also have in order to All The Primitives admm that you can leverage and borrow and trade against this is really cool and you can check it out on Phil swap.org thank you all right next up is saipal chilling in t whenever you're ready hello head hello so yeah screenshot so hello everyone I'm Julian and I'd like to introduce our team and acrylic welcome our real group of three students who are passionate about blockchain technology and what it can offers our goal with subflow is to make the socialized cloud computing accessible to everyone and tell him to wait for a more secure centralized and private future hi everyone I'm Quinton hey I'm Michelle so sapon is a bridge between ethem and the network of bakayam it enables you to to make jobs that are then run on this nodes so if you don't know bakayao it's a network of nodes that can run your happy jobs so you don't have to run them on your local computer so uh Supple has a goal user simplicity so that means that you can even if you don't know how Pacquiao really works you can use our front-end and you will understand it and the support already makes it so that data dials can be linked to our front-end so if you have a data with many cids that have been on ipfs you can use the data directly via our phone so uh this uh what you just saw was our front page if you're interested in uh learning a little bit more about Sappo feel free to go to our front page uh and here you can see that our managed many jobs uh some of them are happier than others you can see that as stable diffusion in CPU and GPU but also uh that's a easy ocean and what is exciting about the job is that you can create your own custom job we only need a Docker image and inputs as a size by pinned on ipfs or falcon we'll try and separate example yeah so the example we'll choose is stable diffusion with gpus grows a little bit faster and um so it also stable decision generates images with AI and it dates as an input it takes text I'm playing text so we have to give that as an input so yeah the right uh this right here what you see is the input we are going to give to to stable diffusion so it's a frog drinking a fresh lemon juice and as you can see here you can either choose between ipfs and data dials for the sake of demonstration once again we will use this one uh if you want you can implement this function in you that other smart contracts so you can directly import all you see ID into zappro app let's try it so here you see our list of cids that are all of five type text plane but we can also show incompatible files for example images or Json but we won't be choosing these ones so yeah this is the one that we just showed to you it's uh for drinking fresh lemon juice and we hope that we will get a pretty image after this so here on the job page you can see those specification about the docker image the job name and the input file we also implemented a way to pay a small fee based on the job complexity and the input file size and either job fail you will be refunded at least 50 of this fee so we confirm yes but uh this might take a while because well State the fusion uses AI so it's a very heavy job uh last time we tried it uh it lasted for 10 minutes so we'll just get that thought because it's not very fun to wait and here you see our job history so there are a lot of jobs that are already done by us and well some are interesting some fills so you can know when a job fails when it's for example if pakayao doesn't uh rejects your job it will fail and you will be refunded as you just said and here that's a job that we that we made which is a magnificent image of a frog drinking fresh lemon juice so interesting art style but well we get it uh it's uh it's an AI it shows it so here you also can see that uh you don't have to really understand all of this uh but uh it's interesting to just know that's with this backyard ID you can see all the job details so back at our stores the information and you can you can get all that so if a bucket I'll describe I can even check if it's verified so this is interesting you can see the outputs you can see the errors and the standard output also uh so yeah that's the other jobs for example this one is another image of a frog and uh we'd like to thank a team that builds that made this project possible this project was inspired by lilybat which is uh also called frog project frog he also builds a bridge and it's very similar but we aimed really at user Simplicity and uh also we wanted to have a front end so it goes right through fvm still and that means that your history will never disappear and we're very excited about the future of decentralized computation and we think that with this step of apps that others can leverage FICO in storage and extract more value with the data stored on fake thank you for your attention amazing well thank you so much for that cool demo and uh yeah we've seen the fiber matters we've seen games and now compete on data this is uh it's gonna be the next wave congratulations and hope you're continuing this thank you thank you next up is Eclipse with three more demos to go or almost at the finish line so much win whenever you're ready hello everyone I'm Ashwin and I'm excited to introduce eclipse Eclipse was built in the last week by Ankit Negi who's a full stack developer myself I'm a smart contract developer and Ankit Sadie who's a designer and a UI ux engineer so what is eclipse eclipse is the easiest way for businesses to leverage firecoin as their native storage layer as a startup owner myself one of the biggest requirements installing files is to be able to share files within the company and you know in a private and secure way uh By Nature file coin everything on filecoin is public unless you choose to encrypted phones individually so what we have built is a very uh what we have built is a very a Google Drive like experience where companies can drag and drop files into the into the workspace and people who are current members of that workspace or Dows will be able to you know will be only able to uh decrypt and view these files not just this however there is a pick requirement of being able store big files in a decentralized way and filecoin is leading the charge with this what we have also built is a way for companies to be able to store big files on the filecoin network using an integrated storage provider marketplace where you can brought requests to store big files and storage parameters can come and come back and pick up paid on top of these things and then you can get the best deal and you can kind of go forward uh so how does eclipse work uh Eclipse uh Eclipse words in the following ways first is uh we use fvm for dehumidification and payouts for big file storage we use contract factories for data composition of data dials and we use Lighthouse for Access Control and small file storage okay so coming to the architecture of it really quickly uh so everything starts off with the eclipse data sparkly smart contract uh this is where every data will get an instance of the eclipse data itself so such that all the data is composed within that one editor and every time you every time the data down makes a deal with the storage provider that deal also gets listed as a separate instance of a smart contract such that you know the data can be verified or over time the payout can happen on time and that it can you know these can be managed independently and to store small files we use Lighthouse and their ax control features on five card coming to house storage requests work uh again uh when a data can request for storage and this will be honored by different storage providers who will make proposals back and the selected proposals by the dove will be uh will be created to a Smart contract which will be used also used as an escrow to make sure the payouts happen on time and will also be used to make sure the deal is valid and takes place Accord now let's get to the demo so we're already live on Netflix website.netified.app this is where you can check us out so as you can see in our landing page we have entered the app we have some documentation and if you're a storage provider you can log into that so I'll log in as a dial member as you can see I'm already there and uh it's it's a very simple interface where you know you try to make keep it as simple as possible for users to understand so we have different uh tasks we can check out different dial data part of like in a very Discord like interface and you can add new members very easily and you can you know also get the check look into big files.com too and you can also have a profile screen where you can you know do uh you're changing your name adding your Lighthouse API gave to that matter on different things so let's go back to the home where uh where it's where the Google Drive interface exists right so uh this dial currently has two members myself and Ankit I'm logged into ankit's profile on this uh you know Chrome browser and uh let me just add a file really quickly let's say I want to share it by that image with with this dial where Arkansas lives so I'm just gonna upload uh this is required meter sign so that the ax Capital features are being applied and I'm encrypting the file as well and once this is done uh the file appears automatically and I can go to unkiss interface here just uh and as you can see the file is already here right so even though the CID is available publicly uh this the CID is meaningless to someone who's not a part of the doubt because they won't be able to see the contents of it right that's the emphasis here so I can click on this it'll decrypt and uh again I have to sign to make sure that I'm a part of the stock at this moment and once the signing is complete I will be able to view files pretty easily as you can see here now coming back to the other main feature which is big files as I told you uh as a dial as a dial with member I can put a request for storing big files I can type the file name what the file is about number the amount of amount of days I'm gonna store this file for size in GB as well as the expiry for this if no one picks it up and I'll also offer a base Bounty the type of delivery will be a link cardboard everybody file currency ID some more description about this and click on that it's a very uh intuitive interface and I I can add how many what I want and what I'll get to see is different storage providers coming back and bidding on top of this so as you can see you'll see different providers coming and asking for different bounties one can ask for 150 120 300 whatever it is and I can view each one of these storage providers individually see the reputation see how good they are and I can do the same for all of them and I can then decide which stores for storage for whatever I want to do I want to let go with and just to give you an experience of how the social server dashboard looks this is how the storage provider will be able to see it if you clicked on the storage forward a link in the landing page you'll end up here let me just quickly sign in either wallet and you'll be able to see requests from different dials in one place and you can kind of evaluate which one you want to you know go about and like um you know take up and it's not this this you'll also be able to see the different activities happening you can also see who else is bidding on it and so you know you can kind of give a good price for your client and it gets your own activity here as well as your profile so that is just a quick um demo of what um Eclipse has to offer is it's live currently uh Eclipse hyphen map 3.95.app and I'm happy for feedback as well uh that is it for the demo yeah amazing thank you so much this is uh this is really cool we're finally seeing more productivity apps here and uh things that actually fit in day-to-day workflows I'm very excited about data Dallas here well congratulations and we are now at our second last demo for today so without further Ado let's welcome and see kaggle Kathleen tape whenever you're ready so hello we're cable uh our project is a bounty platform for incentivized decentralized computing on fem uh built by this very amazing team so we actually draw our inspiration from two places the first is the official list of requests for startups from fem uh asking for a decentralized compute Solutions at the infrastructure level to allow storage provider to do a verifiable computation on the storage data that they have and the other inspiration that we have drawn from is um scaggle which is a very very famous machine learning Bounty platform well there's a problem with those Solutions so first of all to win the bounty on cattle you actually need to submit your full model before even winning anything so this list a privacy problem and that also means that companies cannot really monetize on their proprietary model on the other hand uh we cannot really expect storage providers to have domain knowledge and all the processing power to perform some of the computations and also if only storage providers can do verifiable computation at the infrastructure level is not very accessible the way we aim to solve it is to utilize zero knowledge proof ckp so ckp can help us do private variable computation and also our solution is totally decentralized enabling everyone to participate in this protocol so everyone can actually deploy a bounty smart contract through our browser application and everyone can join the Bounty as well so without further Ado let's do a demo so our um uh our demo live demo was actually already live on Falcon hyperspace testnet but for the sake of this um demo here because we have some sequential transactions that has to be done I'm using a local host Fork network instead so let me switch over to our localhost Network and I'll explain a bit of what we're seeing here so on the left hand side we have the Bounty provider so he will be posting the data and uh posting and and depositing a bounty amount on the right hand side we have the Bounty Hunter who will browse the task and submit whatever they are they want uh to compute for right so on the left hand side you can see that I've already clicked the create button and pre-filled some of the information that is needed to fill uh to create a bounty and now I'm going to upload the date the data so the data is very simple for demo purpose is a black and white image of the number five well this person doesn't have expertise in machine learning so he wants someone to compute it using a image classification model so he's going to go ahead and deposit one token for the bounty as soon as the transaction goes through you can see that the new task is now on the feed so as the body Hunter if he's interested in this task he can click into it and start computation and as a bounty owner he can click into it and view the progress as well so in reality the Bounty Hunter will actually download the data which is now stored in Lighthouse storage and then do the local computation on its own machine compute the CK proof which we do have an example in our GitHub repo and then post all the necessary files that is required to accompany their CK proof so right now I'm just going to post some sample data we're going to sign twice here because we're using the lighthouse SDK to First encrypt the data the file and also allowing only the Bounty provider the Bounty owner to view the file so not anyone else so let me quickly upload all the necessary files and again for demo purpose we already have some known data that is known to be a valid CK proof that I'm going to fill in right here so now when the um Bounty is submitted uh our contract actually checked for the Integrity of the CID so it checks that the ckb actually matches the file that they're Computing uh and also um the validity of the ckp right so once it's submitted you can see that now the Bounty Hunter Bounty provider can see obli submission files well again in reality she will download all these files check that it is the computation that he wants to be done before releasing the Bounty but we're just going to go ahead and do that right now so one thing that I didn't mention just now is that uh in step two when we're submitting the Bounty the computed results is actually hacked so this is to prevent the Bounty owner from prematurely seeing the results so now we're going to um the battery of one counter is going to go ahead and unhatch the result so to claim the Bounty amount and again this hash is going to be checked in the smart contract right and on the left hand side you can see that that the owner now sees the computer results five is the number that was in the original image and the second number here is just a salt that is within the hash and that's the end of our demo uh we welcome any feedback if you have any question or want to know more about our project uh you can check out our GitHub repo and it will also live on this zcang gold dollar app right now thank you very much amazing oh this is really cool and I'm glad that uh we're tackling more of these types of competitions and actually during competition on data that can be private so this is going to be a good Trend and even better for you to ship this and add others trying out too the rats okay and with that we are ready for our last demo for today this is our 12th finalist and without further Ado let's welcome data blocks hi the project that we built for the space for packathon is called Data blocks a set of unchain Primitives to unlock the full potential for data dials on the filecoin virtual machine one of the main narratives around fvm has been the enabling of dated outs a community where stakeholders work together to preserve valuable data sets in theory this has a lot of potential but without the right set of ancient Primitives we found it hard to fully understand how data dials will work in practice this is where data blocks come in data blocks is a set of smart contract Primitives to provide the proper building blocks for establishing an incentive Align data now on fem I'll explain the three pillars of data blocks with an example let's say I have a valuable data set and I want to start a data around it the first thing I'd be able to do is tokenize the data set itself using our data token stand data tokens are simply a new set of token standards that embed the pcid of data stored on the filecoin network such that the token itself can represent the underlying data on chain data tokenization enables buyers who have an interest in a data set to purchase this tokenized version such that the data that can generate revenue and fund its treasury which brings us to our second element of data blocks the datadout core contract the core contracts serve three purposes first it acts as a verified registry for Native tokens second it acts as a treasury for that out where all the revenue generated from the sales of the data data tokens will be accrued in this core contract and finally it facilitates on-chain governance allowing members to create vote on and execute on-champ proposals with their data token and collectively decide on how to manage this out of Treasury the final element of our project is data bounties modules to incentivize the preservation augmentation and innovation of the daos data sets these include storage boundaries to identify as the creation of storage deals for data sets Perpetual storage bounties that additionally incentivize anyone to find expiring storage deals on data sets and renew those storage bounties finally generic stored about generic bounties for any open-ended tasks such that they may do computation boundaries or data processing bounties where gather submissions can be reviewed and voted on by a subset of down members called witnesses to ensure the quality of submission while getting a share of the reward for themselves as you can see data box creates a clear incentive alignment for data dials where data tokens build the treasury which can be used to incentivize and preserve and augment data sets and finally fund research to create new token those data sets to repeat this positive feedback loop now let's see a quick demo of what a data built on data bytes data blocks might look like here we have a data down called Astro now that centers around astronomy data sets we see that that was Treasury and a registry of all its data tokens if we click into this planet's data set we can see various stats about this tokenized collection such as volume and floor price and maybe the total royalties collected through the Dow we also see the individual tokens in this collection and also the pcid of the representing underlying data we can click in to see the representing data token contract on hyperspace testnet and also look at the underlying data that's serious Json files that represents the actual data set for the tokenized data if we look into a single token we can also see its owner and also its price and most importantly you can see the underlying portion of this data set which is represented by this individual token for this example it's a data on a single exoplanet and its planet's data set now let's look at vidao's governance process you can see here a list of proposals the broad range of proposals possible through a core governance contract like funding new research hosting Dow events or investing a portion of data treasury if we click into one we see it's Associated on chain transactions such as creating a storage value for a data set and if you're a dow token holder you can submit a vote for against this proposal once this proposal is settled and the vote is confirmed then it would be able to create a storage bounty on chain using the data Dallas treasury for the sake of time I've created a similar transaction earlier today that does the same property of creating a storage bounty on chain through the data Dallas Treasury furthermore speaking of bounties we also have a list of data bounties from the Dow here you can see all the storage boundaries for the data set owned by the style in this active one we can see its reward amount it's a vesting schedule across ebooks this is to ensure that the storage is reliable over time and so if you have a date if you have a deal ID for a storage deal that I made for a pcid associated with this bounty I'd claim one myself as a client and by doing so I would immediately start to invest some of the rewards from this storage Bounty and also showcase the remaining unvested rewards as such finally we have computation boundaries where anyone can go and submit a computation for a particular data set on chain using a submission URI that's linked on ipfs and also witnesses can come in the dial we'll submit a review for these submissions and all the witnesses in the Dow including myself could go when the submission period is over to vote on their favorite submission and review and what that will enable us to do is reward the top submission and the top witness with the reward according to the share that was allocated at the beginning so hopefully that shows you a glimpse with data blocks enables and find all our contracts and documentation on GitHub thanks for tuning in let's make data that was a reality thanks thank you so much congratulations on this amazing hack and uh we're seeing a lot of cool really amazing themes here so this is going to be even better when everybody can check it out and actually start integrating with all the other kind of cool things that we saw so this is great and with that we are done with our 12 amazing finalist demos I want to give a big shout out again to Seth rothal saber Collective ninja Dash C candle honest build data blocks Eclipse they'll swap fvm Explorer at Fitness lookup and Cosmic chicken it's a really really incredible teams and projects and amazing themes around defy computational um just just decentrals computational zero knowledge proofs data dials all together as a theme and productivity apps and just all and all Perpetual storage related use cases that are now all enabled with roundability on your fall coin data so this wraps up all of our demos let's get into all the stuff that I know you're all waiting for which is prizes and for those of you just tuned in during these demos you can check out everything that came out of this event by adding over to it global.com showcase that is where all 275 projects are available for you to look at and see what they did including these demos on surprises

ship taking me 200 a second place and the two runner-ups Courier and on his bill taking me 150 each so congratulations to all six of these teams or building on top of push and last we have spiron So for anybody who used spheron for deploying your application and building that metal layer you are going to be receiving 10 teams will be receiving these 200 prizes so congratulations to Hatchery dial spatial dial smart notary protocol fill nav feminine portal Memento Dow trustified flex-filled DNA and fill swap All of You Are amazing gear and congratulations to all of you for building a topic for spheron and also winning multiple prizes and as of this moment all of these prizes are also visible on your showcase so if you head over to your own project or if you go to anyone else's project you can see what prizes they want so for those of you are going to catch up on this live stream after you can simply just check out your showcase URL for your own submission and this will also be reflected now on your dashboard and you'll see what prizes you want and the total amounts so as a quick note on price delivery is as follows all these things are tentative and not final which means that while we have a timeline for announcing all the prizes which is this live stream we do want to take our time to make sure that everybody did work on submitting projects as part of the event rules which means that while we were able to verify quite a few of these things already we are still in the process of looking at all 20 275 code bases in checking and nobody did something before this event that was not ready to clear with us or clarifying with us or was breaking the rules which was porting an existing solidity contract to Bethel so we'll be verifying all that and only then we'll be sending these prizes which means that there is a chance that if something comes up uh we will change the winners and there might be one or two edge cases where they're reflected winners may not be the same as what's on the slides here that I just announced the other note here is that if you want a price from the Falcon team that will be distributed separately by the protocol Labs team and not each Global every other prize will be given to you by a global team and that is because there's a handful of kyc and compliance requirements that will come into play here so there are two separate entities delivering these prizes so please be patient as we verify everybody's prizes and make all of this available to to everybody um on uh on your uh addresses the prizes are will be given to you by the 17th of February which means a week from now and that'll be enough time for us to go through everything at confirm and lock in all the amounts and winners and for the ones that are being delivered by the vertical livestream you'll get a separate email with a form that you have to fill out just clarifying A couple of things and then those prices will be delivered to you shortly after so congratulations again and let's try to ramp up the end of the next few minutes so before we close up and we want to say a few thank yous to everybody that made this event possible first one is of course all of you as hackers 1042 a year was spent the last two weeks with us working tirelessly and excitedly on all of your projects we got to see when we total of them here but there's 263 more that are available on global.com and you can check out and see and to secret yourself the excitement what could be possible here in this entire ecosystem so thank you to all of you hackers for making this event possible and on top of that there's way more parties involved in making this event even better and a great experience for you I want to thank our judges mentors speakers and partners so many people give and dedicate their time from this entire ecosystem across the world into making all these things possible for you to stay excited and built in the space so I want to give a big shout
